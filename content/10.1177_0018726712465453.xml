<abstract>
<p>Changing patterns of work and retirement raise major questions for social policy in the 21st century. A key issue concerns how to handle the legacy of the 20th century – namely the institutionalization of retirement as a major part of the life course. The acceptance of early retirement in the 1970s and 1980s accelerated the growth of post-work lifestyles, consolidated by the cohort of ‘first wave’ baby boomers (those born in the 1940s and early 1950s). Both aspects are now in collision with the drive to delay retirement and put in place later pension ages. The various articles discussed in this Special Issue explore a number of questions affecting the future of work and retirement, including developments in the policy arena, factors influencing career decisions in middle and late life, and changing transitions from work to retirement. The discussion concludes with an assessment of the new research agendas emerging from debates about extending working life and the future of retirement.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The social organization of work and retirement has undergone radical transformation over the past four decades. In the 1960s a broad consensus appeared to have been reached – at least among industrial economies – of the value of developing retirement as a distinct stage in the life course (see further the Introduction to this Special Issue). This was linked with an evolving infrastructure of support, which started to provide the basis for challenging many of the insecurities traditionally associated with this period in the life course. However, within a short (in historical terms) space of time the basis of retirement was progressively challenged: de-stabilized at first through the rapid expansion of early retirement or ‘early exit’ as it came to be termed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726712465453">Kohli et al., 1991</xref>) and, subsequently, fears about an excess of older people over younger workers (fuelled by the arrival into their sixties of the cohort of post-war baby boomers). Finding solutions to the economic and social pressures arising from ageing populations has come to dominate policy agendas in the 21st century, with extending working life emerging as an attractive option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726712465453">Vickerstaff, 2010</xref>). ‘Living longer’ meant, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726712465453">2006</xref>), that we should also ‘work longer’ – a theme which had already been pursued in labour market strategies through the 1990s but which became even more popular in the 2000s.</p>
<p>Yet the extent to which the strategy of encouraging extended working can be achieved must be located both in the immediate history of work and retirement and in the range of economic, occupational and social factors which influence retirement as a process and stage in the life course. The historical dimension is of considerable importance in understanding present tensions and contradictions in the policy objective of delaying retirement. During the decades of the 1970s and 1980s (with a backdrop of economic recession, technological changes and a crisis in manufacturing industry across Europe), ‘early retirement’ was promoted both as a ‘solution’ to the need to find jobs for a large cohort of young workers, and offered as a desirable new stage in life. The transformation in fortunes of those moving into mid- and late-career was indeed striking: in Germany, the labour force participation rate of men aged 55–64 in 1971 was 77.8 per cent; by 1995 it had dropped to 52.7 per cent. In the Netherlands, the change was even more dramatic – from 80.6 per cent to 41.4 per cent over the same time period; similarly in France, with a fall from 74.6 per cent to 41.5 per cent, and in the UK from 88.1 per cent to 62.4 per cent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0018726712465453">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Arising from these trends, a new phase in the relationship between work and retirement was established in the 1970s and 1980s, with researchers drawing a distinction between ‘retirement’ on the one side and ‘early exit’ on the other: the former referring to entry into a publicly provided old-age pension scheme; the latter referring to early withdrawal from paid employment supported through unemployment, disability or associated benefits. Rather than employment ceasing after a set number of years, at a fixed chronological age, there was now a measure of ambiguity about the ending of work and the beginning of retirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726712465453">Laczko and Phillipson, 1991</xref>). Kohli et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726712465453">1991</xref>: 21) argued that the transition from work to retirement was: ‘… less a matter of following a well-institutionalized and largely self-evident normative schedule, and … more a matter of personal timing’. At the same time, ‘counter-transitions’ – people moving into or back to what came to be termed as ‘bridge jobs’ (e.g. part-time or self-employment) became increasingly common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726712465453">Cahill et al., 2006</xref>)</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726712465453">Walker (2006)</xref> suggests that the expansion of early retirement and early exit had three main consequences: first, reconstructing old age from a simple age-related status with a single entry point into a much broader category stretching from around age 50 until death; second, devaluing the role of older people in the labour market and exacerbating age discrimination; third, creating a view of older people as an economic ‘burden’, with the potential to undermine intergenerational solidarity. At the same time, it is also the case that the ‘public image’ of retirement began to change in the 1970s and 1980s, with a shift towards viewing it as a positive stage in life (a theme replayed through the development of pre-retirement education and retirement planning over this period). Arguments emerged suggesting that the extended period of retirement associated with ‘early exit’ from work could lead to more expansive lifestyles − an approach associated with the idea of a ‘third age’ of personal development and liberation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726712465453">Laslett, 1989</xref>). Gilleard and Higgs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726712465453">2000</xref>: 34) took the view that:<disp-quote>
<p>In Britain, as in many other countries, increasing numbers of people aged 55 and over are choosing to retire. The break between ages 64 and 65 for men and 59 and 60 for women, has become a less distinct transition within what amounts to a continuum of ‘ages at retirement’ … What evidence there is suggests that a combination of state benefits and occupational private pensions have enabled more people to withdraw themselves from the market, rather than continuing to sell their labour and mortgage their lifetime.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The sociological importance of the huge expansion of early retirement in the 1970s through to the 1990s has yet to be fully analysed or documented in terms of its impact on attitudes and behaviour. Of course, given the scale of change in the labour market – and the numbers of people involved – the variety of circumstances encountered was itself immense. Every worker departing from (predominantly) his employment with a secure financial package to build a new life would have been matched by someone leaving in much less favourable circumstances – because of financial limitations, health problems or a sense of a premature conclusion to work.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0018726712465453">2</xref></sup> Yet the idea of a new phase in the life course being built was a powerful theme in this period. Ending work at 60 or 65 (but preferably much earlier) became embedded in human resource policies, as was the corollary of rampant discrimination within the workplace among those reaching their fifties and early sixties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726712465453">Macnicol, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The attraction of early retirement policies came, however, under scrutiny from the mid-1990s – a consequence of renewed attention to the economic implications of ageing populations and doubts over the adequacy of resources to support a large baby boom population now entering their sixties. The combination of such concerns and a period of economic expansion starting from the mid-1990s put the idea of extending working life firmly back on the agenda. Over the period from 1995 to 2011 leading industrial economies saw substantial increases in the employment of men aged 55−64: labour force participation rates for this group increased in Germany over this period from 52.7 per cent to 71.7 per cent; in the Netherlands from 41.4 per cent to 68.6 per cent; in France from 41.5 per cent 47.1 per cent; and in the UK from 62.4 per cent to 68.6 per cent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0018726712465453">3</xref></sup> Yet, as these figures would suggest, the changes over this period of economic growth varied significantly from country to country and in some cases still left the employment of older workers substantially below what it had been in the 1970s. By the second decade of the 21st century, then, retirement had been called into question in terms of its place in post-industrial economies, but with issues surrounding how to incorporate older workers fully into the labour market, and with significant expectations still in place about the value and benefit of the period of life after work.</p>
<p>The various articles in this Special Issue touch – in different ways and with contrasting points of emphasis – on all of the above themes. The areas for discussion can be grouped under three main headings: first, the evolving policy framework shaping work and retirement; second, contextual factors influencing decision-making in middle and later life; third, understanding the role of paid work within the transition to retirement. The second half of this commentary deals with each of these in turn before highlighting a number of areas for future research and debate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0018726712465453">
<title>Institutional and policy contexts</title>
<p>On the first of the above, the broader policy context is an explicit concern of Moulaert and Biggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726712465453">2013</xref>: this issue) who highlight what they view as the inevitable ‘re-engineering’ of work and retirement given the impact of longevity and population change. They point, however, to the tension between a sociological discourse that, on the one hand, highlights the emergence of more open lifestyles – illustrated by the idea of the ‘third age’ − and, on the other, attempts to impose restrictions on the lives of older people as reflected in the push for later retirement ages. Drawing on approaches developed by Foucault, they analyse the way in which identities are being ‘re-visioned’ in the context of emerging international policies on ageing and retirement. A focal point for their discussion is an exploration of the idea of ‘active ageing’ − a theme which has become prominent in debates across Europe and the OECD countries more generally. At one level, the idea of ‘active ageing’ would seem a perfect fit with that of encouraging more ambitious and wide-ranging options for later life. But the authors, in tracking the evolution of the concept, suggest that definitions have become progressively more restrictive and focused around productive and work-related activities. Unravelling what they refer to as the ‘genealogy of competing definitions’, they conclude that the idea of ‘active ageing’ has been co-opted by those seeking a solution to the economic crisis. And they point here to an unholy alliance between neo-liberal agendas seeking to reduce public expenditure, resulting in calls for older people to remain at work, and critical perspectives inside gerontology which emphasize the creation of dependency produced through exclusion from and discrimination within the workplace.</p>
<p>The solution offered by Moulaert and Biggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726712465453">2013</xref>: this issue) to what they see as the narrowing of ambition in the active ageing debate, is for a rejection of the ‘more of the same’ approach, i.e. more work as the main option for later life. The focus instead should be on encouraging a ‘diversity of identity with all its promise of alternative forms of social engagement enabled by a long life’. They go on to reject what they view as the ‘colonization of ageing by activity and productivism’, arguing for a ‘re-discovery of existential challenges’ as well as ‘critical awareness of policies’ that have ‘effectively co-opted existing forms of dissent’. Yet, attractive as these ideas appear, it could be argued that – as with the broader active ageing debate – they fail to engage with the sociological and institutional context around which people’s lives are built and maintained. Moving from work to retirement is – as the articles in this issue demonstrate – a ‘messy’ and complex process, reflecting variables such as individual characteristics, household circumstances, career stage and prevailing labour market conditions. Moulaert and Biggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726712465453">2013</xref>: this issue) are surely right to point to the need to overcome the dichotomy of ‘more work’ as opposed to ‘more retirement’; but doing this will require proper analysis of the full range of conditions that gave shape to the options (mostly rather limited through financial and health constraints) people have in the last third of their lives.</p>
<p>The article from Flynn et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726712465453">2013</xref>: this issue) on trade union responses to ageing workforces is a reminder both of the range of institutions shaping retirement (with trade unions a somewhat neglected partner in the debate) and the policy dilemmas confronting many organizations. Trade unions are, as the authors of the article note, at the centre of debates about improving quality of life in the workplace, with these especially prominent in the context of moves to increase the statutory retirement age. Unions face a number of tensions on this issue, given their traditional support for early retirement − on the grounds that it frees up potential jobs and provides a reward for a lifetime of work. Supporting policies for extended working can therefore be seen as regressive and discriminatory. The former because they take away the ‘right’ to retirement; the latter because workers in poor health may be forced out of employment while facing a longer wait before receiving a pension.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0018726712465453">4</xref></sup> So the nature of the trade union response to such issues is of considerable interest. Flynn et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726712465453">2013</xref>: this issue) examine this question in the context of contrasting institutional frameworks in Germany and the UK, using case studies from the steel and retail sectors. They use a sophisticated theoretical framework drawing upon, first, relationships between the state, labour and capital – characterizing the UK as illustrative of a ‘liberal market economy’ and Germany a ‘co-ordinated market economy’; second, the influence of a plurality of actors within civil society (including non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and employers); third, and drawing on the work of the British theorist of trade union action Richard Hyman, the strategic orientations of unions – notably in respect of their promotion of class interests and their role in civil society.</p>
<p>The centrepiece of the article comprises interviews conducted with trade union officials, managers and other groups in the two countries, using the case study approach. Both industries present particular challenges for the employment and retirement debate. The steel industry shed labour at a rapid rate in many European countries from the 1970s onwards, thus forming a central part in the drive to promote early retirement. In the German case, low turnover of labour and extensive early retirement has produced an ageing workforce but with pressures – supported by employers as well as unions – to develop an ‘age management strategy’: the latter including options such as part-work/part-retirement along with measures to improve the quality of working life. The case study identifies areas of consensus and conflict in managing an ageing workforce: on the one hand, the employer interest in maintaining productivity in an ageing work force seems clear; on the other hand, the data highlight the way in which the emphasis is placed upon the individual worker adopting a healthy life style (or keeping ‘active’) rather than any radical re-organization of the workplace environment. This is an important issue that could have been picked up in more detail in the discussion at the end of the article. The UK, on the other hand, appears to demonstrate the way in which the early retirement culture is still embedded within the steel industry, with the possibility of retirement as young as 50 on health grounds and with management consent. Flynn et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726712465453">2013</xref>: this issue) usefully contrast tension between steps to enhance opportunities for older workers within the firm with emphasis on the maintenance of existing pension rights – given the threat of redundancies – at a national trade union level.</p>
<p>The retail examples are somewhat less clear-cut: interesting in terms of highlighting the complexity of work-endings in an industry where part-time employment dominates; difficult to interpret in terms of the influence of the wider institutional forces delineated by the authors. The UK case study provided examples of enlightened policies but would almost certainly be an ‘outlier’ in an industry where low pay, lack of training and limited pension provision are defining characteristics. The German example illustrates again the industry-wide nature of agreements but it is difficult to assess the impact of these from the case study provided. An important observation, however, was the extent to which increasing demands from work was leading to a reduction in employee interest in continuing in work after state pension age – a finding that might be replicated in more general surveys of workforce attitudes.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the article is that trade union responses to age-related issues could be described as ‘path-dependent’, following a ‘neo-corporatist’ model in the German case and a more localized (firm-specific) approach in the UK one. There is much utility in this argument and the different theoretical models are suggestive about the experience of the different countries. On the other hand, the wider economic context – of recession, growth and back to recession – also needed to be incorporated into the analysis. How the different institutional frameworks have responded to these macro-economic shocks is a decisive step that needs to be taken in any subsequent analysis.</p>

<title>Understanding work and retirement transitions</title>
<p>As previously suggested, the complexity of the work and retirement transition is that it lies at the heart of the ‘messy’ reality of people’s lives, cutting across individual and household characteristics, work contexts, and wider economic and sociological forces. As Loretto and Vickerstaff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726712465453">2013</xref>: this issue) highlight in their article, decision-making about when to leave work rarely falls into simple ‘either/or’ categories; nor is it taken mainly at the individual-level – the role of partners, peers and other factors within the individual’s social network will be crucial in shaping the final decision. The article takes one of these elements – the couple relationship – and examines, first, in what way the influence of gender roles and divisions of market work and family work interact with other changes (such as ill-health and redundancy) to affect retirement trajectories; second, how these interactions might influence the timing, nature and meaning of retirement and retirement planning among couples.</p>
<p>Based on qualitative research drawn from a combination of interviews both with couples and individuals illustrating different types of work and retirement patterns, the research generated important insights into the way in which gendered roles interacting with changing circumstances in late working life influence decision-making about retirement. An interesting finding from the study was the extent to which joint planning for retirement among couples was much less common than might have been expected from existing research in this area. It tended to occur in circumstances where the male breadwinner was dominant and where redundancy or opportunities for earlier retirement precipitated decisions about retirement. Some retirees, it was found, made the decision to retire in a largely ‘passive’ way, notably those moving or ‘drifting’ from long-term unemployment towards retirement at state pension age. Most of the couples in the research had yet to retire and the study revealed contrasting trajectories and attitudes of men and women: the former influenced by a ‘market-driven pathway’ linked to pensions and work-related issues; the latter, a ‘domestically driven’ pathway linked with responsibilities for caring. On the other hand, the employment context was also important for some of the women in the sample, with boring or ‘dead-end’ jobs providing a reason to exit from the workplace.</p>
<p>Another feature of the research – especially important in the context of the ‘re-engineering of work and retirement’ − was the finding that: ‘In the sample as a whole there was no great appetite for working “longer” … The most common conceptualization of retirement both amongst those who were already retired and those who were still working was freedom, most notably from time deadlines and work pressures’. Again, the gendered nature of such views was also a feature of the research. For men, retirement as a ‘reward’ for a lifetime of labour; for women a reward also but equally one of liberation from the gender contract which ties them into juggling paid work with care responsibilities within and beyond the home. Importantly, and confirming earlier findings in the US by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726712465453">Costa (1998)</xref>, many in the sample were willing to sacrifice some financial gains for the potential freedom which retirement would bring – a significant finding in the context of attempts by governments to encourage people to extend their working life. Finally, a key conclusion from this study is that focusing solely on how individuals make decisions about whether or not to retire is almost certainly misleading. As the authors note: ‘[Such decisions] are rarely the choice of individuals. Instead they reflect their domestic context and the interaction of temporal and long-run factors associated with partnerships, families, health and gender roles. Exhortations from government for people to extend their working lives need to recognize more clearly the very real limitations people face with respect to labour market, health and caring issues’.</p>
<p>A further element influencing the individual will be the stage at which they find themselves in their career, an aspect explored in the article by Post et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726712465453">2013</xref>: this issue) The issue here is the extent to which a particular career stage – in this case mid-career vs late career – might influence predictors of retirement attitudes. The authors draw on a variety of theories – sociological perspectives such as role theory as well as career stage theories – to examine: first, how career stages affect retirement age expectations; second, how individual characteristics and job attributes shape the age at which workers expect to retire; and, third, how career stage moderates these various relationships. The study used company size as a proxy factor controlling for differences in the work environment that might affect retirement decisions. The empirical component of the study draws upon a sample of mid- and late-career MBA alumni from three universities in the US. The research explored a range of hypotheses designed to test the importance of career stage as a factor influencing retirement expectations, age at retirement and related factors.</p>
<p>To what extent is career stage confirmed as an important variable influencing retirement intentions? In fact, on most variables there appears little difference between those in mid as opposed to late career. Nevertheless, the differences that are found do raise some interesting issues. Mid-career managers seem to be considering retiring earlier than their later counterparts – a finding that the author links to the task of resolving issues at mid-life (the so-called ‘mid-life crisis’), which may lead individuals to consider alternative social roles. Work centrality also appears important, reflected in the finding that ‘among individuals with a higher level of work centrality … reluctance to abandon their work-role is stronger at late career than at mid-career’. Organizational size also appears as important, with employees in larger organizations expecting to retire earlier than those in small firms, possibly reflecting the greater range of incentives on offer.</p>
<p>The article by Post et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726712465453">2013</xref>: this issue) brings out a number of important issues for consideration for those concerned with human resource management – notably the case for different approaches to retirement planning, depending on career stage and organizational context. A key consideration for further research, however, concerns the role of careers within the overall landscape influencing retirement expectations and attitudes. The assumption in the article is that traditional career stage models are still applicable for understanding the trajectory of people’s lives and their shaping of roles in work and retirement. But such a view sits uneasily with other articles in this issue − for example, the contribution from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726712465453">Moulaert and Biggs (2013)</xref> − which suggest that we are seeing the development of more ‘fluid’ or ‘liquid’ lifestyles with a blurring of traditional career stages. These other articles might question whether career stage will maintain its importance for understanding change over the life course, or whether the balance will shift towards individual characteristics on the one hand and structural factors on the other.</p>
<p>Contextual elements will clearly influence decisions about whether to remain in or to return to work, or to move into retirement. Issues surrounding post-retirement employment and the factors influencing the retirement-to-work transition are explored in the article by Pleau and Shuman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726712465453">2013</xref>: this issue). They note that ceasing all paid work at a fixed point is now much less common – studies in the US suggesting that this may in fact be characteristic of only half of all workers. Their article examines the trends and correlates of post-retirement employment in the US for 1997 to 2009, examining the influence of macroeconomic and demographic changes over this period. The authors highlight research findings, noting important variations influencing the likelihood of working after retirement, with factors such as gender, health status, lacking a private pension and shorter pre-retirement job tenure among the most important. They make the point, however, that while the salience of individual characteristics has been identified in a number of studies, much less is known about the role of macro-economic and demographic shifts in shaping rates of retiree labour force re-entry.</p>
<p>Developing this last point, the authors provide a valuable summary of the range of public policy, economic and demographic changes that might influence labour force transitions. These include: allowing people to earn additional income without losing benefits, fluctuations in the employment rate, the impact of globalization, and – in respect of demography – the importance of a large (especially in the US context) boomer generation for whom working at some point during retirement may carry greater appeal than for previous cohorts. The authors conclude that these broader changes suggest that older workers may be increasingly attracted to re-enter the labour force following retirement, with employers also more likely to have the ‘flexible’ forms of employment to meet their needs.</p>
<p>The authors go on to test the hypothesis that the prevalence of post-retirement employment has increased over the past three decades, driven by: first, macro-economic forces; second, changes in the composition of the retired population; and third, changes in work-retirement behaviour. Drawing on analysis of a substantial data set covering the period 1997 to 2010, their findings indicate (for the US) in fact relatively modest changes in post-retirement employment over the past 33 years. Differences between men and women were found to be important: for men, the ageing of the population, increasing unemployment rates and the decline of manufacturing industry all made modest contributions to post-retirement employment; for women, increasing educational attainment, increasing retirement income and the experience of economic recession tended to reduce the likelihood of full-time as opposed to part-time employment among those re-entering the labour force. Some of the findings from the study are, however, a puzzle, suggesting the need for more research – perhaps qualitative as well as quantitative. For example, legislation in the US – the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act – appeared from the results to have a negative rather than a positive impact on post-retirement employment, as did the ageing of the retiree population and longer duration of retirement. The findings from the Pleau and Sherman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726712465453">2013</xref>: this issue) analysis indicate the following questions for future enquiry. What role does the changing social composition of the retired population play in limiting aspirations for post-retirement employment? Will baby boomers be more attracted to work, perhaps because of pension uncertainties associated with the shift from defined benefit to defined contribution schemes? Or will they be more critical of what is on offer, as measured against their own work careers and aspirations? And will employers be able to supply the appropriate types of work in a context of continuing recession and high rates of unemployment?</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Changing patterns of work and retirement raise major questions for social and public policy in the 21st century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0018726712465453">5</xref></sup> A key issue concerns how to handle the legacy of the 20th century – namely the institutionalization of retirement as a major part of the life course. The acceptance of early retirement in the 1970s and 1980s accelerated the growth of post-work lifestyles, consolidated by the cohort of ‘first wave’ baby boomers (those born in the 1940s and early 1950s). Both aspects are now in collision with the drive to delay retirement and put in place later pension ages. Such policies must themselves be considered as conditional upon significant improvements to the quality of work, early intervention to support people with long-term health conditions, and a radical overhaul of the current system of education and training. The danger is that without these supports people will be increasingly caught between insecure work on the one side and an increasingly insecure retirement on the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726712465453">Vickerstaff et al., 2011</xref>)</p>
<p>The issues identified in the various articles indicate the basis for a new research agenda around the theme of older workers and work/retirement transitions. Identifying links between attitudes to work and expectations and experiences about retirement has become an important issue for sociological and organizational research. This area has always been significant for the study of ageing, but demographic and economic changes have placed issues affecting older workers as a key concern for social science in general. The reasons for this include: first, the impact of the baby boomer cohort and the tension between relatively high expectations about retirement running alongside anxieties about the adequacy of retirement income; second, the importance of the extended working life agenda for employers and employees; third, pressures within the workplace associated with job insecurity and work-related stress; fourth, the increasing diversity of older workers, notably in respect of gender and ethnicity.</p>
<p>A number of important research questions arise from the changing landscape of work and retirement. The most important of these include the following. How will older workers reconcile pressures to remain in the workplace with continuing aspirations to develop new lifestyles in retirement? How will the work environment need to change to support individuals with responsibilities beyond paid employment, or those with long-term health conditions, or those interested in moving to new types of work? How will training and education systems respond to the needs of an ageing workforce? To what extent will an extended working life reproduce, modify or accentuate inequalities accumulated through the life course? What is the range of transitions through middle and late life likely to emerge with new and more diverse cohorts of older people? What kinds of theory need to be developed to explain changing attitudes and aspirations about work and retirement? These and many other questions highlight the extent to which the interaction between ageing, work and society touches key issues of concern for the range of disciplines within social science. Strengthening the contribution of social science to research and policy on older workers will be a vital task for researchers and policy-makers in the years ahead. The articles reviewed in this collection provide a valuable contribution to our understanding of some of the key questions affecting people in the movement from work to retirement.</p>
