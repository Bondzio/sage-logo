<abstract>
<p>While menu items and menu design have been explored in the food-service sector, there is still a lack of information about the role played by product elements in a wine list from a consumer’s perspective. This study aims to fill this gap using a novel research method, choice modeling with latent class analysis for segmentation, which has not been used previously in menu research. The goal is to provide a better understanding of the way consumers choose wine in an on-premises setting and to identify possible segments based on how consumers respond to different types of information provided on the menu. The study was conducted in Australia, using an online representative panel of 1,258 respondents in May 2009, in a market similar to the United States with regard to on-premises wine consumption. The main results show that grape varietals are key choice drivers, followed by the awards obtained by a wine and its price. Less important but about equal in weight were a wine’s region of origin and tasting notes (i.e., a description of its sensory characteristics). The least important choice factor is food-matching suggestions. A segmentation analysis revealed the existence of seven segments, which are distinctive with regard to wine preferences based on the attributes analyzed in this study. However, as much as these groups diverge in the way they behave, they do not differ on the basis of their sociodemographic and attitudinal characteristics, confirming similar findings of other studies.</p>

<p>Although some restaurants have wine stewards to make suggestions and many consumers have personal experience with selecting wine, in most on-premises beverage venues (whether a restaurant, pub, or other eating and drinking place), a wine menu becomes the most important means the restaurant can use to stimulate wine sales. With that reality in mind, the purpose of this work is twofold. First, this research focuses on the role of various information elements on wine menus, using data collected among a representative sample of Australian restaurant patrons. Second, this study uses a novel research method for menu analysis—choice modeling—to measure the effect of different menu elements on wine choice (including tasting notes, price, varietal, and origin). We also identify distinct customer segments in the sample according to their response to the various items on the list. Our study involves wine by the glass, simply because a study of bottle sales would be inordinately complex to study.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>We could find little research on consumers’ responses to wine menus. While the role of menus from a consumer’s perspective has been investigated in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1938965511428448">Ju and Gluck 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1938965511428448">Thomson and Hamilton 2006</xref>), wine menus have mainly been investigated from a managerial perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938965511428448">Barrows 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938965511428448">Davis and Charters 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965511428448">Gil Saura, Ruiz Molina, and Berenguer Contrí 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938965511428448">Berenguer, Gil, and Ruiz 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938965511428448">Durham, Pardoe, and Vega (2004)</xref> published the only study about wine lists from a consumer’s viewpoint so far. Studying actual purchases, they analyzed the variation in sales related to the characteristics of wines on a restaurant wine list. They concluded that making a wine available by the glass increases the probability of its being sold, and that information on grape varietal and origin affected sales, as did color-specific sensory characteristics. This study’s findings were confounded by the fact that the characteristics on the wine menu were set by the owner and were not varied in a controlled way. Consequently, the effects measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938965511428448">Durham et al. (2004)</xref> reflected managerial decisions confounded with consumer preferences.</p>
<p>Equally unsatisfying are menu engineering methodologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1938965511428448">Taylor and Brown 2007</xref>) and gaze-motion studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938965511428448">Gallup Organization 1987</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1938965511428448">Kivela (2003)</xref> established that menu engineering is not really able to provide the type of analysis required by menu planners, and the implications of gaze-motion studies remain open to debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938965511428448">Bowen and Morris 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1938965511428448">Reynolds, Merritt, and Pinckney 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Instead, we sought to identify the menu aspects that drove consumers’ purchase through a discrete choice experiment (DCE) (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1938965511428448">Louvière, Hensher, and Swait 2000</xref>). By making choices among “bundles” of attributes, respondents reveal the importance they accord to attributes for decision making, as deduced indirectly from analyzing respondents’ choices.</p>
<p>For a DCE to be successful, it is important to identify the key attributes consumers rely on when making their wine menu choices to avoid overloading the consumer with too much information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938965511428448">Chaney 2000</xref>). After understanding what attributes seem useful, we could create an experiment to test the importance of different types of information on consumer choice.</p>
<p>Most of the research conducted in wine marketing has focused on the importance different product attributes have on consumers when purchasing wine in the retail sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1938965511428448">Lockshin et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1938965511428448">Goodman 2009</xref>), and we see no reason not to use those attributes as part of this exploratory study. Those studies identified price, grape varietal, region of origin, food and wine pairing information, sensory descriptions, and awards as key wine list elements.</p>
<p><italic>Price</italic> has always been considered one of the most important drivers of consumer choice, and wine is no exception. In particular, price allows customers to make inferences about the quality and value of a product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1938965511428448">Naipaul and Parsa 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1938965511428448">Narine and Badrie 2007</xref>). <italic>Grape varietal</italic> is an important decision cue in the wine retail environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1938965511428448">Thomas and Pickering 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938965511428448">Felzensztein, Hibbert, and Vong 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938965511428448">Balestrini and Gamble 2006</xref>), particularly for New World wines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1938965511428448">Lockshin and Hall 2003</xref>), and consumers differ greatly in their preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1938965511428448">Ling and Lockshin 2003</xref>). The <italic>region</italic> of origin was found to be the most important driver for an on-premises wine choice by Australian consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938965511428448">Goodman, Lockshin, and Cohen 2007</xref>), a finding confirmed for French (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938965511428448">Cohen, d’Hauteville, and Sirieix 2009</xref>) and Italian consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938965511428448">Casini, Corsi, and Goodman 2009</xref>). <italic>Food and wine pairing</italic> recommendations have been shown to increase wine sales in restaurants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1938965511428448">Harrington 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1938965511428448">Wansink et al. 2006</xref>). Tasting notes bearing a description of the <italic>sensory style</italic> also represents a critical extrinsic cue for wine selection since the wine’s taste is an essential characteristic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1938965511428448">Hall, O’Mahony, and Lockshin 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938965511428448">Bruwer and Johnson 2005</xref>). Finally, a factor not previously examined in restaurants are <italic>awards</italic> and medals, which are commonly used and studied in the off-premises sector. More than one study found that award-winning wines were more likely to be chosen compared to wines with no awards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1938965511428448">Morey, Sparks, and Wilkins 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1938965511428448">Orth and Krska 2002</xref>). In particular, gold medals increase the chance of a wine’s being purchased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1938965511428448">Lockshin and Halstead 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1938965511428448">Lockshin et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1938965511428448">Mueller et al. 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Not only will our study determine these attributes’ relative importance in driving consumers’ on-premises wine choice, but we also seek to investigate the presence of customer segments that have distinct wine preferences, behaviors, attitudes, and desires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1938965511428448">Yuan, So, and Chakravarty 2005</xref>). There is ample evidence for the existence of such consumer segments, but segment analysis is still neglected in the food-service sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1938965511428448">Yüksel and Yüksel 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Rather than use sociodemographic variables to define segments a priori and to test whether these groups differ in their preferences and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938965511428448">Felzensztein, Hibbert, and Vong 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938965511428448">Barber, Almanza, and Donovan 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1938965511428448">Lowengart and Cohen 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1938965511428448">Seghieri, Casini, and Torrisi 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938965511428448">Casini, Corsi, and Goodman 2009</xref>), we thought the opposite approach, post hoc segmentation, would be more effective, because it derives segments from differences in their behavior or attitudes. Only then does the analysis characterize the resulting groups by potential differences in their sociodemographics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1938965511428448">Mueller and Rungie 2009</xref>). Segmenting on behavioral differences has been found to be more robust and stable over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1938965511428448">Wedel and Kamakura 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1938965511428448">Mueller and Remaud 2010</xref>). For choice experiments, segments that differ in their choice drivers can be found with latent class choice models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1938965511428448">Mueller and Lockshin 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1938965511428448">Train 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1938965511428448">Mueller et al. 2010</xref>), which will be applied here to find consumer segments that differ in their use of information for wine choice.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>On-premises wine consumption is quite important in Australia, accounting for 47 percent of the total sales by value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938965511428448">Euromonitor International 2010a</xref>), almost in line with U.S. data (51 percent) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938965511428448">Euromonitor International 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>In May 2009 we recruited respondents from an online panel provider, which actively manages a panel of more than 600,000 Australian consumers. In total 1,258 respondents completed the online survey. To qualify, respondents had to be (1) of legal drinking age, which is 18 in Australia; (2) had to drink wine at least once per month; (3) had to drink red wine; (4) had to have dined out in venues other than fast-food restaurants in the previous month; and (5) had to have drunk wine when dining out in the prior month. The sample is representative for Australian wine consumers who regularly dine out when compared to the Roy Morgan Australian consumer survey, one of the biggest consumer panels in Australia.</p>
<p>The sample had slightly more females (56 percent), and most of the respondents (54 percent) are aged between 25 and 44 years old, though all other age groups were represented. The sample is also well balan ced by income level, with 30 percent in the low-income group (&lt;$60,000 per year), another 30 percent in the medium-income range ($60,000-$100,000), and 40 percent in the high-income segment (&gt;$100,000). This and the fact that the majority of respondents (37 percent) had a university degree is representative for Australian wine consumers regularly dining out. Since we selected for wine drinkers, it is not surprising that the sample drinks wine frequently. Fifty-two percent consume wine more than once a week and often choose wines by the glass (36 percent).</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>A DCE was used to determine the relative effect of different wine menu information elements on consumers’ wine menu choice. To our knowledge, this is the first study using a DCE for the analysis of consumers’ choices on a wine list. There were some issues to consider: the number and kind of wines one can list on a menu is potentially endless, so some means of limiting the size of the list is necessary; wine menus are limited in size, so only a certain amount of information can be provided; and the consumption occasion can have an effect on the way consumers choose wine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1938965511428448">Hall and Lockshin 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>We decided to test the methodology for wine lists in a realistic, but limited, manner by choosing to look only at wines by-the-glass. This part of the menu is usually short enough to fit on one page. The attributes chosen for the DCE were selected in accordance with the elements found in the literature review.</p>
<p>The six attributes are grape varietal, awards, price, sensory description, region, and food-matching suggestions. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1938965511428448">Exhibit 1</xref> shows the levels within each of the six attributes. We limited the study to red grape varietals, which are more frequently consumed in autumn when this research took place. The eight grape varietals and the four wine regions were chosen according to market relevance and awareness in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1938965511428448">Wine Business Solutions 2010</xref>). They were selected to represent both well-known and unknown grapes, which allows us to make some generalizations about consumers’ choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1938965511428448">Lockshin et al. 2006</xref>). The four price points were selected through a review of the most popular prices appearing on 38 Australian wine menus (of 300 posted menus). Sensory descriptions (either none, short, or long—drawn from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1938965511428448">Halliday 2009</xref>), food-matching suggestions (drawn from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1938965511428448">Goldstein 2006</xref>), and awards were also included as sources of wine information. Sensory descriptions and food matching suggestions were formulated specifically for each grape varietal, so one could only measure the effect of their presence or absence but not their specific wording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1938965511428448">Mueller et al. 2010</xref>). This information was limited to presence (one or two levels) or absence, to reflect the realistic scenario that this information is rarely available on a wine menu.</p>

<p>The attribute levels were combined into menus according to an 8 × 4<sup>5</sup> orthogonal main effects plan (OMEP) with 32 choice sets randomly split into two versions of 16 choice sets with a choice set size of eight wines in each. The design had an information efficiency of 99.87 percent according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1938965511428448">Street and Burgess (2007)</xref>. Each respondent was required to answer one version with 16 choice sets, where each choice set represented a wine list with eight items. Every choice set showed all eight grape varietals, while all other attribute levels appeared twice. For each choice set (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938965511428448">Exhibit 2</xref>), respondents were asked to choose one wine from eight alternatives. For verisimilitude, the wine purchase occasion we selected was having a meal in a bistro- or café-style restaurant with friends, which represents one of the most popular occasions when wine is consumed in Australian restaurants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938965511428448">Bruwer and Johnson 2005</xref>). Therefore, before respondents started completing the sixteen choice sets, they were asked to imagine they had to choose a wine in such a situation, to reduce potential variance because of different dining occasions. The scenario also stated that they decided to have a red wine and that they were happy with the fact that the restaurant offered wines by the glass.</p>

<p>Example of a DCE wine menu choice set</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1938965511428448-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Before and after the DCE, a set of sociodemographic and attitudinal questions were asked to characterize the sample and the segments on the basis of attitudes and behavior. The sociodemographic information measured age, gender, household income, and level of education, while the attitudinal questions provided insights on the frequency of drinking; the number of times respondents had a meal out in the last month in pubs, bistros or cafés, or fine-dining restaurants; the number of people they had the meal with; their relationship with the respondents; and the main source of information when ordering a wine.</p>
<p>Respondents’ DCE menu choices were first analyzed though an aggregated multinomial logit (MNL) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1938965511428448">Train 2009</xref>) to estimate the relative importance of each attribute for this model and the relative statistical significance. This was done by calculating each attribute’s partial <italic>R</italic>-square, that is, the partial log likelihood associated with each attribute across all its levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1938965511428448">Louvière and Islam 2008</xref>). We analyzed consumers’ choices using choice frequencies, in which we calculated the relative choice frequency of all attribute levels, which add up to 100 percent. Because of the orthogonal main effects experimental design, choice frequencies of different attributes can be analyzed independently of each other. The choice frequencies of this approach are intuitive to understand, an advantage that is especially relevant for managerial implications. We also calculated part-worth utilities based on a statistical model, which add up to zero. The advantage of this approach is that the statistical significance of the utilities and attributes can be evaluated by means of <italic>z</italic> scores and Wald statistics. To combine the strength of both methods, all results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1938965511428448">Exhibit 3</xref>, but we will describe the more intuitive choice frequencies when discussing the aggregated results.</p>

<p>For the segmentation analysis, the DCE assumption of homogeneity was relaxed, by using a latent class (LC) choice model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1938965511428448">Kamakura and Russell 1989</xref>). LC models are a specific form of finite mixture models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938965511428448">Andrews and Currim 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938965511428448">Boxall and Adamowicz 2002</xref>), which assume that the overall preference distribution is made up of a combination of unobservable, latent groups or classes that differ in their utility between the groups but are similar within (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1938965511428448">Provencher and Moore 2006</xref>). With the help of statistical criteria, the researcher has to specify the optimal number of these underlying groups. Simulation procedures estimate class-specific part-worth utilities for each attribute level and assign each person a probability of belonging to each of the prespecified classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1938965511428448">Train 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The statistical criterion we used to define the number of classes was the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The lowest value of the BIC corresponds to the optimal number of classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1938965511428448">Popper, Kroll, and Magidson 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1938965511428448">Scarpa, Thiene, and Tempesta 2007</xref>). In addition, part-worth utilities and <italic>z</italic> scores were calculated, as mentioned in regard to the aggregated MNL model (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1938965511428448">Exhibits 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1938965511428448">5</xref>). Once the segments were identified, we tested whether the segments differed significantly in their sociodemographics or wine-drinking behavior by cross-tabulating variables with class membership and conducting a chi-square test (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1938965511428448">Exhibit 6</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-1938965511428448">
<title>Aggregated Model</title>
<p>The results of the aggregated model revealed that grape varietal is the key element consumers considered in their wine choices under this scenario (weight of 42 percent). The second most important factor is the awards obtained by a wine (22 percent), and the price (14 percent) was third. This position for price may be an artifact caused by the smaller price span of by-the-glass wine, and the fact that a glass of wine is already priced modestly, compared to the corresponding bottle. The region of origin (9 percent) and the description of the sensory characteristics of a wine (8 percent) carried relatively little weight, while the least important choice factor was the food matching suggestions (5 percent) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1938965511428448">Exhibit 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Looking more specifically at the choice frequencies for the different attributes’ levels, we observe that Merlot and Shiraz appear to be the most preferred grape varietals (each at 17 percent), closely followed by a Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz blend and Cabernet Sauvignon (15 percent each). Pinot Noir (14 percent) is also popular, while Sangiovese, blended Grenache-Shiraz-Mourvedre, and Grenache are less often chosen. These figures closely reflect the actual sales of red wines in Australia, where Shiraz accounts for 38 percent of the market, followed by Cabernet Sauvignon (34 percent), Merlot (12 percent), and Pinot Noir (2 percent) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938965511428448">Euromonitor International 2010a</xref>). It is also interesting to see that the values for Australia are not all that different from the U.S. market, except that Merlot stands in for Shiraz in popularity in the U.S. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938965511428448">Euromonitor International (2010b)</xref>, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot are the two major red varietals in the United States (at 26 and 25 percent market share), while Shiraz (6 percent) and Pinot Noir (5 percent) represent another small, but consistent, share of the market.</p>
<p>As for awards, the presence of a gold medal stimulates choice more than does the absence of a gold medal (62 vs. 38 percent of all choices), while the price results show the expected pattern: consumers prefer to spend less rather than more. Thirty-one percent of all wines were chosen at $5 a glass, compared to only 19 percent of choices at $11 per glass.</p>
<p>Our findings confirm previous research in that more information about the wine increases the purchase probability, most likely by reducing the risk associated with a choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1938965511428448">Johnson and Bruwer 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1938965511428448">Lacey, Bruwer, and Li 2009</xref>). Our results show that long descriptions of the sensory characteristics of a wine are chosen slightly more often (40 percent) than short descriptions (32 percent) or providing no description (28 percent). Revealed preferences for wine regions reflect the share of Australian wine listings by region in the national on-premises sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1938965511428448">Wine Business Solutions 2010</xref>). Margaret River, McLaren Vale, Tasmania, and Heathcote are ranked first, third, fifth, and fifteenth in terms of market share, and similarly these ranks are identical in our experiment, with Margaret River being chosen 29 percent of the time, followed by McLaren Vale (27 percent), Tasmania (24 percent), and Heathcote (20 percent). This congruency confirms the external validity of our experimental results. Finally, although its overall importance is rather low, a majority of respondents prefer to have food-matching suggestions on the menu (56 percent of choices).</p>

<sec id="section6-1938965511428448">
<title>Latent Class Model Segmentation</title>
<p>To segment our respondents, we relaxed the assumption of homogeneity in consumers’ preferences to estimate a latent class model. All fit measures (adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> and the BIC [LL]) improve between the aggregated model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1938965511428448">Exhibit 3</xref>) and the LC model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1938965511428448">Exhibits 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1938965511428448">5</xref>). The LC analysis explains the different behaviors of the respondents better, thus confirming the need to conduct a segmentation analysis.</p>
<p>The best fit of the model was found with seven segments plus one random group solution. Given that the random group comprises a relatively small number of respondents (8 percent) without a clearly identifiable choice pattern, it is excluded from further analysis. This illustrates another strength of LC analysis: it can eliminate those respondents that seem to answer in a random manner.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1938965511428448">Exhibit 4</xref> shows the seven segments, named for their most salient attribute, and provides the ranking of the attributes by relative importance in decision making down the columns. Four of seven groups consider grape varietal as the most important choice factor (segments four through seven). However, while segments six and seven also tend to take into account the price of the wine when making a selection in an on-premises venue, group four looks for the region where the wine comes from, and group five relies on sensory descriptions of the wine. As for the other three segments, segments one and three almost exclusively base their choices on the indication that a wine got an award. However, while segment one supports this information with the grape varietal, segment three uses the price of the wine. Finally, segment two appears to have the most complex choice decision process among the seven groups, taking into account the price, the region of origin, and the grape varietal.</p>
<p>We can now look at the relative utility values associated with the different attributes’ levels for these groups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1938965511428448">Exhibit 5</xref>). Group six (10 percent of the sample) has a clear preference for Merlot, and group seven (9 percent) prefers Shiraz, but only when those wines are sold at lower price points ($5-$7). With regard to segment seven, however, it is interesting to observe that although gold medals do not represent a fundamental choice factor, respondents belonging to this group still seem to prefer awarded wines to others. For these reasons we named segment six <italic>Mid-Low Price Merlot</italic>, and segment seven <italic>Mid-Low Price Gold Shiraz</italic>.</p>
<p>The use of grape varietals also characterizes groups four (13 percent) and five (12 percent of the sample). We called segment four the <italic>Cabernet Regionalists</italic> because they prefer wines from Margaret River, the well-known Cabernet Sauvignon–producing region in Western Australia. Members of segment five—the <italic>Pinot Lovers</italic>—prefer that varietal, plus they like longer descriptions of the wine’s sensory characteristics.</p>
<p>As for the other three segments, it is possible to see that groups one (18 percent of the sample) and three (14 percent) prefer awarded wines. They have an interest in grape varietals (9 percent for group one and 3 percent for group three, as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1938965511428448">Exhibit 4</xref>), but not one in particular. Although price is not a critical choice factor for them, group one seems to favor low-price wines ($5-$7) and group three will order midprice wines ($7). We named group one the <italic>Low Price Gold Varietals</italic> and group three the <italic>Mid-Price Gold Medals</italic>.</p>
<p>Finally, group two (16 percent of the sample), although somewhat influenced by gold medals, prefers high-priced wines ($11) from the well-known regions of McLaren Vale or Margaret River, and is called the <italic>High Price Regionalists</italic>.</p>
<p>After having described the behavioral characteristics of the segments, we can now look at their sociodemographic and attitudinal features (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1938965511428448">Exhibit 6</xref>). All the segments, with the exception of the <italic>Mid-Low Price Gold Shiraz</italic> and the <italic>High Price Regionalists</italic>, have a slight female majority, which is strongest for the <italic>Pinot Lovers</italic>. While the <italic>Mid-Low Price Merlot</italic> group is older (35-54 years old), the other segments tend to be younger (20-44 years old). The two male-majority segments are mainly represented by middle-aged (25-54 years old) people. The majority of respondents in all segments tend to have a graduate degree and a high household income, with the exception of the <italic>Low Price Gold Varietals</italic> group, which has a lower average household income. Moreover, all groups indicate a relatively high consumption frequency (more than once a week), but the share belonging to this most frequently consuming category ranges from 40 percent for the <italic>Pinot Lovers</italic> to 66 percent for the <italic>Mid-Low Price Gold Shiraz</italic>. The main source of information when ordering a wine is the menu, ranging from 53 percent in the <italic>Low Price Gold Varietals</italic> to 60 percent in the <italic>Cabernet Regionalists</italic>. All the segments tend to have a meal in a bistro-style restaurant two to three times a month, and the percentage of respondents falling into this frequency category is relatively homogeneous, ranging from 40 percent in the <italic>Mid-Low Price Merlot</italic> to 53 percent in the <italic>Low Price Gold Varietals</italic> and the <italic>High Price Regionalists</italic>. In relation to this, pub (food-focused bar) owners should also pay particular attention to the <italic>Mid-Low Price Gold Shiraz</italic> and <italic>Mid-Low Price Merlot</italic> segments, as they tend to dine out more frequently (two to three times a month) than the other segments (one time) in this type of venue. Fine-dining venues are not as widely patronized by the Australians in this sample (who are representative of the nation’s consumers), probably because of the high cost per meal. However, it is interesting to see that with the exception of the <italic>Mid-Low Price Merlot</italic> segment, all the other groups tend to have one meal in a fine-dining venue every month.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results presented above show the existence of different population groups with regard especially to their behaviors, and somewhat to their attitudes and sociodemographic characteristics. We would like to offer suggestions for bistro or café managers wanting to set up a wine list that will satisfy the different needs and desires of as many segments of the population as possible. Although these implications could be influenced by the selection of the attributes and levels used in this study, it is interesting to observe what implications the use of the DCE method allows us to derive. The implications apply directly to the by-the-glass market, though the results should be applicable to the full wine list in this kind of restaurant.</p>
<p><italic>Adding a large number of grape varietals to your menu might mean diminishing returns</italic>. Our study showed that a restaurant should be able to offer consumers a limited range of wines and still meet most customers’ desires.</p>
<p><italic>Offer award-winning wine and show the awards</italic>. A considerable proportion of respondents took into account whether a wine had won a gold medal as their most important choice attribute. We found groups, for example, that particularly focused on gold medals awarded to Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Sauvignon–Shiraz blend, and Shiraz.</p>
<p><italic>Be consistent with the prices proposed</italic>. Each grape varietal should be offered with at least two price levels, so as to give consumers a certain degree of freedom about the quality level of the wine they want to have. Beyond the choice of the grape variety and the wine region, however, the way in which managers use the other elements of the wine menus—presence of an award, food pairings, and sensory descriptions—will direct consumers toward a particular price level.</p>
<p><italic>Describe your wines</italic>. Many of our respondents took into account sensory descriptions in choosing the wines. This extra amount of information will reduce the risk associated with a choice, thereby increasing the chances of a wine’s being chosen. It is important that the descriptions of more expensive wines are particularly well written, as they will help push consumers away from the cheaper alternatives.</p>
<p><italic>Communicate the region of origin of the wine</italic>. Geography is important, and your list should include the grape that is best known for its region. So managers need to be careful to include regions that have favorable perceptions and promote wines from those regions in their wine list. For example, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1938965511428448">Wansink, Payne, and North (2007)</xref> showed that a well-known region was able to stimulate a favorable taste expectation and increased the amount of food eaten by 12 percent compared to an unfavorable region.</p>
<p><italic>Suggest wine and food pairings</italic>. Although this information does not appear key for the choice of a wine, it still can lead toward the selection of more expensive alternatives, if customers are unsure about what they want to have.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This article presents an approach hospitality managers worldwide can adopt when building a wine list. The combined application of a choice experiment and latent class analysis offers a useful and innovative approach for segmentation analysis in the hospitality field, particularly since we found that segments derived from traditional demographics demonstrated little difference, as compared to the differences in how people chose their wines.</p>
<p>This study was limited to consumers on the Australian consumer panel who are regular wine drinkers. The selection criteria excluded both people who do not dine out regularly and those who do not drink wine regularly. People who usually drink white wine were also not represented, even though few consumers restrict themselves only to white or red wine. It might be valuable to test whether infrequent consumers respond to the same attributes as regular wine drinkers. Another limitation is that the study only tested one consumption occasion. Future studies might test for different occasions or types of restaurant. Third, it was not verified whether the way in which items are ordered in the wine list (e.g., by price, by grape variety) could lead to different evaluations of the choice items. This should be a fruitful area of inquiry to understand how people choose wine and whether the order in which information is presented can enhance consumers’ choices. We believe that further study should test this study’s finding that price was far from the most important attribute for the choice of wine, since that fails to confirm studies that used a similar methodology to analyze off-premises wine purchasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1938965511428448">Lockshin et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1938965511428448">Mueller et al. 2010</xref>). We have also alluded to the possibility that the range of prices for wine by the glass as presented in this study is not broad enough to really push respondents to make trade-offs between different price points. To maintain a realistic test we had to sacrifice a wide price range. We believe that if the study involved purchases by-the-bottle, the importance of price would be higher, given the wide price range of bottles.</p>
<p>In relation to selection of the attributes and the levels included in a wine list, it should be noted that the results obtained here were influenced by the authors’ selection. Our results might have been different had we included different attributes or levels. Our attribute choices were based, however, on an extensive literature review of wine choice in the retail and the on-premises sector. Since we view this as a first exploratory step into the use of discrete choice experiments for the study of wine menu creation, we see the study of menu planning as a future research venue once the results are validated. Some authors have investigated menu design techniques in relation to food menus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938965511428448">Bowen and Morris 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1938965511428448">Reynolds, Merritt, and Pinckney 2005</xref>), but nobody has tested yet whether the results are generalizable to wine menus. It would be particularly interesting to compare the DCE results with gaze motion techniques to test whether the choice of a wine would follow the same patterns leading to the selection of a food or whether other decision criteria lead to the selection of a wine.</p>
<p>Finally, this study is limited to the Australian market for red wines, so the results cannot be immediately generalizable to other markets. As we noted above, Australian and American consumers do not seem to be different with regard to their wining and dining behaviors. Thus we believe that this work is of value for American restaurateurs. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1938965511428448">Goodman et al. (2008)</xref> observed that both Americans and Australians think that previously consuming a wine, a suggestion by someone they trust, and grape varietals are the three most important elements when choosing wine in a retail environment. The two nations seem to be similar also with regard to the evaluation they give to wine closures and prices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938965511428448">Bleibaum, Lattey, and Francis 2005</xref>), and as we found in this study, about 50 percent of American wine consumers tend to dine out in a full-service venue six or seven times per month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1938965511428448">Kruger, Michels Blank, and Gillespie 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, our results showed that grape varietals are key choice drivers, followed by the awards obtained by a wine, and the price listed on a menu. Used less frequently, the region of origin and the description of the sensory characteristics of a wine are rated almost equally, while the least important choice factor is represented by the food matching suggestions.</p>
<p>Segmentation analysis revealed the existence of seven apparently distinctive segments with regard to preferences toward the different attribute levels analyzed in this study. However, as noted above, as much as these groups diverge in the way they behave, they are similar in respect to their sociodemographic and attitudinal characteristics, confirming findings of other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1938965511428448">Mueller et al. 2010</xref>). Attitudes and demographics are not predictive of how people behave.</p>
