<abstract>
<p>This study examines whether the network characteristics represented on the Internet drive or reflect other events and occurrences in the offline environment. More specifically, the purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between the web visibility network of Korea’s National Assembly members and the amount of financial donations they receive from the public. The results of the linear correlation analysis indicate a positive direction, suggesting that politicians who occupy a central position in the web visibility network are more likely to receive financial donations than those occupying a peripheral position. The quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) correlation results revealed a significant correlation between politicians’ web visibility network and their political finance network. This study identifies the structural relationship between Korean politicians’ online and offline networks.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The widespread use of the Internet has led to the emergence of heavily networked societies worldwide, and socio-political activities have tended to depend mainly on mediated social infrastructure based on advanced information and communication technology (ICT). The term ‘network society’ describes the aspects of modern societies as an interrelated social structure derived from digitalized communication relationships between social components such as individuals, groups and organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461444812457335">Castells, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1461444812457335">Van Dijk, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The number of Internet users in the world has grown dramatically. According to Internet World Stats (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.internetworldstats.com">www.internetworldstats.com</ext-link>), the total population of world Internet users grew from 360 million in 2000 to 1966 million in 2010. South Korea (hereafter ‘Korea’) has the highest rates of Internet access in Asia, accounting for 81.1 per cent of the total population in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1461444812457335">Internet World Stats, 2010</xref>). In a recent report published by the International Telecommunication Union (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1461444812457335">ITU, 2010</xref>), Korea ranked within the top three among 159 countries in terms of broadband penetration including fixed and mobile connectivity. This indicates that Korea has a highly developed infrastructure with regards to ICT.</p>
<p>In network society, communication networks are regarded as fundamental sources of political power making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461444812457335">Castells, 2009</xref>). The developed ICT environment in Korea has facilitated online political campaigns for politicians as well as citizen’s awareness of and participation in these political events. Since the 16th Korean presidential election in 2002, the critical role of online political campaigning has been domestically and internationally highlighted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461444812457335">Gibson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461444812457335">Hara and Jo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1461444812457335">Kuhn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1461444812457335">Lee, 2009</xref>). The 16th Korean president Roh Moo-Hyun was regarded as the first ‘Internet President’ of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1461444812457335">Watts, 2003</xref>). He was not like a traditional political leader, who upholds conservative ideologies, has strong family connections, is well-educated, and is ranked high in seniority. President Roh overcame these disadvantages by using the Internet. His online campaigning strengthened civic mobilization based on the younger generations’ attention and support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461444812457335">Han, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1461444812457335">Lee, 2009</xref>). As a result, the victory of President Roh provided positive feedback concerning the Internet and the role it can play with regard to political success. After the 2002 presidential election, online campaigning has been widely used by Korean politicians.</p>
<p>Although there are a number of studies focusing on the relationships between the Internet and politics, research has rarely considered the network structure concerning political actors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1461444812457335">Thelwall (2009)</xref> noted that ‘webometrics’ is broadly defined as the study of web-based content (e.g. text, images, audio-visual objects and hyperlinks) with primarily quantitative indicators for social science research goals and visualization techniques derived from information science and social network analysis. In other words, webometrics studies are interdisciplinary in nature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461444812457335">Hogan (2008)</xref> emphasizes that webometrics has become an active research domain in the examination of online social behavior and the determination of practices and trends in offline communication.</p>
<p>Although webometrics has become methodologically sophisticated and provides social scientists with rich descriptive data on Internet use, there remains a need for a theoretical explanation of findings that can enable generalizations and hypotheses for empirical research. Webometrics scholars, particularly those in social and political information sciences (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461444812457335">Ackland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461444812457335">Bruns, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461444812457335">Caldas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1461444812457335">Holmberg and Thelwall, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1461444812457335">Lee and Park, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1461444812457335">Park, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1461444812457335">Park and Jankowski, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1461444812457335">Park and Kluver, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1461444812457335">Park and Thelwall, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1461444812457335">Schmidt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1461444812457335">Soon and Kluver, 2007</xref>), have typically analyzed hyperlink data by using social network measures and visualization methods, and thus, their studies tend to be descriptive and topological. In response to these trends, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461444812457335">Borgatti et al. (2009)</xref> stated that one major goal of theory-driven network analysis in social sciences (unlike in engineering and natural sciences) is to relate an individual node’s positional difference (e.g. centrality) in certain networks to the node’s outcomes (e.g. economic success) or behavior patterns (e.g. communication homogeneity).</p>
<p>A number of analytically well-grounded webometric studies exist. However, most replicate previous methods, and their findings rarely advance social science theories about the impact of digital media deployment on society. In this regard, this study examines whether the network characteristics represented on the Internet drive or reflect other events and occurrences in the offline environment. More specifically, the purpose of this study is to investigate the structural relationships between the web visibility network of National Assembly members in Korea and the political financial network, based on the amount of financial donations they receive from the public. In addition, the structural relationships between their socio-demographic networks (e.g. their party affiliation, committee affiliation, constituency, career/experience, gender and age) are also examined.</p>

<title>Political role of the Internet</title>
<p>In terms of the impact of the Internet on politics, previous research has proposed two theoretical perspectives: the normalization and equalization (or innovation) hypotheses. The normalization hypothesis assumes that Internet use among political actors does not seriously change the traditional political structure between major and minor players. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1461444812457335">Margolis and Resnick (2000)</xref> indicated the ‘normalization of cyberspace’, which posits that real-world features of politics are transferred to the Internet. Advocates of the normalization hypothesis have asserted that online communication is influenced by typical offline patterns in the form of reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1461444812457335">Margolis and Resnick, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1461444812457335">Schweitzer, 2008</xref>) and have argued that traditional factors can have a dramatic influence on online activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461444812457335">Foot and Schneider, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461444812457335">Graber, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1461444812457335">Margolis and Resnick, 2000</xref>). That is, online politics can mirror offline politics, revealing existing political structures.</p>
<p>However, the normalization perspective is inconsistent with the innovation hypothesis. The innovation approach emphasizes the Internet’s political role in leveling the inequality of the traditional political hierarchy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461444812457335">Bentivegna (2002)</xref> suggested that the Internet leads to a fundamental change in politics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1461444812457335">Kluver (2007)</xref> found that blogs have created new opportunities for political expression within the tightly controlled media ecosphere in Singapore. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461444812457335">Di Gennaro and Dutton (2006)</xref> argued that the Internet has the power to change political participation by lowering the cost of involvement and creating new mechanisms for organizing groups and forming new channels of information that bypass traditional media gatekeepers. In short, according to these studies, the Internet may transform politics by disseminating information and mobilizing people.</p>
<p>These two perspectives are still controversial in current political communication studies. Both are the subject of some studies. However, prior studies concerning both sides have usually focused on the competitiveness of the campaigning websites of individual politicians or political parties by investigating user traffic, accessibility, functionality and innovation in their content and service features. Rarely do they consider the overall political structure composed by individual political actors. This was a key motivational factor for this research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1461444812457335">
<title>Web visibility</title>
<p>This study considers the web visibility network of politicians as an indicator of their political connectedness on the Internet. Web visibility typically refers to two factors: (a) the number of external web links an individual website has (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1461444812457335">Thomas and Willett, 2000</xref>), and (b) the salience of particular people, objects and issues, among other things, on the web (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461444812457335">Drèze and Zufryden, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1461444812457335">Kretschmer and Aguillo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1461444812457335">Vaughan and Shaw, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1461444812457335">2005</xref>). In this study, web visibility can be defined as the presence or appearance of political actors discussed by the public (or Internet users) on the Internet.</p>
<p>Generally, tracking web visibility has been regarded as a powerful way of obtaining valuable insights into the public’s reactions to actors or issues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1461444812457335">Kerbel and Bloom (2005)</xref> analyzed web mentions on Blog for America (BfA), the official campaign blog of Howard Dean for the 2004 presidential election in the United States and found that 45 percent of posts mentioning a presidential candidate were about George Bush, followed by John Kerry (12 percent). Although BfA represented the Democratic Party, the public’s web posts clearly reflected the political influence of George Bush, the winner. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1461444812457335">Lim and Park (2010)</xref> found a significant relationship between the number of political blog posts mentioning political candidates and the number of votes received by those candidates in the 2009 National Assembly election in Korea. Thus, web visibility can be a new methodology for systematically measuring online political structure in the digital age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1461444812457335">Hindman, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1461444812457335">Lee et al. (2010)</xref> suggested an expansion of the web visibility measure to identify hidden relationships between two people on the web. The co-occurrence of the names of two people on the same webpage may indicate that they are related to each other, though the aspects of their relationship may be positive or negative. The more a particular webpage mentions a pair of individuals, the stronger their relationship is likely to be. The co-occurrence web visibility of a pair of politicians can represent their hidden online political relationships based on public attention, and allows for the construction of a social network structure. Thus, this study employs the co-occurrence web visibility measure to identify the online political structure for Korean politicians.</p>

<sec id="section4-1461444812457335">
<title>Political finance</title>
<p>Traditionally, the amount of financial donations a politician receives has been regarded as a crucial indicator of his or her political influence. This money may reflect the level of public support and can be used to fund political activities. A number of studies have suggested that political finance can influence elections and public support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461444812457335">Ansolabehere and Gerber, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461444812457335">Erikson and Palfrey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461444812457335">Glantz et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461444812457335">Goidel and Gross, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461444812457335">Green and Krasno, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461444812457335">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461444812457335">Grier, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1461444812457335">Jacobson, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1461444812457335">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1461444812457335">Kenny and McBurnett, 1992</xref>). In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1461444812457335">Jacobson (1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1461444812457335">1990)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461444812457335">Grier (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461444812457335">Green and Krasno (1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461444812457335">1990)</xref> found a positive relationship between the challenger’s campaign spending and the number of votes he or she garnered. The incumbent’s campaign funds are also positively related to the number of his or her votes, although this relationship is not always clear. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461444812457335">Coate (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1461444812457335">Stratmann and Aparicio-Castillo (2006)</xref> suggested that voters’ evaluation of a candidate’s quality is influenced by the source of the candidate’s campaign funds.</p>
<p>By contrast, other studies have proposed that political finance, specifically campaign spending, has little effect on votes at the global level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1461444812457335">Levitt, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1461444812457335">Palda and Palda, 1998</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1461444812457335">Prat (2002)</xref> suggested that the informational benefit of political finance is often overestimated by politicians, who generally need to raise campaign funds from the public.</p>
<p>Likewise, there is no consensus on the relationship between political finance and elections. However, there appears to be a broad consensus on the importance of political finance and its implications for political influence in the real world.</p>
<p>In this study, to identify implicit relationships between politicians in the real world, political finance data for individual politicians were transformed into valued network data by considering the dyadic differences in the amount of financial donations politicians received. That is, the size of the financial gap between politicians may reflect their implicit political relationship. If there is a large financial gap between two politicians, their relationship may reflect the degree of inequality in their political influence. Conversely, if there is no financial gap, they may have the same political influence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1461444812457335">
<title>Research objective</title>
<p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the structural relationship between the co-occurrence web visibility network of Korea’s 18th National Assembly members and the dyadic difference network of financial donations they received from the public. The study provides a comparison between online and offline political structures in Korea as well as a theoretical argument about the political role of the Internet. If the online and offline political structures of politicians are similar, the normalization perspective will prevail. That is, the Internet may reflect the offline political structure of individual politicians. On the other hand, if the two structures are different, the equalization (innovation) perspective will prevail. The Internet may reform the offline hierarchical structure of individual politicians.</p>

<title>Methods: data collection and analysis</title>
<p>This study started from a criticism of traditional Internet and political studies, which have overlooked complicated network properties between online and offline worlds. For the purpose of this study, network analyses should be employed to systematically investigate the structural relationships between online and offline networks of Korean politicians. The data were collected on 30 January 2010. At that time, the 18th National Assembly had 278 members − the subjects of this study. All of these members were elected in April 2008.</p>

<title>Data collection</title>
<sec id="section8-1461444812457335">
<title>Co-occurrence web visibility</title>
<p>Co-occurrence web visibility was operationally defined as the systematically counted number of web pages that included the names of two people on the same page. The data were gathered from popular search engines in Korea, including Naver (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.naver.com">www.naver.com</ext-link>) and Daum (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.daum.net">www.daum.net</ext-link>). All data were automatically collected using e-research tools written in Visual C++. The tools are based on common attributes of web scrapers: making a connection to a web server, requesting a web page, and retrieving the text content and mark-up of the page. To retrieve pages that contained a pair of politicians, their names were used as the search query (e.g. ‘politician A’s name AND politician B’s name’). It was necessary to modify the query for collecting the most relevant pages from search engine results. The ‘name’ query also returned pages that mentioned other celebrities who had the same names. Thus, some contextual words were added to the query, such as ‘의원; National Assembly Member’. In addition, the search was restricted to the period between 1 April 2008 (the date of the election) and 31 December 2009. The co-occurrence web visibility data for each pair of politicians were collected across various platforms, including blogs, images, news and websites. There may have been duplicated contents in two search engines, but this study did not remove them because duplications can reflect real aspects of web visibility in the public (Internet users) using the different search engines.</p>

<sec id="section9-1461444812457335">
<title>Political finance</title>
<p>The data were drawn from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1461444812457335">Korean National Election Commission’s annual report (2009)</xref>. The report provided information regarding income and campaign expenditure for each politician during the 2008 election. Only the data on the total amount of financial donations each politician received from the public were collected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1461444812457335">
<title>Socio-political attributes</title>
<p>The data on the socio-political attributes of each politician, including their gender, age, party affiliation, consecutive incumbency, constituency and committee membership, were drawn from the official website of the Korean National Assembly (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.assembly.go.kr">www.assembly.go.kr</ext-link>) and individual home pages of the politicians.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1461444812457335">
<title>Analytic strategy</title>
<p>To examine the relationship between web visibility and political finance, the study employed three types of analytical methods: Pearson/Spearman correlations, CONCOR (convergence of iterated correlations), and QAP (quadratic assignment procedure) correlations.</p>
<sec id="section12-1461444812457335">
<title>Correlation analyses</title>
<p>Regarding the individual level of politicians, the Pearson and Spearman correlations between the politicians’ web centrality levels and financial donations were calculated (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1461444812457335">Table 1</xref>). Generally, there are four centrality measures in network analysis: degree, betweenness, closeness and eigenvector. Degree centrality defined important nodes as having a large number of connections to other nodes; betweenness centrality as having a high number of possible paths between other nodes; closeness centrality as having the shortest geodesic distances to other nodes; and eigenvector centrality as having a position connected to important neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461444812457335">Hanneman and Riddle, 2005</xref>). In this study, the centrality of co-occurrence web visibility was defined as the position in a network in which nodes indicate politicians and ties indicate the number of pages mentioning a pair of politicians. For this reason, this study employed Bonacich’s eigenvector centrality measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461444812457335">Bonacich, 1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461444812457335">1987</xref>), which is an appropriate centrality measure for completely interconnected online networks, in that the eigenvector centrality considers the strength of online links between nodes in the global structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1461444812457335">Newman, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>CONCOR</title>
<p>To identify structural groups of politicians with similar relationship patterns within the online network structure, a clustering method of network analysis, CONCOR, was conducted using the UCINET VI program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461444812457335">Borgatti et al., 2002</xref>). The analysis is based on the structural equivalence criterion that simplifies complicated relational data, based on the similarity of each politician’s connection pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461444812457335">Breiger et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1461444812457335">Wasserman and Faust, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1461444812457335">White et al., 1976</xref>). For more details about the procedures of CONCOR, refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1461444812457335">Wasserman and Faust (1994)</xref>. Through CONCOR analysis, structural positions between sub-groups of politicians can be revealed. Also, an additional analysis, <italic>F</italic>-test would indicate the differences of web centrality and financial levels between different sub-groups of politicians.</p>

<sec id="section14-1461444812457335">
<title>QAP</title>
<p>The QAP correlation, which is useful for inter-network comparisons, was used to examine the structural (network-based) relationship between online and offline political structures. The QAP correlation analysis followed a two-step procedure. In the first step, the observed correlation coefficients for corresponding cells of two matrices were calculated. Then, in the second step, similar to the bootstrap procedure as a re-sampling method, the rows and columns of one matrix were randomly permutated, and then the correlation between the matrices was recalculated. This process was repeated thousands of times. The resulting distribution of correlation coefficients was used to determine the probability that the observed correlation would be significant. Although QAP analysis generates correlation coefficient values, they may not reflect a common significant level because the structure of social network data can limit the number of correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461444812457335">Gibbons, 2004</xref>). In addition, QAP correlation coefficients may not be reliable indicators of the strength of relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1461444812457335">Krackhardt, 1988</xref>). For these reasons, the statistic of interest was the <italic>p</italic>-value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461444812457335">Gibbons et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, the politicians’ socio-demographic attributes were converted into actor-by-actor matrices in terms of their dyadic differences (age and consecutive incumbency) and affiliation (party, constituency, committee and gender). These socio-political attribute networks were considered in the QAP correlation analysis by using the UCINET VI program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461444812457335">Borgatti et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

<p>The political finance network was created from the dyadic difference matrices of paired politicians’ financial amounts. The maximum financial gap was KRW 360,617,140 and the minimum was KRW 1882. The average gap was KRW 97,233,238 (SD = 76,022,684) and the median was KRW 83,643,160.</p>

<title>Pearson and Spearman correlations</title>
<p>Generally, if data have a standard deviation that is more than half the mean, the data substantially deviated from the normal distribution. Regarding the data of political finance and web visibility, their standard deviations were more than half of their means. This indicates that the distributions of the two sets of data did not follow a normal distribution assumption and were affected by outliers. In this case, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1461444812457335">Croux and Dehon (2010)</xref> suggested that nonparametric correlation measures are statistically robust and efficient, compared to the Pearson correlation measure.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Korea is one of the most developed ICT countries in the world and the Internet has played an important role in Korean politics. This study systematically investigated the structural relationship between Korean politicians’ online (web visibility) and offline (political finance) networks. The levels of web visibility among politicians can represent the online structure, based on the public’s attention. Also, the amount of their political finance allows us to identify the offline structure, based on the public’s donations. In this study, a comparison between online and offline political structures provides an insight into the political role of the Internet in Korean politics.</p>
<p>The results of the linear correlation analysis of the politicians’ web centrality levels and financial donation amounts indicate a positive direction, suggesting that politicians who occupy a central position in the web visibility network are more likely to receive financial donations than those occupying a peripheral position.</p>
<p>Through CONCOR analysis, the different aspects of politicians’ groups derived from structural relations in the web visibility network were examined. The results indicated that the groups with lower levels of web centrality have fewer financial donations than those with higher levels. Furthermore, the results of the QAP analysis indicate a significant structural relationship between online and offline networks regarding the politicians. That is, those pairs of politicians with higher co-occurrence web visibility were more likely to have similar amounts of financial donations. Also, two politicians having a strong online relationship are more likely to have similar amounts of financial donations and similar political structures both online and offline. In addition, both the web visibility and political finance networks were significantly related to most of the socio-political attribute networks (e.g. age, party affiliation, consecutive incumbency, constituency and committee membership). In particular, the gender network was significantly related to the political finance network but was not related to the web visibility network.</p>
<p>Overall, these findings suggest that politicians’ online networks were closely related to their offline political structure and attribute networks. That is, their online network reflected their existing political structure and embedded socio-political characteristics. Thus, this study provides support for the normalization argument (i.e. the online environment replicates the real environment), not the equalization perspective (i.e. the online environment changes the offline hierarchical structure of politicians).</p>
<p>In modern democracies, socio-political communication and relationships seem to be complex and irregular. However, traditional social science research has tried to find linear relationships (i.e. cause and effect) between social factors without considering complicated network properties. At this point, this study can meaningfully contribute to webometrics research using social network analysis to identify the interconnected socio-political relationships between online and offline worlds.</p>
<p>This study has several limitations. First, although politicians’ networks can represent both online and offline power structures, they cannot reflect the comprehensive social networks between politicians and the public. Thus, future research should consider the comprehensive social networks of political donors and support to provide a better understanding of political structures.</p>
<p>Another limitation comes from the study’s cross-sectional research design. Even though they may appear to be fixed, both online and offline political structures change over time. In this study, the web visibility network was significantly related to the political finance network, but their future relationship could not be determined. For this reason, future research should consider changes in such relationships over time to provide a deeper understanding of political structures.</p>
<p>Also, this study focuses on the quantitative aspects of online political relationships. However, this approach does not allow for the determination of whether web mentions of politicians are favorable. Thus, because the quality of web content is important in examining politicians’ online reputations, future research should also consider the qualitative aspects of web mentions as well.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study systemically examines the structural relationships between the online political network (in terms of the co-occurrence web visibility for pairs of politicians); the offline political network (in terms of the dyadic difference in the amount of financial donations between pairs of politicians); and socio-demographic attribute networks (e.g. party affiliation, constituency, gender, age, career/experience and committee affiliation).</p>
<p>In terms of methodological contributions, this study suggests that the web visibility measure as a web-based indicator can be a proxy measure to represent the political aspects of the real world. That is, the validity of web data can be supported from this study. This is a significant contribution to webometrics research.</p>
<p>This study provides theoretical and methodological contributions to online political research. Regarding theoretical contributions, the political role of the Internet can be more systematically identified. The normalization and equalization hypotheses have traditionally argued about specific political events, web features, and causal relationships with regard to limited data. This study empirically supports the normalization perspective on the basis of comparing the interconnections of politicians in a global system including both online and offline worlds.</p>
<p>Although this research may be an empirical case study of that normalization, it should be stated that other cases supporting the equalization perspective have been found in Korea. In 2002 Roh Moo-Hyun, who was not from a traditional socio-political regime, was elected as the 16th Korean president via the Internet. Also, in the 2011 Seoul mayoral by-election, Park Won-Soon, a civic activist without any political ties or party affiliation defeated a prominent politician, Nah Kyoung-Won, who was supported by one of the ruling parties. Through social networking services (SNS), such as Facebook, Twitter, and podcasts on iTunes, the number of supporters for Mayor Park rapidly increased and their support helped him to become mayor.</p>
<p>These events supporting the equalization perspective are different from the case of the 18th National Assembly members this study examined. The equalization events happened during election periods, but the normalization case in this study was examined after the election. That is, contextually, equalization events may be examined when political environments are changeable and uncertain, while normalization cases may be investigated when political structures are established and stable. Future research should try to explain more precisely the difference between normalization and equalization perspectives by considering different contexts.</p>
<p>Additionally, from this study, a crucial issue can be raised. The study indicated a significant structural relationship between political money and web visibility. Generally, political money has been regarded as a determinant of political power, but online aspects have been relatively ignored in traditional political science. It has long been debated how political power can be conceptualized and operationalized. At this point, the concept of political power could be more complicated, but should be discussed in further detail nonetheless.</p>
