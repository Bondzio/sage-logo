<abstract>
<p>Whether or not intentional actions initiated and formed by free will exist, it can be shown that lack of belief in such behavior makes people behave less ethically and less law-abidingly (they cheat more). Therefore, this phenomenon—often called a necessary illusion—is crucial to moral as well as legal social-life-forming activities. However, societal coherence based on this kind of illusion is indeed very fragile, and thus we would be better off if we could prove that the quality of free will in intentional activity is more than a convenient illusion. This article presents an interdisciplinary model within the domain of criminal law and psychology explaining human intentional actions based on a scientific notion of free will as a real-world phenomenon.</p>

<p>Recent research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959354310384759">Shariff, Schooler, and Vohs (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959354310384759">Vohs and Schooler (2008)</xref> show that whether or not free will exists, it is crucial that people <italic>believe</italic> in free will. People who do not believe in free will act less ethically and less law-abidingly (they cheat more) than people who do believe in it. It is important for human beings to believe that at least some of their actions and activities are not merely determined by forces (be they outer or inner) that cannot be controlled. Likewise, it is important that we believe that we ourselves have initiated and defined the social, ethical, and law-abiding standards of our actions and activities. Several authors have stated that even if there is no such thing as a free-willed intentional act, believing in free will is a necessary illusion in order to maintain a civilized society and societal cohesion. The obvious question is whether the ethical and law-abiding standards of human activity—and thus cohesion—really depend on whether or not we are able to maintain such illusory social constructions.</p>
<p>The professions of law and psychology are both concerned with human societal life-forms and activities. Obviously, law and psychology are both vast disciplines that are concerned with much broader domains than the aforementioned. However, in the context of this article it would seem safe to say that (criminal) law is concerned with the human actions for which we can be held liable and psychology is concerned with the psychological preconditions of being able to perform and being motivated for performing such acts.</p>
<p><italic>If</italic> (a) we succeed in developing models of human activity based on the concept of intentionality and free will in a manner that is compatible with scientific explanations and theory building and (b) we can prove that such a model can include human activities within law as well as psychology, <italic>then</italic> we have a strong case in favor of the contention that free-willed intentional activities are more than a mere illusory social construct. It is obvious that this would be of societal importance.</p>
<p>As a useful spin-off, such a common model of free-willed activity would advance interdisciplinary cooperation between the professions of law and psychology and advance joint knowledge accumulation based on common hypothesis constructions, empirical designs, and modes of theoretical modeling of human activity patterns found in common data sets.</p>
<p>The task of developing the abovementioned common or interdisciplinary model of human actions takes its point of departure from the phenomenon of intentional acts: to act with <italic>intention</italic>—that is, to act responsibly, and thereby be able to act as a person, to attribute personal responsibility to our own actions and thus act as a <italic>sane</italic> person.</p>

</fig>
<p>A main point is the distinction between objective and subjective conditions for punishment. Only when both the objective and the subjective conditions for punishment are fulfilled can punishment be determined.</p>
<p><italic>The objective conditions</italic> relate to what happened and who did it. The objective conditions are fulfilled (a) if and only if the content of the act can be described according to law as a violation of such a law and (b) if and only if the person has carried out or been involved in the act. If the act is not or only partly materialized, the question is whether there was an attempt to materialize it.</p>
<p><italic>The subjective conditions</italic> relate to whether the accused is normally at such a mental and developmental stage and, at the time of the crime, was actually in such a mental state that he/she can rightly and reasonably be held responsible for the deed and subsequently penalized.</p>
<p>The crucial consideration concerns the subjective conditions. It seems that these subjective conditions contain a libertarian notion: (a) a notion of freedom from external coercion (if a person has acted under strong external influence of coercion, we would not hold him or her liable) and (b) a notion of freedom of will, meaning that the person could and should have acted otherwise (if this is not the case, for instance because of internal coercion or deficiencies, then we would not hold him or her liable either). We will return to the problem of free will, but for now let us have a closer look at the special case of internal coercions and/or deficiencies: that is, insanity.</p>
<p>According to criminal law (of most Western countries), people cannot be held responsible if they have acted in self-defense, acted in fear or under the influence of a strong affect, if they are minors, or, finally, if they were insane at the time of the crime.</p>
<p>The notion of insanity has a long history and its roots can be traced back 2,000 years, to Roman law and even earlier. In Denmark, impunity owing to insanity can be dated back to at least <sc>ad</sc> 1200. Particularly informative is the way in which insanity has been handled in recent time in English and American law.</p>
<p>According to the English McNaughton Rules from 1843, the deciding criterion is the cognitive factor: that is, what the accused <italic>knows.</italic> A person can be acquitted without punishment, provided the defense can prove that the accused at the time of the crime did not know what he/she was doing—or, if the person knew what he/she was doing, did not know then that it was wrong.</p>
<p>However, this provision was gradually faced with increasing criticism —not least in light of the dawning psychological and psychiatric sciences. The objection was that only very few people do not know what they are doing, and that their actions are wrong. There was an increasing awareness that certain people are perfectly aware that what they are doing is wrong and illegal, but they simply cannot help it (e.g., kleptomaniacs).</p>
<p>One can then try to place emphasis on what the accused intended with his/her act. According to this voluntary criterion, a person is insane provided the person cannot control him- or herself and cannot mobilize sufficient reluctance against his or her own criminal actions and tendencies. However, the problem with such a criterion of insanity also quickly became evident. It may be right and reasonable to pardon kleptomania if the person <italic>cannot will</italic> it otherwise. Yet the person is hardly insane if he/she <italic>can will</italic> it otherwise, but simply <italic>will not</italic> muster the strength not to steal. But how can one distinguish between (a) not <italic>being able</italic> to muster sufficient willpower to do what is right and (b) just not <italic>wanting</italic> to muster sufficient willpower to do what is right? If there are no reliable methods to distinguish between <italic>will</italic> and <italic>not being able to or wanting to will something</italic>, it is an unpractical criterion.</p>
<p>In 1954 the Durham Rule was formulated (adopted in the District of Columbia, bur for less than 20 years). The rule states that a person is insane if his/her actions are <italic>a product of</italic> a mental illness. This is an attempt to avoid the criteria of knowledge and will by basing the assessment of the person on psychological and psychiatric diagnostics. If a person is diagnosed as mentally ill, the person is insane. The criticism against this provision is that the very autonomy of law is threatened because the key questions and conclusions of law are then in effect placed outside law and left to the decisions of psychological and psychiatric experts.</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959354310384759">American Law Institute (1962)</xref> tried to amend this situation with the following test of criminal responsibility:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks <italic>substantial capacity</italic> [emphasis added] either to appreciate the wrongfulness of the conduct or to conform the conduct to the requirements of Law.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With this provision, the autonomy of law was re-established and secured in relation to expert witness statements. It was acknowledged that mental illness and defect play a role with regard to the psychological capacity of the accused to (cognitively) assess and to (voluntarily) control his/her actions. However, the point is that it is solely a legal definition whether a given mental state is considered to include sufficient capacity to attribute sanity to the person and hold him/her responsible.</p>
<p>This brief outline from English and American legal history demonstrates a wish to uphold the autonomy of law. It is solely up to the political legislation and law to determine the subjective conditions for penalty, which are not to be determined by experts from other sciences.</p>
<p>Note how such a model of the person—let us call it “law’s standard model of the person”—does not operate with “average people.” It deals with some standard capabilities which we need in order to even understand the contents of law and be capable of acting in accordance with it. These standard characteristics can, for example, be formulated as “[we are] conscious and intentional creatures who act for reasons” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959354310384759">Morse, 2007</xref>, p. 215). It is a legal-political matter to determine when there is sufficient lack of consciousness and rationality to allow excusing conditions: When is somebody too young to have an adequately developed rationality? When is somebody too mentally disturbed for it to be a matter of rationality? When is somebody too influenced by drugs or too subjected to his/her affects to be able to think clearly and consciously? Furthermore, this involves both universalistic and particularistic criteria. Universally, it is a question of what one can determine as expected capacities in human beings. Particularly, it is a matter of how one determines what is to be expected from a specific person or group of people. For example, it is not expected of each and every person that they offer professional first aid of a certain standard, but it is, depending on the circumstances, expected from nurses and doctors.</p>

<title>Holding a person liable</title>
<p>As will appear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959354310384759">Figure 1</xref>, there are several ways in which to attribute a criminal result of actions to a person, namely <italic>direct intention</italic>, <italic>indirect intention, dolus eventualis</italic>, <italic>conscious negligence</italic>, and <italic>unconscious negligence.</italic></p>
<p>A case of <italic>direct intention</italic> would be if the accused intends to carry out, is involved in, or attempted to carry out an act that would violate a law. It is irrelevant whether the person considers it to be very or hardly likely that he/she would succeed in what he/she intended. For the accused the point is to materialize the prohibited content. On the one hand, intention is more than merely a wish/idea/plan about doing something. Intention (as a notion of law) exists when an act has actually been <italic>initiated</italic>. On the other hand, it is not vital whether the aim of the act—e.g., snatching a purse from an elderly woman—was actually accomplished or whether it failed and only was an attempt. In any case it is a direct intention.</p>
<p>In other situations the accused has an aim which in itself is not punishable, but which has a further consequence or side-effect that <italic>is</italic> punishable. In that case one may say that the prohibited content was an unintentional <italic>side-effect</italic> of the materialization of the main goal. There are two main questions here: Was the side-effect such that it would necessarily materialize as a consequence of materializing the main goal (and thus no unforeseen accident)? Did the accused know of this side-effect and its inevitability? If both questions can be answered positively, we have the case of an intentional criminal act—even if <italic>indirect intention</italic> is the case.</p>
<p>In jurisprudential terms a third kind of situation is called dolus eventualis. This is also an attempt to establish whether the accused knew of the illegal side-effect or not. However, what characterizes this category (as opposed to indirect intention) is that the accused can plead that he/she could not have known if this side-effect would actually and inevitably materialize.</p>
<p>A real-world example includes person <italic>A</italic>, the driver of a car, and person <italic>B</italic>, the passenger. Person <italic>B</italic> is dropped off; he throws a hand grenade at a third person, runs back into the car, and person <italic>A</italic> quickly drives away. One cannot say that person <italic>A</italic> directly aimed to harm/kill the third person. Yet, it is still decided that person <italic>A</italic>’s act is a violation of law of an intentional nature, as determined by the type dolus eventualis, as it is claimed that the accused has realized the <italic>possibility</italic> of this side-effect (that <italic>B</italic> throws the grenade), and that he does not renounce his main goal (to be <italic>B</italic>’s driver), and therefore accepts the punishable side-effect as well (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354310384759">Danish Parliament Website, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>A fourth situation is when the accused will <italic>not</italic> accept the prohibited side-effect. If he/she had known that the side-effect would materialize, then he/she would never have attempted to materialize the main goal. That he/she nevertheless materializes the main goal is due to <italic>conscious negligence</italic>, either because he/she overestimates his/her own abilities to prevent the side-effect from occurring or because he/she underestimates the probability that this side-effect will, in fact, occur (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959354310384759">Morkel, 1982</xref>). One example could be: <italic>A</italic> has a gun and aims at a beer can close to <italic>B</italic>. <italic>A</italic> knows that there is a risk of hitting <italic>B</italic>, but is confident of his ability as a good shooter. He aims, shoots—and unfortunately kills <italic>B</italic>.</p>
<p>The fifth and last type of situation resembles conscious negligence in that the accused does not have the prohibited effect as his/her main goal, and that he/she does not accept the prohibited side-effect and would never have tried to materialize the main goal if he/she had known that the side-effect would materialize. Nevertheless, it is more than just an unforeseen accident: the accused could and should have accepted and realized the risk of this side-effect.</p>
<p>It may be a drunk driver who loses control over his/her car and thereby hits a cyclist. This would be <italic>unconscious negligence.</italic> The driver could and should have foreseen the risk in the shape of the side-effect, but had got him- or herself in a state where he/she was unable to be as attentive as conditions demanded.</p>
<p>According to criminal law, these are the five main modes of human activities for which one can be held liable. The question now is if such notions as free will and intentions need to be included in the understanding of the mentioned modes and in the decision whether a person can be penalized.</p>
<p>Some authors, for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959354310384759">Morse (2007)</xref>, claim that law does not need a notion of free will at all. According to Morse, the practical task for law to solve is to identify necessary and sufficient criteria on the basis of which we can distinguish between people whom we will hold accountable for criminal actions, and people whom we do not want to hold responsible. Furthermore, Morse believes that the criteria of the legal standard model of humans (see above) are fully sufficient to make this differentiation. People are responsible to the extent that they are conscious and intentional creatures who act for reasons. People whom we, according to this model, do not want to hold responsible are those who show lack of rational capacity and those who are not subjected to compulsion (neither external nor internal). Law need not be concerned with whether a person could have acted otherwise but need only concentrate on what the person actually did and whether what he/she did is characterized by consciousness, rationality, and non-compulsion.</p>
<p>This way of thinking is in fact fully in line with many of the psychological theories about crime developed in the course of the 20th century. These psychological theories diverge with regard to which type of action-forming forces their theoretical explanations refer to, but, as we shall see, not in the type of explanations of human actions they embrace.</p>
<p><italic>Individual-oriented theories</italic> identify the personality-shaping and action-forming forces as internal. Trait theories, for example, attempt to explain criminal actions by stating that the accused is (behavior-genetically) disposed to develop into a person with specific criminal traits: that is, with a tendency to act criminally. Cognitive theories explain that respect for law is a question of whether an individual has developed the necessary cognitive capacities to even comprehend and cognitively process moral and legal rules and principles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0959354310384759">1</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Psychoanalysis-oriented theories</italic> try to explain crime as a consequence of unconscious conflicts. Therefore, we are far from choosing ourselves how we experience a situation, how we relate to other people, and how we actually act.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0959354310384759">2</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Social-psychology-oriented theories</italic> focus on identifying these action-forming forces as external social forces. Some social-psychological theories assume that humans are not by nature law-abiding. To become law-abiding, the person must learn a number of social norms, and crime is explained as a result of failed norm acquisition. Some social-psychological theories emphasize that it is a question of learning: as a starting point human beings are not criminal, but criminals in one’s upbringing have been role models from whom one has learned how to be. The completely opposite explanation suggests that crime is due to lack of learning: as a starting point, humans are indifferent to laws and norms, and through their upbringing they need law-abiding role models to become law-abiding themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0959354310384759">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>This is, of course, only a quite brief and simplified outline of the psychological theories, yet adequate to illustrate the vital point that such psychological theories, regardless of their apparent differences, are basically still <italic>of the same kind.</italic> Common to these theories are that they all attempt to explain the criminal act as caused by <italic>non-intentional internal or external forces</italic>.</p>
<p>Modern criminology is, of course, much more diverse and includes neuroscientific, biosocial, as well as modern developmental and social and personality theories. The problem, however, seems to remain. The types of explanations used state that the action-forming forces are outside the person and therefore the person <italic>cannot help</italic> the act or the criminal content he/she was involved in or attempted to engage in. These forces <italic>made him</italic>/<italic>her</italic> act in such a way. The problem lies in the types of explanation used—in law as well as psychology—and, especially, the types of possible forms of scientific explanations <italic>not</italic> used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0959354310384759">
<title>Types of explanations in psychology</title>
<p>In this section, the task is to address other theories in psychology building on relevant methods of explanation and concepts that are compatible with methods of explanation and concepts within Law.</p>
<p>Generally, there are three levels of explanation: <italic>causal, functional, and intentional explanations</italic>. One can hardly say that there is an agreed-upon definition of causality in the philosophy of science. The common use of causal explanations most often has this form: A state and/or a movement is explained as a consequence of the preceding cause. When a prior cause can be identified and, furthermore, when a natural law can be identified, after which this cause results in precisely this, and no other, state/movement, then we have a causal explanation.</p>
<p>Causal explanations are, however, inadequate when it comes to the far more complex matters that involve living organisms. Admittedly, living organisms fundamentally consist of states and movements of physical/chemical substances that are combined in and cooperate as biological structures and processes. Yet, causal explanations cannot explain how and why these physical substances and chemical reactions are combined and cooperate in precisely such a way that they constitute a living organism’s states, processes, movements, and life course. This requires a more advanced method of explanation: that is, a functional explanation. Once again it must be admitted that one hardly can find consensus on how to understand the concept of something being functional. There are many ways of being “functional.” But again, briefly stated, one could say that in terms of functional explanations, organisms’ structures and (life-)processes are explained as being of <italic>use</italic> to the organism’s self-organizing interaction with its surroundings. For example, a dog is capable of displaying a number of <italic>species-specific behaviors</italic>, which can be explained functionally according to evolutionary principles: precisely these types of behavior help the dog species to maintain existence and ensure breeding chances. Yet, such functional explanations do not explain why this specific dog in this specific situation demonstrates this particular behavior and no other—for example that it runs to the left round the lamp-post and not to the right. Such specific behavior must therefore be explained by how this specific dog <italic>self-actively</italic> attunes, optimizes, and organizes its behavioral functionalities according to its organic state and according to the conditions of possibilities and requirements of the situation. This self-active, optimizing organization of own behavioral functions is <italic>intentional</italic> behavior.</p>
<p>Intentional behavior is always directed <italic>at</italic> something. From the point of view of the organism (animal or person), behavioral connectedness always manifests itself as an active search for something or as reaching out for something.</p>
<p>But its actual behavior is equally adapted to the state of the surroundings and current events in the surroundings. Another dog in the vicinity might make the need for food fade to the advantage of other needs, and the behavior is then directed as curiosity, alertness, dominance behavior, mating behavior, and so on.</p>
<p>Thus, explanations of intentionality do not explain self-active organisms’ behavioral connectedness as something that is exclusively determined from inside (“it is due to something in the organism/person him- or herself”) or from outside (“the surroundings/society bear the blame”). Behavior is always directed both <italic>at</italic> someone or something and <italic>by</italic> someone or something. That is, intentional behavior is always <italic>directed at/by someone or something</italic>.</p>
<p>In people we find another and more advanced form of intentionality than behavior—that is, <italic>actions—</italic>and explanations of actions cannot be reduced to behavioral explanations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310384759">Bertelsen, 2005</xref>). <italic>Behavior</italic> is the active intention-directed connectedness directed at/by the surroundings in a species-specific, optimized/adapted and an individual-specific, concrete optimizing/attuning manner. <italic>Actions</italic> are active connectedness, which a person—on the basis of such attunements and optimalizations—also <italic>chooses</italic> in a free-willed and conscious, reflective way (the concept of free will to be discussed below).</p>
<p>Consequently, there are four modes of scientific explanations in psychology: (a) <italic>causality</italic> (explanations based on causes and natural laws), (b) <italic>evolutionary functionality</italic> (explanations based on functionality), (c) <italic>behavior intentionality</italic> (explanations based on individual behavior as directedness at/by the surroundings), and (d) <italic>action intentionality</italic> (explanations based on actions as free-willed and reflective directedness at/by the surroundings).</p>
<p>We find the concept of—or at least the implicit idea of—intentionality in a large part of psychology. Of course it played a central role in early humanistic and existential-phenomenological psychology. In their extensive review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959354310384759">Malle, Moses, and Baldwin (2001)</xref> point to several areas in psychology in which the research question concerns intentionality in one or another way. One area concerns intentionality in the folk psychological theory of mind.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0959354310384759">4</xref></sup> Another area concerns how people make sense of human actions by detecting underlying intentions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0959354310384759">5</xref></sup> Yet another area concerns the question of how we distinguish reason from cause in explanations of behavior and action.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0959354310384759">6</xref></sup> To this we can add that at least some authors within law and jurisprudence would agree that human actions are based on intentionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354310384759">Ashworth, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354310384759">Bedford, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354310384759">Duff, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959354310384759">Hart, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959354310384759">Kenny, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959354310384759">Marshall, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0959354310384759">Williams, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0959354310384759">W.

<sec id="section4-0959354310384759">
<title>The basic model of intentional activity</title>
<p>At this point, we should be ready to construct a model of intentional activity. On the basis of this model we can both construct theories and explanations of human actions within the domains of criminal law and psychology, and reject the claim that a necessary belief in free-willed intentional actions can at best be nothing but an illusory social construction.</p>
<sec id="section5-0959354310384759">
<title>Actions</title>
<p>The concept of actions is central to this model. Actions are the forms of behavior whereby we intentionally connect to the surroundings in our daily activities. Looked at inside-out, actions <italic>are explained as situationally directed projects</italic>. Looked at outside-in, actions are determined <italic>by</italic>, as well as shaped <italic>by</italic> and directed <italic>by</italic>, the goals that we want to materialize. In this perspective, <italic>actions are explained as directed at/by the situational activities</italic>. Thus, action is not one-sidedly determined by either “inner” or “outer” forces.</p>
<p>For instance, an action can be to approach a house, lift a window out of its frame, climb into the house, open the terrace door, and then carry a sleeping child into a waiting car. This action is, on the one hand, determined by the situationally directed project that is directed <italic>at/by</italic> removing the child from the house. On the other hand, it is determined <italic>by</italic> a number of conditions and the whole situation in which the action in relation to the child takes place (e.g., the complex social circumstances that means that the child is in the house and brought out in this way).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0959354310384759">
<title>Activity</title>
<p>As indicated above, an action is, however, always part of a major, organized system of actions, by which the person essentially maintains his/her life. Perhaps the child’s parents removed the window because they had locked themselves out. In this case the action is part of the very general life project of being caring parents. Or perhaps the act is a criminal break-in and part of a major system of actions such as kidnappings and demands for ransom.</p>
<p>Such systems of actions, all of which are part of maintaining and developing a specific way of life, are called activities. It is through this system of actions, this activity, that persons establish, maintain, and develop their general life-form, be it a life as a caring mother or as a burglar. The individual action can never be fully understood and explained unless it is seen in the light of the general activity of which it is a part and by which it is organized.</p>
<p>Together these actions <italic>constitute</italic> the referred-to activity. Separately these actions could, as shown above, constitute a variety of alternative activities. They are, however, <italic>organized</italic> in the specific combinations of the activities they constitute. That is, organized in <italic>this</italic> way, they constitute precisely <italic>this</italic> and no other activity. In short: bottom-up actions constitute activities; top-down these activities organize precisely these actions to cooperate in an activity-constituting manner. As can be seen, action is explained partly <italic>horizontally</italic>, inside-out/outside-in, partly <italic>vertically</italic> top-down/bottom-up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0959354310384759">
<title>Operations</title>
<p>Each action is basically constituted by fundamental, operational capacities for action of a mental, sensory, and motor nature (stretch the arm forward, press the crowbar in, break the window open, etc.). Just as the same action can be part of different activities, the same action elements or operations can be part of a myriad of different actions. They are, however, organized by a specific action to cooperate as constitutive to this action and no other. Some of the mentioned operations could also have been carried out by a carpenter, who quite legally is changing the wooden frame of an old window.</p>
<p>In sum: intentional actions are produced in a dynamic, initiating, and shaping field of dynamic forces. Therefore, actions can be explained on the basis of the following four perspectives:</p>
<list id="list1-0959354310384759" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Outside-in actions are explained as directed <italic>by</italic> surrounding forces and social dynamics and conditions. This is a sociological perspective on action. It concerns the field of interacting social forces that constitute the way in which our common life foundation operates and the type of <italic>social order</italic> it involves.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Inside-out actions are explained as directed <italic>at</italic> maintaining and further developing the life forms. This involves the intention of action dynamics, and an intrapsychic perspective on action is adopted here. It concerns the way in which we, psychologically, <italic>can and will direct ourselves at</italic> life, the fundamental social forces and the social order in life.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Top-down actions are explained as organized by life activities, and explanations draw on <italic>organizational perspective on action</italic> (which calls for intentional modes of explanations).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Bottom-up actions are explained as being constituted by operations and a constitutional perspective on action is adopted.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The main point in this basic model of human actions is that we cannot properly understand and explain the human aspect of our actions unless we apply an approach that makes possible scientific explanations, based on all of the four modes of explanations. Especially it is vital to include modes of explanations of how it is up to individuals in a vertical organizing manner to make assessments of what a good action would be. We organize and direct ourselves <italic>at</italic> the directedness of our own actions. At the same time our activities are also constituted <italic>by</italic> our actions: that is, our activities are, in this sense, also directed <italic>by</italic> our actions. In short: we are also <italic>directed at/by our own directedness</italic>. Because of this vertical organizing intentional property of human activity it makes sense to hold persons responsible for their actions. As stated above: we can be held responsible for our activities because we are able to be directed at/by the directedness of our actions (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354310384759">Dworkin,1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959354310384759">Frankfurt, 1989</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959354310384759">Taylor, 1982</xref>, for such hierarchical notions of actions and responsibility)</p>
<p>For someone to be held responsible for an action or a prohibited content, he or she must have been in a position and in a mental state where he or she <italic>could have acted otherwise.</italic> The basic model of intentional activity identifies the ability to act differently as having been able to organize one’s actions and operations differently, so that together they would have constituted another action and activity. This is the real core of <italic>free will</italic>.</p>

<title>Psychology and free will</title>
<p>But can a concept of free will even be part of a psychology that to a great extent applies <italic>deterministic</italic> types of theoretical explanations? (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959354310384759">Figure 2</xref>.)</p>

</fig>
<p>In terms of hard determinism, theoretical explanations can only be scientific if they explain their phenomena as effects of <italic>preceding</italic> causes. The notion of free will, however, implies that people could have <italic>chosen</italic> to act otherwise. That means that there could not be any preceding cause because that would have dissolved the very act of choosing. But if one cannot point to any preceding cause, one cannot give any scientific explanation. So, if the only type of scientific explanation would be causal explanations <italic>ad modum</italic> hard detetermism, one must, according to hard indetermism, that is, hard libertarianism, give up scientific explanations when one wants to defend the existence of free will. Thus, according to both hard determinism and hard libertarianism, scientific explanation is <italic>incompatible</italic> with the notion of free will.</p>
<p>A <italic>compatibilist</italic> strategy would be to soften libertarianism so that it could include scientific explanations. Soft libertarianism is in agreement with determinism in that—whether we want to or not—we must always attune our self-constructed reasons with the framing conditions of the world. To some extent one has the choice of stepping outside of these frames (e.g., the social or moral and legal). However, one cannot opt out of the consequences of them or the reaction of the surrounding world to one’s actions and breaches of conventions. Furthermore, we have in fact certain biologically and psychologically limited and limiting constitutional capacities to act in the world in general and in our social surroundings in particular.</p>
<p>Recently psychologists have defended a notion of free will essentially based on the compatibilist strategy of <italic>soft determinism</italic>: we are to some degree able to control our actions, or—at least—to stop unwanted impulses, or, more precisely, we function(!) on the basis of some form of “self-control.” (See, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354310384759">Baer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354310384759">Bandura, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354310384759">Baumeister, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959354310384759">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959354310384759">Howard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959354310384759">Kihlstrom, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959354310384759">Miller &amp; Atencio, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354310384759">Roediger, Goode, &amp; Zaromb, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354310384759">Simonton, 2008</xref>. Among writers in the domain of jurisprudence, see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959354310384759">Gomes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959354310384759">Grim, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959354310384759">Morse, 2007</xref>.) According to this soft version of determinism we can determine necessary and sufficient criteria of free will based on optimization of functionality. A necessary and sufficient criterion for free will is (a) that the determining forces converge in what could be called a “junction” of forces—that is, in the acting person’s mental apparatus—and (b) that they are optimized in this “junction” in a practical reasonable way and are functionally adapted to the situation. As can be seen, soft deterministic theories apply the functional mode of explanation.</p>
<p>Some authors have even stated that free will does not exist as functional organization at all but that nonetheless the <italic>folk psychological illusion</italic> of free will is a necessary condition for us to function in a proper way in complex societal contexts (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959354310384759">Dennett, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0959354310384759">Strawson, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0959354310384759">Wegner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0959354310384759">T.D. Wilson, 2002</xref>; and recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354310384759">Roediger et al., 2008</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0959354310384759">Wegner, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Newly conducted research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959354310384759">Shariff et al. (2008)</xref> seems to show that whether or not free will exists, it is crucial that people <italic>believe</italic> in free will: if we induce people to believe that free will is illusory, they will simply behave less ethically (demonstrated in laboratory experiments). Based on their own laboratory experiments, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959354310384759">Vohs and Schooler (2008)</xref> showed that people who were convinced that free will does not exist cheated more at computer games than people who believed in free will. The authors conclude that believing in free will and the debate about free will as an illusion have important societal implications.</p>
<p>Wegner is a prominent defender of viewing free will as an illusion. He suggests that the belief in free will is a <italic>feeling</italic> of conscious will. Furthermore, this feeling is based on the inferences and correlational misinterpretations we make between, on the one hand, our thoughts and experiences and, on the other hand, the behavior and actions that seem to have something to do with these thoughts and experiences. As with any correlation, one should always search for a possible third factor which could be the cause of both. Wegner is of the opinion that certain unconscious neural processes cause both our actions and our feelings. Nevertheless he would agree with, for example, Vohs and Schooler that free will might very well be a necessary illusion.</p>
<p>The hypothesis of free will as nothing but illusion has been criticized by many authors. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959354310384759">Baumeister (2008b)</xref> has argued that even if Wegner and associates are able to point out vast amounts of phenomena and experimental data documenting the fact that we are unaware of the causes of certain ways of behavior, we can never conclude that <italic>all</italic> ways of behavior are the result of unconscious causal processes. It is possible that we will find data and patterns in human behavior that make modes of theoretical <italic>scientific</italic> explanations drawing on some sort of a <italic>scientific</italic> notion of free will preferable, even necessary.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354310384759">Andersen (2006)</xref> confronts Wegner’s linear causal model and mode of explanation which is fully in line with Libet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959354310384759">Libet, Freeman, &amp; Sutherland, 1999</xref>): either our intentions (feelings of free will) or our neural processes come first, and if we can show (as Libet did) that unconscious neural processes come first (even a split second before), then they must be the cause of our behavior, not of our intentions. As Anderson points out, Wegner makes the same mistake as Libet, namely that of drawing on an oversimplified mode of explanation. Wegner—and Libet—lacks the means to model a <italic>hierarchical</italic> (not linear) <italic>causal structure.</italic> Furthermore, Andersen cites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959354310384759">van Duijn and Bem (2005)</xref> for a comment on Wegner’s work: that he does not make a proper distinction between causation and constituency – that is, in my words, a distinction drawing on the difference between top-down causation/organizing constituted by bottom-up constituents.</p>
<p>I have elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310384759">Bertelsen, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310384759">2005</xref>) argued more in depth that the soft version of determinism and the soft version of libertarianism can, by means of the basic model of intentional activity, be <italic>integrated</italic> in a <italic>genuine</italic> compatibilism. My proposal is that a genuine integration is found in the type of hierarchical models (top-down/bottom-up) of which the basic model presented above is an example. With such a hierarchical model, free-willed phenomena are explained as bottom-up constituted and top-down organized. According to the type of hierarchical models presented here, free will can be determined as <italic>downward-directed vertical organization whereby we direct ourselves at/by our horizontal directedness at/by the world.</italic> In this model of free will we rediscover soft determinism (and as stated above: the causal and functional modes of explanations) bottom-up as the way our intentions are c<italic>onstituted</italic>. Soft libertarianism (and the intentional modes of explanations) is rediscovered top-down as the way in which these constitutive relations are <italic>organized</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959354310384759">Figure 3</xref>). (Regarding hierarchical models and the notion of downward causation, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959354310384759">Bichard &amp; Campbell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959354310384759">Emmeche, Køppe, &amp; Stjernfelt, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959354310384759">Kim, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959354310384759">Moreno &amp; Umerez, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959354310384759">Pattee, 2000</xref>.)</p>

</fig>
<p>This sort of genuine compatibilistic model of free will (building on the action intentional mode of explanation) overcomes soft libertarian metaphysics and the lack of an explanation of how free will can exist in a world of natural dynamics and forces. On the other hand, genuine compatibilism overcomes the type of “compatibilism,” of which soft determinism is an expression, which cannot account for how free will may arise as a “converging point of the deterministic forces.” Let us, for example, have a closer look at the version soft determinism defended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959354310384759">Morse (2007)</xref>.</p>
<p>Again, to paraphrase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959354310384759">Baumeister (2008b)</xref>, we should not search for advanced metaphysical notions of free will (and certainly not Cartesian notions) but do what we as psychologists do best: develop the necessary modes of scientific explanations and theoretical models based on facts. Free will can thereby be found as modes in which nature—in this case human nature—is <italic>organized</italic> in hierarchical structures which emerge as intentions and conscious/free will that differ quite a lot from both libertarian and soft deterministic notions of free will.</p>
<p>The theoretical analysis has shown that it is possible to develop a basic model of human activities as real-world phenomena organized in ways that have to embrace scientific explanations building on intentionality and free will.</p>

<title>The basic model of intentional activity: Intention and negligence</title>
<p>An important test of whether we have constructed a common, basic model for psychology and law is this: can it form the theoretical foundation for psychologically and jurisprudentially meaningful definitions of the five ways in which to attribute a result of criminal actions to a person (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959354310384759">Figure 4</xref>)? The following outline shows how distinctions between different types of actions central to law can be made in terms of the proposed basic model of intentional activity.</p>

<p>The basic model of free will and criminal law (MG is main goal, and PS is prohibited side-effect)</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0959354310384759-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Phrased in terms of the basic model, the first criterion of liability is <italic>a behavior with directedness at/by something in the world (i.e., the prohibited content of the act)</italic>. However, any living creature equipped with a psyche is capable of carrying out such intentional behavior—let us call it horizontal intentionality—but we do not attribute liability to animals on that account. The second criterion of liability is therefore that we can identify the behavior as vertically organized behavior: that is, a free-willed action characterized by <italic>directedness at/by directedness</italic>. This is the simple form of <italic>direct intention (snatching a purse from an elderly woman).</italic> Direct intention is the intentionality of actions that are horizontally directed at/by a main goal (MG in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959354310384759">Figure 4</xref>) with a prohibited content.</p>
<p>The four other types—indirect intention, dolus eventualis, conscious neglect, and unconscious neglect—all differ from direct intention in that the prohibited content is not part of the main goal (which in itself is not prohibited), but is nevertheless present as side-effect. Furthermore, side-effects are <italic>not</italic> accidental. They are part of the entire action which the person performs. They are part of what the person in one way or the other faces because of his/her action or activity, and therefore they are directed <italic>at</italic> and <italic>by some way or another</italic>. The prohibited side-effect (PS in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959354310384759">Figure 4</xref>) is not an irrelevant event but an intentum in a joint, intentional system of actions. So, all four types of actions have the common form of directedness in actions that are horizontally directed at/by the prohibited side-effect.</p>
<p>In the case of <italic>indirect intention</italic> (the intent is only to burn down a house at night but the sleeping residents are killed), the prohibited side-effect is inevitably materialized and is sufficiently organized vertically: that is, organized by reflective directedness at/by directedness. In this sense the horizontal act with the prohibited content is characterized by free will.</p>
<p>In the case of dolus eventualis (knowingly driving a killer to the scene of crime and thereupon helping him to escape), the prohibited side-effect (as opposed to indirect intention) is only possibly materialized and thus with a certain probability, but it is nevertheless sufficiently organized vertically: that is, organized by a reflective directedness at/by directedness. In that sense the horizontal action with the prohibited content is characterized by free will. The person <italic>could</italic> have mobilized all the free-willed, vertical organization of his/her actions and activities, as we routinely can expect of the person, but he/she did not do so and instead chose to accept the prohibited content.</p>
<p>In the case of <italic>conscious neglect</italic> (a shooter takes a risk and fires at another person’s hat but hits his head and kills him), the prohibited side-effect is also only materialized with a certain probability, as was the case with dolus eventualis. Conscious neglect differs from dolus eventualis in that the action that leads to the prohibited side-effect is not sufficiently vertically organized by reflective directedness at/by directedness. Therefore, the horizontal action with the criminal content is only to some extent free-willed—yet free-willed in the sense that one could routinely expect of the person that he/she had reflected on the probability that the side-effect would occur and thus could have been directed differently at/by the directedness of this side-effect. The person would have organized his/her actions and activities differently if he/she had mobilized vertical organization to such an adequately free-willed extent as we routinely can expect.</p>
<p>In the case of <italic>unconscious neglect</italic> (a drunken car driver runs down a child playing in the street), the prohibited side-effect is still intentum in a joint, intentional system of actions, and it is therefore not correct to appraise the prohibited content as an unavoidable coincidence. If a child suddenly runs out in front of a car, it may be impossible for the driver to brake—in which case it is an unavoidable accident. However, if a drunk driver at high speed races into a quiet road and gets involved in a road death, which he could have avoided had he been sober, then it is not correct to call it an unavoidable accident. With unconscious neglect, the prohibited content is not at all organized vertically and not at all free-willed. Even the direct action that could have been directed at/by the main goal (e.g., driving home under the influence of alcohol) is only to a less degree organized vertically. Nonetheless, it is a joint, intentional system of actions. The person could ultimately have wanted it differently. The person <italic>could have wanted</italic> to organize his actions and activities differently if he had mobilized the vertical organization to a sufficiently free-willed extent, as we routinely can expect of this person (first of all, he could have refrained from materializing the main goal—to drive home under the influence of alcohol). This entire system of actions is only to a small extent, and only indirectly free-willed, but nonetheless it is ultimately a non-accidental, intentional, and free-willed system of actions, and the person <italic>could</italic> and <italic>should</italic> have done otherwise.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As stated by several authors: to decline intentionality <italic>ad modum</italic> free-willed and conscious acts as mere illusions may have severe social and societal consequences for human morality and law-abiding activity. Contrary to further promoting of this “illusionist” misunderstanding of intentions and free will caused by too simple modes of explanations and too simple understanding of causational structures in (human) nature, the basic model of intentional activity demonstrates how modern scientific psychology and its more advanced modes of explanations can enter into a genuine scientific non-illusionist understanding of intentional and free-willed human activities.</p>
<p>The basic model suggests that both psychology and law can offer a four-dimensional explanation of the intentional and free will quality of human activity. This four-dimensional explanation is an intentional explanation as opposed to a causal or functionalistic explanation. Actions as intentional connectedness must, horizontally speaking, be explained <italic>socio-dynamically</italic> (outside-in), <italic>psycho-dynamically</italic> (inside-out), <italic>constitution dynamically</italic> (bottom-up), as well as <italic>organization dynamically</italic> (top-down). None of these explanation perspectives can stand alone; none of them can be reduced to any of the others.</p>
<p>As the theoretical analysis will have shown, the concept of actions in the professions of law and psychology (as well in the two sciences, jurisprudence and psychology—or at least the part dealing with human activity <italic>ad modum</italic> criminal conduct) can be made compatible by means of the common basic notion of directedness at/by directedness as the central concept of the common basic model of intentional activity. As mentioned in the beginning, the advantages of common concepts are obvious: the possibility of entering joint knowledge accumulation based on common hypothesis constructions, empirical designs, and modes of theoretical modeling of human activity patterns found in common data.</p>

<p>Examples of this approach are <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354310384759">Cloward and Ohlin (1960)</xref>, who claim that crime is frustrated reactions to different societal opportunities. The social control model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959354310384759">Hirschi (1969)</xref> points to lack of inner containment: If society fails to present external controls and norms, no self-control can be internalized. Bandura’s social learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959354310384759">1986</xref>) is built on the hypothesis that most behavior (that goes for crime as well) is learned by observation of models. Further examples to designate this approach (although, of course, from different traditions) are <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959354310384759">Elliott, Huizinga, and Ageton (1985)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0959354310384759">J.Q.
