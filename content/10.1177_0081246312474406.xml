<abstract>
<p>The impact of transpersonal psychology techniques as a treatment in burnout prevention interventions for teachers has not been studied in South Africa. This quantitative research study utilised a pre- and post-test quasi-experimental design using the Beck Anxiety Inventory to measure anxiety and the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory to measure personal, work, and client dimensions of burnout. Thirty educators, who were HIV/AIDS coordinators in their schools located in South Metro, Western Cape, received 6 days of Capacitar training between March and September 2009, based on transpersonal psychology practices. These workshops were initially developed by Dr Pat Cane, who founded Capacitar International, California, USA, in her engagement with trauma and burnout survivors in 35 countries. While the pre-test means of the intervention and control groups of teachers were similar on the Beck Anxiety Inventory and Copenhagen Burnout Inventory measures, there were significant reductions (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) in anxiety, personal, and work burnout in the post-test measures of the intervention group. There were also significant differences (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) in anxiety, personal, work, and client burnout of teachers between the intervention and control groups. The results of this study suggest that transpersonal psychological techniques could be an effective treatment in burnout prevention interventions in this teacher sample.</p>

<body>
<p>This study of teacher burnout is located in the broad context where action is sought to prevent the alarming measures of stress being experienced. This is a critical time in the choices being made for a sustainable world; action needs to be taken to slow the damage to the Earth and its people; structural causes of disease and destruction need to be analysed with new alternatives considered; and there is a fundamental shift in worldview and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0081246312474406">Macey, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>An intimate collaboration between science and praxis is needed for a lively, vibrant partnership capable of generating innovative therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0081246312474406">Levine, 2010</xref>). There is a need for open multidisciplinary efforts to help discern what is effective or not and achieve the primary aim of helping suffering people heal. As a result of the disempowering effects of colonialism and globalism on many communities throughout the world, especially in contexts of adversity or oppression, there is a need for a change in psychological attitudes, practice, and commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0081246312474406">Watkins &amp; Shulman, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Transpersonal psychology offers an alternative to the Cartesian paradigm, challenging traditional views of mental health and psychotherapy, drawing on cross-cultural insights, suited to indigenous and holistic approaches to healing and managing stress. Emphasis is on health improvement through body treatments affecting heart coherency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0081246312474406">McCraty, Atkinson, &amp; Tomasino, 2001</xref>), achieving mind-altered states of consciousness and heightened spiritual awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0081246312474406">Institute of Transpersonal Psychology [ITP], 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In South African education, a burnout crisis among educators is becoming pandemic, demonstrated by alarming national statistics. In all, 55% of educators have considered resigning due to inadequate remuneration, increased workload, lack of career development, lack of professional recognition, dissatisfaction with work policies, and job insecurity, according to the Human Science Research Council (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0081246312474406">HSRC, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The South African Democratic Teachers’ Union (SADTU) has expressed concern about the well-being of teachers and commissioned research in 2010 to find the causes of stress. A Teacher Well-being in SA Public Schools Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0081246312474406">SADTU, 2010</xref>) pointed out that South Africa needs 33,000 teachers by 2015. Main findings of this survey are that teachers are key people supporting learner care and development and that teachers and school support systems need strengthening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0081246312474406">SADTU, 2010</xref>). However, large numbers of teachers are leaving the profession due to contract termination, resignation, and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0081246312474406">HSRC, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Transpersonal psychological insights and practices facilitated in psycho-educational group interventions for stress and burnout can contribute to sustainable and creative modes of coping in high-risk, low socio-economic communities, including schools. This study considers the plight of teachers in the challenging context of the Cape Flats, Western Cape, South Africa.</p>
<sec id="section1-0081246312474406">
<title>Teacher stress and burnout</title>
<p>Teacher stress has been described as the perception of an imbalance between demands at school and the resources teachers have for coping with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0081246312474406">Wood &amp; McCarthy, 2002</xref>). Stress symptoms include anxiety, frustration, poor performance, and disrupted interpersonal relationships at work and home. Experienced over a long period of time, stress may result in burnout indicating a change in tolerance for continual stress, ‘a tolerance that gradually wears away under the never-ending onslaught of emotional tensions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0081246312474406">Maslach, 1982</xref>, p. 11).</p>
<p>Burnout, with a loss of idealism and enthusiasm for work as a result of unmet needs, is considered to be a disability, which results in teachers performing far below their potential, despite being well prepared and committed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0081246312474406">Gold &amp; Roth, 2003</xref>). Feelings of isolation and depersonalisation increase over time unless action is taken. Stressors in the workplace and in personal lives can lead to adverse lifestyle behaviours, having a negative impact on mental and physical health over prolonged periods of time. Anxiety, stress, and burnout can lead to psychopathologies such as acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, with symptoms of, for example, social withdrawal, chronic depression, pessimism, and cynicism.</p>
<p>As a result of the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in South Africa and particularly in the schools context, prevention programmes have been introduced in the school curriculum, and teachers volunteer, or are assigned, to take on the role of HIV/AIDS coordination in the schools. These teachers are exposed to additional stressors not normally encountered in the profession. Those that are involved, devoted, and conscientious are particularly susceptible to burnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0081246312474406">Rudow, 1999</xref>). Motivated by social caring and helping motives, HIV/AIDS coordinators are at risk of stress and burnout.</p>
<p>The Cape Flats context of South Metro teachers working in post-apartheid conditions in South Africa includes factors of poverty, crime, violence, substance abuse, and child neglect that have been present in schools and wider society for multiple generations. The impact of multiple types of trauma to which teachers are exposed needs to be taken into consideration in any approach to healing. The history of trauma in our lives, families, and our culture is carried in our unconscious memory, and this accumulating effect poses a threat to our health and well-being. It needs to be exposed, addressed, understood, and released on both a collective and a personal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0081246312474406">Mines, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Teachers who serve as HIV/AIDS coordinators are particularly susceptible to high levels of stress and trauma. In addition to taking responsibility for the implementation of Department of Education HIV/AIDS programmes in schools, HIV/AIDS coordinators are expected to be responsible for initial liaison with learners and/or fellow educators who have the disease and affected family members who are part of the school community. In fulfilling their duties, HIV/AIDS coordinators may have to deal with illness, suffering, and death.</p>
<p>In carrying out challenging tasks, these educators run the risk of suffering from secondary traumatisation or compassion fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0081246312474406">Figley, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0081246312474406">McCann &amp; Saakvitne, 1995</xref>). Work-related stress has been described as demands of the job that affect other settings as well, needing caregiver resilience to cope with this stress naturally or through the help of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0081246312474406">Figley, 1995</xref>). While there are different degrees of ability to tolerate exposure to stressors, work focusing on emotional suffering invariably has a debilitating effect on the individual.</p>

<title>Transpersonal approach to healing</title>
<p>‘Capacitar’ is a Spanish word meaning to empower, to bring to life. Capacitar transpersonal psychology workshops focus on enhancing spiritual awareness through exercises designed to assist in the healing process. Spirituality as a protective factor to health has been studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0081246312474406">Simpson (2005)</xref>. Spirituality has been linked to higher self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0081246312474406">Koenig, 1999</xref>) and a greater sense of well-being and satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0081246312474406">Ellison, 1998</xref>). Failure to address spiritual needs can put emotional well-being at risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0081246312474406">Morgan, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Transpersonal psychology draws on the work of Jung, Frankl, Maslow and Assagioli, who emphasised wholeness and well-being. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0081246312474406">ITP (2008)</xref>, the term originated in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0081246312474406">Jung (1959)</xref>, who coined transpersonal unconscious as a synonym for the collective unconscious, which he identified as the source of life and vitality. Transpersonal practices, such as mindfulness, breath work, and visualisation, elicit a sense of calm and safety and facilitate heart coherence, the benefits of which have been scientifically documented by the Institute of HeartMath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0081246312474406">McCraty et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Heart rate variability, or heart rhythm, reflects inner emotional states and stress. On the one hand, negative emotions lead to increased disorder in the heart’s rhythms and in the autonomic nervous system, which adversely affects the rest of the body. On the other hand, positive emotions increase harmony and coherence in heart rhythms and improve balance in the nervous system. Health implications are that disharmony in the nervous system leads to inefficiency and increased stress on the heart and other organs, while harmonious rhythms are more efficient and less stressful to the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0081246312474406">McCraty et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The transpersonal psychology definition of wholeness includes good physical health, emotional balance, mental clarity, and spiritual well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0081246312474406">Cane, 2000</xref>). It has been described as a psychology that focuses on the power of inner wisdom and a heightened awareness, which includes the soul (R. Frager, personal communication, 24 March 2012). Working at the subtle level of the soul has been described as going beyond the definitions of empathy to linking, which ‘is a new kind of being,… which goes much deeper … it is more about being than doing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0081246312474406">Rowan, 2003</xref>, p. 226). Healing involves a deeper change in the whole system – from the person and their relationships to the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0081246312474406">Cane, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In the schools’ context, introducing teachers to transpersonal practices should not only facilitate deep connection with mind, body, and emotions but also equip them with a set of tools for use in the classroom. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0081246312474406">ITP (2008)</xref>, the use of non-ordinary states of consciousness, deep insight, and spiritual practice for healing can be used effectively in the overcoming of burnout among caring professionals. The ITP states that many professional psychologists are beginning to recognise the importance of knowledge of spirituality and how it interfaces with psychology. In considering the nature of the service profession, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0081246312474406">Davis (2000)</xref> believes that deeper caring and more emotional and transpersonal involvement between professionals and those being served will reduce burnout and promote growth in both those being cared for as well as caregivers.</p>

<title>Research question</title>
<p>With the high rate of attrition, stress, and burnout among professional staff, the Department of Education is searching for practical ways to assist teachers to perform optimally. Within this context, the primary research question is as follows: Are transpersonal psychology practices effective as a treatment for burnout in prevention interventions in the specified teacher population?</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section5-0081246312474406">
<title>Demographics of intervention and control groups</title>
<p>The participants were selected through convenience sampling, being volunteers who enlisted in the training. The majority of educators taking part in the study were women, married, Christian, and designated as Coloured. They taught mostly in primary schools from Grade 1–7 (Table 1). The intervention group comprised educators working in the Mitchells Plain area of South Metro, Western Cape Education Department. Thirty volunteers started the training, with 27 completing the workshops. The control group comprised 27 teachers who worked in the adjacent Central Metro, coming from schools in areas such as Hanover Park, Athlone, and Manenberg.</p>
<p>All these schools can broadly be described as being located in a low-income part of the Cape Flats, where there are high levels of unemployment, crime, and violence. This is an area originally demarcated for ‘Cape Coloureds’ in forced removals by the apartheid government during 1950–1980. Under notorious Pass Laws and the Group Areas Act, people designated as non-White (Black or Coloured) were relocated to this flat, sandy stretch of land to the south-east of the central business district of Cape Town. It has been described as ‘the dumping ground of the ’50s’ by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0081246312474406">Bergman (2011)</xref>, who points out that while these communities are no longer restricted since the end of apartheid by racial discrimination, history, language, economics, and ethnic politics still contribute to the homogeneity of local areas.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0081246312474406">Beck &amp; Steer, 1993</xref>) and the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0081246312474406">Kristensen &amp; Borritz, 1999</xref>) were utilised to assess anxiety and burnout levels of the intervention and control groups. The BAI is a multiple-choice, self-report inventory consisting of 21 questions that is used for measuring the severity of an individual’s anxiety by listing symptoms such as numbness, feeling hot, and unable to relax. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0081246312474406">Piotrowski’s (1999)</xref> review found the BAI to be the third most used research measure of anxiety, behind the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Fear Survey Schedule. In South Africa, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0081246312474406">Steele (2003)</xref> assessed the development and validation of the Xhosa translations of the BAI in South Africa, finding concurrent, convergent, and discriminant validity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0081246312474406">Kagee and Le Roux (2009)</xref> found good reliability and validity with the BAI, supported by samples worldwide, in a study of psychological distress among South African patients living with hypertension and diabetes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0081246312474406">Van Dam, Sheppard, Forsyth, and Earleywine (2011)</xref> also reported that the BAI had good reliability and validity across numerous populations, including a South African sample, with high internal consistency (α = .93). Internal consistency of pre-test BAI items in this study was measured with Cronbach’s α, which yielded a good reliability score of .93.</p>
<p>The CBI consists of personal (CBIP), work-related (CBIW), and client burnout (CBIC) scales with questions such as ‘How often do you feel tired?’ (personal burnout), ‘Is your work emotionally exhausting’ (work burnout), and ‘Do you find it hard to work with children’ (client burnout). It has been found to have acceptable reliability (internal consistency and homogeneity) as well as factorial and criterion-related validity in a sample of secondary teachers in New Zealand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0081246312474406">Milfont, Denny, Ameratunga, Robinson, &amp; Merry, 2007</xref>). A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0081246312474406">Smit (2011)</xref> to test the suitability of the CBI as a valid and reliable measure for burnout in South Africa found high internal reliability for personal burnout (α = 0.94) and client-related burnout (α = 0.91). It was recommended that additional items based on withdrawal should be added to the work-related burnout scale. In this study, Cronbach’s α reliability score for CBI personal burnout pre-test measure was .85, work burnout was .87, and client burnout was .82, indicating good internal consistency reliability.</p>
<p>This study utilised a quasi-experimental pre- and post-comparative group design to evaluate whether transpersonal techniques significantly mediated anxiety and burnout in HIV/AIDS coordinator teachers. Two equivalent groups were established from HIV teacher coordinators in the South and Central metros of the Western Cape, and stress and burnout levels were measured at pre- and post-intervention phases for both intervention and control groups. We used <italic>t</italic> tests to assess for pre-test differences between the two groups and for the pre- and post-tests within groups on anxiety and burnout measures. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed at post-test, with pre-test scores as the covariate, to investigate the significance of difference between the mean scores of the intervention and control groups on the BAI and CBI personal, work, and burnout measures. Data from quantitative measures were gathered and analysed, using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) computer software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0081246312474406">Field, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>While random selection of the sample is the best way to ensure external validity, this was not feasible due to differing time schedules and commitments of participants from different metros. As far as effect of pre-testing on post-testing was concerned, 6 months separated the completion of questionnaires, which meant that participants were unable to recall previous responses. Considering the effect of pre-tests on the treatment, the intervention group might have been more motivated to engage with the workshop activities after the pre-tests, as there was a low attrition rate for this group.</p>
<p>The need to protect the rights and privacy of HIV/AIDS coordinator teachers was considered, as well as their vulnerability, given the study’s focus on stress and burnout. Signed consent was obtained from participants, with anonymity being assured through the use of referral codes and security passwords accessing information. Referral options were also given in the event of any adverse reaction, although this did not prove necessary during workshops. As the principal researcher and participants came from different cultural and race groups, the culture, language, beliefs, and customs of participants were actively processed during the workshops. The participants were encouraged to complete the training, but the right to withdraw at any time was respected, without any reason being given or any negative consequences.</p>
<p>Material covered in the six workshops included personal check in, Tai Chi, breath work, acupressure points, finger holds, emotional freedom technique, safe space meditation, hand massage, head/neck/shoulder release, Pal Dan Gum exercises, boundaries and protection, map of human consciousness, song/dance, and closing circle of healing. (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0081246312474406">Johnson, 2010</xref>, for a detailed description of the workshop content.)</p>

<p>To investigate the significance of differences between the pre- and post-test means for the intervention group, paired sample <italic>t</italic> tests were carried out, with anxiety and burnout as the two dependent variables. The post-test anxiety mean score of the participants was significantly lower after the transpersonal intervention (<italic>M</italic> = 8.56, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.92) than before the intervention (<italic>M</italic> = 16.48, <italic>SD</italic> = 10.80), with <italic>t</italic>(26) = 3.75, <italic>p</italic> = .001.</p>
<p>Similarly, personal burnout scores were significantly lower after the intervention (<italic>M</italic> = 38.80, <italic>SD</italic> = 13.37) than before the intervention (<italic>M</italic> = 49.22, <italic>SD</italic> = 14.80), with <italic>t</italic>(26) = 3.93, <italic>p</italic> = .001, and work burnout scores were also significantly lower after the intervention (<italic>M</italic> = 43.74, <italic>SD</italic> = 14.61) than before the intervention (<italic>M</italic> = 45.77, <italic>SD</italic> = 17.72), with <italic>t</italic>(26) = 4.15, <italic>p</italic> = .000.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Capacitar workshops aim to foster systemic healing in communities at risk of burnout by offering transpersonal psychology techniques as treatment in prevention intervention. Burnout affects the whole person, and it is therefore very debilitating, affecting functioning in various spheres of the individual’s life. In addressing the mental, physical, and spiritual needs of the individual, transpersonal psychological techniques offer simple practices for teachers to use not only for themselves but also to engage with others, including learners in the classroom.</p>
<p>The findings of the study indicate that transpersonal workshops presented in a psycho-educational support group format to HIV/AIDS teacher coordinators have the effect of significantly reducing anxiety levels and burnout levels. There were, however, significant limitations to the study. The sample was very small, drawn from a specific metro on the Cape Flats. Random assignment was not possible given logistical constraints. There were variances between the intervention and control groups, with most notably gender differences. The control group had five men, while the experimental group comprised entirely of women. However, as women have been found to be more susceptible to anxiety and burnout than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0081246312474406">Cremades &amp; Wiggins, 2007</xref>), any improved differences in measures between the two groups would indicate effectiveness of transpersonal practices, given this greater susceptibility. Lower CBI personal and work burnout scores for the control group at year end could indicate a tendency for educators to become less stressed as the academic year draws to an end, regardless of exposure to interventions.</p>
<p>It has been pointed out that stress management training should not exonerate organisations of their responsibility to improve working conditions leading to stress and burnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0081246312474406">Dunham &amp; Varma, 1998</xref>). The Department of Education does indeed need to take cognisance of the challenges facing HIV/AIDS coordinator teachers on a daily basis and devise realistic, practical solutions for conditions that could lead to stress and burnout. It was beyond the scope of this study, however, to address systemic challenges in the schools.</p>
<p>The results of this limited study show significant anxiety, personal and work burnout reductions in the intervention group, and significant differences pre- to post-testing between the intervention and control groups on all measures of anxiety and burnout. This trend supports findings in the literature that a transpersonal approach to healing can reduce levels of burnout among those in the caring profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0081246312474406">Davis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0081246312474406">ITP, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0081246312474406">Montgomery, 1991</xref>). In Capacitar workshops, educators attempted to improve health by taking part in physical, emotional, and spiritual activities. In all these activities, there is an increase in self-awareness, considered crucial in the reduction of stress and burnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0081246312474406">Gold &amp; Roth, 2003</xref>) and an improvement in heart coherency, resulting in less work and personal burnout. A personal sense of efficacy and optimism develops with repetition of successful problem-focused coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0081246312474406">Savicki, 2002</xref>). Personal and work burnout reduction indicated the areas that transpersonal psychology practices could be considered as a preventive treatment in this teacher cohort.</p>
<p>The study should be replicated with a larger sample and using random assignment (which was not possible in the context of this study) and comparison made to other burnout intervention modalities to confirm findings. Qualitative research can also be used to help teachers identify which aspects of the transpersonal workshops were perceived as particularly meaningful.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to assess whether a transpersonal psychology–based intervention could be effective in a group of HIV/AIDS teacher coordinators to reduce their anxiety and levels of burnout. In many schools in disadvantaged areas of South Africa, the educator is the adult who can be a solid anchor for the child. Maintaining teacher health and preventing burnout should be a priority for the Department of Education, not only for the sake of the teachers but also for the learners. The quantitative findings indicated that transpersonal practices can assist in reducing levels of anxiety and burnout in a sample of HIV/AIDS coordinator teachers who work in low-income communities, where there are complex social and economic challenges.</p>
