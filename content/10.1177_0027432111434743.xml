<abstract>
<p>Excellent musical ensembles have a strong sense of communal identity among the participants. Because of scheduling challenges and performance priorities, it is difficult to build camaraderie during rehearsal time other than through music making. This article explores the processes, benefits, and challenges of implementing a writing component in an ensemble for the purposes of building camaraderie and assessing individuals. The writing component described here is used with a joint community/prison choir consisting of college students, community members, and prisoners. Ideas are included for teacher-conductors who want to develop their musicians’ learning through invitations to write. Activities involved in this project may include scripts for concert introductions, program notes, creative writing explorations, concepts to share during rehearsal, and interdisciplinary teaching.</p>

<p>How can ensemble directors knit their groups closer together? Here are some ideas that have proven effective.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>One of the characteristics of an excellent musical ensemble is an inclusive sense of communal identity within the ensemble. Participants enjoy warm feelings of social interaction, a sense of belonging, and strong internal motivation for involvement and recruitment when communal identity develops within a musical group. Whereas communal identity often emerges as a result of consistently well-organized rehearsals and a series of successful performances, the pressure to prepare for contests and performances and the time constraints that such preparation entails often hinder the director’s ability to build community. Directors may resort to the most efficient means of preparing performances, adopting an autocratic style that impedes the performers’ full participation in the community and prohibits interactions with one another. To alleviate these undesired outcomes, directors need to find ways to prioritize community building in spite of pressures to focus only on musical preparation.</p>
<p>In our mixed choir, called the Oakdale Community Choir (OCC), comprising thirty male inmates of a medium-security prison and thirty community members, time constraints and high levels of social regulation within the prison where we rehearse have motivated us to seek alternative ways to build community, including a writing component. Our writing component was designed to function as a tool for building communal identity and for encouraging self-assessment of learning among the performers. This type of writing component also fulfills National Standard 8, “Understanding relationships between music, the other arts, and disciplines outside the arts,” and other mandates for integration with academic subjects and writing across the curriculum.</p>
<p>Researchers have examined both the use of writing as a means to improve music-learning processes among students in upper-elementary-age classrooms and the use of writing as a reflective strategy to improve music teaching.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0027432111434743">1</xref></sup> Mitchell Robinson, an associate professor of music education at Michigan State University, East Lansing, suggests that students in ensembles keep journals to record thoughts, questions, hopes, and dreams related to their experiences in the group as well as to suggest ways the ensemble’s performance quality and learning can be improved.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0027432111434743">2</xref></sup> Patricia O’Toole lists some ideas for brief writing assignments to help the director get to know individual ensemble members.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0027432111434743">3</xref></sup> However, few to no publications examine the process of integrating a writing component into a musical ensemble for the purposes of both assessment and building camaraderie.</p>
<p>This article offers (1) a description of the purposes for integrating writing into the OCC; (2) a description of the processes and practices of writing components built into the choir; (3) pedagogical implications of the writing activities, including their use of differentiated instruction that satisfies some language-learning literacy mandates; and (4) ideas about how to introduce and realize the potentials and benefits of a writing component within instrumental and choral ensembles.</p>
<sec id="section1-0027432111434743">
<title>Why Writing?</title>
<p>My goals for using a writing component with the Oakdale community/prison choir are (1) to encourage participants to examine their experiences of singing through reflective writing in response to prompts that call for self-assessment and focused attention to elements of music, (2) to build camaraderie through written exchanges among participants, and (3) to provide opportunities for individualized instruction when members communicate directly with me about difficulties with musical learning and performing. I hoped that writing would offer choir members a medium for building musical and social relationships apart from simply practicing and performing together.</p>
<p>In practice, the plan looks like this: Each week I distribute a two- to six-item “menu” of writing choices via e-mail to the community members of the choir and as a hard copy to the choir members in prison. I encourage them to explore one of these topics in depth through writing, although they are welcome to explore more than one topic. I also invite them to contribute their own prompts. They can write as little or as much as they would like to, and I encourage all to participate. If they wish to exchange with another random person in the group, they place their writing in a basket labeled “Writing to Exchange.” They can also put their writing in another basket that is meant for me alone. If they brought writing to exchange, at the end of rehearsal, they pick up someone else’s writing, take it with them to read and respond, and return that page to my basket the following week. I read all the writing and responses, indicate that I have read them, and usually include a short note to each writer. Writers also have the option to share their writing with the full group through a choir newsletter. Those who wish to share their writing in this way indicate so at the top of their paper. After I have read and responded to each piece, I give them to a volunteer, who takes excerpts from the writing and creates newsletters that the whole chorus receives after approval from the prison administration.</p>
<p>Specific outcomes of the writing include chorister-written introductions for songs, lyrics for chorister-composed songs, a chorister-generated name for the choir during the inaugural semester, and articles for the <italic>Iowa City Press Citizen</italic>’s “Community Music” column. Additionally, writers have demonstrated reflective thinking about themselves and their musical experiences, both inside and outside the choir. One community member reflected on the lyrics of a song titled “May the Stars Remember My Name,” written by a prisoner member who reflected on the fact that he has not seen the stars since he has been incarcerated. The community member wrote,</p>

<p>I have had the same experience with land. Whenever I visit my hometown, I drink in the landscape as I get closer. The land is perfectly flat for long stretches, and it bakes under 360 degrees of unbroken sky. When I step out of the car, I smell the frying grass, I feel the higher pressure of being closer to sea level and the powerful gusts of wind that have nothing in their way. I take this all in, and I could swear that the land remembers the touch of my feet, and welcomes me back. I grip the insides of my shoes with my toes in a sort of hug—hello, again, friend. I remember you, too.</p>

<p>A prisoner member shared the following reflection about the song we sing at the end of each rehearsal:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Though I enjoy most every aspect of our weekly choir rehearsals, the closing, “May You Walk in Beauty” has a special place in my heart. To me, it seems as though we are all bidding one another farewell, or au revoir (’til we meet again), after having come together for a time of sharing something very special. Even though I may not have the opportunity each week to have a meaningful conversation with everyone that was present for rehearsal, I can still send them a message from my heart as I sing with them and look into their eyes, giving them a little part of me to take with them for their journey back out into the <italic>real</italic> world.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>John Dewey suggested that reflection is in direct opposition to routine thought.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0027432111434743">4</xref></sup> It means taking time out—standing apart from normal activities to reflect and think about something that has already occurred. A consistent writing practice can help awaken people from their ordinary habits of thinking and encourage new approaches to routine activities or established disciplines. In a discipline as personal and as aural as music-making, particularly, choral singing, writing can serve as a medium for reflection on the music-making process and one’s own approach to that process. Moreover, because choral singing has the “word factor”—nearly all choral arrangements contain words—writing about the relationships between the singers and the sung text offers an opportunity to deepen reflection about the choir and its performance pieces.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0027432111434743">5</xref></sup> In designing the writing component, I therefore hoped to foster reflective opportunities by putting in place a system that asks choir members to think about the words they are singing during rehearsals and performances and to learn about their fellow choir members’ perceptions of their shared choral experiences.</p>
<p>I discovered in implementing this writing component with the community/prison choir that teaching and learning advantages arising from individual assessment and interaction among members are well worth the efforts of implementing and sustaining it. Multiple demographics and realities of large ensembles create a need to address learner variance in music classrooms. When teachers start where the learners are, and modify learning tasks to meet variance in students’ interests, readiness, and learning profiles, they more ably encourage motivated and meaningful learning. The term <italic>differentiated instruction</italic> denotes such an individualized learning process. Teachers who use this approach are responsive to the specific learning needs of each individual rather than relying on a “one-size-fits-all” method.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0027432111434743">6</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>University of Iowa professors Carol Severino and Cinda Coggins Mosher suggest that writing prompts viewed as “invitations,” where writers respond to the invitation prompts as they wish, work best in the context of a relationship between writer and reader. In these writing exchanges, ideally the writers’ goals are focused on communicating ideas rather than completing an assignment. Invitations to write function as diagnostic tools that give the teacher information about the learners’ backgrounds, strengths, weaknesses, and interests. This process allows instructors to develop individualized instruction as they learn these specific details about their learners and apply them to the writing prompts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0027432111434743">7</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Granted, such individualization is difficult in group ensemble settings. When designing a writing component for a musical ensemble, teacher-conductors can differentiate by asking the students to create possible writing topics, thereby accessing student interest and increasing student motivation for writing. To give the students more options for participation, teacher-conductors could suggest alternatives, such as drawing or creating comic strips, that depict their answers to the writing choices. These practices are clear examples of facilitating students’ understanding of relationships between music, the other arts, and disciplines outside the arts (National Standard 8).</p>

<title>Going High-Tech</title>
<p>Jason Vodicka, choral director at Pennsbury High School in Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania, uses a writing program with his learners to help him know them as individuals, provide an outlet for students’ musical and textual interpretations, and present rehearsal reflections. He has large choirs of more than eighty students, so the initial “getting-to-know-you” writing assignments at the beginning of the year help him learn names. He originally used paper journals, but recently created a Ning network—a Facebook-like social networking website that allows access only to members of the choir. The students respond well to the online network, and the website streamlines Vodicka’s paperwork and organization. At the beginning of the year, he posts weekly writing assignments, and as the year progresses, he uses the Ning network less often.</p>
<p>Two topics Vodicka has asked his students to write about are the challenges they are experiencing in rehearsals and how they would rehearse a particular piece if they were the conductor. One of his students responded to this second prompt by writing, “One of the things I like that Mr. Vodicka does that I would try my best to emulate would be to try to get the chorus into the movements, and warm-ups. Another thing I would do that Mr. Vodicka I think does really well is trying to hear what different people’s opinions on a piece we heard, piece we sang, or even piece we saw. I feel the peer involvement that we do helps us put more of our heart in anything we sing or do.” These writing exchanges help Vodicka understand what his students are thinking about rehearsals, and they give the students a sense of ownership in the choir because they are sharing their own musical ideas directly with the instructor.</p>
<p>These interactions help the director know what the members are thinking, and also help the members know what the director is thinking. In responding to a prompt asking prison choir members to describe what the experience of the writing component had been like for them, one of the prison choir members wrote, “I’ve only written a couple of times, although I carefully read and ponder all the writing prompts created by Dr. Cohen. They are wonderful, creative, and spark ideas and conversations that take the choir experience to whole new levels. They also provide insights into what the director’s context is and what the director thinks is important, including restorative justice. It helps insiders and outsiders see things from a new, shared perspective that they otherwise would never experience.” Such interactions outside of the rehearsal space between director and members allow the choral learning to go deeper than the usual interactions that occur during rehearsals.</p>

<sec id="section3-0027432111434743">
<title>Implications for Teaching</title>
<p>A benefit of such a writing program in an ensemble setting is its service as a communication channel between a teacher-conductor and individual participants. The context of a full-ensemble practice makes it difficult for directors to assess individual members’ musicianship, limited rehearsal time often prohibits extensive work with individual musicians, and participants may fear being singled out for tutorial work during full rehearsals. Appropriate writing prompts, however, offer opportunities for individuals to communicate their strengths and limitations directly to the teacher-conductor in writing. In the OCC, the writing component provided me some fairly detailed accounts of what singers do and do not know and understand about choral music, thus extending to some degree my capacity to evaluate and appropriately respond to choir members’ musical learning. For example, one choir member wrote of his difficulties understanding intervals and rhythm: “Last week you were talking about a note being one-fifth higher or lower or something, and I’m totally lost.” He went on to say, “You had an assignment where we were supposed to put a dot under the words of a song where the beat is . . . <italic>no comprende</italic> . . . I don’t understand it or get it.” After reading these comments, I added a “musical tidbits” section at the bottom of the writing prompts to explain basic elements of music. I also took more time during practice to explain various musical concepts to the choir members.</p>
<p>Writing also offers occasions for ensemble members to reflect upon their musicianship even when they are not actively making music. Pausing to examine and describe their own strengths and shortcomings, assess their own musical knowledge, and think about music in new ways may help some learners self-identify more confidently or profoundly as musicians, or to be more attentive of their development as musicians. One prisoner in the choir reflected on his personal growth in relationship to singing in the choir: “Singing in the Oakdale Prison Community Choir has made me more confident and aware of myself and my surroundings through positive encouragement, group participation (learning to work together), and communication, which I believe to be a step toward my rehabilitation. My participation in the choir has also improved my skills as a musician, in writing songs, and in music appreciation.” Writing about music also gives the learners opportunities to expand their own awareness of music in their lives. A community member reflected, “I wrote about birdsongs that I could hear through the open windows of my study at home. Writing about the birds made me listen to them more closely, and I started to hear them as an improvisational choir.” In addition to increased opportunities to communicate directly with the teacher-conductor, writing extends the participants’ capacity to learn through structured reflection.</p>
<p>Finally, the early stages of this experiment of using writing within the choir suggest that publication can affect the development of communal spirit in an ensemble by mediating connections not simply among <italic>musicians</italic> but among <italic>people</italic>. By offering an additional channel for interaction within and beyond the membership of the choir (the choir “newsletter”), writing has broadened the range of communal identity available to all singers. Not only do the writing activities invite both groups of singers to interact with one another on the page, but various forms of publication also extend the possibilities of communal identification beyond the walls of the rehearsal room and even outside the prison itself. In addition to in-house publication of choir newsletters that are shared with supervisory prison staff and may be available on a casual basis to inmates who are not members of the choir, my implementation of songwriting activities and prompts resulted in public concert performances of twenty original compositions by choir members working independently and with me (I offered assistance with melodic composition and notation, and a graduate student assisted with musical composition on two of these songs). The CD recordings from these concerts were distributed to prisoner participants and their selected family members and were made available for community participants. In this form of publication, the choral voices of the group amplify the writing voices of individuals and broadcast their words beyond the limitations of the choir rehearsals. We now invite audience members to respond to the concert in writing, share their writing with the director, and indicate whether they wish to share their writing or not.</p>
<p>Other choirs and instrumental ensembles might similarly benefit from writing and publication activities, though the mechanisms for organizing these would have to be appropriately adapted to the specific context and community in which the group practices and performs. Vocal or instrumental sections, for instance, could take turns editing and publishing sectional newsletters in successive months (a soprano or a woodwind newsletter in September, alto or double reed newsletter in November, tenor or brass newsletter in February, and bass or percussion newsletter in April, for example). These shared writing activities speed up the process of getting to know one another in the ensemble. Additionally, students who are shy may have difficulty expressing themselves face-to-face. This type of structured writing activity gives them a different outlet to communicate. When the teacher-conductor reads quotes from a particular member’s writing to the whole ensemble, it may build self-confidence in that person and help other members get to know him or her. However, jealousy and charges of favoritism may result if the teacher-conductor does not read an example of everyone’s writing. With this negative potential in mind, the teacher-conductor needs to establish a system for making sure that everyone’s writing has been shared at some point. It may be appropriate to share some students’ quotes anonymously, and it is important to be aware of how sharing these pieces affects student interactions.</p>
<p>Another important step when implementing a writing program in an ensemble is creating an encouraging atmosphere rather than forcing participants to write. Musicians who are mandated to write may object, causing the teacher-conductor’s intentions to backfire. Teacher-conductors must know their learners well and figure out attractive ways to implement a writing component. Perhaps giving learners a variety of options in how they respond, such as cartooning, drawing, songwriting, fictional writing about a particular composition, or writing in other forms, such as poetry or rap, may help ensemble members be more excited to participate. The implementation of structured <italic>individualized</italic> expression, such as a writing program, within a musical ensemble is different from the basic aim of traditional score-based <italic>group</italic> ensemble performance; however, it might assist the group in its communal development in special ways not accessible through performance alone.</p>
<p>Although school and community musical ensembles operate in different contexts than a prison choir, a well-designed writing component may add depth to the learning and camaraderie of any ensemble. Musicians have their own unique and specific gifts and needs that can be discovered and acknowledged through writing. The purposes, processes, and prompts of an ensemble writing component must reflect and address the special needs of the particular group to which it is introduced. Future practice and research should continue to examine the potential benefits and drawbacks of implementing writing activities in various musical settings and should test new processes for carrying them out. Of particular potential value are further investigations of how writing experiences enhance or limit members’ capacities to increase musical awareness between rehearsals and develop a sense of belonging within the ensemble’s communal identity.</p>
