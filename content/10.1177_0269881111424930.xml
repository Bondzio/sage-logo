<abstract>
<p>Shortly after stress, limbic neurons are exposed to high levels of noradrenaline and corticosterone. These hormones are necessary for optimal behavioural adaptation. Behavioural effects critically depend on noradrenaline acting via β-adrenergic receptors, but these effects are strongly modulated by corticosterone, indicating putative interactions between the two hormones. Since both noradrenaline and corticosterone are known to quickly affect properties of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPAR), we here examined – in hippocampal neurons – three parameters which give insight in the functionality of AMPARs: phosphorylation, surface expression and spontaneous synaptic transmission. In homogenates of adult hippocampal slices, application of corticosterone (30 nM for 15 min) by itself did not affect phosphorylation of the AMPAR GluA1 subunit at S845 or S831. Co-application of the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (10 µM) largely increased S845 (but not S831) phosphorylation. Corticosterone also did not change GluA1 and GluA2 surface expression in hippocampal primary cultures. However, combined administration of corticosterone and 1 µM isoproterenol – which by itself was ineffective – enhanced surface expression. Interestingly, 10 µM isoproterenol alone enhanced GluA1 surface expression, but this was decreased by corticosterone. Finally, in hippocampal primary cultures, the inter-event interval of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) was decreased by the combination of 1 µM isoproterenol and corticosterone (which were ineffective by themselves) while the same combination did not affect the amplitude. We conclude that AMPAR phosphorylation, surface expression and mEPSC inter-event interval respond most strongly to a combination of corticosterone and β-adrenergic receptors. These combined hormonal effects on glutamate transmission might contribute to their memory-enhancing effects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Stress in rodents causes rapid activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Via the vagal nerve and the nucleus tractus solitarius (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269881111424930">Williams and McGaugh, 1993</xref>) and by direct activation of the locus coeruleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269881111424930">Valentino and Van Bockstaele, 2008</xref>), limbic neurons, for example neurons in the basolateral amygdala and hippocampus, are thus exposed to elevated levels of noradrenaline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881111424930">McIntyre et al., 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881111424930">2002b</xref>). Slightly later these neurons are also targeted by glucocorticoids, which are released in high amounts after stress-induced activation of the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881111424930">de Kloet et al., 2005</xref>). Together these hormones promote an adaptive response, allowing the organism to cope with the challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881111424930">Joels and Baram, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269881111424930">Roozendaal et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Behavioural studies have supplied evidence that effects of stress on hippocampus-dependent memory formation critically depend on noradrenaline, acting via the β-adrenergic receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881111424930">Roozendaal et al., 2004a</xref>). This effect is facilitated by corticosterone, which by itself seems insufficient to modulate behavioural function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881111424930">Okuda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881111424930">Roozendaal et al., 2004b</xref>). Even though pharmacological and behavioural studies have suggested that glucocorticoids may influence the β-adrenergic receptor-cAMP/protein kinase A system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881111424930">Roozendaal, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269881111424930">Stone et al., 1987</xref>), insight into how interactions between the two stress hormones is achieved at the cellular level is still very limited.</p>
<p>Corticosteroid hormones generally act via a slow gene-mediated pathway, involving two nuclear receptors, the high-affinity mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the lower-affinity glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881111424930">de Kloet et al., 2005</xref>). It was shown that β-adrenergic receptor activation potentiates transcriptional activity of the GR in a hippocampal cell line, via a pathway involving G-proteins and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881111424930">Schmidt et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, in the dentate gyrus and basolateral amygdala in vitro, corticosterone treatment slowly decreased the ability of the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol to facilitate synaptic potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881111424930">Pu et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881111424930">2009</xref>), thus potentially preserving earlier encoded stress-related information. In line with these observations, corticosterone slowly suppressed isoproterenol-induced facilitation of AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated synaptic responses in the basolateral amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881111424930">Liebmann et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently it has become evident, though, that corticosterone can also rapidly and non-genomically change synaptic function in limbic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881111424930">Karst et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881111424930">Olijslagers et al., 2008</xref>). This is highly relevant for the period directly after stress, when limbic neurons are first exposed to high levels of noradrenaline and shortly thereafter to corticosteroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881111424930">Droste et al., 2008</xref>). It was reported that corticosterone via membrane-located MRs increases the release probability of glutamate-containing vesicles in adult CA1 hippocampal neurons, causing a rapid and reversible enhancement in the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881111424930">Karst et al., 2005</xref>). In cultured hippocampal cells, MR activation enhances lateral diffusion of the AMPAR subunit GluA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881111424930">Groc et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, noradrenaline also changes AMPAR function. Thus, noradrenaline was reported to increase phosphorylation of the Ser845 (and to a lesser extent Ser831) residue in the GluA1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881111424930">Hu et al., 2007</xref>). Phosphorylation at these sites was found to be necessary and sufficient to lower the threshold for GluA1 synaptic incorporation, as occurs during long-term potentiation. Very recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881111424930">Joiner et al. (2010)</xref> demonstrated in forebrain that β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors form a complex with GluA1 subunits, together with PKA and other proteins. Activation of β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors triggered phosphorylation of GluA1 via PKA, which led to increased surface expression of GluA1 and enhanced AMPAR-mediated mEPSC amplitudes.</p>
<p>In view of this convergence of corticosteroid and β-adrenergic signalling pathways on AMPAR subunits, we here hypothesize that corticosterone facilitates noradrenergic function in the hippocampus by potentiating the effects of the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol on GluA1 phosphorylation, AMPAR subunit surface expression and/or mEPSC properties.</p>

<title>Immunoblots</title>
<p>Naïve male Wistar rats (6–8 weeks old) were sacrificed under 4–5% isoflurane anaesthesia, and coronal brain slices (400 µM in thickness) were made with a manual tissue chopper. Slices were incubated at room temperature in artificial cerebro-spinal fluid (ACSF) containing 120 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 1.3 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10.0 mM glucose and 25.0 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, pH 7.4, and continuously gassed (mixture of 95% O<sub>2</sub>–5% CO<sub>2</sub>). To this perfusion medium we added for 15 min (1) isoproterenol (ISO; Sigma, The Netherlands) at 1 or 10 µM; (2) corticosterone (CORT; Sigma, The Netherlands) at 30 nM; (3) the combination of ISO 1 µM / CORT 30 nM or ISO 10 µM / CORT 30 nM. For each treatment we used 2–3 slices per rat. In total, 14 rats were used for this experimental series. After treatment, slices were immediately put in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until use.</p>
<p>Each slice was homogenized with an insulin syringe in 200 µL homogenization buffer (1% TritonX-100, 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EGTA pH 8; 10 mM EDTA pH 8) according to standard protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881111424930">Bartos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881111424930">Joiner et al., 2010</xref>). Phosphatase inhibitors (25 mM NaF, 25 mM NaPPi, 1 mM PNPP, and 2 µM microcystin) and protease inhibitors (PMSF, Pepstatin A, Leupeptin and Aprotinin) were added to the buffer. After being left on ice for 5–10 min, the homogenate was ultracentrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and saved as the Tx extract. A volume of 20 µL of each Tx extract was mixed with 5 µL of 5× SDS loading buffer, then heated for 5 min at 95°C with shaking. The condensation was quickly spun down and samples were loaded onto 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. The PAGE gel was run for 2–2.5 h at 30 mA and transferred for 500 min overnight at 50 V at 4°C. The blot was subsequently blocked in 10% milk solution for at least 1 h at room temperature. Next, blots were incubated with antibodies against pS845 (1:1000, Millipore), pS831 (1:100, Millipore), total GluA1 (1: 600) and alpha tubulin (1: 500) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881111424930">Bartos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881111424930">Joiner et al., 2010</xref>) (in 10% milk) for 3 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker and afterwards washed with 0.1% Tween in TBS buffer for four times, 5 min each wash. Blots were next incubated with goat anti-rabbit horse radish peroxidase solution (in 10% milk) for 1 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker, after which they were washed with TBS buffer and 0.1% Tween 4–5 times, 20–30 min each. GE Healthcare ECL reagents were used to visualize bands. Immunosignals were quantified by densitometry. Phospho-S845 (pS845) and phospho-S831 (pS831) signals were expressed relative to the total GluA1 signals and normalized to control for data analysis. Two blots were run per animal/experimental condition.</p>

<title>Hippocampal primary culture</title>
<p>Primary hippocampal cultures were prepared from rat brains at embryonic day 18 ± 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881111424930">Hoogenraad et al., 2005</xref>). Cells were plated on coverslips coated with poly-D-lysine (0.5 mg/mL) at a density of 75,000/well for the electrophysiology and immunosurface labelling experiments. Hippocampal cultures were grown in neurobasal medium supplemented with (per 100 mL): B27 2 mL, GlutaMaxI 1 mL, penicillin/streptomycin 1 mL, FBS 5–10 mL (plating medium) for the first day; from the second day onwards, half of the medium was changed once a week for the culturing medium (plating medium without FBS), with 5-Fluoro-2’-Deoxyuridine (FUDR) 10 µM to inhibit glial growth. All reagents except FUDR (Sigma, The Netherlands) were obtained from Gibco Invitrogene (the Netherlands).</p>

<title>Immunosurface labelling and confocal microscopy</title>
<p>DIV 14-21 hippocampal neurons were treated for 15 min with: (1) ISO 1 or 10 µM; (2) CORT 30 nM; (3) the combination of ISO 1 µM and CORT 30 nM, or of ISO 10 µM and CORT 30 nM. For each treatment we also included a vehicle control group: distilled sterile water and EtOH (final concentration: &lt;0.01%) for ISO and CORT, respectively. Neurons were subsequently incubated with GluA1 (Calbiochem, 1:8) or GluA2 (Zymed, 1:80) N-terminal antibodies (10 mg/mL) at 37°C for 15 min. After being washed in DMEM medium, the neurons were fixed for 5 min with 4% formaldehyde/4% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Neurons were then washed three times in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa488 (1:400) or Alexa568 (1:400) in staining buffer without TritonX-100 (0.2% BSA, 0.8 M NaCl, 30 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) overnight at 4°C. Neurons were then washed three times in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and mounted.</p>
<p>Confocal images on a Zeiss laser scanning microscope 510 (USA) were obtained with sequential acquisition settings at the maximal resolution of the microscope (1024 × 1024 pixels). Morphometric analysis and quantification were performed using MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corporation, USA). The averaged whole cell surface immunodensity from 12–20 neurons per group was measured.</p>

<title>mEPSCs</title>
<p>Coverslips with DIV 14-21 neurons were placed in a recording chamber, mounted on an upright microscope (Zeiss Axioskop 2 FS Plus, Germany) and filled with HEPES buffer at room temperature (20°C ± 2) containing 145 mM NaCl, 2.8 mM KCl, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2.0 mM, 1.0 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10.0 mM H-HEPES, pH 7.4, osmolarity 300 ± 10 mOsm/L. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made using an AXOPATCH 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, USA), with electrodes from borosilicate glass (1.5 mm outer diameter, Hilgerberg, Malsfeld, Germany). The electrodes were pulled on a Sutter (USA) micropipette puller. The pipette solution contained 120 mM Cs methane sulfonate, 17.5 mM CsCl, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM BAPTA, 2 mM Mg-ATP, 0.5 mM Na-GTP, 10 mM QX-314, pH 7.4, adjusted with CsOH; pipette resistance was between 3–6 MΩ. Under visual control (40× objective and 10× ocular magnification) the electrode was directed towards a neuron with positive pressure. Once sealed on the cell membrane (resistance above 1 GΩ) the membrane patch under the electrode was ruptured by gentle suction and the cell was kept at a holding potential of −70 mV. The liquid junction potential caused a shift of no more than 10 mV, which was not compensated during mEPSCs recording. Recordings with an uncompensated series resistance of &lt; 15 MΩ and &lt; 2.5 times the pipette resistance with a shift of &lt; 20% during the recording, were accepted for analysis. Data acquisition was performed with pCLAMP 8.2 (Axon Instruments, USA) and analyzed off-line with Minianalysis (version 6.0.9; Synaptosoft, USA).</p>
<p>As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881111424930">Karst and Joels, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881111424930">Karst et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269881111424930">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>), mEPSCs were recorded at a holding potential of −70 mV, at which NMDA currents are blocked when Mg<sup>2+</sup> is present in the extracellular buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881111424930">Nowak et al., 1984</xref>), thus focusing on AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs. Tetrodotoxin (0.25 µM, Latoxan, Rosans, France) and bicuculline methobromide (20 µM, Enzo Life Sciences, the Netherlands) were added to the buffer to block action potential-induced glutamate release and GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents, respectively. After achieving the whole-cell configuration, mEPSCs was recorded for 2 min with vehicle administration. A 16-min recording was then made after the application of ISO 1 or 10 µM alone, CORT 30 nM alone, or the combination of the two, i.e. ISO 1 µM and CORT 30 nM or ISO 10 µM and CORT 30 nM. The events were examined manually and identified as mEPSCs when the rise time was faster than the decay time, with an event detection threshold of −5 pA. The inter-event interval and peak amplitude of mEPSCs were analyzed.</p>

<title>Effects of isoproterenol and corticosterone on immunosurface labelling of AMPAR subunits</title>
<p>Unlike the slow effect on AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881111424930">Martin et al., 2009</xref>), application of corticosterone (30 nM) did not affect surface labelling of GluA1 (<italic>t</italic><sub>34</sub> = 0.62, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05, compared with the corresponding vehicle-treated cells) or GluA2 (<italic>t</italic><sub>34</sub> = 1.32, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) when bath-applied for only 15 min (typical examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269881111424930">Figure 2A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We here tested the hypothesis that corticosterone facilitates noradrenergic function in the hippocampus by potentiating actions induced via β-adrenergic receptors on GluA1 phosphorylation, AMPAR subunit surface expression and/or mEPSC properties. Corticosterone – at the presently tested concentration – was mostly ineffective by itself, as was isoproterenol, with the exception of a significant increase in GluA1 and GluA2 surface expression observed with 10 µM isoproterenol. In agreement with the hypothesis, AMPAR phosphorylation, surface expression and mEPSC inter-event interval all responded most strongly to a combination of corticosterone and isoproterenol, except for the case where isoproterenol by itself already induced a strong effect.</p>
<p>In this study we focused on properties of AMPAR subunits, as a potential common endpoint of corticosteroid and adrenergic signalling. This is a highly relevant endpoint, since it is well known that trafficking of AMPARs towards and from excitatory synaptic membranes is critically involved in long-term potentiation and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881111424930">Kessels and Malinow, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881111424930">Malenka, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881111424930">Plant et al., 2006</xref>), and important for emotional learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269881111424930">Rumpel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269881111424930">Whitlock et al., 2006</xref>). Corticosterone rapidly alters the mobility of GluA2-containing AMPARs, and slowly enhances AMPAR surface expression and AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission, at least in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881111424930">Groc et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881111424930">Martin et al., 2009</xref>); this may contribute to its memory-enhancing effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881111424930">Krugers et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, β-adrenergic receptor activation by noradrenaline and isoproterenol has been found to induce the phosphorylation of GluA1, to facilitate surface expression and synaptic delivery of AMPARs, to enhance AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs in the prefrontal cortex and to lower the threshold for long-term potentiation induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881111424930">Hu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881111424930">Joiner et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine putative <italic>rapid</italic> interactions between corticosterone and the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol on AMPAR properties, we used a corticosterone concentration of 30 nM. This was based on earlier studies describing rapid corticosteroid actions in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881111424930">Groc et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881111424930">Karst et al., 2005</xref>). On the one hand this concentration seems sufficiently high to just affect GluA2 surface trafficking in hippocampal cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881111424930">Groc et al., 2008</xref>). On the other hand, rapid effects of corticosterone on mEPSC frequency in adult hippocampal slices are not yet saturated with this concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881111424930">Karst et al., 2005</xref>), allowing facilitation as well as suppression to become apparent. Since the current experiments were carried out in different preparations for technical reasons – surface labelling is best studied in cultures, while AMPAR phosphorylation was examined in slices, and to allow comparison with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881111424930">Hu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881111424930">Joiner et al., 2010</xref>) – we settled for 30 nM corticosterone, which seems an appropriate concentration under both conditions. With respect to isoproterenol, we primarily focused on a concentration (1 µM) which was previously found to be appropriate for studying rapid interactions between isoproterenol and corticosterone in slices of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881111424930">Pu et al., 2007</xref>). To allow comparison with other studies reporting on isoproterenol and AMPAR properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881111424930">Hu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881111424930">Joiner et al., 2010</xref>), we also included the higher concentration of 10 µM. We refrained from using much higher concentrations of the two hormones, which are no longer in the physiological range.</p>
<p>Recently, it was demonstrated in the rat brain that β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors form a complex with GluA1 subunits and other proteins including PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881111424930">Joiner et al., 2010</xref>). These authors showed – in hippocampal primary cultures – that activation of β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors triggered phosphorylation of GluA1 via PKA, and increased surface expression of GluA1. Moreover, β-adrenergic receptor activation enhanced mEPSC amplitudes in prefrontal cortex cells. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881111424930">Hu et al. (2007)</xref> reported that noradrenaline – via β-adrenergic receptors – enhances phosphorylation of GluA1 in organotypic hippocampal slices from rats. Similar results were obtained in acutely prepared hippocampal slices from stressed mice, in which on average a 70% increase in pS845 was found. Phosphorylation of the S845 and S831 sites of GluA1 subtype AMPARs by β-adrenergic receptor agonists seems therefore a critical step early in these processes. In hippocampal slices from rats we did not observe any significant effects of either corticosterone or isoproterenol on phosphorylation of S831 and S845 relative to total GluA1 expression, although pS845 levels were 70% but non-significantly increased after 15 min of isoproterenol (10 µM) treatment compared with the vehicle group. The discrepancy in efficacy of isoproterenol to regulate phosphorylation of AMPARs at the S845 site between the current data and the data reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881111424930">Hu et al. (2007)</xref> could be due to differences in species used (rat versus mouse), the concentrations of β-adrenergic receptor agonists that have been used (10 µM isoproterenol versus 0.5 mg/kg epinephrine injected i.p.), and/or to the use of other preparations (rat acute slices versus rat organotypic cultures). Differences in efficacy of isoproterenol to modulate mEPSCs between our current study and that by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881111424930">Joiner et al. (2010)</xref> might be due to differences between prefrontal and hippocampal cells. Indeed, very recently it was reported that prefrontal tissue responds differently after stress than hippocampal tissue with respect to AMPAR subunit phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881111424930">Caudal et al., 2010</xref>). It should be noted that the timeframe of that study (animals killed &gt; 60 min after stress onset) was such that it focused on slow genomic rather than rapid non-genomic effects of stress hormones. However, it is even more important to underline that we explicitly made sure to prepare slices from non-stressed animals at the nadir of their circadian corticosterone release pattern, resulting in extremely low endogenous corticosterone levels. This differs from the procedure in most laboratories, where animals are placed in an unfamiliar transportation cage prior to decapitation. This is experienced by rats as a novelty stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881111424930">Joels et al., 2003</xref>), causing effects on hippocampal properties which can be effectively mimicked with 30 nM corticosterone in vitro. If slices are prepared after a delay of &gt; 20 min, noradrenaline concentrations due to the novelty stress have probably already normalized, while corticosterone levels are still high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881111424930">McIntyre et al., 2002a</xref>), particularly when animals also have been subjected to an injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881111424930">Hu et al., 2007</xref>). In the hippocampus this would cause a situation comparable with slices treated with 30 nM corticosterone only. In this respect, it is of interest that compared with the slices treated with corticosterone only, pS845 levels in our hands were significantly increased by a combination of 10 µM isoproterenol and corticosterone. The state of the animals could thus very well explain the differences between earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881111424930">Hu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881111424930">Joiner et al., 2010</xref>) and the current observations. Overall, the present data suggest that the combined application of 10 µM isoproterenol and corticosterone is most effective in increasing pS845 levels: this was the only treatment group which differed significantly from the vehicle control group.</p>
<p>While Ser831 is phosphorylated by CaMKII and protein kinase C (PKC), Ser845 is phosphorylated by PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881111424930">Barria et al., 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881111424930">Mammen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881111424930">Roche et al., 1996</xref>). Previous studies have shown that PKA phosphorylation of GluA1 directly controls its synaptic incorporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881111424930">Esteban et al., 2003</xref>) and fosters surface expression of GluA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881111424930">Man et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, in the current study surface expression of both GluA1 and GluA2 AMPAR subunits was not affected by either 1 µM isoproterenol or 30 nM corticosterone, but when co-applied these hormones significantly enhanced GluA1 and GluA2 surface expression. A higher concentration of isoproterenol (10 µM) increased GluA1 and GluA2 surface expression by itself, which was not further enhanced by corticosterone.</p>
<p>In contrast to what was earlier described for CA1 neurons in hippocampal slices from adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881111424930">Karst et al., 2005</xref>), we did not observe an effect of 30 nM corticosterone on mEPSC frequency in cultured cells, while the amplitude was significantly enhanced. At present it is not easy to explain these different effects on synaptic transmission. The discrepancy may be explained by differences in the species used (rats versus mice). More important is the fact that we recorded synaptic transmission in hippocampal primary neurons that were generated from embryonic rats, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881111424930">Karst et al. (2005)</xref> recorded from acutely prepared hippocampal slices of adult mice with higher corticosterone concentration than we used in the current study. The notion that the frequency of mEPSCs is approximately five times higher in our cultures when compared with acute slices (while the amplitude of mEPSCs appears comparable) indicates that synaptic transmission – and possibly the regulation by corticosteroid hormones and noradrenaline – may be different between these preparations. Moreover, the presently used cell cultures do contain various cell types from all hippocampal subfields. Although we find overall hormonal effects in this heterogeneous population of cells, we cannot exclude that these effects are different in cells from a homogenous population in a discrete hippocampal subfield such as the hippocampal CA1 area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881111424930">Karst et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In our study, we found that isoproterenol by itself was ineffective in regulating AMPA receptor-mediated mEPSCs. However, co-application of 1 µM isoproterenol and corticosterone significantly reduced the mEPSC inter-event interval. Possibly, 1 µM of isoproterenol might have induced subthreshold effects. This would be in line with reports that PKA activation increases mEPSCs frequency, but not peak amplitude, in rat hippocampal CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881111424930">Carroll et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881111424930">Chavez-Noriega and Stevens, 1994</xref>) as well as in dentate granule cells in human hippocampal slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881111424930">Chen and Roper, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>For both the surface labelling of GluA1 and GluA2 and the mEPSC frequency, the combination of corticosterone and a high concentration of isoproterenol (10 µM) was less effective than the lower concentration of 1 µM. This is reminiscent of the inverted U-shape dose dependency of corticosterone at the hippocampal CA1 neuronal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881111424930">Joels and de Kloet, 1994</xref>) and network level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881111424930">Diamond et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881111424930">Joels, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881111424930">Joels and de Kloet, 1994</xref>). A similar dose dependency is also reflected at the behavioural level, in tasks requiring hippocampus, such as spatial orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881111424930">Sandi et al., 1997</xref>) and learned helplessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881111424930">Kademian et al., 2005</xref>), where optimal enhancing effects on memory performance were seen at the midrange dosage while higher dosages were less effective or even impaired memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881111424930">Roozendaal, 2000</xref>). Although it is not easy to compare the latter experimental conditions with the reduced preparation of the present study, a general principle seems to emerge that the collective efficacy of the two main stress hormones is highest under those conditions where the effect of either of the hormones alone is not yet saturated, as was suggested already by results from recent electrophysiological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881111424930">Liebmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881111424930">Pu et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, our experiments indicate that corticosterone rapidly increases AMPAR surface expression – a postsynaptic index of glutamatergic transmission – particularly when combined with moderate doses of β-adrenergic receptor agonist. This possibly involves phosphorylation of AMPARs at Ser845 by PKA activation. Corticosterone in combination with a moderate dose of isoproterenol also enhances mEPSC frequency, which reflects presynaptic efficacy in glutamatergic transmission. Overall, the combination of the two hormones seems very effective in targeting AMPAR functionality, although combinations of the hormones beyond the optimal range lead again to diminishment of the effectiveness, pointing to a U-shaped dose dependency. In vivo release of noradrenaline and glucocorticoids after stress (the latter at a slightly slower rate than the former) might thus promote rapid and prominent AMPAR-mediated responses in the hippocampus. This early interaction could contribute to a prompt response to stressors, enabling the organism to cope with stress rapidly and efficiently.</p>
