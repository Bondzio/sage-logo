<abstract>
<p>Understanding the processes of demographic change is critical for economic and services planning. Often times, planning in ‘rural’ areas is based on an assumption of homogenous populations and drivers of change (ageing, declining traditional rural industries, adaptation to changing environments and so on). This article argues that attention to spatial, social and temporal scales reveals great diversity between places and within places with regards to demographic change and economic potential. We use evidence from seemingly incomparable case examples from the Alpine villages of Austria and the remote Indigenous communities of Australia to demonstrate that differences in mobility over time and between social groups results in very different experiences of local economies. Specifically, social groups (and individuals) experience the local within their own actor-networks. The article examines how the diverse experiences of the local might be measured, and why they are important for ‘local’ policy making and planning. The research is grounded in theories of social and human geography around ‘fragmented development’, actor-network theory and scale.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0269094212474869" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Understanding processes of demographic change is critical for economic and services planning for three reasons. First, demographic capacity can readily be equated with economic capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094212474869">Headey and Hodge, 2009</xref>) – what size local workforce is available (age distribution), what local economic output is required to finance local services (dependency ratios), how attractive is the locality to new migrants or non-resident workers (mobility) and so on. Second, demographies are dynamic, in constant flux as people are born and die, people move in to and out of (and pass through) the place, people age and partner, families form, dissolve and re-form. Third, demographies are diverse – similar economic conditions can result in different demographic changes in different (even geographically proximate) locations. For example, recent loss of agricultural jobs in south-eastern Australia as a result of the drought of the first decade of the 2000s has meant substantial population loss from some communities, while others have experienced population growth arising from in-migration of low-income single parent families and retired couples taking advantage of cheaper housing. The conditions which determine demographic responses to drought (or floods, or cyclones or school or factory closures etc.) are complex and localised. In the drought example, determinants of population gain or loss included where agricultural workers had lived (in town or on the land), the nature of employment (permanent or seasonal), the history of attractiveness of the location to non-agrarian workers and other visitors, the age structure of the remaining resident population, the lag between initial population loss and loss of (particularly health) services, and the nature of the local real estate market (dominated by rental or owned properties) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094212474869">Carson, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>This article specifically focuses on mobility and its relationship with local economic development. We argue that understanding mobility helps practitioners manage issues of scale when attempting to divine the local in policies, plans and programmes. Three types of scale are examined – spatial scale (the geographic boundaries of the local), social scale (the demographic boundaries of the local), and temporal scale (the extent to which a single conception of the local can persist over time). The article is underpinned by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269094212474869">Scholz’ (2004)</xref> theory of fragmented development and a view that ‘a growing differentiation of experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269094212474869">Ludes, 2008</xref>:10) rather than increasing homogeneity is what defines rural spaces. In particular, we argue that mobility is a key signifier of the differentiation of experience. We call on two case studies – one from alpine valley communities in Austria, and one from Indigenous communities in Australia to illustrate how physical mobility shapes actor-networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094212474869">Latour, 2005</xref>) that serve to continuously shape and reshape local economies. Our contribution to theory is to assert the positions of mobility and scale as critical variables in understanding local economies. Our practical contribution is to illustrate how the effects of mobility and scale may be usefully examined and incorporated into local economic planning processes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0269094212474869"><title>Fragmented development, issues of scale and some assistance from actor-network theory</title>
<p>The theory of fragmented development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269094212474869">Scholz, 2004</xref>) offers a suitable approach to embed empirical complexities theoretically. Instead of using (meso-) scaled spatial levels such as states or municipalities to describe social dynamics and diversities, it provides a wide-ranging concept of scale which provides a more nuanced spatio-temporal view on the social. Spatial boundaries are not perceived as pre-existing limiting modes of aggregation, but as functional and process-oriented inclusion/exclusion mechanisms. Fragmented development approaches have helped improve understandings of the transition of large cities through the ‘second modernity’ (globalisation, individualisation, insecurity of employment, increasing mobility). For example, London is not entirely a global city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094212474869">Castells, 2002</xref>). Only very few districts belong to the global network of flows of capital, goods, information and human beings. Other parts of the city are more or less cut off from this development. In this way, London is not only spatially diverse, but socially diverse depending on the extent to which different groups can engage with the global mobilities. In another example, the theory of fragmented development has helped reveal the complexity of spatial and social separation of residents of Brazil’s favelas from residents of the ‘formal’ cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094212474869">Deffner and Hoerning, 2011</xref>). While economic programmes have focused on the favela dweller in the favela, research reveals that many spend a greater proportion of their time in the ‘formal’ city working, shopping, or seeking services, recreation and entertainment. Fragmentation, then, does not need to mean separation and segregation, but can reveal opportunities for socially inclusive local development.</p>
<p>One layer which receives relatively little attention in the literature is the temporal scale of fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094212474869">Koch and Carson, 2012</xref>). The truism is that things change over time, and so social and spatial boundaries of the ‘local’ are dynamic, evolving, shifting and recasting themselves as a function of a raft of human mobilities (across space, across socio-economic strata, through the life cycle). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094212474869">Carson’s (2012)</xref> analysis of industries of employment across rural Australia revealed the fallacy of the homogenised view of rural industries as chiefly agrarian with recent incursion by mining and resources developments. Even where agrarian economic dominance was apparent at a regional level, there were localities within the region whose labour economies were clearly operating on a different basis. In comparing data from just two Census periods (2001 and 2006), Carson identified a number of regions and localities whose economic basis had shifted dramatically sometimes due to widely recognised factors (drought, the resources boom) and sometimes due to highly localised factors (apparently random (to the external observer) decisions to invest in particular activities in one place rather than another). Nevertheless, Australian regional development policy continues to be dominated by ‘one size fits all’ approaches which assume a static and homogenous rural economic structure. It is little wonder that so much of this policy has failed rural communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269094212474869">Tomaney, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The sensitivity of rural economies to place and time has been well explored in the Canadian literature through Innis’ Staples Thesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094212474869">Barnes, 2005</xref>). The reliance on economic activities, particularly resource extraction, which are limited by their nature to particular locations (where the minerals are) and periods of time (when the minerals are there) to underpin regional economies creates dramatic division between the haves (who are in the right place at the right time) and the have nots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269094212474869">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>). Universal panaceas for rural decline, such as tourism, have also been revealed as subject to these same scale impacts, which helps explain the fragility of their contribution to local economies over the long haul (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269094212474869">Schmallegger et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The relationships between fragmented development and mobility also play out in different ways in different places at different times for different social groups. Some locations are particularly sensitive to time scales, and so ‘borrow’ mobile labour from outside for short periods. These newcomers (many of whom may even consider themselves non-residents) represent different social units than longer-term residents, and have different ambitions for how the place will evolve over time economically and socially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269094212474869">Green et al., 1999</xref>). The temptation may be to ignore the transients, but their impact on economic and social space is important and difficult to separate from ‘the local’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094212474869">Boucquey et al., 2012</xref>). This is consistent with the lessons of separation of Brazilian favela dwellers from the ‘formal city’. The presence of favela dwellers as commuting workers to the city was integral to the nature of the city and its opportunities for future prosperity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094212474869">Deffner and Hoerning, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Non-resident labour is one indicator of the regionalising/globalising of local economies. Local residents may also bypass local institutions by working outside of the locality, by shopping or accessing services outside, by taking their children to school outside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269094212474869">Green et al., 1999</xref>). Mobility as a representation of who is in a place and when therefore maps neatly to the idea of fragmented development. There is a flux and flow of human movement between places which is often disrespectful of administrative borders and boundaries. Movement patterns differ from individual to individual. Local economic development strategies which fail to understand the nature of mobility run the risk of addressing a population which is not there, not there at the right times, or not constituted there as described by simple and static measures of ‘resident population’.</p>
<p>The notion of mobility commonly refers to as the capacity and capability of displacement, thus encompassing subjective and objective meanings of potentials and constraints, i.e. issues of access, competence and relevance arise. Displacement usually is connoted to geographical space; it includes, however, social movements as well. With the advent and increasing penetration of advanced information and communications technologies, displacement is also associated with a virtual movement of knowledge, information and distant action. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269094212474869">Kellerman (2006: 4)</xref> who distinguishes between spatial mobility at large and personal mobility in particular, where the latter is constituted by the four dimensions ‘people and societies, places and spaces, technologies, and human activities’, we mainly focus on this personal type of mobility (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269094212474869">Urry, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The ultimate social unit of diversity is the individual, but individual diversity is often tempered by the social organisation of the family/household, which may be further tempered by the agency of association (work colleagues, club members, political affiliates, etc.). Some of these associations are locally bounded and some are not. Importantly, diversity does not decrease in a linear fashion as each scale is viewed. Individuals do not progress smoothly from micro to macro social scales, but make discrete ‘scale-jumps’ that see them change their behaviour and their attitudes to newly define social diversity at each respective agglomeration level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269094212474869">Koch, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>While there is a strong theoretical argument, therefore, to respect social, spatial and temporal scales in understanding local economies, the question remains how to do so in a practical sense. The commonly used demographic descriptors of local economic capacity are clearly inadequate. They constrain ‘local populations’ through artificial boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269094212474869">Chi, 2009</xref>). They assume a static occupation of place – you are either resident or not. They aggregate and disaggregate populations based on artificial spatial boundaries. They assume the predominance of the ‘average’ (or other summary measures) in determining local needs, and while they are occasionally cognisant of demographic change in the (recent) past, they have limited capacity to consider the potential for diverse change into the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094212474869">Cameron and Poot, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This article reports on research that suggests a new way of looking at local economies through understanding the mobility of people engaged in those economies. We do this by adapting some ideas from actor-network theory (ANT) which relaxes the narrowing focus on fixed, pre-defined social, spatial and temporal units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094212474869">Latour, 2005</xref>). Being aware that the scope of ANT is multifaceted, encompassing the hybrid nature of objectives like devices, goods and spaces by emphasising the (mostly) intangible relatedness of tangible things, it is the convincing conceptualisation of space as being simultaneously geometrical and topological that allows for a differentiated perspective on mobility. The relational view of ANT abandons an imagination which represents actions and their effects as if they were evenly distributed over space and it turns to an imagination which links actions and their effects as being local all the time but at many different (concrete) places.<disp-quote>
<p>As I have said earlier, action is always dislocated, articulated, delegated, translated. Thus, if any observer is faithful to the direction suggested by this overflow, she will be led away from any given interaction to some other places, other times, and other agencies that appear to have molded them into shape. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094212474869">Latour, 2005</xref>: 166)</p></disp-quote>The production of place and scale is, then, not just a simple micro-macro link (the individual with the social, the place with the space), but a multi-scaled operation of detecting and highlighting the plenty of associations that emerge through concrete actions at concrete locations. Following this approach can produce a dynamic analysis of local economies which is sensitive to the continuing emergence of actor-networks that reveal the effects of spatial, social and temporal scales.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no holy grail in this venture as all classifications and categories (social, spatial, temporal) are artificial to a greater or lesser extent. However, by paying attention to how people and concrete places (actors) interact (networks), such analysis may help practitioners select classifications and categories that are meaningful for the places in which they operate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0269094212474869"><title>About the cases</title>
<p>The research has been conducted in two apparently very different settings – alpine valleys in the Salzburg province of Austria and Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory of Australia. What is common between the two settings is their position outside of the central economies and the demographic centres of their respective jurisdictions.</p>
<sec id="sec4-0269094212474869"><title>Lower Pinzgau</title>
<p>The Austrian cases are two municipalities chosen as pilots for a European Union-funded project D<sc>emochange</sc> – demographic change in the Alps (demochange.org). The municipalities, Fusch an der Glocknerstrasse (Fusch) and Lend/Embach (Lend), were chosen as examples of alpine municipalities which have experienced substantial loss of population of around 12% over the first decade of the 2000s and between 12% (Fusch) and 30% (Lend) over four decades (1970–2000). Fusch had around 750 registered residents at the start of the century, and fewer than 660 by 2010. Lend had nearly 1600 registered residents in 2000 and about 1400 in 2010. Despite this demographic trend, the past economic development in Fusch has led to an increase in the local labour force of 15% and a slight positive tax development. Lend, in contrast, is challenged with a negative labour force development of 7% and stagnating tax revenue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269094212474869">Statistik Austria, 2012</xref>). A well-constructed transportation infrastructure (mainly road network, less rail network) and well-equipped regional centres in close proximity have contributed to these diverse developments. Historically, mobility has been assessed in terms of travel by foot, and there has been great diversity in terms of on foot access to basic services (shops, pharmacy, etc.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269094212474869">Figure 1</xref>).
<fig id="fig1-0269094212474869" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Accessibility on foot of basic infrastructure in the Fusch-Lend region.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0269094212474869-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Economic activity in the two municipalities is still largely driven by agricultural activity, although there is a growing services sector including some substantial tourism developments. At the Pinzgau Province level the GDP is nearly the average value of Austria (96% in 2007). Regional economic development has been positive over the last decade (+28.6%) compared with the federal state level (+26.8%) and the national level (+23.7%). A small-scale enterprise structure (fewer than 20 employees) is typical for the study area. Although there is a common trend towards the services sectors, inner regional differences are significant. While the Pinzgau region is clearly dominated by tourism, it lacks employment opportunities in the industry and crafts sectors. This fact becomes economically even more relevant as climate and demographic change leverages innovative ideas to cope with.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0269094212474869"><title>Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory</title>
<p>There are approximately 80 ‘discrete Indigenous communities’ across the Northern Territory. They have been so defined by Northern Territory and Australian legislation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.indigenous.gov.au/stronger-futures-legislation/">http://www.indigenous.gov.au/stronger-futures-legislation/</ext-link>) as settlements situated on Indigenous or Crown-owned land. They typically contain between a few hundred and two or three thousand inhabitants, nearly 80% of whom are Indigenous Australians. Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory have been recognised by Government as having very fragile local economies and facing substantial barriers to improving social and economic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094212474869">Howitt, 2010</xref>). Most communities are isolated from one another, and from the larger urban centres (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269094212474869">Figure 2</xref>). Even relatively proximate communities (which in the Northern Territory may mean less than two or three hundred kilometres from one another) are rarely connected by all-weather roads or other forms of regular transport. The lines on the map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269094212474869">Figure 2</xref> show the only sealed roads in the Northern Territory.
<fig id="fig2-0269094212474869" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Selected Indigenous communities relative to large population centres in the Northern Territory.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0269094212474869-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The research reported in this article focuses on eight communities (identified by name and large circle markers on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269094212474869">Figure 2</xref>) which are relatively large (between 600 and 1500 people), and for which quantitative data from the 2006 Census of Population and Housing are available (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.abs.gov.au/census">www.abs.gov.au/census</ext-link>). The eight communities are part of a larger group (between 15 and 22 communities depending on the programme) selected by Northern Territory and Australian Governments for a process of development planning that commenced in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269094212474869">Carson, 2011</xref>). The planning process aims to establish these communities as service and economic ‘hubs’ for nearby communities, and to reduce their reliance on accessing services in the large urban centres of Darwin, Katherine, Tennant Creek, Alice Springs and Nhulunbuy (identified by name and square markers on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269094212474869">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Economic activity in these communities is focused on the provision of government, education and health services. Collectively, nearly three-quarters of the workforce in the eight focus communities are employed in these sectors. There are some private sector activities in some communities. For example, Borroloola and Daguragu had about 5% each of their workforce in the agricultural sector according to the 2006 Census. Angurugu had about 7% working in the mining sector. Numbulwar and Yuendemu had about 4% in the hospitality sector, and there were small (up to 5% of workforce) retail and arts sectors in most of the communities.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0269094212474869" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>The Austrian case studies use a mix of quantitative and qualitative research. The major primary data source for the Lower Pinzgau study was a 2011 survey of approximately 180 inhabitants of each municipality (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.demochange.org">www.demochange.org</ext-link>). The survey asked people about their awareness of local facilities (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269094212474869">Table 1</xref> for an indicative list), their use of those facilities and their satisfaction with those facilities. The survey was supplemented by a series of focus groups involving particular peer group representatives within the communities (families, elderly, youths, farmers, entrepreneurs, volunteer workers). Approximately 10 of these groups were conducted in early 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094212474869">Koch and Koch, 2011</xref>).

<p>The major primary data source for the Northern Territory Indigenous communities study is the 2006 Census of Population and Housing (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.abs.gov.au/census">www.abs.gov.au/census</ext-link>). Several mobility indicators were analysed:

</list></p>
<p>Indicators of mobility were compared between the Indigenous communities, and between different groups within communities. Groups were defined according to age, sex, Indigenous status, employment status and industry of employment. Quantitative data were supplemented by qualitative data, much of which has been previously published. Qualitative data included interviews with Indigenous people in three of the focus communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094212474869">Taylor and Carson, 2009</xref>), interviews with Indigenous people who were travelling away from several of the communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094212474869">Taylor and Carson, 2012</xref>) and interviews with general practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094212474869">Auer and Carson, 2010</xref>) and nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212474869">Heidelbeer and Carson, forthcoming</xref>) with experience working in Indigenous communities. Specific communities are not identified in the qualitative data because doing so could identify individual research participants.</p>
<p>The case studies each were quite complex and so the results here are selected highlights rather than a full reporting.</p>

<p>The municipalities of Fusch and Lend/Embach are positioned within the Austrian Federal State of Salzburg, the administrative region of Pinzgau and the district of Lower Pinzgau. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269094212474869">Table 1</xref> shows how the view of population development (changes in the number of registered residents) changes according to spatial and temporal scale. The coarser spatial scales show an increase in population over the longer term (1971–2010), but the Pinzgau region has experienced almost no change in population in the short term (2001–2010), and the Lower Pinzgau district has experienced population loss during this time. At the finer spatial scale, both municipalities of Fusch and Lend/Embach have experienced population losses both over the long term and in the short term. In the Austrian framework for regional development policy, then, the municipalities sit within ‘winner’ regions, but are themselves ‘in decline’ on the basis of the simple measure of population size. The question for the research, then, was the extent to which residents of the municipalities experience this local ‘decline’ (through loss of access to services, for example).</p>

<p>An interesting variable is ‘not available’ when related to ‘not able to judge’ and the set of facilities located de facto in the municipality or not. ‘Not available’ can mean that a facility is actually not available at the municipal level (e.g. drugstore); or it is available, but it does not meet the needs of the inhabitants (e.g. inns and the post office services provided in the local food store in Lend/Embach and doctors in Fusch). Furthermore, some inhabitants do express satisfaction even in cases of absent supply within the municipality, because they are readily able to access facilities in the broader region. What is ‘local’ therefore changes depending on the nature of the facility and the patterns of use of the facility by individuals – activity spaces are clearly not bounded simply by administrative frontiers.</p>
<p>The qualitative research was able to throw further light on this issue, particularly in terms of social and temporal scales. The complexities of scale were best summarised by a group of elderly participants (55+ and retired) in Lend/Embach. They saw their own levels of access to facilities decrease over time but acknowledged the increase in access experienced by others. They pointed to increasing differences in the mobility of different social groups in Lend/Embach as the cause of this fragmentation. Younger residents and particularly new arrivals had high levels of mobility through private vehicle ownership, high household incomes resulting from increasing female employment, and changing relationships between where people lived and where they worked. Commuting behaviour was particularly important as it both allowed Lend/Embach inhabitants to access facilities in other places (where they worked) and it allowed non-residents of Lend/Embach to work in the municipality without necessarily needing or valuing the same range of local facilities that residents would value. The example was given of school teachers, who in the past had lived and worked in Lend/Embach, but who now lived in relatively distant places and were in Lend/Embach during school hours only.</p>
<p>This discussion reflects on both migration (the more or less permanent residential move from one place to another) and mobility (the movement of people across space generally) and its impact on divining the local. Out-migration of residents facilitated by increased commuting distance reduced the demand for local (municipal) facilities, while some residents of the municipality (but not the elderly) could reconstruct ‘local’ based on their ability to access facilities across a larger spatial area. The situation was similar in Fusch, where younger residents were satisfied with ‘local’ facilities which they accessed outside the municipality, while older residents felt the loss of municipally-based facilities more keenly. In Fusch, however, another social group emerged of young mothers who felt constrained in their mobility by responsibilities for child care and housekeeping. This again emphasises the need to be sensitive to social scale, as the category ‘young women’ was itself fragmented in terms of the experiences of local economic change.</p>
<p>The increasing role of mobility in divining the local can additionally be demonstrated through discussion of the proposed development of a 200-bed spa resort in Lend/Embach and the growing demand for seasonal tourism labour in Fusch. In both cases, residents expect the employment opportunities to accrue to non-residents who can commute on a regular basis, or seasonally migrate into and out of the region. The local value of such developments in terms of providing employment and serving as catalysts for improving local facilities is therefore questioned by many residents. Residents, because of their own capacity to travel, also disagreed about the priorities for local development.</p>

<sec id="sec9-0269094212474869"><title>Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory</title>
<p>The Northern Territory has had the highest level of population mobility of all Australian jurisdictions as indicated by changes in place of usual residence recorded at the census (both one year and five years prior to the census) for every census since 1971. This is typically thought to be a function of high levels of mobility among non-Indigenous people, and particularly those living in the larger urban centres of Darwin and Alice Springs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094212474869">Carson and Brown, 2008</xref>). Nonetheless, between 2001 and 2006, the eight focus communities collectively experienced in-migration of 724 people and out-migration of 762 people, meaning a population turnover of 21%. Across Australia, the mean population turnover for this period was 49% and for the Northern Territory it was 67%. While the combined volumes for the focus Indigenous communities were comparatively small, Borroloola (47%) and Yuendemu (48%) had population turnover rates similar to that for Australia as a whole. At the other end of the spectrum were Angurugu (8%) and Wadeye (17%).</p>
<p>Population turnover was driven more by non-Indigenous people (135% turnover 2001–2006<bold>)</bold> than Indigenous people (13%), more by working (50%) than not-working (16%) people, and more by adults aged 30–44 years (34%) than other age groups. Within the Indigenous population, there was comparatively high population turnover among those who were working (15%) compared with those who were not (11%) and among young adults (15–29 years, 15%) than other ages (11%).</p>
<p>Not only were there higher levels of population turnover among the working populations (Indigenous and non-Indigenous), about 11% of people who worked in the communities lived elsewhere. This included 13% of the non-Indigenous workforce but also a small proportion (about 3%) of the Indigenous workforce. About 6% of the local workforce worked outside the community, and this was the same proportion for the Indigenous and the non-Indigenous workforce.</p>
<p>The largest number of non-resident workers worked in general government administration (about 50 workers or 27% of non-resident workers), with the next largest sectors being education (24%) and health (15%). The sectoral breakdown of non-resident workers closely resembled that of employment overall, although overall education employment (15% of the total workforce) was slightly less than health employment (17%). Interviews with non-resident nurses suggested that they desired ‘the best of both worlds’ in terms of benefiting from the local economies of these communities, while retaining the amenity and social connections in their (often very distant) ‘home’ communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212474869">Heidelbeer and Carson, forthcoming</xref>).</p>
<p>High in-migration rates for 2001–2006 suggest short lengths of stay for employed people in these Indigenous communities. In fact, there were over 100 working people living in these communities in 2005 (nearly 10% of the working population at that time) who were not there in 2001 and who were not there in 2006. Interviews with general practitioners suggested that ‘you can stay almost anywhere’ for one or two years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094212474869">Auer and Carson, 2010</xref>: 7) but that longer stays were difficult because of the size and nature of the community.</p>
<p>Another indicator of mobility is whether people were counted on census night in a different place to where they stated they lived. This group included many of the non-resident workers, but was largely a practice of the Indigenous populations of these communities. About 7% of Indigenous people normally living in these communities were away from the community on census night. Similar proportions of Indigenous people who were working and not working were away from the community. Similar proportions of males and females were away from the community. People aged 45–64 years (9%) were slightly more likely to be away, and people aged 0–14 years (5%) were less likely to be away, but proportions were similar in other age groups. Interviews with Indigenous people in communities suggested that travel away from the community for regular activities such as shopping, work, education, health and medical treatment, and visiting friends and relatives was common particularly among young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094212474869">Taylor and Carson 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094212474869">2012</xref>). Often this travel occurred even when facilities were available in the community.</p>
<p>There were substantial differences between individual communities across all of the indicators of mobility. For example, Yuendemu (36%) and Borroloola (26%) had high rates of population turnover among their Indigenous populations, compared with Angurugu (3%), Wadeye (6%) and Gunbalanya (7%). Wadeye, however, had comparatively high population turnover among the working Indigenous population (12% compared with Gunbalanya at 5% and Angurugu at 6%). There was also great diversity in terms of the places involved in the mobility networks for each community. Overall, there were often stronger connections between distant locations than between close ones, and there were substantial differences between the sources of flows in to the community and destinations for flows out.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269094212474869">Figure 3</xref> shows examples of the mobility networks constructed for each community. Connections between places were weighted according to the volume of flows in (including in-migration between 2001 and 2006 and incoming non-resident workers) and flows out (out-migration and residents working elsewhere). Black dashed lines represent flows in and grey solid lines represent flows out. Line thickness represents relative volume of flows. Nodes are positioned to reflect relative distance from the community. Square nodes are outside of the Northern Territory. The purpose of the maps being presented here is not about specific volumes, but about relative volumes and the nature of the ‘catchments’ for the local economies of these communities. The two examples here both reflect the general observations in the preceding paragraph and illustrate the differences that exist between communities. While Darwin (the capital city of the Northern Territory) was important for both communities, the other connections are not obvious from proximity. For example, Wadeye appeared to have stronger connections to areas in the north-east of the Northern Territory (Gunbalanya through Angurugu on the graph) and to other Australian States than to nearby regions (Timber Creek, Daly and Daly River). Lajamanu had a strong relationship with relatively proximate Yuendemu, but otherwise its local economy is most strongly influenced by Queensland and Western Australia. Furthermore, when these graphs were replicated to reflect only migration 2005–2006, the related places and the relative strength of links changed dramatically.

<sec id="sec10-0269094212474869" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
<p>Local economic systems are substantially influenced by the mobility of residents and non-residents alike. In both case studies we can see that the capacity for people to commute to different places for their economic (work) activity changes the spatial scale at which the local can be viewed. If there is sufficient mobility, then there is less need to constrain local economies. While a narrow spatial view (e.g. of the municipality in Lower Pinzgau, or the ‘Indigenous community’ in the Northern Territory) reveals a difficult economic environment, a broader spatial view reveals something more complex. The ‘local’ is inextricably linked with other places through the physical movement of people. The economic status of residents is not restricted by opportunities in the immediate locality. On the other hand, locally-fixed opportunities are not only for local residents. In both case studies, there is likely to be strong resistance from the community to attempts to spatially constrain them, given how patterns of mobility have emerged to meet social as well as economic aspirations. The more local an economy, the more narrowly based it is likely to be, and so the less choice individuals have as to the nature of their participation. Mobility creates new choice sets. By better understanding population mobility, planners and policy makers can start to identify opportunities that may exist outside the ‘local’ both in terms of links out (local residents engaging in other places) and links in (residents of other places engaging locally).</p>
<p>The emergence of new choice sets as mobility has increased over time does not automatically bring benefit to local economies. In the Northern Territory, the lack of resources to support the mobility of some members of the population excludes them not only from economic opportunities elsewhere, but from the local labour economy (because they have limited opportunities to develop skills through education or experiences gained elsewhere). The same may apply in Lower Pinzgau, where the seasonal nature of local employment in the tourism industry in particular demands types of mobility that may not be attractive to local residents. As a consequence, issues of social scale become important in planning for local economic futures. In the Northern Territory case, it is tempting to construct just two social categories – Indigenous and non-Indigenous – but the research shows that there are social layers within each of these broad classes that are linked to higher or lower mobility potential. The point is also made in relation to the young women of Fusch, some of whom engage well in the ‘extended local’ through physical (and virtual) mobility and some of whom feel increasingly excluded because of mobility-limiting commitments to household and family.</p>
<p>Finally the research has revealed that local economic actor-networks change over time. In Lower Pinzgau, the capacity for school teachers to live elsewhere and daily commute to Lend/Embach is a relatively recent phenomenon. This changing relationship between where people work and where they live fundamentally affects crucial local economic development questions around recruitment and retention of skilled labour, as just one example. The localities that are involved in the ‘extended local’ networks also change over time. The development of the new spa resort in Lend/Embach will connect that location to others in different ways than have occurred in the past. Likewise, the changing nature of the European seasonal labour market for tourism creates new connections between Fusch and places that are near and distant. In the Northern Territory communities we observed dramatic changes in sources and destinations of mobile people even between 2001 and 2005. In that case, part of the stated intent of local development plans in the ‘hub’ communities is to influence the localities involved in their economic networks. The ambition is to limit the necessity for residents of the hub to travel to larger centres, while connecting hubs to smaller proximate settlements with which they may or may not have had previous relationships. Those plans are surely challenged by observations of the existing patterns of behaviour that create relationships between places.</p>
<p>The ideas of fragmented development and ANT that have helped shape this research emphasise the diversity of experiences between different places, as well as between different social groups in a single place and between single places at different points in time. While Fusch and Lend/Embach seem to have been experiencing similar ‘declines’ in terms of loss of resident population, they appear to be differently situated to manage the local impacts of that decline in terms of access to facilities and the maintenance of local social networks. While the various Indigenous communities are exposed to the same regional development policy and tied to the same (centrally decided) development priorities, their capacity to access external labour and to mobilise their own populations in the local labour force are quite different. Their relationships with nearby and distant localities are also different.</p>
<p>The overarching conclusion is that the nature of the local economy looks different depending on the scales (spatial, social, temporal) at which it is viewed. Different actors have very different experiences of the economy depending on the scales at which they personally operate. The apparently declining Lower Pinzgau municipalities are economically satisfying places for individuals whose economic networks extend spatially beyond the municipal boundaries. The Indigenous communities of the Northern Territory are vibrant economies for those who plan a short-term presence there. Effective local economic planning needs to be cognisant of scale effects and needs to include consideration of the characteristics of the multiple economic actor-networks that have applied, currently apply, and might apply in the future. By doing so, planning can better describe the spatial, social and temporal parameters of the local economic system and anticipate the impacts on that system of new ventures.</p>
<p>This article has focused on the conceptual issues around scale, but has also demonstrated that it is possible to gain insights into actor-networks that impact local economies through use of existing data (Census data in Australia) or through dedicated new data collections (a survey and interviews in Austria). To make the work more accessible to practitioners, more research needs to be done into how local economy actor-networks can be described and depicted. The social network and geographic information system (GIS) tools used to illustrate the case studies in this article may be useful in this regard, but tend to be limited in their capacity to depict temporal scales. The purpose of this article has been to argue the conceptual case for awareness of scale and fragmented development, with illustration from two case studies. Future research will be targeted more at the development of specific measures of scale effects, and mechanisms for illustrating those effects.</p>
