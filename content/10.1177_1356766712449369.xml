<abstract>
<p>Through social media applications, consumers are increasingly participating in information processes. When booking a journey, consumer opinions exchanged via modern media shape the reputation of enterprises like travel agencies and thus have a major impact on the decision to book a journey. Online market research is regarded as a crucial tool to steer these online discourses, with the emphasis on quantitative analyses. However, looking at the Web as a social forum can provide additional insights. Taking user-generated data has the advantage that it is collected within a natural setting. Webnography is an attempt to capture this information in a systematic way. Therefore, in this article, <italic>Computer-Assisted Webnography</italic> is presented as an innovative control method. It is based on the practical modification of ethnographic methods. <italic>Computer-Assisted Webnography </italic>is meant to combine quantitative and qualitative methods and merges both the approaches on a virtual working platform, so that the semiotic codes of any given target group can be extracted efficiently and precisely. The results shall be used to create individual reputation management strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Internet has triggered a revolutionary change in all channels of communication. By using social media, users are no longer passive consumers. Travellers, for instance, will use evaluation platforms such as TripAdvisor to exchange information about the performance of travel businesses. These participatory forms of interaction allow the individual to present their experiences with providers in the tourism industry online. Travellers share all kinds of information and emotions about services, brands, providers and destinations. The W3B<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1356766712449369">1</xref>
</sup> study proved that Internet users purposefully availed themselves of other people’s evaluations for their own decision-making when booking a journey (Fittkau &amp; Maaß Consulting GmbH, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356766712449369">2011</xref>). The trustworthiness of consumer evaluation in the Internet reaches an extremely high value of 70%; it is surpassed only by recommendations by friends and acquaintances (90%) (The Nielsen Company, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356766712449369">2009</xref>). Thus, online consumer evaluations can be regarded as a highly relevant source of information and crucially shape the reputation of tourism enterprises.</p>
<p>By exchanging information with other people who share the interest in a given holiday destination, new social relations can be established and maintained. As this exchange is a basic human need, it can be assumed that the use of the social Web for tourist purposes will not be a short-lived trend, but that it will have a marked impact on future travel decisions (Amersdorffer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356766712449369">2010</xref>). The formerly passive consumer has achieved the role of producer and can present self-created contents to the general public. Practical experiences show that Internet users will more and more critically question the advertisements of travel businesses. The classical prospectus, with its one-sided listing of the advantages of destinations and providers, will in extreme cases, completely lose its impact if the promises made by the agencies cannot withstand the comparison with consumer evaluations presented on the Internet.</p>
<p>Thus, there has been a massive change from the classical marketing, with information being sent and steered centrally by the service providers, towards marketing, where the consumers have a vital function for the forming of opinion. In a classical sense, advertising and public relations (PR) was the only way to form a Media-Public. With the possibilities of the so-called Web 2.0 and the public interaction between consumers, this has changed. The result can be called Media-Public 2.0, which is influenced by corporations as well as by interactive users (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1356766712449369">1</xref>).</p>

<p>Some years ago, Amazon and eBay were still regarded as exceptional means of publishing user evaluations. In tourism, however, this has changed dramatically, at the latest since the establishment of platforms such as TripAdvisor or HolidayCheck. Due to the pressure of these independent evaluation websites, travel businesses have started to implement recommendation functions on their sites (Schmeisser, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356766712449369">2010</xref>). Thus, the Internet provides the infrastructure for social exchange processes, which change the market foundations. In the first of their 95 theses on the new business culture in the digital age, the authors of the Cluetrain Manifesto postulated that ‘<italic>markets are conversations</italic>’ (Levine and Vogel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356766712449369">2000</xref>: xiv). Predominantly, opinions are not formed on the basis of mass media information monopolies anymore, but through consumer conversations in the Internet. In contrast to the classical mass media public, the Internet provides countless micro-publics without any selection or control. These are very difficult to capture, as initially they do not create a broad public. Additionally, the Internet brings together people who in the offline world would not necessarily get into contact with each other. Therefore, any strategic reputation management for the tourism industry has to take this into account (Pleil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356766712449369">2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Semantic Software such as Radian6 or B.I.G. provides a sentiment analysis, based on different sources from the Web. Though the data collected are not interpreted. At current state, companies must guess which meaning lies behind a certain collection of data. Therefore, this conceptual article discusses an approach on how user-generated content (UGC) can systematically be collected, interpreted and transformed into actions. To understand the meaning of data, it is essential to understand the concept of reputation. Therefore, this article explains how reputation is being formed by referring to theoretical approaches in section ‘Understanding and measuring online reputation’. This theoretical part is followed by practical examples, which explain the heterogeneous and dynamically changing sociocultural structure of the actors within the social web. The examples show that an online discourse about a certain topic cannot be viewed limited to one source, but must be compared and analysed in context to each referring source. As a consequence, reputation understood as the result of a discourse among customers cannot be captured at once. This shows that the dynamics within an online discourse are very complex. In order to understand the conversations, they must be regarded as a social life in a virtual environment. To analyse these data in their natural context, ethnographic methods can be transferred to the Internet. This approach is typically called ‘webnography’, ‘netnography’ or ‘virtual ethnography’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1356766712449369">2</xref>
</sup> As conversation is an ongoing process, the methodology must be iterative in order to capture debates which are forming an online reputation over time. Referring to the theoretical and practical findings, this article concludes by presenting <italic>Computer-Assisted Webnography</italic> (<italic>CAW</italic>) as a strategic way to capture an online discourse and transform the findings of a discourse into meaning in reference to the online reputation of a tourism company. Meaning is here defined not only as understanding the topic but also the motivation, beliefs or values of the participants within that dialogue.</p>

<title>Understanding and measuring online reputation</title>
<p>The previous discussions show the growing relevance of the Internet in the lives of the consumers, which is also important to online selling of travel arrangements. The tourism industry as an economic segment is to an extremely high degree based on the dissemination of information. Any journey consists of a large number of individual and separate services. It is difficult to assess the quality of each service component prior to their consumption, so that any tourism product is characterised by a marked asymmetry of information and a high demand for information on the customer’s side (Bieger and Laesser, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356766712449369">2000</xref>). Booking a journey is always risky, and the quality of the eventual travel experience depends on a large number of parameters such as the weather, the friendliness of the staff and the quality of the food. Generally, tourism products continue to be difficult to compare, thus having all the typical characteristics of a performance based on trust (Laesser, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356766712449369">2004</xref>). If performances are based on trust, incomplete information will unsettle the customer. One strategy to reduce the uncertainty prior to the purchase is the search for information. The range of this information asymmetry between provider and customer depends on the quality of the provision of information. With regard to information economics, the provider can transmit signals to the customer to emphasise the advantages of their product. The signal must be designed in such a way that it satisfies the consumer’s desire for information; only then can it contribute to reducing the uncertainty. Apart from the consistency of the single-information signals, trustworthiness is a major factor in uncertainty reduction. One valuable instrument to increase the customer’s trust is a high reputation of the respective business. If the trustworthiness of the information signals has been established, the customer’s trust in the performance of the provider will rise (Walsh and Beatty, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1356766712449369">2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The new networking possibilities of the Internet considerably mark the information flow in the tourist business and run parallel to changes in media utilisation (Buhalis and Egger, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356766712449369">2006</xref>). The reputation of the providers of tourism products has been particularly affected by this development. Reputation is acknowledged to be a product of communicative processes. This reputation will not necessarily derive from direct experiences, but it will additionally be influenced through social interaction. Thus, at its core reputation is the diffusion of information exchanged by actors within a social network (Einwiller, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356766712449369">2003</xref>). Against this background, one generally speaks of reputation-making if the evaluation of one actor is disseminated and acknowledged within in a social network. It is important to keep in mind that reputation may be a conveyed second-hand acknowledgement which thus transcends personal contact networks (Eisenegger, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356766712449369">2005</xref>). Reputation therefore has a public application area and is the result of interaction processes. Through this exchange, the individual attitudes of the stakeholders towards the reputation object are negotiated. Thus, travel companies have to face the potential and ubiquitous danger of losing their good reputation through negative evaluations. For any business, reputation is an intangible asset (Schwaiger, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356766712449369">2006</xref>). Reputation thus has a trust-stabilising function, as any actor in the tourism industry would endanger their reputation with opportunistic behaviour (Einwiller, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356766712449369">2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the social web, reputation management in tourism means the determination of who will influence the reputation of the providers, in which areas and through which factors, and which impact this will have on the behaviour of travellers. In this context, Inversini et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356766712449369">2010</xref>) develop a conceptual framework which they call ‘Destination Online Reputation Model’ (DORM). This approach gives an overview about important issues that need to be considered when evaluating the online reputation of a tourism destination. The findings can be taken as a guideline in order to identify important topics which relate to the online reputation of a tourism destination (Inversini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356766712449369">2010</xref>). Nonetheless, these topics must be further analysed, in order to evaluate the underlying meaning of the online discourses. Here, the analysis of Inversini et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356766712449369">2010</xref>) only evaluates whether UGC contains one of the identified reputation drivers and which connotation this could have (positive, indifferent or negative). Therefore, their approach is more a sentiment analysis than a discourse analysis. Nonetheless, it shows important findings in regard to reputation drivers (Inversini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356766712449369">2010</xref>). But the consequences of reputation are also important. Particularly for products which are strongly based on services rendered – as is the case with holiday trips – as a good reputation corresponds with an increased trust of the customer in the provider. One consequence is an increased support potential of the customer towards the provider of tourism products (Liehr et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356766712449369">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to identify not only the drivers and their connotation, the work of Crotts et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356766712449369">2009</xref>) can also help to develop a methodology, which will also generate consumer insights. In their article, Crotts et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356766712449369">2009</xref>) combine quantitative and qualitative approaches to measure guest satisfaction. They collect and analyse UGC on a qualitative basis and then quantify it. The work gives some important arguments to the method <italic>CAW</italic> presented in this article. The aim of <italic>CAW</italic> lies more on the qualitative part in order to give information about consumer insides rather than quantifying the results. Also, the sample was not collected according to the development of an online discourse (Crotts et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356766712449369">2009</xref>). The following examples will show that though the development of online discourses is not limited to a certain platform, it depends on the relationships and must therefore be evaluated across different sources.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1356766712449369">
<title>Examples of an online discourse</title>
<p>There has been a clear tendency of actors in the tourism industry to concentrate on Internet network services like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and so on. Often, however, the enterprises lack a comprehensive communication strategy, when it comes to criticism outside of the corporate social media channels. This lack makes for a high risk, as it is not possible to estimate the resonance to business activities before the customers avail themselves of the products.</p>
<p>In the Internet, one can find a large number of examples where single customer had a massive influence on the forming of opinions about a large company. One impressive example in the tourism industry is the case of David Carroll, whose guitar was destroyed during a United Airlines flight (Carroll, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356766712449369">2011</xref>). This example shows how an online discourse can move from one platform to another. The musician tried to obtain compensation from the airline – at first in vain. After all his efforts had failed, he turned to the public with a protest song about United Airlines which he disseminated via the YouTube website. In this song called ‘United Breaks Guitars’, he describes his case in an ironical way, but with clearly negative connotations: ‘<italic>You broke it, you should fix it; you’re liable, just admit it, I should have flown with someone else</italic>’. In the space of only 6 weeks, the video was viewed by five million users, with CNN reporting on the case (Bliss, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1356766712449369">2009</xref>). The airline reacted to the incident by siding with Carroll, posting a positive evaluation of the video and announcing to use it for the training of their employees. Generally, however, a negative discourse about United Airlines was triggered off in the Internet, the beginnings of which could have been prevented by early online reputation management, because the example mentioned was by no means an exceptional case. Airline passengers who publish their experiences with lost luggage and the ensuing complaints management of the airlines on the Internet are legion, and customers will also read the less popular entries. Thus, these micro-publics will cause considerable damage not only to the reputation of the single actor but also to the respective branch as a whole. In other sectors of the tourism industry, similar tendencies can be identified. So far, most service providers have been reacting only when the complaints reached the mass media public. Yet, on the Internet there exist many, albeit mostly not so frequently accessed publication and reception options. The influence of these micro-publics is described by the term ‘<italic>Longtail</italic>’ (Anderson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356766712449369">2007</xref>). In the long run, these micro-publics can cause a much higher damage to the reputation than a single complaint which is noticed by the general public (Anderson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356766712449369">2007</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1356766712449369">2</xref> shows how such a chain could develop: a travel agency or a hotel could, for example, try to influence their online reputation by doubting an entry of a guest (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1356766712449369">2</xref>, <italic>Step 1</italic>). The guest could then inform his/her community via Twitter about the conflict (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1356766712449369">2</xref>, <italic>Step 2</italic>). The conflict is then being taken as an example for a mislead reputation management by different travel bloggers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1356766712449369">2</xref>, <italic>Step 3</italic>). The conflict could even be picked up by traditional media (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1356766712449369">2</xref>, <italic>Step 4</italic>). Since it is now a big topic, other upset guests report about their experience. This does not necessarily need to be on TripAdvisor but could as well be on YouTube (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1356766712449369">2</xref>, <italic>Step 5</italic>) or Facebook. The conflict could lead to a reaction, where the travel agency or hotel erases its own Facebook fan page because of constant protest (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1356766712449369">2</xref>, <italic>Step 6</italic>). Finally, this could encourage other newspapers to report about the PR disaster (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1356766712449369">2</xref>, <italic>Step 7</italic>). Overall, this example shows that an online discourse depends very much on relationships and how these relationships are treated. But it can also be taken as an example for how diffuse an online discourse can be. It jumps from platform to platform and therefore cannot be grasped at once, but needs to be observed in an iterative way to identify all its sources.</p>

</fig>
<p>Generally, it should be stressed again that opinions are formed wherever people enter into conversations. Nowadays, this forming of opinions will often begin in the Internet. Thus, providers of tourism products have to establish systems that allow them to participate in these conversations, in order to be present immediately and to react at once if a conversation gets negative connotations. However, the implementation of a successful online reputation management relies on the providers dealing with customer opinions and trying to understand them. Only on such a basis will it be possible to actively take part in the conversation (Pleil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356766712449369">2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1356766712449369">
<title>Qualitative online reputation management</title>
<p>In this section, the method called <italic>CAW</italic> will be explained, which is designed to satisfy the increasing demand for a cultural understanding of target group-specific codes of communication and behaviour in order to be able to participate in online discourses. The basis of this qualitative reputation management approach is listening to and understanding the customer. The evaluation process is being established by a simultaneous analysis of several researchers to maintain intersubjective results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1356766712449369">3</xref>, <italic>Step 1</italic>). As this form of analysis is still quite new, the actual analysis process should be steered by an experienced project manager, whose task would be to guide the research process and to safeguard the intersubjectivity. The advantage of a virtual setting is that the presence of the researchers is not necessary. Therefore, an etic perspective can help to better observe an online discourse. Only after having understood the discourse, an active participation can help to influence the conversation. This would then already be an emic perspective where the reaction of the observed persons can be evaluated. Nonetheless this step remains risky, since most communities react sensitively and reactions from the observer can quickly lead to misunderstandings.</p>

</fig>
<p>To be able to work separately and independently from time and place, an online working platform and a theoretical framework need to be set up (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1356766712449369">3</xref>, <italic>Step 2</italic>).</p>
<p>One promising base in the context of the methodological setting is to use the idea of Grounded Theory (Strauss and Corbin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356766712449369">1990</xref>). This approach is characterised by a particularly high efficiency, as – in contrast to conventional approaches – the determination of sources, the collection of data, codification and analysis are expressly not kept separate, but dovetail with each other. Thus, Grounded Theory refers to both the process and the result of the research and can in this context be regarded as a meta-level approach, which refers to the procedures during the entire recording and evaluation process. As a result, the research team does not have previous assumptions about the analysed discourse.</p>
<p>The definition of a research question is the starting point. In order to identify virtual discussions related to the defined issue, systematic search for customer opinions through web-monitoring offers itself. This search may be run via search engines, but there are also freely accessible web-monitoring tools available, such as ‘Social Mention’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1356766712449369">3</xref>
</sup> or ‘Addict-o-Matic’,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1356766712449369">4</xref>
</sup> which systematically identify UGCs in the Internet. Alternatively paid options such as ‘Radian6’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1356766712449369">5</xref>
</sup> or ‘B.I.G.’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1356766712449369">6</xref>
</sup> can be used. As customer opinions are subjected to dynamic changes due to finished and newly developing conversations, the monitoring should not be run as a one-time control of the results of communication measures, but rather be integrated in an online reputation management system as a continuous task (Pleil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356766712449369">2010</xref>). Continuous web-monitoring allows identifying the relevant nodes of networks. The terms to be searched for prior to the analysis results from the criteria relevant for the respective research target and are defined accordingly. With regard to the approach of Grounded Theory, topics will be gradually extended within the course of the examination. In this way, those communication activities that are relevant for the research question can be determined. Once the sources are identified and the process has been run through several times, important topics can be grouped into categories. These categories include main keywords, which can be used to restart the whole process (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1356766712449369">3</xref>, <italic>Step 3</italic>).</p>
<p>In <italic>CAW</italic>, a qualitative method is used for the analysis of the identified online discourses, because attempts to record online discourses with quantitative software and to analyse them with automated computer-linguistic tools can only yield limited insights into the semiotic code of the respective target group. Among other reasons, this is due to the semantic problem of contextual and sociocultural polysemy (equivocality) of the comments. One method which is based on listening and understanding, and is thus well suitable for semiotic analysis, is ethnography. The major objective is to recognise the contexts of meaning of a defined social group and thus to draw conclusions about the everyday world of the respective target group. By combining the terms <italic>Web</italic> and <italic>ethnography</italic> to <italic>Webnography</italic>, Strübing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356766712449369">2004</xref>) coined a term that transfers the methods of classical ethnography to the research object Internet. Using ethnographical methods such as participatory observation and thick description, market-relevant information is gained from the perspective of the consumers, for instance, about motivation, value patterns, conventions or taboos. In this way, Webnography follows methods of the qualitative analysis of contents, discourse and conversation. One particular characteristic of Webnography is that it is not necessary to initially compile the desired data, as these data already exist in the Internet. Due to their authenticity, the value of this content differs crucially from data which can be gained from opinion polls or interviews. The collected data are initially free of a systematic bias, since the researcher does not interrupt the conversation and can remain invisible (Janowitz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1356766712449369">2008</xref>). As a result, it becomes possible to examine structures, which cannot be measured with conventional conditions under laboratory conditions or with pre-structured questionnaires.</p>
<p>For the qualitative decoding process, the culture–theoretical principles of modern cultural studies can be used. In this context, cultural studies means an internationally common and semiotics-based culture–theoretical approach. Internet users establish heterogeneous subcultures, the semiotic codes of which can be laid open through the integration of cultural studies. However, as ethnographical methods are generally quite time-consuming and cannot directly be transferred to online research, the decoding process should be alleviated, with the abovementioned methods being rendered more suitable for practical approaches. Such a simplification can be effected with modern software components. For the decoding process, a qualitative data analysis software such as ‘Coding Analysis Toolkit’ (CAT)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1356766712449369">7</xref>
</sup> or MAXQDA<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1356766712449369">8</xref>
</sup> could be used. This software helps to structure the <italic>semiotic</italic> codes according to their identification (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1356766712449369">3</xref>, <italic>Step 4</italic>). The extracted data could then even be visualised in a synchronised way with the structure visualisation software NodeXL.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1356766712449369">9</xref>
</sup> This tool is a project of the Social Media Research Foundation and is supported by Microsoft Research Group for External Projects. It uses the MS Excel table calculation program as platform for its visualisations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1356766712449369">3</xref>, <italic>Steps 5 and 6</italic>). Additionally, the integration of cloud computing can help with the scripting of reports and thus safeguard an online-based and collaborative work process. This can be established by using services such as Dropbox<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1356766712449369">10</xref>
</sup> or Google Docs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1356766712449369">11</xref>
</sup> With these services, word documents can be accessed locally and synchronically, so that several Webnographers could create a report from various locations and in real time (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1356766712449369">3</xref>, <italic>Step 7</italic>). Also, a simultaneous communication process of the researchers should be guaranteed. This can be managed by using Skype.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1356766712449369">12</xref>
</sup> In this manner of project realisation, the entire team would have the possibility to exchange views and opinions parallel to assessing the visualised research results. The described process is iterative. It is being run until the research question is fully answered (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1356766712449369">3</xref>, <italic>Step 8</italic>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In regard to the communication changes discussed above, it becomes obvious to which high degree providers in the tourism industry are under public scrutiny and evaluation. Through the increased public exchange of opinions, enterprises might lose control over their reputation. At the same time, however, this new public offers the chance if businesses manage to filter the mass of newly generated information, to evaluate it qualitatively and to use it for their purposes. If negative evaluations about single component of the tourist product or the provider appear in the Internet, the service providers must safeguard through continuous web-monitoring that they stay informed about these comments directly, immediately and constantly (Mühlenbeck and Skibicki, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356766712449369">2010</xref>). In order to steer the ensuing online discourses, it is necessary to have a profound understanding of the conversation <italic>culture</italic> of the respective target group. The insights provided by <italic>CAW</italic> offer such an understanding and thus provide the basis for a successful and sustainable access to conversations in the Internet, which can then be used for an authentic and transparent online dialogue with the customers. As a consequence, the data collection by means of Webnography is relatively easy compared to traditional research methods. Since data in the web are usually not erased, Webnographic studies offer the opportunity to reflect a discourse over a long period of time. The idea of <italic>CAW</italic> is to collect data in an iterative process. By doing this, real-time trends are being observed and critical discourses can be identified immediately. This advantage is especially important to tourism, as it is a sector which is fragile in times of a political or economical crisis. Being able to foresee the development of a crisis makes the potential of the <italic>CAW</italic> framework very important to tourism destinations.</p>
<p>In this context, transparency and authenticity mean that the respective provider of tourism services will make themselves known within the initiated communication process to gain the acknowledgement of the customers, with the dialogue serving as moderating interface between customer and business. The identification of the customers’ requirements on a qualitative basis with the help of <italic>CAW</italic> allows running the conversations in the semiotic code of the respective target group in a fair and equal way. Thus, <italic>CAW</italic> offers options to structure a fair communication culture which allows actors in the tourism industry to become capable of acting in a constructive way again, so that the discourse of a business can be changed in a positive way and will at any time be understandable for all participants. This will efficiently support communication policies in which authenticity, transparency and participation opportunities are considerably increased, so that new identification areas for the customers and their relation to the businesses will develop in a positive way through the successful and sustainable dialogue.</p>
<p>The advantages of the presented <italic>CAW</italic>-based reputation management over measures using conventional media are that the reputation genesis will have a long-term effect and is created through discourse. Information in the Internet is hardly ever deleted. Also, the trustworthiness of a discussion is particularly high if the reports are not one-sided – as is the case with the classical mass media information structure – and arguments are settled through discourse and discussion.</p>
<p>Even though the described advantages are of great value, it is important to prove the reliability and validity of the <italic>CAW</italic> approach. The biggest concern here is that within the process of the data collection, there could be a bias because of self-selection. This problem is tried to be solved by the number of observers working on one discourse. With the team of researchers working together, intersubjectivity is guaranteed, which also helps with another concern which is regarding the risk of misinterpretation of the collected data. Finally, it must be said that the collected data must not be limited to text but could include visual information as well. Nonetheless, it will be difficult to interpret gestures and mimic. Therefore, the decision to limit the observation to textual information could lead to a systematic bias, which would have to be mentioned by the researcher.</p>
<p>Thus, the target of providers of tourism products should be to establish high trustworthiness through successful participation of the customers and – in the long run – to implement a sustainable reputation management system. The results of <italic>CAW</italic> provide data which can help tourism practice in this sense. For tourism theory, the results of the <italic>CAW</italic> help to understand of which components corporate reputation consists. Therefore, further research measures should test the effectiveness of the method presented in this article and discuss further optimisation options.</p>
