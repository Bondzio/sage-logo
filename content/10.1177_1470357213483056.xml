<abstract>
<p>This article discusses the relationship between theories of photography and mobile phone footage. In doing so, it asks if theories of photography still apply in a technologically saturated world of imagery. Technology is an increasingly important part of viewing imagery today and enables imagery to become part of a global cultural flow, thus calling into question the physical connection between viewer and image. This article analyses what happens to that connection when not only the image but also the physical body is mediated and challenged in post-human relations, and examines the ensuing ethical implications. The author takes photojournalism and, in particular, mobile phone footage as a starting point for an exploration of the (post-human) body as evidence and sign of authenticity in the modern age of digital communications and journalism.</p>

<p>In scientific practice, ways of seeing become ways of knowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470357213483056">Daston and Galison, 2007</xref>: 368). In their historical explanation of the emergence and development of objectivity in science, Daston and Galison analyse how scientific atlases have taught scientists what to look for and how to see it (p. 369) when describing and analysing data. The various ways of seeing came to define ‘evidence’. Daston and Galison divide the historical ways of practising scientific epistemology into three categories that each emphasises particular qualities about data gathering and representation in atlases (p. 371). From a reasoned image to automated transfer of knowledge and finally trained judgment that gives an expert’s interpretation of the data, the three categories of epistemic virtues tell us about the values of the scientific community at a given time and, in turn, the values of the wider community. Crucially, the link between vision or representation, human eye, i.e. the physical body, and knowledge production is continually at the core of our understanding of evidence, i.e. what is true and authentic. This article poses the question of what happens to that link when the physical body is mediated and challenged in post-human relations and with what ethical implications. The post-human is understood as a shift in the construction of subjectivity from a unified self, endowed with a determining will, to a multi-layered, multi-modal subjectivity constructed through mediated and digital relations to organic and inorganic (technological) others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357213483056">Braidotti, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470357213483056">Hayles, 1999</xref>). I take photojournalism and, in particular, mobile phone footage<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470357213483056">1</xref></sup> as a starting point for an exploration of the (post-human) body as evidence and sign of authenticity in times of digital communications and journalism.</p>
<p>Following an introduction to current discussions about mobile phone footage’s impact on journalistic practice in general, I relate these discussions to re-introduced classic theories on photography in light of new technological developments, and argue that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470357213483056">Barthes’ (2000[1961])</xref> ‘traumatic image’ can be found in the combination of affect<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470357213483056">2</xref></sup> and ‘neutrality’ in mobile phone footage. However, today’s traumatic image is further related to a filmic imaginary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470357213483056">Sontag, 2003</xref>) that in turn is part of a global cultural flow that interpellates us into a global imaginary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357213483056">Appadurai, 1996</xref>). Mobile phone footage and its affects relate to theories of the post-human multiple self in light of technological advances and enhancements as embedded and embodied in viewing and knowledge production. Finally, theories of traumatic imagery, global imaginary and the post-human viewer are brought to bear on the mobile phone footage taken of the death of the young student, Neda Agha-Soltan, in 2009. I conclude by returning to the question of journalistic authenticity and embodied accountability in truly an age of mechanical reproduction.</p>

<title>Imagery, Objectivity and Authenticity in the Age of Mobile Phones</title>
<p>When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470357213483056">Walter Benjamin (1968)</xref> wrote during the early part of the 20th century, he believed that photography and film belong to the artistic and the technological. Art, he claimed, produces an original object, an object of authenticity and aura. However, technology creates objects that are made for reproduction and therefore cannot be authentic. Through editing, close-up and slow-motion, ‘the camera introduces us to unconscious optics as does psychoanalysis to unconscious impulses’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470357213483056">Benjamin, 1968</xref>: 237). The viewer identifies no longer with the actor on stage or the person in the painting, but with the camera that ‘penetrates reality’ (p. 233). This fragmented reality, dissected by the camera, is perhaps today more pertinent than ever. We are surrounded by imagery and camera angles, close-ups and slow-motions and constantly invited to think about how our bodies, minds and social settings as intricately and intimately linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470357213483056">Protevi, 2009</xref>). Feminist theory has been most lucid about the ability of film and advertising media, in particular, to cut and dissect women’s bodies into piece-meal portions for easy (sexual) consumption, leaving the whole and actual woman behind. But today by use of mobile, digital and wireless technology, we are not only surrounded by or presented with imagery; we are producing, sharing and editing imagery. The subject’s involvement in the creation, re-creation and consumption of imagery questions the interrelations between ‘the self and society, the “inside” and the “outside” of the subject’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470357213483056">Braidotti, 2002</xref>: 20) and presents us with an ethical tension between the visual expression, the experience of viewing mobile phone footage and the viewer. This tension is particularly well expressed in citizen journalistic mobile phone imagery but also has a history in photojournalism and journalistic visuality.</p>
<p>Visuality has long had a tense relationship to traditional journalism in which the practice of objectivity as given by the written word has been characteristic of the favoured epistemology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470357213483056">Schudson, 1978</xref>). This ideal of objective relay of information leaves photojournalism as an additive to written news stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470357213483056">Zelizer, 2010</xref>). Photojournalism has often been seen as the blurring and contaminating aspect of hard news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470357213483056">Zelizer, 2010</xref>: 4), while objectivity in journalistic practice – both implying ‘professional objectivity’ and ‘self-abstraction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470357213483056">Peters, 2005</xref>), i.e. practice and ideology – has long been promoted in professional journalism and mediated communication as a model for public interaction and engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470357213483056">Dahlgren, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470357213483056">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357213483056">Habermas, 1989</xref>). The reliance on rationality and reason meant that photo-journalism – the knowledge production stimulated by sight and thereby physicality – was regarded as portraying associative or interpretive items that do not adhere to strictly rational knowledge production. However <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470357213483056">Zelizer (2010</xref>: 7) cautions ‘it may be … that rationality has been over-emphasized as a way of explaining public action, in large parts because it supports journalism’s own self-recognition as a project aligned with modernity.’ The tension between reason and emotions continues to inspire research and debate in journalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470357213483056">Blaagaard, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470357213483056">Pantti, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470357213483056">Richards and Rees, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470357213483056">Wahl-Jorgensen et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Whereas traditional photo-journalism has come under suspicion of political deceit and of photo-shopping and other technical and visual manipulation, documentaries have been criticised for being political tools (Moore, Gore) and iconic photographs have been exposed as staged (Capa), mobile phone footage is supposed to be different. Mobile phone footage is real, live action. Shot by a bystander, a person untouched by political bias or commercial forces of media institutions, who is therefore a true, ‘neutral’ witness – a return to the automated transfer of knowledge of which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470357213483056">Daston and Galison (2007)</xref> write. Simultaneously, however, mobile phone footage of extreme situations captures a moment of affect. It merges the viewer with the person holding the camera and with the fragmented, shaken view of the camera and thereby produces a traumatic image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470357213483056">Barthes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470357213483056">Zelizer, 2010</xref>). It is as if we are watching the ‘real thing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470357213483056">Slade, 2003</xref>). This narrative surrounding mobile phone footage has enabled journalistic photography to experience a revival as the seal of authenticity in citizen journalism.</p>
<p>Mobile phone footage is often located in the category of citizen journalism: reports from people who are in the right place at the right time to bear witness to catastrophe, terror and violence, and to record and disseminate their experiences online on content sharing sites such as YouTube, Flickr, Twitter, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470357213483056">Allan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470357213483056">Blaagaard, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470357213483056">Greer and McLaughlin, 2010</xref>). The grainy and often shaken picture quality and frames add a sense of realism to the report in which the mobile phone content is used, although clearly this revival of emotions’ challenge to journalistic objectivity is not without its problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470357213483056">Pantti, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470357213483056">Wahl-Jorgensen et al., 2010</xref>). Some professional journalists voice their concern about the faltering quality and compromised ethics of professional journalism exacerbated by, among other tendencies, the extensive use of citizens’ reports and pictures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470357213483056">Pantti, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470357213483056">Richards and Rees, 2011</xref>), while others see a process of embracing attachment and emotions into the journalistic war reporting culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470357213483056">Tumber and Prentoulis, 2003</xref>). Major mainstream media institutions’ collaboration with citizen journalists may produce a form of trust between public and journalism. However, it is a trust that can be easily broken; journalistic practices and organizations need to engage with citizen journalism on the grounds of, on the one hand, acknowledging that ‘someone out there always knows more about a story than you do’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470357213483056">Allan, 2007</xref>: 4). ‘“Right here, right now” citizen journalism can bring authenticity, immediacy and realism to news stories through the production of dramatic and visually powerful “evidence” of events “as they happen”’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470357213483056">Greer and McLaughlin (2010)</xref> contend. On the other hand, they advise, journalistic integrity is at stake. Citizen journalism’s lack of accountability means that news corporations likewise need to trust the citizen <italic>cum</italic> journalist that their reports, eyewitnesses and mobile phone footage are genuine and disseminated in good faith. The time-honoured journalistic values such as accuracy, objectivity and fairness are at stake. In addition, professional journalistic photography has recently been seen to move even further away from the journalistic principle of objectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470357213483056">Susanka, 2012</xref>) and towards an expression resembling, what I term, ‘embodied authenticity’ through the use of citizen journalistic mobile phone footage and its shaken and shaking qualities.</p>
<p>To sum up, while visual mobile phone footage is vouching for neutrality and unbiased reporting, it is simultaneously recognised as highly affective. This seemingly counter-intuitive way of visualising the news calls on an embodied objectivity because of its ability to forge a connection between affectivity and neutrality or detached reporting. In the following, I argue that what this brings about is a Barthesian ‘traumatic image’, which in turn is connected to our mediated state of consciousness or post-human condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470357213483056">Braidotti, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470357213483056">Hayles, 1999</xref>). This condition extends our vision and subjectivity beyond our bodies and through technology, and potentially redefines journalistic ethics.</p>

<title>The Traumatic Image of Mobile Phone Imagery</title>
<p>Despite the concern about the accuracy of citizens’ reports in mobile phone footage, they are sometimes seen as ‘more compelling because they [are] dim, grainy and shaky, but more importantly, because they [are] documenting an angle to an event as it [is] actually happening’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470357213483056">Allan, 2007</xref>: 13). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470357213483056">Christina Slade (2003</xref>: 36) makes a similar point in relation to reality TV and movies in which ‘it is the lack of professionalism that suggests that the story is true.’ The truth or authenticity is conveyed through a certain style of framing, which creates ‘the impression that the picture was <italic>taken</italic> rather than <italic>made</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470357213483056">Susanka, 2012</xref>: 106, emphasis in original). When the photographer – be it a citizen journalist or a professional photojournalist – succeeds in giving the impression of a <italic>taken</italic> picture, a stolen moment, he or she sometimes achieves the ‘traumatic’ imagery ‘about which there is nothing to say’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470357213483056">Barthes, 2000[1961]</xref>). This kind of image breaks and unsettles the structure of the journalistic practice and institution, and is therefore outside language – pure passion. Barthes develops the idea that the photographic image is considered objective because it lacks the connotative level. ‘Objectivity’ is here understood by Barthes in terms of photographs’ ‘purely “denotative” status’ (p. 198), that is, it shows what is there. However, Barthes quickly goes on to identify a number of ways in which the photograph as well as paintings, drawings, cinema and not least language also express a connotative level. The ‘trick effect’ (what today is better known as photo-shopped photos), the ‘pose’ of the photographed object or person, the actual objects in the photo, photogenia, aestheticism, and finally syntax (i.e. pictures in a sequence amounting to a sentence) (pp. 200–204) all carry connotations that make it possible to ‘read’ the photograph. Connotations, Barthes writes, are constituted through gestures, attitudes, expressions, colours, or effects, and are historically and culturally bound. They cannot be said to be eternal or universal, he concludes: ‘If such [photographic] denotation exists, it is perhaps not at the level of what ordinary language calls insignificant, the neutral, the objective, but, on the contrary, at the level of absolutely traumatic images’ (p. 209). He says that ‘trauma is the suspension of language’ and therefore simultaneously purely denotative and purely affect. The traumatic photograph sends the viewer into a state of shock, of pure affect, beyond the structure of language.</p>
<p>Barthes’ analysis of the photograph understood in correspondence to the situation of journalistic practices today supports the argument that journalistic ideology and professionalism still afford journalistic products an aura of objectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470357213483056">Peters, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470357213483056">Schudson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470357213483056">Ward, 2008</xref>). This aura entails the belief and trust that journalism does not carry other meanings than those intended by the journalist or those described in the words on the screen or on paper. But as readers and viewers, we also know that language is read and absorbed in a multitude of ways, and in ways that are constantly changing. We know that the meanings of words change and old television programmes, for example, seem quaint, out-dated and faulty. They reflect the society in which they were produced and for which they were intended. But sometimes images, stories, come along that leave us speechless, and without the journalistic structure to uphold the connotative level and institutional activity of journalism. These images are purely denotative in that they are outside language. It happened in 2001, when shaking pictures showed the western viewers the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center collapsing, and again in 2004 when the tsunami swept people away into the Indian Ocean. The grainy and shaken picture quality and frames added a sense of ‘authenticity’ to the reports in which mobile phone footage is used, thereby implicitly assuming an ethical stand. The mystification that comes with the assumption that the photographer or cameraperson must have been present at the moment of disaster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470357213483056">Barthes, 2000[1961]</xref>) breaks the mould of journalistic objectivity and practices and lets us perceive the images through affect. The implied ethical relation is no longer based on rationality and reason alone, but on embodied and empathic relation between subjects. In the following, I explore how this trauma, embodied affect fits into a larger frame of cultural imaginary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1470357213483056">
<title>The Filmic Qualities of the Global Imaginary</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470357213483056">Susan Sontag (2003</xref>: 23–24) writes: ‘Pictures of hellish events seem more authentic when they don’t have the look that comes from being “properly” lighted and composed.’ Although we – the 21st-century audience – know that television is not necessarily true, that simply because it can be observed, it is not necessarily objective, we still seem to be partial to an image that speaks to our emotions. What we seem to be acknowledging as true is imagery that speaks to our emotions on a fictional level, i.e. shaky framing, wobbly camera movements and scattered narrative seem to mimic documentary film making, which in turn is enmeshed in fictional screen plays and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470357213483056">Renov, 1993</xref>). The social imaginary is fraught with Hollywood imagery that makes what once ‘felt like in a dream’ today ‘feels like being in a film’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470357213483056">Sontag, 2003</xref>). Here Barthes’ traumatic image loses denotative expression and is re-installed into a cultural connotative language. As Barthes recognised, frame, pose, object, etc. all carry connotations – connotations that today are intertwined with fictional imagery.</p>
<p>Thus, recent professional journalistic war photography from Afghanistan portrays war in blurred and tilted imagery, angles and visions that usually occur under extreme circumstances and conditions. Photojournalists today are embedded with the military and take pictures showing the guns of the soldiers at the lower border of the photo as if the viewer <italic>is</italic> the soldier. Thus, immersing the viewer in the picture makes it possible to identify with the agent of war, the soldier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470357213483056">Susanka, 2012</xref>), not unlike computer game imagery. Importantly, Susanka notes that these new journalistic war photos suspend the rule of physical balance (p. 109). Although the blurred and shaken images are meant to represent the actual experience of being present, in reality we would not experience the world as shaky or skewed, because our sense of balance would compensate for this disequilibrium. The techniques that allow this urgency to be transmitted to the viewer are also demonstrated through a sense of closeness, proximity, of the viewer and the photographed object. The photojournalists will pick focal points and widths that are in accordance with the human eye and perception of reality and thus give an appearance of ‘an unmediated glance at reality’ (p. 105) and a sense of proximity. This development in recent photojournalism seems to imply a further creative inspiration taken from citizen journalistic products and a shift from objectivity as automated transfer of knowledge – to use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470357213483056">Daston and Galison’s (2007)</xref> terminology – to objectivity as embodied authenticity in photojournalistic work. The idea of what is authentic representation has changed from ‘how it would appear’ to ‘how it would feel’. That is, what the photos and citizen journalistic mobile phone footage are portraying is mediated <italic>experience</italic>, i.e. the bodily sensation or affects of being in a crisis situation or war zone mediated by filmic techniques, rather than what it would look like if the viewer were actually present in person and in body.</p>
<p>The mimicking of human eye–brain coordination and perception in professional photo-journalism so as to appear more like citizen journalistic mobile phone footage and relay an experience of being present and close to the event frames the footage. The framing of the photograph – the selection of reality that it represents – is an interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470357213483056">Butler, 2009</xref>). The actions of selecting an angle, zooming in on a face, directing one’s camera to an object are acts of editing or framing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470357213483056">Barthes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470357213483056">Van Leeuwen, 2005</xref>). They are actions of the citizen journalist as well as the professional photojournalist. Moreover, before the footage hits the television or computer screens, it has been framed in the sense that it is put into context by staff journalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470357213483056">Quandt, 2012</xref>). This frame is not static and, to a degree, citizen journalism in particular holds the power to change this frame. In fact, citizen journalism is often seen as enabling a different story from the ‘official’ version, thus challenging the frame given by mainstream media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470357213483056">Blaagaard, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470357213483056">Greer and McLaughlin, 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, the footage is sometimes technologically manipulated in order to make a particular aspect of the film more obvious or to hide what is deemed inappropriate. It is moreover shortened, paused and rehearsed, narrated and voiced-over online and on screen. This adds something to the perception of what is seen in the footage and, as such, functions as a way of editing, i.e. framing, the mobile phone footage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470357213483056">Van Leeuwen, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>All this would suggest that individual choices constitute the framing of the photo and footage. However, the mobile phone films and journalistic photographs are framed in terms of our social imaginary, the collective imagination that guides our common understanding of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357213483056">Appadurai, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470357213483056">Berger 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470357213483056">Zelizer, 2010</xref>). Despite the warnings of what the decline of rationality and reason in photojournalism and online social networks would mean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470357213483056">Quandt, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470357213483056">Susanka, 2012</xref>), recent research into photojournalism’s relation to society and political conscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357213483056">Azoulay, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470357213483056">Linfield, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470357213483056">Zelizer, 2010</xref>) suggest that photographs are vital in developing our political understanding of injustices in the world. Constant bombardment of images of suffering may provoke compassion fatigue or changes in mediation modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470357213483056">Chouliaraki, 2006</xref>), and simultaneously they show hope or a political commitment to the fact that the suffering will subside. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470357213483056">Judith Butler (2009)</xref>, concurring with Sontag, it is not the pictures alone, but also the frame that constructs their meaning and the norms through which they are understood that is at issue. She asserts that the frame is active ‘as both jettisoning and presenting, and as doing both at once, in silence, without any visible sign of its operation’ (p. 73). In doing so, the frame restricts our political consciousness and our understanding of the human and ‘grievable’ life. Because of this, photographs of suffering and violence are necessary in the struggle against suffering and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357213483056">Azoulay, 2008</xref>) but, importantly, an ability to see the frame is needed to critically assess the dehumanising norm of wars and suffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470357213483056">Butler, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470357213483056">Sontag (2003</xref>: 35) contends that the intent of the photographer does not determine the meaning of the photography, which will have its own career. The photograph, the image, gains meaning from its frame or from the social, cultural and political imaginary, the collective imagination through which it is interpreted. It is therefore a question of collective framing, the norm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470357213483056">Butler, 2009</xref>), or the collective imagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357213483056">Appadurai, 1996</xref>). It is a question of a society’s collective values – cultural and political – and how they circulate and are mediated in society. All this suggests that it is both the social and political agency of the photographer and the social and political context within which the photographer works and the photograph is viewed that – in multiple ways – construct the meaning and ethical implications of the image. In a mobile technological landscape emphasising imagery, this multiplicity becomes even more pronounced.</p>
<p>In <italic>Modernity at Large</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357213483056">1996</xref>), Arjun Appadurai theorises what he sees as the conjunction between globalisation and modernity. He proposes five –<italic>scapes</italic>, fluctuating and fluid dimensions of global cultural flows. They are <italic>ethnoscapes, technoscapes, financescapes, ideoscapes and mediascapes.</italic> Appadurai thinks of these -scapes as flows of intersections characterising the modern world. The latter two, ideoscape and mediascape, concern themselves with landscapes of images (p. 35). Mediascapes provide extensive imagery throughout the world and, like Sontag, Appadurai recognises the world of commodities and the world of news and politics as profoundly mixed. This mix in turn blurs the lines between fiction and reality and lays the groundwork for a collective imagination, an imagined world (rather than an imagined community, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357213483056">Anderson, 1991</xref>). Ideoscapes provide political images in relation to major western ideologies and their diasporic developments. The ideologies that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357213483056">Appadurai (1996</xref>: 36) identifies are ‘ideas, terms, images, including <italic>freedom, welfare, rights, sovereignty, representation</italic> and the master term <italic>democracy</italic>’ (emphases in original). The two -scapes in conjunction with each other and the three previously mentioned –scapes make out the flows of global culture. Mobile phone footage is part of this mediascape and the ideoscape insofar as it draws on existing interpretations and is expressed in journalistic framing. It blurs fictional and real conceptions and is an imbrication of personal experiences and social conventions, morphing according to their contexts. To paraphrase Sontag (1993), what used to be perceived as a personal dream sequence, is now a public film montage, recognised partly by (imagined) global society and represented as (universally) embodied. However, where do this filmic imaginary and global flow of cultural signs leave the body?</p>

<title>The Post-Human and Embodied Viewer</title>
<p>It is necessary, then, to discuss what we mean by ‘the body’ in an age of technological, mediated saturation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470357213483056">Peters (2001</xref>: 713, 717) argues that ‘to bear witness is to put one’s body on the line … The body is authenticity’s last refuge in situations of structural doubt’, and scholars of cybernetics and informatics have argued that the division between body and consciousness and technology is nonsensical. Indeed,<disp-quote>
<p>the overlay between the enacted and the represented bodies is no longer a natural inevitability but a contingent production, mediated by a technology that has become so entwined with the production of identity that it can no longer meaningfully be separated from the human subject. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470357213483056">Hayles, 1999</xref>: xiii)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What, then, is the role of the body in journalistic authenticity and knowledge production?</p>
<p>Hayles makes a call for a broader understanding of subjectivity as ‘a multiple warranted by the body rather than contained within it’ (p. 27). Feminist philosopher Braidotti’s nomadic subjectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470357213483056">2011</xref>) subjectivity goes even further and stresses the embodiment of thinking by investing ‘all that lives, even inorganic matter, with the power of consciousness in the sense of self-affection’ (p. 2). Neither theorist wishes to escape the flesh or disembody thought through technology. To them, technology itself – silicon, wiring, metal – is material and endowed with consciousness through its relation with others. Likewise, communication needs vocal cords or fingers and hands. Therefore, nomadic subjects, like Hayles’s embodied post-human, are ‘a socially mediated process of relation and negotiations with multiple others and with multi-layered social structures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470357213483056">Braidotti, 2011</xref>: 4). Thus, as Braidotti succinctly puts it: ‘virtual reality is in fact densely material, and the digital is just the social by another name’ (p. 12). Being post-human suggests a life lived <italic>in</italic> media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357213483056">Deuze, 2012</xref>); a human subject not centred but multiple through material and affective connections, and occupying a space complete with organic and inorganic relations on equal terms.</p>
<p>In her seminal work in cybernetics, <italic>How We Became Post-Human</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470357213483056">Hayles (1999)</xref> argues that certain parts of the scholarship in cybernetics have focused on the technology–human relationship, branding flesh as obsolete and heralding a new age of disembodied thought online and in virtual reality. This aspect of cybernetics, Hayles suggests, sees materiality and information as two separate things. Materiality is expressed in presence and absence, whereas information is expressed in patterns and randomness. The argument goes that information – and concomitantly pattern/randomness – has replaced the humanist emphasis on materiality, i.e. presence/absence, as a defining feature of communication. However, Hayles challenges this binary distinction between materiality and information. She makes a call for rethinking the interplay between the two axes and the recognition of embodiment, which is necessary for subjectivity. Hayles envisions the axes as axes of a semiotic square (pp. 248–250). But the terms pattern/randomness and absence/presence are not static; rather they are in dynamic dialectics with each other creating indefinite new dialectics and new modes of communication. Thus, whereas the dialectic between absence and presence is materiality and between randomness and patterns is information, the dialectic between absence and pattern is <italic>hyperreality</italic>, or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470357213483056">Baudrillard’s (1985)</xref> <italic>simulacra</italic>. The dialectic between randomness and presence, which Hayles calls <italic>mutation</italic>, ‘testifies to the mark that randomness leaves on presence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470357213483056">Hayles, 1999</xref>: 249). The example Hayles offers is when a random event intervenes in an organism’s genetic code and changes its material form. However, I would argue that we may also speak of an intervention into an organism’s emotional mode, which would likewise produce material changes, such as emotionally charged physical expressions (tears, shaking, shouting) or political actions (voting, demonstrating, writing an opinion piece). That is, mutation relates to post-human subjectivity of which the body is a part. This embodied subjectivity is an inter- and ever-changing sum of connections and actions, encompassing inorganic materiality. With ‘the body’ thus reworked as embodied subjectivity, authenticity may be found in the mutation of materiality and information, i.e. the randomness that disrupts or traumatises our vision, making the viewer of mobile phone footage post-human.</p>
<p>Unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470357213483056">Chouliaraki’s (2006</xref>: 157–183) concept of <italic>ecstatic news</italic>, which is based on rupture in the perception of time and space, and allows spectators to witness live events while called on to recognise their own situatedness and the technological mediation, Hayles’s <italic>mutation</italic> between randomness and presence does not encompass a journalistic news narrative to ‘normalise’ the rupture. Whereas ecstatic news ‘reserves the spectators’ capacity to connect for those who are like “us”’ (p. 181), the post-human viewer is not limited to journalistic news production and can therefore reject the journalistic ethos of ‘us’ and ‘them’. The post-human viewer acknowledges the link between seeing and the mind, knowledge and visual representation but tries to ‘queer the <italic>self</italic>-evidence of witnessing, of experience, of the conventionally upheld and invested perceptions of clear distinctions between subject and object’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470357213483056">Haraway, 1997</xref>: 267, emphasis added).</p>
<p>In summary, whereas the power of photography, emphasised by the connection between the visual and the sensory, makes imagery neither fact nor fiction, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470357213483056">Sontag (2003)</xref> noted, the mediated nature of citizen journalistic mobile phone footage means that it belongs to neither human nor machine but to a post-human mutation, digitally social, connection driven by and infused with affect. The self, the body, the human which has for so long been a voucher for evidence and authenticity is called into question, extended, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470357213483056">McLuhan (1967)</xref> predicted, in terms of physicality as well as affectivity. I want to take this definition of the relation between the post-human and knowledge production to a concrete reading of a mobile phone footage event in order to explore the ethical implications of the post-human as witness.</p>

<sec id="section5-1470357213483056">
<title>Dying in Media: The Death of Neda Agha-Soltan</title>
<p>The public death of 27-year-old Iranian philosophy student, Neda Agha-Soltan, during the 2009 demonstration against the Iranian election,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1470357213483056">3</xref></sup> serves as an example of the theories discussed above. I will explore this case in light of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470357213483056">Barthes’ (2000[1961])</xref> ‘traumatic image’, Appadurai’s mediascape and political social imagery on a global as well as a local scale, and the implications of the post-human body as witness.</p>
<p>The footage of Neda’s death is 54 seconds long and shows us – the viewers along with the man holding the mobile phone filming – moving towards Neda, who is already on the ground. Her knees have fallen to the sides, there is blood on the ground and two men are kneeling beside her, bending over her face. One of them, wearing a blue-and-white striped t-shirt, is her music teacher. The other in a white shirt was later identified as Dr Arash Hejazi.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1470357213483056">4</xref></sup> We move to the left around one of the men to find Neda’s face framed in their hands. Her own hands have fallen to the ground and the two men’s hands are pressing on her neck, presumably to stop the bleeding. Her eyes, now famously, turn toward the mobile phone (the man who is holding it) and us, and blood runs from her mouth and nose. We move back a little to give room to some more people. There is a glimpse of the stomach and shirtsleeve of a man and somebody’s denim trousers in the frame. We circle the crowd and end up on Neda’s left side. The number of hands around Neda’s face increases and the sounds of yelling and cries for help, which were desperate enough, suddenly rise in intensity. Neda’s face is now streaked with blood. Another man in a white shirt kneels down and crouches over the top of her head. There is yelling and the screen goes black. A second goes by and the filming is resumed away from Neda, approximating the starting point of the initial filming. A finger is in front of the mobile phone’s lens for a while then we move back to Neda for some erratic close-ups of her body and face intercepted by the man in the blue-and-white striped t-shirt.</p>
<p>At no point is the film still; it shakes, wobbles, skips and jolts. Neda’s face is rarely at the centre of the frame. Most of the footage is unclear and in the original footage it is difficult to tell that Neda has turned her eyes towards the mobile phone and the viewer. The angle is that of a standing person, reflecting the height of the anonymous man or woman who is filming. Far from only recording the facts of the events, the people who are present, the blood and the attempts to help, the footage connotes the chaos, desperation and fear of the event. It shocks us and calls on the viewer to help because we seem to be right there next to her.</p>
<p>The footage of Neda’s death is a trauma, in Barthes’ sense, because it was a recording of what was there, but simultaneously it communicated shock and disbelief, i.e. emotions and affect. It is in particular Neda’s return of the gaze that makes us present, as present as she is/was. As she is looking into a mobile phone’s lens, we are looking at a computer or mobile phone, tablet, etc. Both her and our presence is equally in a mediated space as our experiences are expanded through wireless technology, the materiality of the fingers pressing the buttons on the mobile phone, and the screen is a part of our post-human bodies. This is possible because of the <italic>mutation</italic> taking place between randomness and presence, which is created through information technology and post-human embodiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470357213483056">Hayles, 1999</xref>). But this mutual presence is moreover facilitated by the multi-modal way we experience, through the wobbly and grainy images, the chaos and affect. Although, we may not be there in our bodies as facts, it is not fiction either. Neda is dying in media.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1470357213483056">5</xref></sup> She is no longer living matter; her tragic and violent death became a symbol of diverse and counter intuitive struggles, and in that sense too she is post-human.</p>
<p>However, recalling that ‘to bear witness is to put one’s body on the line … The body is authenticity’s last refuge in situations of structural doubt’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470357213483056">Peters, 2001</xref>: 713, 717), the martyr, the dying body and the body in pain, in this case Neda, is the ultimate witness. Despite the strong arguments for the return of the body of flesh and blood that argue that affects alone do not warrant knowledge transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470357213483056">Livingston and Asmolov, 2010</xref>) and that virtual dissent does not produce real political action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470357213483056">Koukal, 2010</xref>), these arguments assume that technology and subjectivity are disconnected. As I argued and underlined in this analysis, the viewer becomes both the passive and active witness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470357213483056">Peters, 2001</xref>) as we move with the person holding the mobile phone. There seems to be no gap between the real experience and the film because our understanding of reality is filmic. The viewer is post-human: embodied and affective perception of imagery such as Neda’s death cannot be dissected and divided neatly into categories of political, emotional, activist, detached, mediated. The person holding the mobile phone filming Neda dying is likewise post-human in his relation to Neda, the viewers and within the global imaginary. Ideas of the rational divide between fact and fiction in our perception and experience of imagery and by means of our bodily authenticity are already challenged.</p>
<p>Summing up: our technologically extended bodies, looking at Neda and meeting her gaze, present an ethically new way of visualising the news through a post-human position. This is a position that not only questions experiences of fact and fiction but also challenges ideas of ‘them’ and ‘us’, inside and outside the body, and which is exemplified by mobile phone imagery. The link between vision, the physical body and knowledge production is reframed due to the dialectic between randomness and presence, technology and body.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470357213483056">Daston and Galison’s (2007)</xref> reasoned image, automated transfer of knowledge and trained judgment of objectivity all relied on a clear distinction between the body, the representation and knowledge production. The way a subject perceived an object produced certain knowledge about the object. A reasoned image was a re-production of the object by a subject, the photograph introduced an automatic re-production of the object, presumably without the interference of the subject, and trained judgment allowed a privileged and knowledgeable subject to interpret the object. Today the subject–object–knowledge distinction is less clear. The relationship between vision or representation, the physical body, and knowledge production is still at the core of our understanding of evidence (i.e. what is true and authentic) but the <italic>self</italic>-evidence of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470357213483056">Haraway, 1997</xref>) as a limited and known entity vouching for authenticity is no longer stable or even viable. In order to understand the power of the Neda footage and its call for an ethics of imagery, we need to rethink the relationship between the object (Neda), the viewer or subject, and the knowledge that comes from that relationship.</p>
<p>Through the mediated relationship, the technologically enhanced self or post-human viewer is also a producer and editor of the reality perceived through photograph or mobile phone footage. The camera and the selves, if not melted into one, have then mutated and connected in new ways. Ethically, journalistic authenticity – and with it journalistic accountability – is caught in the ongoing debate and tension between emotions and objectivity. Emotional or affective authenticity can be seen somewhere on a scale between interpretations and traumatic images. In contrast, objectivity relies on automated transfer and uncontaminated facts. Embodied authenticity from a post-human perspective challenges both stances in that it argues that technology – the medium itself – is embodied and thus never detached, but also never only personally interpretive. The medium connects knowledge productions to global flows that are always already there. Rather than placing mobile phone imagery in one or the other camp, it is an expression of this post-human perspective.</p>
<p>The mobile phone imagery of Neda dying produced a ‘traumatic image’ through its simultaneously neutral and affective expressions. On the one hand, we were passive witnesses behind a screen, on the other we were embodied and moving with the camera and the person behind it. This duality is mirrored in our post-human condition that merges technology or randomness of knowledge production with body or physical presence and is emphasised through our filmic social imaginary. Whereas mobile phone footage is part of the flow of global culture, it affects us through the technology with which we are imbricated. Authenticity is no longer to be found in original works of art and their aura (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470357213483056">Benjamin, 1968</xref>), or the liveness of witnessing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470357213483056">Peters, 2001</xref>); indeed witnessing itself is being called into question because post-human ethically relational perspective assumes a body which has extended and is no longer merely flesh but a larger consciousness encompassing inorganic materiality. It is within these new frames of post-human subjectivity that photojournalistic authenticity and an ethics of imagery re-emerge.</p>
