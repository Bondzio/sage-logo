<p>Using language samples from 3- to 5-year-old developing African American English (AAE) speakers in southwest Louisiana, the author of an earlier landmark work on the grammar of adult AAE documents how children acquire the language structures, meanings, and patterns of use of their communities. In this book, Green, a scholar in theoretical syntax, establishes child AAE as a complete system with consistent developmental benchmarks. Through a methodical inquiry into the linguistic components of the AAE system Green shows that its acquisition is not an imperfect attempt to acquire Mainstream American English (MAE). She challenges accounts of AAE which privilege the role of features maximally different from MAE while demonstrating, conversely, that overlapping forms are not always isomorphic in terms of their respective meanings in each variety. Green ends the book by discussing practical applications for the developmental patterns in the data, using an evidence-based approach to create an awareness of what meanings children target when using AAE to approach the MAE system.</p>
<p>Through recourse to ample excerpts of real conversations in the book, Green unlocks the distinct forms and functions of structures ranging from copula marking in both stative and eventive sentences to negative concord marking across relative clause barriers. Along these lines, Green writes at the vanguard of burgeoning research in child AAE and syntactic variation; she has also produced a work that is accessible as a reference for speech pathologists, teachers, and early childhood educators.</p>
<p>The book’s first chapter reviews the literature on child AAE since the 1970s, from foundational work on descriptive frameworks for AAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0142723712455964">Stockman &amp; Vaughn-Cooke, 1982</xref>) to studies of exemplar morphological forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142723712455964">Kovac, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142723712455964">Steffensen, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0142723712455964">Stokes, 1976</xref>) to practical research on assessment and literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142723712455964">Charity Hudley &amp; Mallinson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0142723712455964">Craig &amp; Washington, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0142723712455964">Labov, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142723712455964">Seymour, Roeper, &amp; J. de Villiers, with P. A. de Villiers, 2003</xref>). Green then gives a sketch of the speech community and the history of the project; she has been working in the same early child care center since 2003, collecting data from both spontaneous conversations and elicited tasks that include production and comprehension activities. Finally, she gives examples of features which make the variety in question similar to other regional AAEs (r-vocalization, consonant cluster reduction, use of <italic>finna/fitna</italic> = ‘getting ready to’) as well as to Southwest Louisiana Vernacular English (expletive <italic>it</italic> followed by <italic>have</italic>, affirmative and negative tags <italic>yes/yeah</italic> and <italic>no</italic>).</p>
<p>Chapter 2 begins by critiquing earlier attempts to characterize the AAE system (including feature lists and dual components) and discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. For example, Green argues that traditional feature lists and dialect density measures (DDM), while serving as a handy tool for practitioners, do not capture dynamic properties of inherent variation or language development. Instead, she advocates a patterns- and systems-based approach which provides an explanatory mechanism for the processes of AAE acquisition while recognizing the complexity of strategies children use to convey messages within a ‘multidimensional, multifarious communicative system . . . [which] as a system of communication, has a range of uses and can be used by some, not all, speakers in varying degrees’ (p. 32). This model has the advantage of being able to capture nested hierarchies between isolated features (preverbal <italic>had</italic>), systematic properties exhibited by those features (verbs of achievement and accomplishment are more frequently marked with preverbal <italic>had</italic>), and finally, overarching systems (a unitary account of tense- and aspect-marking in terms of a suite of grammaticalized markers, including preverbal <italic>had</italic>).</p>
<p>Chapters 3 and 4 begin the analysis proper by addressing children’s system of tense-aspect marking in both non-past/habitual and past contexts, with particular attention to how verb forms are used for talking about type and time of eventualities (e.g. events vs. states). In non-past contexts, for example, the copula and auxiliary <italic>BE</italic> form may or may not be present in children’s speech (<italic>They</italic> Ø<sub><italic>COP</italic></sub> <italic>tall</italic> or <italic>They</italic> Ø<sub><italic>AUX</italic></sub> <italic>talking</italic> vs. <italic>And he<underline>’s</underline> a boy or It<underline>’s</underline> not a good dance</italic>); however, the overt and zero forms occur consistently in the same environments across speakers. Overt <italic>BE</italic> occurs, for example, in the following contexts: (1) past (<italic>And then I <underline>was</underline> the winner</italic>), (2) first person singular (<italic>Where I<underline>’m</underline> at?</italic>), (3) sentence-finally (<italic>What color they <underline>are</underline>?</italic>) as well as (4) in (perhaps unanalyzed) forms <italic>it<underline>’s</underline>/what<underline>’s</underline>/that<underline>’s</underline></italic> (<italic>That<underline>’s</underline> the walkie talks</italic>). Conversely, Green argues that the zero form of copula auxiliary regularly occurs in contexts in which it would redundantly mark an event, as in <italic>He</italic> Ø<sub><italic>AUX</italic></sub> <italic>try<underline>ing</underline> to dance</italic> and <italic>And then Mama say, ‘Ya’ll</italic> Ø<sub><italic>AUX</italic></sub> <italic><underline>gon</underline> catch a spanking!’</italic> In these contexts, she argues that the markers <italic>gon(/fitna/sposeta/bouta</italic>) and morphologized –<italic>ing</italic> already indicate an event (e.g. the verb is in progress), so the overt verbal form (auxiliary <italic>BE</italic>) is not required on the surface. In this way, Green describes a situation where, as children develop, they get evidence from the variable input in their communities that, for example, copula or auxiliary <italic>BE</italic> may occur optionally in some environments, such as before a NP (<italic>The other one is the white one</italic>) or when it is stressed; furthermore, the child’s acquisition device must be able to process and produce the (systematized) variable forms.</p>
<p>In the second half of chapter 3, Green presents data which distinguish the function of copula/auxiliary <italic>BE</italic> from that of aspectual <italic>be</italic> (<italic>be</italic><sub><italic>ASP</italic></sub><italic>)</italic>, which is used for marking habitual eventualities (Akila: <italic>‘Cause when I watch Blues Clues, my eyes be like this</italic> &lt;makes blinking motion with eyes&gt;). Here, Green presents convincing evidence from comprehension tasks that children associate <italic>be</italic><sub><italic>ASP</italic></sub> with habitual meaning, as in adult AAE: when children were presented with a scenario where a character is portrayed as eating a turkey sandwich day after day (but not at the speech time or present), they chose that character as the answer to the target question <italic>Who be eating turkey sandwiches?</italic> (i.e. even though Bruce is portrayed in the last story frame to be eating, as a change of pace, soup). Here, Green reports that children as a group scored at least 48% accuracy on each aspectual <italic>be</italic> scenario and as high as 72% accuracy on one of the six scenarios.</p>
<p>In chapter 4, Green discusses the distribution and function of two additional invariant tense-aspect markers which occur in children’s speech: preverbal <italic>had</italic> and remote past <italic>BIN</italic> (rendered in capitals since it must be stressed). Adult AAE speakers use preverbal <italic>had</italic> to mark the MAE function of simple past: thus, in the sentence <italic>Bruce had left when the game started</italic>, Bruce’s leaving does not occur (at least in adult AAE) farther in the past than <italic>when the game started</italic>; it only occurs in the past relative to speech time. Green presents speech data from several speakers which illustrate that in child AAE, preverbal <italic>had</italic> does not only situate an event in the past, but marks the achievement or accomplishment of that event. Thus, <italic>He <underline>had</underline> uh uh went up the slide with me</italic> marks a completed, accomplished event whereas [LJG: . . . <italic>what else did you do with him?] <underline>Slide</underline> with him</italic> emphasizes the ongoing nature of the activity (sliding). Correspondingly, children use preverbal marker <italic>BIN</italic> to talk about events that occurred in the remote past, the same function which occurs in adult AAE: <italic>Bruce BIN</italic> reading mystery novels means ‘Bruce has been reading mystery novels for a long time.’ Green illustrates, with comprehension data drawn from 10 elicitation tasks, that children have developing knowledge of the function of remote past <italic>BIN</italic>: overall they scored 73% accuracy on all <italic>BIN</italic> scenarios, with scores increasing with age.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 continues the analysis proper of child AAE grammar with an in-depth discussion of negative concord, yes-no questions, and <italic>wh</italic>-questions. Green observes that as in developing MAE, child AAE speakers use multiple negating elements in sentences like <italic>They did<underline>n’t</underline> have <underline>no</underline> books</italic> to mark a single negative meaning. She provides evidence that the children in her study not only produce negative concord structures, but interpret them reliably, even when negative elements originate inside structures which had elsewhere been understood as boundaries to concord relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142723712455964">Coles-White, de Villiers, &amp; Roeper, 2004</xref>). For example, Green gives elicitation task results which indicate that for the children in her study the negative concord reading in <italic>Who did<underline>n’t</underline> get <underline>no</underline> cookie with <underline>no</underline> rainbow sprinkles on top?</italic> extends across the preposition <italic>with</italic> to agree with <italic>no rainbow sprinkles</italic> (children scored 92% accuracy on this scenario).</p>
<p>In chapter 6, an examination of the strategies children use to produce yes-no and <italic>wh-</italic>questions, Green considers variable input from adult AAE in which auxiliaries may or may not be (prototypically, for yes-no questions) inverted and in which speakers may or may not use the contour of a sentence-final rise in pitch. She finds that variable patterns for other structures, for instance, variable <italic>BE</italic>, are also reflected in interrogatives: the data show that children delete copula (auxiliary) in non-prototypical (uninverted) questions like <italic>They pretty?</italic> but not with <italic>It’s/What’s/That’s</italic>, as in <italic>That’s the dad?</italic> Because of these uniform effects, Green argues that non-prototypical (subject-initial) questions are not simply truncated or reduced, nor do they necessarily show that children have not acquired the inversion process. By contrast, the results consistently reflect the variable input patterns of adult AAE syntax. Furthermore, children generally show the presence of (non-copula) auxiliaries in environments where they are required for a distinct meaning (<italic><underline>Can</underline> I use the duck talk to huh</italic> (<italic>huh</italic> ‘her’)<italic>?</italic> or function, as in negation (<italic>He <underline>did</underline>n’t broke this one?</italic>).</p>
<p>In the last two chapters, Green deconstructs processes of moving ‘back and forth’ between AAE and MAE by distinguishing between intra-dialectal or variable-shifting and inter-dialectal or ‘true’ code-shifting. Here, children need not move ‘into’ MAE to produce forms which happen to be compatible with MAE but which are actually variants within the AAE system. For example, in talking about the past, children have four variants available to them, represented in the phrase <italic>I (had) start(ed) the pinball machine</italic>. Green argues that the more accurate way to ‘slice’ the overall picture may be not to consider which forms occur in MAE and which do not, but instead to accurately specify the semantic and pragmatic contexts in which all variants occur within (developmental stages of) the AAE system: do preverbal <italic>had</italic> and morphologized –<italic>ed</italic> mark the same sort of meaning (perfective)? If so, do they exist in a concord relationship?</p>
<p>These linguistically-informed kinds of questions, she emphasizes, should be considered in making MAE accessible to students in school environments; here, prescriptively-grounded characterizations (‘<italic>grammatical-in MAE-or-NOT_</italic>’) may be less useful than principled understandings of which forms may be most salient to children and the functional reasons why. For example, variable past tense –<italic>ed</italic> may redundantly mark a perfective-type situation in conjunction with preverbal <italic>had</italic> (and, moreover, simple past –<italic>ed</italic> meanings may be retrievable from context) whereas –<italic>ing</italic> might be indispensable in progressive or <italic>be</italic><sub><italic>ASP</italic></sub> contexts since it gives crucial information about events (they are in progress or have a recurrence-type property).</p>
<p>Overall, Green’s nuanced, systematic inquiry is powerful enough to jolt ‘seasoned’ AAE scholars into taking a fresh look at old, familiar structures in a new way – not only with respect to MAE, but from the perspective of the unitary system of developing children themselves.</p>
