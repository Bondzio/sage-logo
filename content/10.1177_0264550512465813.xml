<abstract>
<p>This article looks at the marketization of the criminal justice system from a user perspective. Using a combination of personal and professional experience, the author explores the development of a market within the system, starting with an examination of what the system is trying to achieve. The ‘primary customer’ of the system is then discussed, highlighting in the author’s view how the emphasis of NOMS has been moving away from the person serving a sentence as being its primary customer. This then leads into a discussion of how a market has developed within a system that doesn’t have its main consumer as its primary customer, and some of the potential problems that this causes. While slightly pessimistic about the way that the market currently operates, the article concludes by calling for a shift in who is seen as being NOMS’s  primary customer, if a fair and effective market is to be developed in the future.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>When I was first approached about writing this article, it was with a view to providing an ‘ex-user’ and/or ‘user organization’s’ perspective on marketization. I have personal experience of having been on probation. I have also worked for Unlock, the National Association of Reformed Offenders, for the last four years. So, I will attempt to provide both perspectives in one.</p>
<p>Unlock does not tender for government contracts to deliver services; its financial status reflects this; it has little in the way of money. Nevertheless, as a result, the organization is well-placed to honestly reflect the views of individuals, without having a vested interest in promoting a particular agenda, service or type of support. I will attempt to write from a collective perspective, rather than just from my own. However, this is always fraught with difficulty, so I have a caveat; it’s impossible to reflect the views of all those who have been through the criminal justice system. After all, everyone is different.</p>
<p>In this article, I hope to examine the impact that marketization has had from the perspective of people who have personally been through the system (a user perspective),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0264550512465813">1</xref></sup> and I will discuss the potential future for marketization from the perspective of this group. A useful complement to this discussion is an article written by my colleague, Chris Bath, which discusses some of the tensions that are raised in this piece, but from the perspective of organizations working in the criminal justice system (CJS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0264550512465813">Bath, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0264550512465813">
<title>What is the system trying to achieve?</title>
<p>A fundamental question relating to the criminal justice system is this; what is it trying to achieve? It sounds a simple one, but it’s one that often receives various responses. Is it to punish ‘offenders’ (who are referred to in this article as ‘people serving a sentence’)? Perhaps it’s to rehabilitate them? To some, it’s to serve victims. The ‘formal’ answer can be found by looking at the statement of purpose of NOMS; ‘to protect the public and reduce reoffending by delivering the punishment and orders of the courts and supporting rehabilitation by helping offenders to reform their lives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0264550512465813">NOMS, 2012</xref>). This statement of purpose is confusing. NOMS seems to have two purposes; to protect the public <italic>and</italic> to reduce re-offending. It is difficult to reconcile the two, especially when they will be competing with one another in various ways – which one takes priority in such circumstances?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0264550512465813">
<title>Who is the primary ‘customer’?</title>
<p>Ordinary markets work on the basis of supply and demand, generated from the users of the product or service. However, in the CJS, people serving a sentence have no choice about whether they want to be in that group; they are compelled by the courts. Furthermore, they have little choice about what ‘services’ they use. For example, you can’t choose which prison you go in.</p>
<p>A natural starting question would be to ask who is intended to benefit from the provision of these services? In the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0264550512465813">Home Office (2004</xref>) response to the Carter report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0264550512465813">Carter, 2004</xref>), it is clear that NOMS exists to provide a service to the law-abiding public both by punishing offenders and by reducing re-offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0264550512465813">Home Office, 2004</xref>). As a result, historical conceptions of the person serving a sentence being a legitimate individual client, service user, or even partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0264550512465813">Bottoms and McWilliams, 1979</xref>) have been replaced with the person serving a sentence being re-branded as an object of risk-reducing intervention. That said, a number of recent studies suggest that probation agencies and, more significantly, probation practitioners, have not fully adopted this centrally prescribed construction of the Probation Officer/offender relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0264550512465813">Robinson, 2002</xref>). This is certainly reflected in the conversations I’ve had with both people on probation and Probation Officers themselves. These relationships often seem to be constituted as a result of the preferences of the individual parties (although more often dominated by the style of the ‘offender manager’).</p>
<p>The direction of travel has very much been towards constructing the person serving a sentence as having a predetermined set of risks and needs, at which a discrete set of interventions are then targeted. The person serving a sentence is neither the subject nor the consumer, but rather the object on which the process operates. As a group, those serving a sentence have things ‘done to them’. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0264550512465813">Morgan (2003</xref>) explains:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Offenders can scarcely be considered the customers of the probation service. It is not they who decide whether or not to have contact. Others do that for them. Offenders are instructed to comply. They constitute the material on which the service works.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>However, as our knowledge of the process of desistance has grown, what has emerged is an inherently subjective, interactive relationship which, if recognized as being valuable, will need to be supported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0264550512465813">McNeill, 2006</xref>). If you regard somebody serving a sentence as a mere object of interventions, it will progressively undermine the legitimacy (from the individual’s point of view) of the work that is being done to help, and thus its potential to support desistance. As a result, while it may be tempting in a punitive climate for services to strip people serving a sentence of their status as ‘clients’, ‘consumers’ or even ‘stakeholders’, it risks jeopardizing future success.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this failure to recognize people serving a sentence as the primary customer has resulted in NOMS viewing ‘the public’ as its primary customer. While it would clearly be right to include ‘the public’ as a relevant stakeholder, by positioning the public as the notional consumer, the state has created and exploited an increasingly antagonistic dichotomization of the ‘law-abiding’ public and people serving sentences. Not only does the ‘law-abiding’ as a group not exist in practice (who can say they’ve never done something that could be classed as illegal?), this fundamental shift excludes the person serving a sentence and installs a far more demanding (and far less rewarding) relationship between the state and the individual in which the obligations flow mainly from the individual to the state. Ultimately, for NOMS to achieve its dual purposes of ‘protecting the public’ and ‘reducing reoffending’, it requires people serving sentences to not reoffend. It goes without saying that, with such a critical part of NOMS’s purposes relying on the individual, this person should be the primary customer of NOMS. Of course, in order to benefit this customer, NOMS needs to engage in partnerships and arrangements with others, but throughout all of these processes, the primary customer would, and should, be the person serving a sentence.</p>

<title>The role of marketization</title>
<p>Marketization is the process by which market forces are imposed in public services which have traditionally been developed, delivered and financed by local and central government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0264550512465813">Whitfield, 2006</xref>). Privatization is ‘more than asset stripping the public sector. It is a comprehensive strategy for permanently restructuring the welfare state and public services in the interests of capital’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0264550512465813">Whitfield, 1983</xref>). Marketization and privatization are inseparable, with the former creating the economic and ideological conditions and social relationships by which privatization is developed.</p>
<p>When markets work well they bring benefits such as cost reduction, service innovation, and responsiveness through competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0264550512465813">Armstrong, 2007</xref>). Providers who offer unwanted services or charge too much for needed ones will be driven out of the marketplace, while market participants that respond imaginatively to requests for service will gain an advantage by distinguishing themselves from their competitors. Fully realising these market efficiencies requires the optimal conditions of a large and balanced number of buyers and sellers. Unfortunately, the criminal justice system isn’t like most other markets. As discussed above, NOMS (at least not formally) doesn’t recognize people serving a sentence as their primary customer. In trying to develop a market, this inevitably causes problems. There is recognition within NOMS that it cannot deliver everything. This fits well with the new government’s agenda. The Coalition Government’s Green Paper, <italic>Breaking the Cycle: Effective Punishment, Rehabilitation and Sentencing of Offenders</italic>, represents a further attempt to involve business and charities into delivering governmental agendas. <italic>Breaking the Cycle</italic> proposals reconfigure the voluntary sector’s function, opening up the possibility of charities competing with others to undertake what has traditionally been seen as the preserve of statutory agencies. This is not new for NOMS; the gradual marketization since the inception of NOMS has led to a plethora of contract management, a function that the state is not used to performing. But what kind of market are we trying to develop?</p>
<p>There is a wide range of large and small voluntary, charitable, public and private organizations that can and do make a significant contribution to services for people serving a sentence. NOMS sees its role in developing the commercial capability of the sector by challenging its service providers to deliver more effectively to raise performance, to improve quality and to deliver better value for money (Local <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0264550512465813">Partnerships, 2010</xref>). However, it has some way to go before it truly generates a competitive market. One only has to look at the management of private prisons to see that the conditions are far from ideal; the usual private bidders emerge, although increasingly alongside others to boost their prospects (for example, the Serco and Catch 22 consortium). On the ground, rarely do people serving a sentence have much interest of who is helping them.</p>
<p>The rationale behind developing a market in providing services to people serving a sentence is that no single provider is able to meet the diverse and challenging needs of all those serving a sentence; this is true. However, it is my view that NOMS have, in the past, tried too hard to help people serving a sentence. This may sound like a strange thing to state, coming from my perspective; what I mean by this is that NOMS have been guilty of trying to solve all of the problems themselves. This is noticeable in some of the contracts that they commissioned in their earlier days to help with issues such as housing and employment. It is also evident to this day in the form of prison education (although NOMS are not the funder of this area). Now, it is not my contention that NOMS (or others) should not be trying to help in these areas; my point is that they should not be creating a niche market for ‘specialist’ providers. Wherever possible, mainstream providers with the skills and expertise to help should be engaged (and perhaps funded accordingly, because of the specialist circumstances which they are being faced with). While an understanding of those that they are helping is obviously a necessity, this can easily be provided, without resulting in what is often the case currently whereby people serving a sentence are unfairly seen as ‘something different’ that a ‘specialist’ needs to help with. The risk to this strategy is that you lose the value and experience that specialist CJS agencies have built up; this has to be harnessed, but in a way that achieves the right balance between mainstream and specialist provision.</p>
<p>However, it is also true that, given the points above about who the primary customer should be, NOMS needs to do more to connect providers (whether mainstream or specialist) with customers in a way that is beneficial to the development of services that meet the needs of the client group. Currently, at a commissioning level, NOMS appears to be remote when it comes to deciding what to commission. Whether in practice this is true or not I am not sure; my experience of commissioning is limited. However, there is little evidence of increasing marketization in the CJS resulting in services which better match the needs of people serving a sentence. There needs to be a clear process by which NOMS can be seen to be commissioning what is needed. This requires an unbiased evidence base. It is my contention that this ‘evidence’ should principally come from either those individuals who are serving a sentence (or have in the past), or from those without a vested interest in what is commissioned. Increasingly, NOMS is looking to fund outcomes rather than activities. While this is a noble ambition, what this often results in is providers bidding to deliver what they currently deliver, claiming that it is needed by the client group. I have seen little to suggest that the assessments made by providers in relation to need are rigorously examined or independently verified. Unfortunately, my current feeling is that NOMS is swayed by providers who are pushing their own agenda. This does nothing to support the development of a genuine market which properly reflects the needs of its customers.</p>

<title>Have services improved as a result?</title>
<p>Where is the evidence which shows that marketization has improved services in the CJS for those serving a sentence? Well, if there is any, I’ve yet to see it. There is some research that has looked at whether private sector provision is more effective than public. In respect of private prisons, the results look unconvincing. In January 2005, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0264550512465813">Prison Reform Trust (2005</xref>) published findings which suggested that overall the performance of the private sector in prisons had been no better than the public and thus far has been very mixed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0264550512465813">Hodge’s (1996)</xref> review of international empirical evidence revealed that cost savings from privatization have been modest or non-existent and that there has been a lack of consideration given to the wider political, social, democratic and legal outcomes of such a move. Furthermore, DWP’s own research found that ‘service innovation on the part of prime providers was largely focused on reducing operational costs and achieving performance efficiencies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0264550512465813">Hudson et al., 2010</xref>). NOMS claim that ‘competition in offender services has been shown to be effective in improving outcomes, driving efficiency and delivering more innovative models of service delivery’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0264550512465813">NOMS, 2011</xref>), but in the list of examples that follow, none relate to improved outcomes.</p>
<p>In my work with people serving sentences, I have rarely come across individuals who actually care who are there to help them; the fact that there is somebody to help them is usually good enough. However, more important to them is normally what they can get help with. The biggest frustration is where they are offered help, but it is with something they don’t really need much help with. While examples like this will always occur no matter how perfect the system is, the regularity of these frustrations suggests a lack of connection between the needs of those serving a sentence with those who are commissioning and delivering the services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0264550512465813">
<title>The impact of marketization on the ability of the voluntary sector to reflect their clients’ needs</title>
<p>Voluntary sector organizations entering the CJS marketplace need to be aware that any sentences need to be ‘penal’ enough to secure political and public support, and that being co-opted by government could impact dramatically upon their original mission and approach to service users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0264550512465813">Gough, 2012</xref>). The response of the third sector to their increasing presence in punishment and rehabilitation has so far being varied. Important ethical debates are being had within the sector as to whether charities should be involved at all in this highly punitive and politicized area of social policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0264550512465813">Silvestri, 2009</xref>). The Serco and Catch 22 consortium, which successfully bid to run a prison, encourage us not to ‘get hooked up on the fact that the doors are locked’, as successful work to improve prisoners’ health, education and life opportunities can be undertaken, they argue, by reforming a chronically dysfunctional system from the inside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0264550512465813">Cook, 2009</xref>). It is fair to say that this is a view that is shared by many individuals serving sentences. However, while there is little opposition to the delivery of services by private companies, the process of marketization may have long term implications for the services that people serving a sentence receive. While the role of the private sector has increased recently (a trend that looks likely to continue), a culture of competition has fragmented the charitable sector and ensured that the increased mass of the voluntary sector working with people serving sentences has not resulted in a stronger voice for the group itself. The voluntary sector’s increased proximity to government, brought about by delivering their contracts,  has come at the price of greater distance from beneficiaries. Charities claim to understand and represent communities are appearing increasingly arrogant to the members of those communities, being forced in strict delivery arrangements. As a result, many people serving sentences feel let down by services which are governed by a ‘tick box mentality’ that does not reflect their needs. This reflects badly on organizations whose origins were to serve the best interests of their clients. Their client is no longer the person serving a sentence; their client is NOMS (or whoever else is funding them).</p>
<p>From resettlement support to employment and training, people serving a sentence are being fed what the contractors in their area have to deliver, which is usually derived from what they can deliver, not what their clients need. The result is that family members, alongside the very smallest charities and community groups which have resisted the lure of large-value contracts and significant amounts of funding, are left to pick up the pieces where their needs fall outside the strict remit of what is being paid for. This view of service providers may be overly pessimistic, but the result of the way government has framed its relationship with the voluntary sector is that by encouraging them into a market of contracted service deliverers, they have drained them of their intrinsic value. Unsurprisingly, rather than the voluntary sector changing the market from inside, the infinitely more powerful market has rotted the voluntary and community sector from within. However, by presenting their services as client-led, non-compulsory, non-punitive and engaging, traditional interventions from voluntary organizations have a better chance of reaching marginalized groups than the coercive and punitive state. They must ensure that those serving a sentence remain their clients, not allowing their funders to come between what their clients truly need. However, in an environment where NOMS potentially commission services that do not match with the services these groups feel are needed, there will remain a tension between ‘delivering on the terms of the contract’ and ‘going the extra mile’ as a charity. The question is therefore whether the voluntary sector can afford to be involved in the increased marketization. Many will think they can’t afford not to be involved; it will take a brave service delivery organization to take a stand, but for the one that does it, and which does it well, they will reap the rewards, properly reflecting the needs of those serving a sentence, putting their interest first at all times.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0264550512465813">
<title>The future for marketization</title>
<p>I have yet to find any evidence that intrinsically links the development of marketization in the CJS with improved services for people serving sentences. That is not necessarily a problem; all it means is that we should be clear what the rationale behind marketization is, and, currently, it certainly isn’t to improve the services for people who are serving their sentence. At least, if it is, there isn’t any evidence to show that this is being achieving.</p>
<p>The impact of marketization has resulted in a much stricter delivery structure. If charities and other providers of services turn to Government for their funding, people serving sentences will be much more likely to only get the help that is being paid for. Historically, whilst it has been fragmented, it has been possible for those serving sentences to get flexible tailored support by a wide range of organizations that are there to help them, because these organizations have been funded in various ways. An increasingly marketized CJS will require much more accurate defining of need to ensure that there are no gaps in delivery. Otherwise, whereas previously there will have been organizations there to pick up the pieces, people will just fall through the net. This will require a closer connection between people serving sentences and the commissioners and/or service providers. To do this, people serving a sentence must be seen as the primary customer. To do anything else would only serve to continue to place them at the margins of a discussion that principally relies on them to change their ways. Personally, I am in favour of marketization, but not in the way that it has developed within the CJS. A true market is one where it is able to function as freely as possible; one whereby ‘the customer’ (the person serving a sentence) is the one in control of which services they made use of. At the moment, there is a huge gap between the funder (NOMS, or others) and the customer (people serving a sentence), which is being filled by intermediaries with an agenda. It is important that these intermediaries are there to deliver, but they shouldn’t be the ones that are defining need; that’s for the funder and the customer to decide, together. A radical step forward would be to put the power back in the hands of the customer, in a similar way to how personalized budgets have been trialled in the health sector. This would ensure that services which are needed are well subscribed, and services that are not needed fall by the wayside. Commissioners would be responsible for setting up the structure; mystery shopping providers would not go amiss either, to monitor the quality of service being delivered. The use of genuine individuals (those serving sentences) in this activity would be a good way for people serving a sentence to be actively involved in the improvement of the services being offered to them. Undoubtedly, this kind of funding structure would present its problems for delivery organizations, but then again, far too often the CJS has suffered as a result of having a captive audience; it has meant that many providers become complacent, knowing that they have a steady stream of clients. This has to stop; we should be the customers.</p>

<p>Wherever possible, I avoid using the various labels that are commonly used : ‘offenders’, ‘ex-offenders’, ‘prisoners’, ‘probationers’. I’d rather not label people in this way, as it is rarely helpful, as a person, to be labelled (unless you specifically choose to be associated with a particular description). However, for the purposes of this article, I think a label is needed. I normally opt for ‘people with a criminal record’ (as it’s factually accurate and the most inclusive one I can come up with), but with this article I’m specifically referring to people who are still serving a sentence, whether it be in the community or in prison.</p>
