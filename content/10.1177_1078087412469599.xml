<p>Necropolis was the metaphor Lewis Mumford coined for Rome to dramatize the state of moral and economic bankruptcy that marked the end of the Roman Empire. Jane Jacobs, too, employed the language of mortality—the death of the Great American City—to describe the disintegration of the urban fabric wrought by destructive urban planning. George Galster joins this tradition in his new book on Detroit, where he calls the city “suicidal” as it slides toward an end state that he names “mortropolis.”</p>
<p>Galster, a housing economist, has written an immensely readable and personal book. Underlying his fine analysis of how the city went from arsenal of democracy and engine of America’s manufacturing might to its current state of terrible decay is a deep knowledge of its streets, its music, its history, and its people. He begins by taking the reader on a long driving tour of the city, past its extensive array of industrial and residential ruins, its sylvan but shabby Olmsted-designed Belle Isle park, and its muscular casinos, monuments, and churches. The lyrics of Motown and the Detroit blues, the poetry of its people, and the city’s French street names function throughout as an elegy to this once important city. Galster’s own family history is a thematic refrain in the book. He is a fifth-generation Detroiter, and he writes of this “marvelous, horrible, dysfunctional place” with an understandable tone of both sadness and anger.</p>
<p>The frame of the book is laid out very briefly at the beginning. Playing on the double meaning of “driving” Detroit, Galster argues that Detroiters have been badly thwarted in their drive to acquire what he calls “respect,” that is, a short-hand term for satisfying physical, social, and psychological resources. This frustration is a function of the city’s over-dependence on the automobile industry, the unconstrained sprawl and political fragmentation of its metropolitan region, and the compounding effect of racial polarization and segregation. For scholars and other urbanists, the analysis provides a useful complement to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078087412469599">Thomas Sugrue’s (1996)</xref> classic account of Detroit’s troubled history in <italic>Origins of the Urban Crisis</italic>, but it brings the story up to date.</p>
<p>There is probably no better nor succinct account of the toll Detroit paid for its dependence on the auto industry. Galster calls it a Faustian bargain. Although a generation of workers managed to establish a foothold in the middle class, thanks in large part to the United Autoworkers Union (UAW), the cyclical nature of the market for high cost durable goods created a boom and bust employment pattern. Assembly line work provided a good living in good times, so there was little incentive to seek higher education. (One result is that Detroit ranks today Number 95 among the 100 largest cities in the proportion of its adult population with college degrees.) Auto assembly line work is deskilling, Galster points out, leaving redundant workers who have nothing more than a high school education with little to offer in the labor market.</p>
<p>Detroit never diversified its economy to provide a fallback when cars weren’t selling; its concentration in manufacturing employment in the late twentieth century was 49% higher than the national average and 1,082% higher in auto manufacturing in particular. The failure to diversify was in part the product of vertical integration of the auto industry, where not only production but financing, design, marketing, and accounting were typically done in-house. Combined with a tradition of top-down management and the absence of competition from abroad until the 1970s, the auto industry developed a complacency that dampened innovative entrepreneurialism and discouraged the emergence of strong independent R&amp;D and financial services sectors.</p>
<p>The auto industry also helped to encourage suburban sprawl by leaving the city and building greenfield plants after World War II, helping to produce the highest level of metropolitan job deconcentration today of any large city in the country. Interestingly, Galster argues that the window of prosperity in the auto industry, when the good jobs were not only plentiful but also still held largely by whites, enabled the working class to move out of the city’s aging housing stock and buy new single-family homes in the suburbs, which they then protected zealously by resisting residential racial integration.</p>
<p>Race is, of course, the other part of the story behind Detroit’s pathology. Many white Detroiters in the first half of the twentieth century were Southern migrants seeking work in the auto and war factories, and many Detroiters claim the city has always had a Southern feel. The city’s bitter racial history courses through the chapters of this book, from Dr. Ossian Sweet’s attempt to break the residential color barrier in the 1920s to the hate strikes and race riot of the 1940s to the enduring conflict today between the black city and the white suburbs. What is especially noteworthy about Galster’s analysis is his careful account of the self-defeating politics of racial identity pursued by whites and blacks alike. Most of the largely white suburban communities, for example, long ago opted out of any regional public transit system, resulting in a hodge-podge of uncoordinated bus routes that make commuting to or from the city nearly impossible without a car. Huge numbers of white suburbanites still say they are afraid to go into the city, and some never have done so in their lives. But black politics is often just as myopic. In one of many examples Galster recounts, the city council refused to set up a city land bank because it would be ceding control of what was in fact near worthless city-owned parcels to a board on which city representatives would be a minority. Indeed, a constant refrain in Detroit politics is that the white suburbs want to control “our city resources” and must be resisted at all costs.</p>
<p>Galster concedes that in a broad sense, the story of Detroit is not entirely unique—the Great Lakes region is littered with dying cities that were once industrial powerhouses—but he maintains that the forces of manufacturing dependence, deindustrialization, suburban sprawl, and racial polarization have played out there in an especially intense way. Add to that the sheer scale of the Detroit story—a population loss of well over one million people since the late 1950s—and it is hard to mount a counterargument. Galster certainly is ready to write the city’s epitaph: “We loved the automobile. We loved it to death.”</p>
