<abstract>
<p>Fifty years after his death, C. Wright Mills’s efforts to deconstruct unacknowledged power structures in the United States and his comprehensive critique of academia remain absent from the general curriculum. This is partly because Mills never pretended academic work wasn’t personal; his texts pay witness to the struggles of a man who used the written word to come to terms with himself. Mills aimed to grasp it all, to make individual troubles accessible by redefining them into social issues; he failed as much as he succeeded. I make Mills a comrade on my own intellectual journey and argue that rereading Mills allows young critical scholars to rethink current social theory and their own place within it. I show how, with a critical mind nourished rather than suppressed, rereading Mills can make you realize that you are not a crazy person.</p>

<body>
<p>Writing an essay on the (im)possibility to live with C. Wright Mills is agonizing. Like Mills, writing comes to me anything but easily, especially when using my own biography to set the stage from which to make sense of his writing. As Mills put it, “It’s hard to tell the truth about yourself and your ideas. Look how . . . I disguise so much of what I think and feel; how elaborately and awkwardly I go about it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. 254).</p>
<p>Like Mills, I never cared much for the labels that were put on him. His intellectual appearance was as imposing as his physical one;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1532708612441767">1</xref></sup> both are part of the current legacy of “the Texan rebel” who still is seen as one of the foremost “radical social dissenters” and the “most flamboyant renegade” (Eldridge, 1983, p. 13) in U.S. sociology (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532708612441767">Aronowitz, 2003</xref>; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532708612441767">Domhoff, 1968</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532708612441767">2006</xref>). Both, however, can also blind us for the grasping struggles of the man behind them.</p>
<p>Why is this important? We as academics are socialized in ways as to make us self-ignorant of the personal motives that drive our research; we are conditioned to ignore our own biases by making the personal peripheral. By disguising our personal interests in abstract research questions, we hide our own social, material, or intellectual objectives that stand behind the work we do. C. Wright Mills never pretended academia wasn’t personal. Reading his work allowed me to appreciate the author’s voice, his struggles and biases, while it simultaneously encouraged me to exploit my own.</p>
<p>I am a young female critical media scholar who found her way into academia by chance rather than by intention. Growing up in single-parent household in East Berlin, I disliked my childhood for the little agency I had in a world defined by dramatic socioeconomic change; I always dreamt of escaping into a world outside my own. Coming from a working-class background I was baffled with the path I that was laid out for me. I resisted silently, escaped by traveling, but I never resolved this tension; my thirst for autonomy did not match the numb compliance those around me seemingly had with the social order that dictated life. Nowadays I look at Mills, 50 years after his death, and I appreciate the role his work has played in helping me make sense of my surroundings. Mills made me a critic for he allowed me to redefine my troubles; he made me realize I am not a crazy person.</p>
<p>In writing and rewriting this article, however, I recognize how “elaborately and awkwardly I go about [disguising how I feel]” in my attempt to grasp the significance, the ambivalence, the fascination, and disdain I experience when dealing with C. Wright Mills. I struggle with every word and every sentence, not the least because the admiration and criticism I am about to pose are directed at an author and man without defense; his work—a witness for a particular time and place—is all there is that can serve as evidence against my redefinition of it. Such a position puts me in great power, but it makes the task of critiquing and filling the gaps that Mills’s work has left much harder. After all, it is easy to criticize but hard to show the value of others’ (im)perfect work. My thoughts, therefore, seem too much to fit the vocabulary and the space I have available. I can see myself in Mills when he wrote in 1949: “I can’t write it right. I can’t write what I want to say. . . . What I want to say is what you say to intimate friends when you are discouraged about how it all is” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. 136). This is where I stand.</p>
<sec id="section1-1532708612441767">
<title>Troubles</title>
<p>Ever since I read the first pages of <italic>The Power Elite</italic> and <italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic>, I was fascinated with Mills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532708612441767">Mills, 1956</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532708612441767">1959</xref>). His work struck me because each and every page pays witness to the struggles of a man who used the written word to come to terms with the world around him. His texts, dense and complex, show outraged composure. Concerned with issues of power and pain, labor and alienation (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532708612441767">Mills, 1948</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532708612441767">1951</xref>), Mills’s aim is to grasp it all, to make individual experiences accessible by putting them into their broader sociohistorical context. This aim, thinking back as to why I started going to college, was the reason I studied sociology and it also became the reason I dropped out of it. I aimed for answers but faced—what Mills would call—“abstract empiricism” and “grand theory” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532708612441767">Mills, 1959</xref>); thus, I soon realized that I simply cared for the wrong questions. I wanted to make sense of my feeling of powerlessness and alienation and my deep-seated sense that something was not quite right with the way things were. Why, for instance, was I told that it was normal to work a job you disliked as long as the money was good? Why is the answer “This is the way things are!” an accepted response to a serious question? As a child I was told I was thinking too much; in college I was told that my thinking was off track and that academia might not be the right place for me. I was told to buy into the idea that academic writing is boring and that translating human action into numbers and theories was the way things needed to be in order to understand human behavior. It struck me that everyone seemed to accept how detached social theory was from social reality, and no one seemed to notice the very bias that lay in the notion of a “scientific objectivity.” This notion, through its aspired nonexistence for bias, never itself became a target of debate; neither did it become an issue <italic>whose</italic> categories were taken to represent social reality. I wanted to understand my social surrounding, thirsting for agency to control my own dealings with it. My questions, however, made me unfit for the social sciences; thus I switched to (cultural) history. Nowadays, as a PhD student in communications, I am still trying to make sense of the mess. Having intellectually survived college, I have found others who seek to break with what is accepted as given. We all could be labeled <italic>leftists, feminists, Marxists, cultural critics</italic>, or <italic>radicals</italic>, but, of course, labels do not illuminate, they simplify complexity. What’s important is that all of us care enough to think and act, which is not to say that others do not, rather that owning “nonconformity” can be empowering.</p>
<p>Reading up on Mills, I found that he, who had initially studied sociology at Texas A&amp;M, had had similar experiences in college. Mills felt a deep sense of isolation throughout his entire education; he did not find like-minded friends and never belonged to any group, however small, neither academic nor political (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. 30). Mills was disgusted with what he saw was wrong with academia, while simultaneously internalizing its standards, which resulted in “a further cutting off of self from [his] family background and the social setting at large” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. 29). Mills, who also came from a working-class background, later writes he therefore felt “intellectually, politically, morally alone” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. 29) and without much guardianship. Such a representation of self, of course, triggers questions of how much of Mills’s narrative is distorted in his attempt to make sense of his own biography. How much of Mills is him and how much of it is how he would have liked to see himself? This question, as Mills was well aware, is hard to answer but it—even without it being resolved—does not diminish the very struggle present in his work.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1532708612441767">2</xref></sup> The reason why <italic>I</italic> found a refuge in critical scholarship was because of Mills’s influence on academia and critical theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532708612441767">Geary, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532708612441767">Hayden, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Mills was the first sociologist I read who broke with all of the academic standards with which I was accustomed; he deconstructed the social world around me. His writings dealt with biographies and personal troubles, with history and power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532708612441767">Mills, 1948</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532708612441767">1951</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532708612441767">1956</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532708612441767">1959</xref>), and he created “a really big view into which all the little fits and makes sense” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. 220). Mills did not pretend that academic writing was impersonal. His aggressive and at times polemic texts gave him (and me) the means to react against the notion of a detached social scientist. It allowed me to question the <italic>status quo</italic> we both were told to accept; it offered an arena within which we both could resist the silence that legitimizes unacknowledged power.</p>
<p>Mills stood up to his own ideals. Scholarship, to him, was “to unite a variety of private lives with public affairs . . . to enrich the private life by making it publicly relevant . . . to put human meaning into what is now called public affairs, reshaping them to allow and to invite a more decent variety of private lives” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. 280). He succeeded with me. Mills critiqued those in power as well as those who apathetically and uncritically followed; he tackled the given social structure that compromised the best idea for the one that simply worked. As a young scholar unwilling to accept the notion that things are because they are, I saw myself in Mills’s disgust for convenient ignorance and conformity. He rejected the division of social reality into all-inclusive, arbitrary, and faceless categories that betray the truth for the sake of simplicity; things do not always fit best in a two-by-two table. In short, Mills not simply asked questions I could relate to, but he redefined my own biography and my sense of isolation. He made me realize that it was not me who had to change, but it was the world around me that was deeply flawed. In the appendix to <italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic>, titled <italic>On Intellectual Craftsmanship</italic>, Mills addresses young scholars like I was when he writes:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Above all, do not give up your moral and political autonomy by accepting in somebody else’s terms the illiberal practicality of the bureaucratic ethos or the liberal practicality of the moral scatter. Know that many personal troubles cannot be solved merely as troubles, but must be understood in terms of public issues—and in terms of the problems of history making. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532708612441767">Mills, 1959</xref>, p. 226)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>How can such words not appeal to a critical mind that is on a search for intellectual identity? At best, Mills’s first-person narrative can be seen as an attempt to offer the kind of guidance Mills missed as a student. It can, however—as I will discuss later—also be viewed as a paternalist attempt to lecture and recruit. Either way, Mills allowed for identification in a world where academics all too often are devoted to dominant ideas, the social establishment, and their own material interests without truly challenging any of them (Tilman, 1984).</p>
<p>As a troubled person I became captivated with Mills’s uncompromising quest; I read his books to get an insight into the man who often gets to speak through his work alone. I looked for what I thought could be found in between the lines, soon realizing the complexity of Mills’s work and personality; both challenged the academic and social norms of their time but—to a large part—also remained within them (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532708612441767">Geary, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Mills Behind the Text</title>
<p>My search for the <italic>man</italic> behind the text, not the academic, and the motives for his prolific intellectual enterprise soon led me to one of the shortfalls of Mills’s work. Since Mills’s private life was never part of his public or professional world, personal accounts and private narratives remain largely absent in his writing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1532708612441767">3</xref></sup> Thus, in my craving for insights I remained clueless and could only take what his biographers had constructed for him (Aptheker, 1960; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532708612441767">Hayden, 2006</xref>; Kraus, 1977; Tilman, 1984). Still, there needed to be more than what was accessible to me. What I saw in Mills’s <italic>writing</italic> were themes of agency and compliance, the feeling of powerlessness and resistance, and his rigorous rejection of norms that existed for somebody else’s sake, all of which corresponded to the troubles I felt. How did he deal with them? Not fully belonging to either my working-class upbringing or the academic setting I appreciated and questioned both; did he feel the same way? In my mission to find answers to these questions, I made Mills an ideological comrade on my journey to find pieces to the puzzle.</p>
<p>The most insight into the <italic>man</italic> Mills is offered in his autobiographical letters to his imaginary Russian friend Tovarich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1532708612441767">4</xref></sup> Tovarich, for whom Mills—later when going to the Soviet Union—searches but cannot find, lives in Mills’s imagination alone; he becomes real only in his writing. Mills, in a true conversation with his <italic>alter ego</italic>, is in conversation with himself. By doing so he reveals a mind that is not appeased, one that struggles with itself in its dedication to a constant search with a “camera eye always working whether you want or not” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. 147). Writing to Tovarich allows Mills to take a break from his restless mind and to cross the lines between his personal and academic life more so than he had done before.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1532708612441767">5</xref></sup> Mills, freed from academic standards, aims to capture “[a]ll of it at once”—his experiences of “alienation, and apathy and dry rot and immensity and razzle sizzle and bullshit and wonderfulness and how lonesome it is, really, how terribly lonesome and rich and vulgar and god I don’t know” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. 136).</p>
<p>Elaborating on his feelings of isolation, doubt, and depression, Mills admits that “you worry that everything you write about the ‘new little man’ isn’t about anybody at all but your own God damn self: an elaborate projection draped in semiacceptable [sic] models of proof” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. 138). Mills finds himself guilty of manipulating those about whom he supposedly writes by using “their troubles” as substitutes for his own. On the other hand, Mills’s essential aim is to explain his troubles in order to create a space within which others can make sense of theirs. Mills, believing in social science as a useful tool, asks, “How can a writer [meaning himself] report fully the ‘data’ that social science enables him to turn up and at the same time include in his account the personal meanings that the subject often comes to have for him” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. 219)? The only answer is to give agency to the readers; they must use his writings for their own purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. 111). Such an approach requires faith in that they will. Mills often struggled with keeping this faith; at best he did and recommended others to do so, and at worst it paralyzed him. In his fight for an “economy of emotion” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. 56), Mills suppressed fears about how others would redefine his work that, after all, was the result of an intellectual enterprise that served Mills’s aim to come to terms with himself. He saw “the judgments and the possibilities for ignorance and error” on every page and, at times overwhelmed, he got “the shakes” and was scared: “too much work. Too much scope to it. Can’t stop. Can’t go on” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. 138). This frantic obsession to capture the complexity of social reality and his tormenting struggle to stand up to his own ideals glues my mind to his.</p>
<p>These details make Mills human. They show that he cannot simply be indentified with his written texts. Mills’s writings, though personal in style, are still conscientiously created representations of his logic, conversation, and intellect; they are the “orderly” parts of the (ir)rational self. As Mills points out, “Writing . . . is another name for the creating and the maintaining of a more or less orderly mind of your own, and so a sense of your own identity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. 255). What you <italic>cannot</italic> capture in writing are the moments that paralyze you, the moments of trouble when “you are overwhelmed by events and issues you have no control over. To be in trouble is to be in the grip of fate but not to be able to get any melodramatic pleasure out if it. To be in trouble is not to be able to plan” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. 255). The honesty Mills brought to the process of writing is outstanding in his work. Still, his texts only show us the composed, un-deranged Mills who had overcome and made sense of his troubles, not the torn Mills, isolated and desperate. In a way, Mills used his work as a means to hide both from himself and from others. This take on Mills, however, is liberating for it shows that distress is part of the deal; it is the essence of critical growth. Mills takes it even further and views depression and doubt to be the very “perils of thought,” both being intrinsic in the act of thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. 136). The latter therefore demands regular escaping, which to Mills is a universal human need to remain sane. Escapism shows, and is a necessity for, a healthy curious mind:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Everyone with any liveliness does a great deal of escaping, and is continually planning future escapes from which he hopes to learn something more about himself and about the world. For what is important about escapes is not avoiding them (or you would always remain one of your old selves) but choosing them carefully and using them well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. 278).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I am reading this passage with my own biography in mind, always having been told that I needed to face life, to stop wandering around, and that I was escaping “real life.” Rather than denying this fact Mills asks me to own it. Mills toured Europe in a Volkswagen bus, I toured the U.S. in my Chevy van. It was easier for Mills to observe other people’s lives in the passing than living everyday life according to somebody else’s norms. In his narratives I detect how traveling gave him temporary freedom and a sense of mobility in more than a physical way; it cut him loose of expectations and of that which gave his personal “self” social meanings. This sense of agency and intellectual movement are essential for me to be passionate about what I do. I have worked many jobs but only stayed until the monotony took over; when I read Mills I see the same in him.</p>
<p>Work to Mills was a mindset rather than an occupation revealing an unasked-for zeal for thinking that is exhausting and exhilarating at the same time. Mills escaped into his work and out of it; he worked obsessively for days and weeks, preferably detached from the demands of everyday life and social engagements, and then took long breaks to recover. Such a way of living is compelling, for it never gives intellectual ennui an opportunity to set it. This mindset made Mills who he was and it very much is a great part of me; it allows for passion in anything I do for I could not do it any other way.</p>
<p>Work also allowed Mills to overcome the everydayness of life. It gave him the chance to break with his personal isolation. By building lasting intellectual bonds he found comradeship in books and eventually among other critical minds. This shows how much of a “mind man” Mills really was. While he took the everyday as a starting point for his intellectual work, he aimed to transcend it in his private life; he did so through the power of the mind that needed constant stimulation. His work and work mode were outlets for doubt and restlessness; they offered a frame for orderly disorder.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1532708612441767">
<title>Mills on Race and Gender</title>
<p>I still fall short living up to what Mills termed the life of an “intellectual craftsman”: Whatever he read, observed, or debated, he used it intellectually; he noted it down, wrote about it, and aimed to put the pieces into the larger social context as he saw it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532708612441767">Mills, 1959</xref>). I, on the other hand, still do not exploit the richness of <italic>my</italic> observations in all their possibilities. However, though I can admire Mills for his work and see myself in him, his world is not mine.</p>
<p>Redefining the term, I, as an intellectual crafts<italic>woman</italic> living in the twenty-first century, am aware that reading Mills essentially means dealing with a white man’s take of the ‘white men’s world.’ I see that his ability to engage in his intellectual endeavors was also due to the women he was with. Mills was married three times and it was mainly his wives who kept him free from the responsibilities of life. Accordingly, the prevalent memory of Mills’s three children was that of him working, his greatest fault being “his self-absorption regarding his work” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. xxiii). Cutting oneself off from the pleasant and unpleasant details that make everyday life is a privilege that comes with a price. The price Mills paid was that he came to take <italic>his</italic> world as an ambiguous but given fact against which he defined <italic>his</italic> truth.</p>
<p>It is striking that one who aimed to unravel unacknowledged power while living in a society that was racially segregated and sexist never made racial or female oppression issues of his work. In a letter to Tovarich in 1960, when the burgeoning Civil Rights movement pressed racism onto the white agenda, Mills touches upon “the racial business” or, as he calls it, the “racial silliness . . . [in] a white tyranny” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, pp. 313-314). Two years before his death, Mills admits:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I have never been interested in what is called ‘the Negro problem.’ Perhaps I should have been and should be now. The truth is, I’ve never looked into it as a researcher. I have a feeling that if I did it would turn out to be ‘a white problem’ and I’ve got enough of those on my hands just now.

<p>It is interesting that when talking about “the Negro problem,” Mills points to “a white problem” as being the real issue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1532708612441767">6</xref></sup> Mills is aware of race being socially constructed, and as such he sees the arbitrariness of such distinctions as black “or brown, or yellow, or red, or pink” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. 314). He cannot, however, take it seriously enough to make it an intellectual challenge because racism was not <italic>his</italic> personal trouble; it, thus, did not need to be translated into a social issue. And though Mills’s general focus on power as an organizing principle in U.S. society points to white men’s power, with Mills being a white man fitting the norm, this aspect of reality falls short in his analysis. On the other hand, he points out that there is only so much a man (or woman) can do in one’s lifetime—fighting those in power, even without tackling racism, pitted him against enemies aplenty.</p>
<p>Mills’s take on the world was narrowed, as he was aware, because he was privileged. To him, this privilege came with individual, social, and economic freedom; he did not perceive it as a racial one. After all, the white men’s world was Mills’s own milieu and he took the very same as his starting point of analysis; in this way, he upheld the racial <italic>status quo</italic>.</p>
<p>Mills relates his thoughts about racial oppression to the oppression of women by pointing out that “like many Negros and Jews, they [women] are judged not as individuals but as members of a stereotyped bracket” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532708612441767">Mills, 1963</xref>, p. 339). What he means by “stereotyped bracket” is explained in an essay called <italic>Women: The Darling Little Slaves</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532708612441767">Mills, 1963</xref>, pp. 339-346). In it he engages in Simone de Beauvoir’s <italic>The Second Sex</italic>, a feminist writing in which she deconstructs male dominance and points to (what we now know as) the formation of gender.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1532708612441767">7</xref></sup> Mills summarizes:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The facts of biology themselves take on the values that we give them, and woman is a female only to the extent that she is defined as such in her experienced situation. Anatomy is <italic>not</italic> destiny. And even her consciousness of her femininity does not define woman, for this consciousness is itself acquired under specific historical conditions. Like man, woman is not only a member of a species, she is an historical creation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532708612441767">Mills, 1963</xref>, p. 340)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although he does not have the language readily available, Mills points to gender and fully acknowledges, as he does with race, that gender is a social construct based on physical attributes, which makes female oppression a structural issue. In this way, Mills is a feminist. Why then did he neglect to examine the role of women in U.S. society? As with the issue of race, Mills did not experience sexism as a personal trouble and, therefore, could not engage with it in his work.</p>
<p>Also, his (personal and intellectual) relationship to women was a complicated one—though admittedly Mills’s relationship to other men was complicated as well. Intellectually, Mills rejected women’s gendered attributes. In a letter to Tovarich, he characterizes Simone de Beauvoir as “an admirable woman” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. 278) because she aimed to break with her (male-constructed) role by transcending her everyday existence lived according to norms dictated by society. According to Mills, de Beauvoir’s main question was, “How can a human being in a woman’s situation attain fulfillment?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532708612441767">Mills, 1963</xref>, p. 339) Her answer was to reject apathy by living life according to her own standards, that is, the demands one formulates and accepts and makes upon oneself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. 278). De Beauvoir speaks to Mills through her ideas about resistance and agency, her gender is secondary. When he summarizes his view of her, he essentially writes about himself: “It is not so much that you live for ideas, it is that you really cannot live without them—although of course you can exist. But you are not in involuntary servitude to the powers of the commonplace and the terrible domination of the everyday” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. 278). On the one hand, Mills realizes the oppression of women to be a structural problem. This problem “not only discourages their [women’s] . . . efforts to become productive individuals, but more grievously, leads to their not making the effort” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532708612441767">Mills, 1963</xref>, p. 339). On the other hand, Mills blames women for their lack of resistance and inherent curiosity that would allow them to break free from (male) domination. Women who internalize their constructed roles to the domestic sphere <italic>intellectually</italic> stood against everything Mills believed in. Thus, his disregard was not so much defined by gender, but by his strong sense for living life according to one’s own standards and remaining true to oneself.</p>
<p>In doing so, Mills dismisses the power relations inherent in a male-dominated society that, though possible, gave women little space to find their voices. By focusing on the intellect, he ignores gender to be a powerful construct that hampered intellectual stimulation and rigor; both were much easier to find for men. He also disregards that his personal life was very much based on the domestic support of the women he was with; thus, what he aimed for intellectually he could not apply to his personal life. And when Mills writes, “[m]ost people do not go after things which are out of their reach,” and then points to “the intellectual, the artist, and the scientist [who] do just that” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. 278), he makes clear that to him the leading principle was not race or gender but a shared interest in finding truth. He does not acknowledge that this truth is <italic>not</italic> a disembodied entity; instead his work is a testimony for <italic>his</italic> version of truth that was shaped by the same social conditions that privileged him but oppressed others. This oppression related not only to gender and race but also to economic exploitation from which Mills’s work in academia, as he was well aware, partially set him free. Mills’s carefully crafted image of a public intellectual and an advocate of the oppressed could not help his deep antipathy for those who could “not go after things which are out of their reach” for he did not encounter the social constraints they experienced. Thus, Mills fell into the trap of the same assumptions he criticized and thereby upheld what he critiqued.</p>
<p>Although intellectually Mills might have admired women’s search for a ‘disembodied truth,’ I wonder how he would have personally dealt with a woman who lived according to her own rules. The more I emancipate myself from Mills and his work the more I question both. While I still appreciate large parts of his rigorous writing, I must reject its presumptuous vagueness. Mills suggests that I, as a human being, can overcome my powerlessness, but he falls short of offering alternatives. Although he suggests that I, as a woman, am free to choose my own destiny and to change history, he does not say how; he gives me agency but then leaves it at that. Thus, his attempt to show me how the world works lacks vision. After all, he critiques <italic>any</italic> structure necessary for social interaction; he argues for the sake of the argument and I wonder how useful such approach is, especially when based on a white, male-dominated <italic>status quo</italic>. Would he have allowed me to ask these questions and critique him? I do not think he would have. In the end, Mills upheld, lived, and depended on the very same power structures he pretended to criticize, and the type of woman he preached for would have questioned the very essence of his being.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1532708612441767">8</xref></sup></p>

<title>Living With(out) Mills</title>
<p>Mills’s work, often criticized for its polemic language that prevents complexity by polarizing discourse into argumentative camps, lacks depth as much as Mills’s personality shines through. Mills, blinded by his own biases, denies the very complexity of those he pretends to speak for, those who do not have the voice to express themselves. By claiming “to carry out the intellectual’s role of diagnosing the common dilemma” (Ryntia, 2001, p. 563), it is Mills who sets the agenda, and while he critiques what limits <italic>him</italic> he never exploits his own limitations. True, Mills takes the individual as a starting point to conceptualize (his) social reality and to reveal unacknowledged power. This individual, however, is fed by Mills’s personal struggles and is therefore based on a white man’s experience to whom the feeling of powerlessness is an out-of-the-ordinary force. His gender and race, his economic or social standing—though he surely was aware of them—never became part of his narrowly defined intellectual world. The “Texan rebel,” after all, conformed to the social norms of his time and did not acknowledge the very postures he fell into.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1532708612441767">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>I ask myself whether Mills would have supported my search for him, the <italic>man</italic>, behind his carefully crafted academic self. Although in the abstract he might have, in the concrete he surely would not. After all, despite his use of slang and curse words, Mills believed in the written word and the life of the mind. Mills’s world remained abstract and was refined to the intellect and his work, the personal remained outside ironically because it was very much the same; as his letters show, concrete criticism of his work was hard for him to handle exactly because it was personal. His belief in a disembodied truth essentially meant <italic>his</italic> version of truth.</p>
<p>Keeping this in mind, Mills still allows for identification. Throughout his life, Mills put much vigor into living up to his own ideals, and he expected others to do the same; that meant remaining true to oneself. I currently see an urgent need for reorientation and change in academia, and that can only be brought about by grasping and holding on to one’s critical mind. More young scholars need to realize that their sense of uncomforted struggle with the state of the academy, the social structure, and their place within both show a healthy mind that should be nourished rather than suppressed. Mills redefines these feelings of trouble into a productive intellectual enterprise; he shows that being nonconformant means being truthful. Torn between the man he was and the intellectual he aimed to be, Mills chased after the truth or maybe escaped from its chasing shadows. Those of us who question the world often lack intellectual guidance and find little encouragement to find our own voice. Reading Mills made me realize that it is not an accomplishment to feel indifferent. After all, “[t]o be uneasy about the world is not necessarily to be uneasy with yourself. . . . it is possible to live in an overdeveloped society but not be an underdeveloped person” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, p. 278). Reading Mills’s work can be a mirror-like experience. He escaped from what restricted him, that is, any sort of controlling structure that demanded a life according to rules that would confiscate his truth. The only control Mills could bear was the type he put upon himself; he became an academic because, as he points out, it allowed him the greatest amount of freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills et al., 2000</xref>, pp. 296-299). Such recognition demands a sense of responsibility and appreciation among academics for the work we do and the purpose it fulfils. Mills’s writing therefore offers a frame to conceptualize my observations. True, his belief in a disembodied truth meant <italic>his</italic> version of truth, but there is no reason why I can’t make it mine. After all, he made me realize I am not a crazy person.</p>

<p>Mills had an impressive appearance; “He was tall (about six feet two inches); he spoke in a thundering drawl that marked him as a native American . . .; he smoked much, laughed easily, and angered many—although more often over abstract ideas than personalities.” Mills is said to have had uncanny ability to irritate those who had befriended him. One of Mills’s biographers reports that of all the people he had met, talked, and corresponded with “very few mustered positive sentiments towards Mills” (Introduction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532708612441767">Mills, 1963</xref>, p. 4).</p>

<p>In Fall 1957, Mills takes a critical stand toward his self-representation as “the Texan” who worked in the oilfields to finance school. Although his story of having done manual labor “is true . . . all of it is also a damned lie” because, Mills points out, he always knew by the end of the summer he would be safe back at school. He continues that “it is so easy to pose, to fake” and to claim something your own that is not, to build one’s own biography around the narratives of others in one’s aim to give meaning and make sense of the presence. Mills is aware of how playing his “Texan” card, that is being the “troublemaker,” is his own kind of “attitudinizing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills, 2000</xref>, p. 27).</p>

<p>Mills admits, however, that knowing the public will read his letters keeps him from telling it all.

Anyway, it’s just a tale of monstrous tragedies, Tovarich,” of which he will tell him in private (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441767">Mills, 2000</xref>, p. 254).
