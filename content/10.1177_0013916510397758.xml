<abstract>
<p>Little is known about spatial and temporal variations of violent crime in South Africa. This article addresses this gap by investigating the seasonality of assault at a neighborhood level in the city of Tshwane. The authors first investigate whether assault is seasonal, and then examine the association between seasonal levels of assault and area measures of social deprivation for urban neighborhoods in Tshwane. Similar to previous international research, the authors found that assault is seasonal, with higher incidences of assault in summer. Deprived neighborhoods exhibited higher rates of assault than more affluent neighborhoods. Assault levels in urban neighborhoods were found to be socially stratified and spatially patterned regardless of the season of the year. More deprived neighborhoods had higher assault rates in summer, whereas in winter, assault rates were more equably split over neighborhoods ranging from high to low deprivation. More affluent neighborhoods typically exhibited lower assault rates in summer.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article focuses on the relationship between seasons and crime in Tshwane, South Africa. Not only do we examine the seasonality–crime relationship at a citywide level of aggregation at a new geographic location, but we also investigate whether the ecological characteristics of neighborhoods within a city contribute to seasonality results. We do this by looking for possible interneighborhood variations in seasonal crime rates and consider the possibility of neighborhood deprivation as a factor affecting the seasonality–crime relationship.</p>
<p>Over the past century, there has been much interest in the relationship between seasons and various types of crime. As early as the 19th century, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916510397758">Quételet (1842/1969)</xref> observed that crimes against property reached a maximum in winter, and crimes against the person peaked in the summer months. His theory was later supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013916510397758">Sutherland (1947)</xref> who also found that property crimes reached their highest levels in winter, whereas crimes against the person peaked in the hot days of summer. The increasing availability and accuracy of recorded crime information, coupled with the emergence of geographic information systems (GIS), have resulted in a large and growing body of literature investigating seasonality and crime (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013916510397758">Baron, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013916510397758">Baumer &amp; Wright, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013916510397758">Dodge, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916510397758">Farrell &amp; Pease, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013916510397758">Harries, Stadler, &amp; Zdorkowski, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013916510397758">McPheters &amp; Stronge, 1974</xref>). However, the research on this topic has produced inconsistent and often contradictory results. In terms of property crime, some investigations have reported an increase in summer months (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013916510397758">Anderson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013916510397758">Cohn &amp; Rotton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013916510397758">Dodge, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013916510397758">Dodge &amp; Lentzner, 1980</xref>), whereas other investigations have reported winter peaks (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013916510397758">Chang, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013916510397758">Field, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013916510397758">Landau &amp; Fridman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0013916510397758">Van Koppen &amp; Jansen, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Results of studies of crimes against the person are also contradictory. Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013916510397758">Cheatwood (1988)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013916510397758">Yan (2000)</xref> found no particular season for homicides in the United States, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013916510397758">Hakko (2000)</xref> observed a statistically significant seasonal pattern for homicides in Finland. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013916510397758">Hird and Ruparel (2007)</xref> found summer peaks for common and indecent assault in the United Kingdom, whereas other studies have failed to find any consistent seasonal trends for these types of crimes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013916510397758">Hipp, Bauer, Curran, &amp; Bollen, 2004</xref>). Researchers have even looked at the relationship between temperature and aggression in sporting events. For example, an examination of Major League Baseball in the United States found a significant positive correlation between temperature and the probability of batters being hit by balls thrown by pitchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013916510397758">Reifman, Larrick, &amp; Fein, 1991</xref>), whereas a later study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013916510397758">Larrick, Timmerman, Carton, &amp; Abrevaya, 2011</xref>) found that the increased probability of a batter being hit by a pitch is sharper when more of the pitcher’s teammates have been hit by pitchers earlier in the game, suggesting that heat increases the likelihood of retaliatory violence. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0013916510397758">Rotton and Cohn (2003b)</xref> failed to replicate the results obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013916510397758">Reifman et al. (1991)</xref>. The reasons for these conflicting findings are largely uncertain, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013916510397758">Landau and Fridman (1993)</xref> suggested that they are related to the different ways in which seasons are measured by different countries, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0013916510397758">Yan (2004)</xref> considered them to be related to the varying geographical locations under investigation.</p>
<p>Most of the crime seasonality research has occurred in cities of the United States and Europe, but a limited number of investigations have also been conducted in less developed contexts. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013916510397758">Chang (1972)</xref> found an increase in property crimes in Korea in winter and an increase in physical violence and sexual crimes in the summer months. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0013916510397758">Yan (2004)</xref> indicated an absence of seasonality in burglary and overall theft in Hong Kong but did find winter peaks for shop theft and a weak summer peak for pick pocketing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916510397758">Ceccato (2005)</xref> found significant differences in homicide by season in São Paulo, Brazil, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013916510397758">Téllez, Galleguillos, Aliaga, and Silva (2006)</xref> found a distinct seasonal pattern of sexual abuse in Santiago de Chile.</p>
<p>Although these and other studies have enhanced our understanding of crime seasonality throughout much of the world, very little is known about seasonal variations of crime in Africa in general, and South Africa specifically. South Africa’s location in the southern hemisphere also means that the seasonal patterns are significantly different from those of the United States and Europe, with the coldest days falling in the months of July and August and the warmest occurring in December and January. In addition, many of the most widely observed public holidays that in the United States and Europe fall in the coldest time of year (such as Christmas and New Year) occur during the summer months in South Africa. Moreover, the long (often 10 or more week) school vacations that commonly occur in the summer months in the United States and Europe do not exist in South Africa; the longest summer school vacation occurs over the Christmas/New Year period and is only about 6 weeks long.</p>
<p>Only two other studies, both in South America, have ever examined the relationship between seasonality and crime in a country with this type of seasonal pattern, and no such studies have ever been conducted in South Africa. This study will also consider whether any existing seasonal variations in crime in South Africa are more similar to those found in countries with a similar seasonal pattern (such as Chile and Brazil) or to those found in countries in the northern hemisphere (such as the United States).</p>
<p>Finally, most prior research into crime and seasonality has examined the phenomenon at a citywide level. These studies have either assumed spatial homogeneity of seasonal crime across a city or have merely offered some brief speculation on subcity crime seasonality. There has been almost no research examining the interneighborhood variation of crime by seasons within a single city. In this study, we will examine the seasonality of crime at a much finer level of aggregation than has been done in the past. In addition, we will relate seasonal crime levels to the ecological characteristics of the smaller geographic areas under study, specifically focusing on social deprivation levels in each individual community. This study will not only be among the first to investigate the crime–seasonality relationship at a neighborhood level but will also be the first to consider neighborhood deprivation as a factor that may impact this relationship.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0013916510397758">
<title>Theoretical Context</title>
<p>The two types of theories that are most commonly used to explain seasonal variations of crime are routine activity (RA) theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013916510397758">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>) and temperature/aggression (T/A) theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916510397758">Quételet, 1842/1969</xref>).</p>
<p>RA theory employs a social explanation to explain seasonal oscillations in crime. It focuses on opportunities and risk, rather than on offender motivation, and is based on the idea that for an understanding of criminal behavior, one needs to understand how individuals routinely use their time. RA theory states that individuals generally follow strict daily, weekly, and even monthly routines, which affect opportunities for crime and risk of victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013916510397758">Brunsdon, Corcoran, Higgs, &amp; Ware, 2009</xref>). Some of these “routine activities” are obligatory, with a reasonably fixed duration, and are difficult to change, such as work and school. Other activities, such as socializing, are discretionary, and individuals have a greater amount of choice as to whether they will engage in these activities and when they will occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013916510397758">LeBeau &amp; Corcoran, 1990</xref>). The theory also states that for a crime to occur, three elements must converge in time and space: (a) a motivated offender, (b) a suitable target, and (c) the absence of a capable guardian against criminal behavior. Manipulating the availability of these elements may affect the likelihood of crime and victimization.</p>
<p>Changing weather conditions can play an important role in altering the routine activities of individuals, particularly those who are discretionary, and can potentially impact the likelihood of the convergence of these three required elements. For example, pleasant weather encourages individuals to engage in outdoor activities during their free time, increasing the likelihood of contact between suitable targets and motivated offenders, and as a result increasing the likelihood of violent crimes such as homicide and assault. The likelihood of residential burglary may also increase, as homes are left without capable guardians while their inhabitants are outdoors, making them more suitable targets. Similarly, cold or inclement weather conditions may encourage individuals to stay at home, decreasing the amount of suitable targets for property crimes such as residential burglary and reducing the likelihood of interpersonal crimes that require contact between victim and offender. Essentially, RA theory suggests that seasonal changes in individual behavior patterns help to account for seasonal variations in crime rates.</p>
<p>The majority of studies evaluating RA theory have focused mainly on temporal factors, looking at the interaction between time and weather and attempting to determine how human behavior during certain seasons, days of the week, and/or times of day can impact an individuals’ risk of victimization (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916510397758">Ceccato, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013916510397758">Landau &amp; Fridman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013916510397758">Rotton &amp; Cohn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013916510397758">Yan, 2000</xref>). More recently, however, the notion of space as well as time has been incorporated into crime seasonality research, with investigators focusing on the spatial–temporal differences affecting the probability of convergence of these three conditions (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013916510397758">Brunsdon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013916510397758">Cohen, Gorr, &amp; Durso, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013916510397758">Hipp et al., 2004</xref>). In many cases, RA theory is successfully used to test the stated hypotheses and to justify the results obtained.</p>
<p>T/A theories offer a more psychological explanation for the increase in crime during certain seasons of the year. These theories suggest that hot temperatures, particularly in summer, lead to an increase in frustration and discomfort in individuals, and thus increase the likelihood of aggression. Essentially, the relationship between an aversive event (such as a hot day) and aggression is mediated by the negative affect generated by these types of emotions.</p>
<p>There are several versions of T/A theories; they differ mainly as to their views of the shape of the relationship between temperature and aggression. The first is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013916510397758">Anderson and Bushman’s (2002)</xref> general aggression model (GAM). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013916510397758">Anderson and Anderson (1998)</xref> suggested that aggression is a monotonic linear function of temperature, so that rates of aggression increase during hotter days, months, and seasons. However, when shorter time periods are examined, such as 3-hour or 6-hour periods of time, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013916510397758">Rotton and Cohn (1999)</xref> found that this function becomes curvilinear, rather than monotonically linear as Anderson and Bushman proposed. These latter findings support an alternative model, the negative affect escape (NAE) model proposed by Baron and Bell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013916510397758">Baron, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013916510397758">Baron &amp; Bell, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013916510397758">Bell, 1992</xref>). This model suggests that the relationship between temperature and aggression may better be described by an inverted <italic>U</italic>-shaped curve. According to the NAE model, moderately high levels of negative affect (such as uncomfortably warm temperatures) can lead to an increase in aggression, but if such levels continue to increase, a critical threshold is reached. At very high levels of negative affect, individuals are more inclined to desire to escape from the hot temperatures rather than to seek conflict with others, thereby reducing aggression.</p>
<p>However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013916510397758">Cohn and Rotton (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013916510397758">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013916510397758">Rotton &amp; Cohn, 2004</xref>) have suggested that the temperature and aggression relationship may, at different times, assume different shapes. They suggest that there are certain times during the day when the relationship between temperature and aggression is curvilinear, as suggested by the NAE model, and other times, for instance in early evening hours, when the relationship is linear or nonexistent, supporting the GAM model. According to Cohn and Rotton’s social escape and avoidance (SEA) theory, the shape of the curve relating temperature to aggression and the strength of that relationship are dependent on a number of other additional factors, including the time of day, the day of the week, the season of the year, the amount of social interaction occurring between people, the type of crime being committed, and even the setting in which the crime occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013916510397758">Cohn &amp; Rotton, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013916510397758">2006</xref>). SEA theory was developed in an attempt to integrate psychological theories of aggression, such as the GAM and NAE models, with criminological models such as the RA theory.</p>
<p>Although the exact shape of the temperature–aggression curve is still one that creates heated debate (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013916510397758">Bushman, Wang, &amp; Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013916510397758">Cohn &amp; Rotton, 2005</xref>), the general consensus among researchers is that a generally positive relationship exists between temperature and aggression (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013916510397758">Anderson, Anderson, Dorr, DeNeve, &amp; Flanagan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013916510397758">Cohn &amp; Rotton, 1997</xref>) and that more research is needed examining the temperature–aggression relationship in geographical areas with different climatic regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013916510397758">Brunsdon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0013916510397758">Yan, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>The Current Research</title>
<p>The current research focuses on the seasonality of assault in Tshwane, South Africa. The city of Tshwane (population 2.2 million; 1,248 square miles) is located in the Gauteng province and is one of the six major metropolitan areas in the country. This region of South Africa has four distinct seasons, which are, as noted earlier, the inverse of those in the northern hemisphere: spring, which occurs between the months of September to November, is generally pleasant; summer includes the months of December through February and is typically rainy and hot, averaging between 27°C to 28°C (80°F-82°F). Autumn, which occurs between March and May, is pleasant and dry, whereas winter, which occurs between June and August, is moderate, with average temperatures ranging from 10°C to 25°C (50°F-77°F).</p>
<p>The only other research studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916510397758">Ceccato (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013916510397758">Téllez et al. (2006)</xref> that examined the seasonality–crime relationship in the southern hemisphere examined violent crimes (homicide and sexual abuse, respectively). Therefore, we also have chosen to examine the relationship between seasonality and violence. In this research, we focus on the crime of assault, including sexual violence. There are three main types or categories of assault in South Africa, all of which are included in this research. <italic>Common assault</italic> is the least serious and involves a victim being attacked, physically beaten, or threatened in a frightening way by an attacker who does not take anything from the victim. <italic>Assault GBH</italic> (grievous bodily harm) is similar but is more serious as the offender has intent to cause grievous bodily harm to the victim. <italic>Indecent assault</italic> is the term used in South Africa for what in the United States is known as sexual assault; it involves intentional unlawful assault with the object of committing an indecency.</p>
<p>We chose to examine the crime of assault as it includes both intentional crimes (both assault GBH and indecent assault) as well as a more impulsive component (common assault) and includes various levels of seriousness (with common assault as the least serious type and indecent assault and assault GBH as more serious offenses). We will examine all three types of assault together, with the data aggregated to provide a single measure of aggression, and will also disaggregate the data into the three separate crime types so that each category may be examined separately. This will allow us to focus on the possibility of more subtle variations in the season–crime relationship.</p>
<p>Both RA theory and T/A theories predict a seasonal effect for violent crime. Therefore, the first hypothesis tested by this study is that there are significant seasonal patterns of assault in the city of Tshwane and that these patterns will be similar to those found in similar prior research in other parts of the world. Specifically, we hypothesize that assaults will peak during the summer months and fall to a low during the winter months. We are suggesting that despite the “reversal” of seasons, compared with northern hemisphere countries in North America and Europe, the basic seasonal pattern will still occur.</p>
<p>SEA theory suggests that the shape of the relationship between temperature and aggression is affected by a variety of external factors, including the setting in which the crime takes place. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013916510397758">Rotton and Cohn (2004)</xref>, for example, found that climate control could moderate this relationship. One factor that has not been previously examined as possibly impacting the seasonality/crime relationship is that of neighborhood deprivation. SEA theory would predict that social deprivation levels would impact the relationship between seasonality and crime. Therefore, our second hypothesis is that any seasonal pattern of assault will be influenced by neighborhood deprivation. Essentially, the question here is whether people living in more socially deprived neighborhoods within a city more inclined to aggressive behavior during any particular season than those living in more affluent communities? We do not believe that the question of neighborhood deprivation has ever been addressed in any prior research examining the relationship between seasonality and crime.</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<sec id="section5-0013916510397758">
<title>Crime Data</title>
<p>Crime data for the research were obtained from the Crime and Information Analysis Centre (CIAC) of the South African Police Services (SAPS) for the 5 years from September 1, 2001 to August 31, 2006. The information provided by the SAPS included the specific geographic location of each assault (<italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> coordinate), the date and time of day at which the assault was committed, and the specific type of assault committed (common assault, assault GBH, or indecent assault). A total of 136,122 incidences of assault were recorded in Tshwane over this 5-year period, including 81,739 cases of common assault (<italic>M</italic> per month = 1362.31; <italic>SD</italic> per month = 160.76); 52,305 cases of assault GBH (<italic>M</italic> = 871.75; <italic>SD</italic> = 130.74); and 2,078 cases of indecent assault (<italic>M</italic> = 34.63; <italic>SD</italic> = 4.70).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0013916510397758">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>To test our first hypothesis, we calculated the ratio of observed to expected monthly frequency for the 136,122 cases of assault. The expected number of assault cases was obtained by dividing the total number of cases in each assault category by the mean number of days per month for each month calculated over the 5 years. The observed number of assault cases each month was extracted from the CIAC crime data set and averaged above 5 years. Ratios greater than 1 indicate that there were more observed cases of assault in a given month than would normally be expected; ratios less than 1 indicate the opposite. The differences in levels of assault by month for the 5-year period from September 2001 to August 2006 were then examined using a one-way analysis of variance with a post hoc Scheffé test.</p>
<p>To further quantify the monthly differences in assault rates, a series of dummy variable regression models were run on the data. Mean monthly assault rates (per 100,000 population) for each assault category acted as the dependent variable, and 11 dummy variables representing the 12 months of the year were the independent variables. Preliminary analysis indicated that the distributions for overall assault and assault GBH were positively skewed (i.e., had a long right-hand tail). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013916510397758">Cohen and Cohen’s (1983)</xref> recommendations, a square root transformation was applied to obtain more normal distributions for these two crimes<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0013916510397758">1</xref></sup>; both common assault and indecent assault showed neither signs of skewness nor kurtosis. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0013916510397758">Yan (2004)</xref>, the months with the average highest assault rates were excluded in the regression analysis to compare with the rest of the year. The results of the regression are then interpreted relative to the intercept, which is the expected assault rate in the months with peak rates.</p>
<p>To test our second hypothesis—that of the impact of neighborhood deprivation on the seasonality–crime relationship—we first conducted a two-way analysis of variance to gauge this interaction. Then we examined the spatial relationship between these three phenomena at the neighborhood level of analysis. The neighborhood represents the finest spatial level of aggregation at which Census 2001 data have been provided by Statistics South Africa (SSA). Each of the 371 neighborhoods in Tshwane consists of between 150 to 300 households. The spatial analysis was undertaken in three stages. First, all 136,122 incidences of assault were mapped and the mean number of assaults cases per 1,000 population was calculated monthly for each of the 371 neighborhoods of Tshwane. Second, social deprivation levels were calculated for each neighborhood in Tshwane using the Census 2001 data. Social deprivation was calculated based on the United Nations Development Program’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013916510397758">UNDP; 2003</xref>) parameters for deprivation in five dimensions as follows: (a) the percentage of residents living in informal housing,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0013916510397758">2</xref></sup> (b) the percentage of households with no flush toilet, (c) the percentage of households with no water supply, (d) the percentage of households with no electricity, and (e) the percentage of households with no refuse removal. The deprivation index was calculated as a simple average of the five basic services indexes, with 0 indicating extreme deprivation and 1 indicating affluence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013916510397758">Erasmus, 2004</xref>, for a detailed review of this method). These indices were used to assign a quintile rank to all neighborhoods in Tshwane. Quintile ranks assigned to each neighborhood in Tshwane ranged from 1 (<italic>low deprivation</italic>) to 5 (<italic>high deprivation</italic>). The total number of assaults per category and the total population of each neighborhood were extracted for each quintile and used to calculate the monthly rate of assault per 1,000 population. Finally, correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between the deprivation indices and the mean rates of assault for each month.</p>

<p>The mean observed and the mean expected number of cases of assault per month from the study period is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013916510397758">Table 1</xref>, and a curve examining the ratio of observed to expected monthly frequency of assault is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013916510397758">Figure 1</xref>. Not surprisingly, the mean number of assaults in Tshwane follows a seasonal pattern with levels of assault highest during summer (December-February) and lowest during the months of winter (June-July). Indeed, the mean monthly overall assault rate drops from 2,890.4 in December to 1,848 in June, a decrease of more than 1,000 assaults per month. Assault GBH and common assault were also the highest in December; there was a sharp decrease in both these categories of assault in January followed by a gradual decline in winter. Indecent assault was also found to be more prominent in summer. The results of the one-way analysis of variance showed significant differences in levels of overall assault between the months of the year, <italic>F</italic>(11, 48) = 4.71, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The levels of assault in the hot months of summer differ considerably from the levels of assault found in the colder months of the year (May and June). Additional measurements yielded by the analysis of variance procedure also indicated significant differences in assault rates among seasons for the three categories of assault: (a) assault GBH, <italic>F</italic>(11, 48) = 3.84, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; (b) common assault, <italic>F</italic>(11, 48) = 5.81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; and (c) indecent assault, <italic>F</italic>(11, 48) = 3.43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01.</p>

Significant monthly rate differences from December were found for overall assault, assault GBH, and common assault, whereas significant monthly differences from November were also found for indecent assault. It is interesting to note that common assault rates in October and November did not differ significantly from December, suggesting a surge in these types of crimes leading into summer.</p>

<p>The results of the two-way analysis of variance used to gauge the interaction between season, deprivation, and overall assault in Tshwane indicated a significant main effect for deprivation, <italic>F</italic>(4, 290) = 4.41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Neighborhoods in deprivation quintiles four (<italic>M</italic> = 2.43) and five (<italic>M</italic> = 2.49; high deprivation) exhibited significantly higher rates of assault than neighborhoods in the lower quintiles one (<italic>M</italic> = 0.75) and two (<italic>M</italic> = 0.42; low deprivation). As predicted from previous results, significant main effects were also found for month of the year, <italic>F</italic>(11, 290) = 2.20, with higher rates of assault occurring in summer (November-February; <italic>M</italic> = 1.88) than winter (<italic>M</italic> = 1.50) or spring (<italic>M</italic> = 1.74). The interaction of season and deprivation also approached significance, <italic>F</italic>(42, 290) = 1.34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .06. In summer, highly deprived neighborhoods have the highest assault rates, whereas in winter, assault rates are more equably split over neighborhoods ranging from high to low deprivation.</p>
<p>An examination of the spatial relationship between the number of assaults per 1,000 population and social deprivation for neighborhoods located in Tshwane showed a clear social gradient (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0013916510397758">Table 3</xref>). Mean rates of assault generally increase across neighborhoods stratified from low to high deprivation. This trend occurs in all seasons of the year. The strength of this relationship varies marginally between seasons as the ratios of the prevalence of assault in deprivation quintile five (high deprivation) compared with quintile one (low deprivation) ranged from 0.98 (in September) to 2.63 (in December). These values suggest that overall assault rates are up to 2.63 times greater in summer in the most deprived neighborhoods than in the least deprived neighborhoods. The Spearman correlation coefficients show a few significant linear relationships occurring between neighborhood deprivation and assault rates, although the vast majority of the coefficients are not statistically significant. This could be explained by the higher rates of assault identified in the least deprived quintile one when compared with the more deprived quintiles two and three. Indeed, with the notable exceptions of winter (June–July) and summer (December), overall assault rates are always greater in the least deprived quintile one than in quintiles two and three. A summary of this trend is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0013916510397758">Figure 2</xref>, which illustrates the mean annual assault rates per quintile.</p>

<p>The results of the overall assault are broadly consistent with the rates of assault GBH and common assault. Both mean rates of assault GBH and common assault increase across neighborhoods stratified from low to high deprivation. With the exception of March, levels of assault GBH are also the highest in the most deprived neighborhoods year round, whereas levels of common assault are the highest in the second-to-most deprived neighborhoods regardless of the season. The strength of the relationship between assault GBH and neighborhood deprivation is much stronger than any of the other assault categories with the ratios of assault in deprivation quintile five compared with quintile one ranging from 1.46 (July) to 4.16 (December). These values suggest that rates of assault GBH are 1.46 times greater in more deprived neighborhoods in winter and 4.6 times greater in more deprived neighborhoods in summer, compared with the least deprived neighborhoods. Rates of indecent assault fluctuate, and these levels are consistently greater in the least deprived neighborhoods, again with the exception of May and December.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The preliminary results of the study support our first hypothesis that there is a seasonal effect for violent assaults in Tshwane, as predicted by both RA and T/A theories. This finding is consistent with previous research that has found clear seasonal oscillations in crime rates (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013916510397758">Hird &amp; Ruparel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013916510397758">Téllez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0013916510397758">Yan, 2004</xref>). The summer month of December was the highest in all assault categories except that of indecent assault, whereas the lowest incidences of assault were evident in the autumn/winter months of May and June.</p>
<p>A number of factors may account for this seasonal trend, with the most obvious being the increase in temperature during the summer months in South Africa. According to RA theory, individuals are at a higher risk of personal victimization when they are outdoors than when they are at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013916510397758">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013916510397758">Rotton &amp; Cohn, 2004</xref>). On a hot summer day in Tshwane, people are more likely to be outdoors, increasing the likelihood that victims and offenders will come into contact with each other and thus facilitating assault. Similarly, T/A theory states that higher temperatures in summer will lead to increased frustration and consequent aggressive behavior.</p>
<p>A second factor that could explain this trend is the large number of public holidays in the summer in South Africa. In fact, almost a third of all the public holidays in the country occur during a 2-week period in the summer. In the United States, it has been found that a majority of violent crime victims are known to be acquainted with or related to their offenders (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013916510397758">Rand, 2008</xref>); this pattern also exists in South Africa where up to 90% of assault incidents involve people known to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013916510397758">SAPS, 2009</xref>). During the holiday periods, individuals are more likely to spend time with friends and family members, which may place them at increased risk of violence. A study in Minnesota by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013916510397758">Cohn and Rotton (2003)</xref> has shown that levels of assault increase on public holidays, specifically Christmas Day and New Year’s Day—even though these holidays occur in winter in the United States. Further research should aim to tease out the exact nature of the relationship between major and minor holidays and levels of violent crime in South Africa.</p>
<p>The fact that aggressive crimes increase in summer is certainly not new (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013916510397758">Cohn, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013916510397758">Rotton &amp; Cohn, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0013916510397758">2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013916510397758">2004</xref>). The results presented here, however, significantly extend the earlier work on this topic by not only examining crime seasonality at a finer level of aggregation but also by relating seasonal crime levels to the ecological characteristics of these small geographical areas. Our second hypothesis focuses on the impact of neighborhood deprivation on the relationship between seasonality and crime, stating that the seasonal pattern of assault is influenced by deprivation. The results largely support this hypothesis as well. Assault levels in urban neighborhoods of Tshwane were found to be socially stratified and spatially uniform, regardless of the season of the year. Moreover, the social stratification of assault was consistent for all assault types, with the exception of indecent assault, which exhibited greater fluctuation. The strength of these relationships do, however, vary somewhat by season (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0013916510397758">Figure 3</xref>), with the ratio of the prevalence of overall assault in deprivation quintile five (high deprivation) compared with quintile one (low deprivation) being the greatest in summer (December). This finding indicates that the <italic>difference</italic> in assault levels by neighborhoods stratified by deprivation quintile is the greatest in summer. The implication being that individuals in more socially deprived neighborhoods in Tshwane are more inclined to commit assault in summer than in any other season of the year. This finding suggests that people from varying levels of society are <italic>not</italic> equally prone to the same seasonal “heat of the moment” outbable and that people living in more deprived parts of a city are more likely to react to some act of provocation by friend or family on a long, hot summer day—at least in a South African context. The results in support of the second hypothesis are to be viewed with caution however. That is because much of the strength of the association between deprivation and season can be determined by the size of the sample. For example, a very weak effect can be found to be “statistically significant,” whereas a fairly strong effect can fail to attain statistical significance dependent on, among others, the sample size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013916510397758">Cortina &amp; Nouri, 2000</xref>). The correlations shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0013916510397758">Table 3</xref> are based on five data points (one per quintile) and are therefore to be interpreted with caution. Although the Q5:Q1 ratios shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013916510397758">Table 1</xref> and graphed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0013916510397758">Figure 3</xref> do not suffer from the same inherent problem, it could be that dividing the neighborhoods of Tshwane into quartiles or deciles and calculating a similar ratio could result in different effects than those presented here.</p>

<p>The results presented here are generally in accord with the prevailing international evidence, suggesting that seasonal crime rates are more pronounced in areas with lower socioeconomic wealth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013916510397758">Harries and Stadler (1983)</xref>, for instance, found that the relationship between temperature and assault in Dallas, Texas, was stronger in low- than high-socioeconomic neighborhoods, and concluded that this was because the rich were better able to escape the hot temperatures. Later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013916510397758">Harries et al. (1984)</xref> showed that the hot summer effects on aggressive crime rates were most pronounced in neighborhoods where air conditioning was scarce. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013916510397758">Rotton and Cohn (2004)</xref> found that assaults in climate-controlled settings remained fairly constant over time but that there was a linear increase in crimes in areas that probably lacked climate control. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916510397758">Ceccato (2005)</xref> found considerable differences in spatial patterns of homicide from season to season in São Paulo, Brazil. Significant clusters of seasonal homicide occurred in summer and winter in the disadvantaged areas in the south of the city. Although these studies have helped to explain interneighborhood variations of crime by season, few researchers have been able to demonstrate a clear stratified social pattern in seasonal crime levels. By calculating assault rates for neighborhoods divided into quintiles of deprivation, we have not only been able to establish a stratified social pattern of crime but also demonstrate that this pattern is uniform across all four seasons and most categories of assault. In addition, these results provide support for SEA theory, which predicts that the setting in which the crime occurs may impact the temperature–aggression relationship. However, it should be noted that although both NAE and SEA models hypothesis effects as a function of temperature, this study has not measured temperature, although month is effectively a proxy for average temperature. Therefore, caution should be taken when applying these findings to the NAE and SEA models.</p>
<p>A final notable finding of this study is that overall assault rates are consistently <italic>higher</italic> in the least deprived neighborhoods of Tshwane (quintile one) when compared with quintiles two and three (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0013916510397758">Figure 2</xref>). This pattern was consistent for overall assault, assault GBH, and common assault. In some instances, the assault levels in the least deprived neighborhoods were not vastly different to those in the most deprived neighborhoods. Although not directly comparable, this anomaly is certainly inconsistent with similar research that has found either no social stratification, or more commonly, that seasonal crime rates are more pronounced in areas with lower socioeconomic wealth (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916510397758">Ceccato, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013916510397758">Harries et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013916510397758">Rotton &amp; Cohn, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Several explanations may help to explain this inconsistency. First, assaults in South Africa tend to co-occur with other types of crime, particularly property crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013916510397758">SAPS, 2009</xref>). Affluent neighborhoods and occupied households are also more likely to be targeted by perpetrators of property crime in South Africa. This surprising finding is one of the main results obtained from a recent survey of property offenders in South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0013916510397758">Zinn, 2008</xref>). In his research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0013916510397758">Zinn (2008)</xref> found that residential burglaries in South Africa were more likely to occur when residents are at home and awake. His study found that offenders were attracted to occupied residences for a number of reasons: First, offenders felt that the probability of obtaining a larger reward (e.g., acquiring hidden cash and jewelry) was greater if the home owner/s were present. Second, offenders believed that they were less likely to be surprised during a burglary or robbery if the home owner/s were already present during the time of the crime. Third, offenders stated that any existing alarm system was more likely to be switched off if the homeowners were present. Offenders burglarizing occupied households must expect to come face to face with occupants of these households and would need to carry some weapon to subdue the occupants. The likely result of these confrontations is the probable use of force and violence, including assault, thus leading to an increase in assault in more affluent neighborhoods. This interpretation is important from a theoretical perspective because it contradicts one of the core pillars of RA theory: that a capable guardian will <italic>discourage</italic> a crime from taking place. Indeed, it appears from Zinn’s findings that burglars in South Africa actually prefer to target a home in which a capable guardian is present.</p>
<p>Another possible explanation for the relatively higher rates of assault in affluent neighborhoods of Tshwane could be the influence of alcohol. Not only are up to 90% of assaults in South Africa committed by people who are known to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013916510397758">SAPS, 2009</xref>), but research conducted by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0013916510397758">South African Institute for Security Studies (2004)</xref> has found that 40% of assault victims reported that their assailant was under the influence of alcohol and/or other drugs at the time of the assault, and one third of victims admitted to having been under the influence of alcohol themselves at the time. Other research in South Africa has found similar results (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013916510397758">Kalichman &amp; Simbayi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013916510397758">Parry et al., 2005</xref>). Alcohol is a known modifier of human behavior, as it decreases an individual’s cognitive abilities and lowers inhibition. These effects may increase the likelihood of a physical confrontation among individuals within any socioeconomic setting. Previous crime seasonality research has suggested that alcohol consumption can enhance and/or accelerate the relationship between violence and temperature (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013916510397758">Rotton &amp; Cohn, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013916510397758">2004</xref>). It is also possible that alcohol consumption may moderate the effects of socioeconomic inequalities on various types of criminal behavior, including assault. However, although there may be more malevolent reasons for the comparatively higher levels of assault in more affluent neighborhoods in Tshwane, without more contextual detail available in the crime data—such as the modus operandi, whether the crime occurred indoors or outdoors, or whether alcohol was in any way involved—any association between alcohol, time, and deprivation will be difficult to determine.</p>
<p>In addition, it is possible that victims in the more socially deprived quintiles are less likely to report assaults to the police, perhaps because of fear of retaliation or because they do not trust the authorities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013916510397758">Azfar &amp; Gurgur, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013916510397758">Soares, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013916510397758">Levitt (1999)</xref> stated that “there is evidence that the propensity to report crime to the police is a function of a victim’s income” (p. 97) with low-income households being less likely to report victimization to the police compared with households with high-income levels. Thus, it is possible that the difference between higher and lower quintiles may be larger than that found in database on crimes reported to the police.</p>
<p>It is important to note that there is still an overall linear relationship between the number of assaults and social deprivation in Tshwane: Assault rates generally increase in neighborhoods from low to high deprivation. The explanations provided above are therefore not aimed at addressing a main effect identified in the study but are rather an attempt to explain this unexpected finding. Interestingly, this unexpected finding reveals the complex nature of violent crime in post-apartheid South Africa and provides an avenue for future research.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The main aims of this research were to determine whether levels of assault varied by season in Tshwane and to investigate the possible influence of a neighborhood’s level of social deprivation on seasonal rates of assault. Not only has this study accomplished these goals, but it also makes several important contributions to the existing literature on seasonality and criminal behavior. First, this study demonstrates that assault in South Africa is seasonal. Although this may be considered a rather trivial finding to international crime scholars, the fact that this study is the first of its kind in South Africa, and indeed Africa as a whole, makes it highly significant. Second, the study has demonstrated that levels of assault in urban neighborhoods in South Africa are socially stratified and spatially homogeneous regardless of the season of the year. Moreover, it is clear from this research that certain ecological characteristics of neighborhoods, such as social deprivation, can influence the pattern and magnitude of interneighborhood crime seasonality. More research is needed to determine whether these findings are generalizable to other countries. Third, the study has raised some doubt as to the applicability of RA theory when explaining crime phenomena in South Africa. Future research could use more sophisticated GIS methods to tease out these theoretical anomalies and demonstrate ways in which other ecological characteristics of neighborhoods could influence subcity crime seasonality. We believe that the results presented here, although preliminary, are sufficiently valuable to merit further investigation and that they provide an important spatial–temporal platform for future crime seasonality research in South Africa.</p>
