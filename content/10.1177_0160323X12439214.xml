<p>This research note examines the Western Wisconsin Intergovernmental Collaborative (WWIC), located in three mainly rural Wisconsin counties bordering the Minneapolis–St. Paul region, including the results of a survey of chief elected officials representing local governments in the region. Despite the fact that the WWIC has not generated significant interest among most prospective member governments, survey results indicate that many of these governments are engaged in collaborations with other jurisdictions. The lack of interest of smaller communities in participating in a regional organization should not necessarily be seen as evidence that such communities are not using collaborative arrangements with other jurisdictions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The subject of regionalism has received extensive attention in recent years among scholars of state and local government, and a number of influential works have been published which discuss the prospects for regional policies and governing institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160323X12439214">Dreier, Mollenkopf, and Swanstrom 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160323X12439214">Orfield 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160323X12439214">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0160323X12439214">Rusk 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160323X12439214">2001</xref>). Yet, there are several different approaches to what has been labeled the “new regionalism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0160323X12439214">Savitch and Vogel 2000</xref>). These approaches can be viewed along a continuum, with “one large super-metropolitan area government” that “consolidates the powers of existing local governments” at one end, and “cooperation among local governments on a policy-by-policy basis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0160323X12439214">Post 2004</xref>, 67), or regional governance, at the other. In between these extremes is a “new tier of local government—regional government” that maintains existing local units of local government but centralizes certain specific policy functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0160323X12439214">Post 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Considering the many obstacles to the creation of new layers of government, numerous scholars have examined the practice of regional governance and interlocal agreements. Some studies have suggested that such agreements are predicated on the fiscal stress of the governments involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160323X12439214">Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160323X12439214">McManus and Caruson 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160323X12439214">Morgan and Hirlinger 1991</xref>). Other research has focused on the transaction costs of service agreements among local governments, including bargaining costs, information costs, agency costs, division costs, and enforcement costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X12439214">Feiock, Steinacker, and Jun Park 2009</xref>). Still other work has emphasized the presence of third-party coercion and incentives to produce interlocal agreements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160323X12439214">Agranoff and McGuire 2003</xref>), while several researchers have examined questions related to municipalities’ local and regional reputations as motivating factors in the creation of such agreements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160323X12439214">Andrew 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160323X12439214">Clingermayer and Feiock 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160323X12439214">Feiock 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160323X12439214">Gulatti and Singh 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160323X12439214">Steinacker 2004</xref>). A related line of inquiry involves the issue of consensus building and collaboration among local jurisdictions in order to address complex regional policy problems. This work has suggested that such collaborations can achieve a number of important goals in addition to the creation of specific agreements, including increased social and intellectual capital, improved policy networks, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160323X12439214">Innis and Booher 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160323X12439214">2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the volume of work that has been produced, scholars have paid less attention to interlocal cooperation among jurisdictions with small populations in more rural locations. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160323X12439214">Hawkins’ (2009)</xref> extensive survey of local government officials’ attitudes toward establishing joint ventures with other jurisdictions involved municipalities with populations of 10,000 or greater. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X12439214">Feiock, Steinacker, and Jun Park's (2009</xref>) research is based on jurisdictions with populations over 50,000. And in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160323X12439214">Lamothe, Lamothe, and Feiock's (2008</xref>) work, which relies on surveys by the International City/County Management Association, only 3.5 percent of respondents represented jurisdictions with populations of less than 10,000. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160323X12439214">Agranoff and McGuire’s (2003)</xref> survey included jurisdictions under 2,500, only 5 percent of the 237 cities that responded to their survey were of this size. Although the field of rural studies has begun to examine regional governance in rural areas, this work tends to focus on communities in other nations, such as Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160323X12439214">Hall and Stern 2009</xref>), or on the role of nongovernmental organizations in initiating specific regional projects in rural areas in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160323X12439214">Hamin and Marcucci 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This article is a case study of an organization falling near the regional governance end of the continuum mentioned above. The voluntary organization was created to encourage regional collaboration among local jurisdictions in three largely rural counties of western Wisconsin bordering the Minneapolis–St. Paul metropolitan region. The background and brief history of the organization are examined, and survey results of prospective member governments are also analyzed. Overall, while local jurisdictions have shown little enthusiasm for participating in the regional collaborative, survey results indicate that a significant number of these jurisdictions are already participating in a variety of cooperative arrangements with neighboring jurisdictions. These findings suggest that if faced with the trends associated with rapid growth, metropolitan sprawl, and declining revenue sources, a sizable number of local jurisdictions in rural regions may well be willing to engage in interlocal cooperation on their own despite an apparent lack of interest in participating in a regional collaborative.</p>

<title>The Western Wisconsin Intergovernmental Collaborative (WWIC): Background and Formation<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0160323X12439214">1</xref>
</sup>
</title>
<p>Immediately to the east of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul in Minnesota is western Wisconsin. With the state border approximately fifteen miles east of St. Paul, western Wisconsin is convenient for commuters to St. Paul, Minneapolis, and surrounding suburbs, making this region, for all practical purposes, within the Twin Cities metropolitan area. The three Wisconsin counties closest to the Twin Cities (Pierce, Polk, and St. Croix), have grown by a considerable amount in recent years. In 1990, the population of these counties was 117,789, but by 2009, this figure had increased roughly 42 percent to 167,684 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0160323X12439214">Washington County 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160323X12439214">US Census Bureau 2008</xref>). This rapid growth has precipitated a process of “nudging the region’s rural character to somewhat of a more suburban nature” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160323X12439214">Giles 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite this rate of growth, the three-county region of St. Croix, Pierce, and Polk is still largely agricultural and contains dozens of smaller municipalities. Of the ninety-four cities, villages, and townships in these counties, seventy-four have populations below 2,000, with forty-five of these having fewer than 1,000 residents. While five jurisdictions have populations over 4,000, just two of these are over 10,000: River Falls, with roughly 14,000 residents, and Hudson, with approximately 12,000. Thus, while western Wisconsin hangs on the edge of the Twin Cities metropolitan area, it is still largely a rural area.</p>
<p>The origins of the WWIC can be traced to a series of meetings in 2004 and 2005 initiated by the University of Wisconsin, River Falls (UWRF), a comprehensive four-year institution within the University of Wisconsin system located in the City of River Falls in Pierce County. Witnessing the changes occurring in the region, the university initiated a series of public discussions in 2004 to gauge the views of both local government officials and residents about the region’s current problems and future. One of the ideas that emerged from these meetings was the desire to create some sort of intergovernmental organization that could address the changing needs of the region. At a meeting in June 2005, three issues specifically discussed within the framework of “regional problem solving” included wastewater, storm water, and transportation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0160323X12439214">UWRF 2005</xref>). Yet at each of the formative meetings, the need for the proposed organization to promote best practices in service delivery generally was also emphasized, an indication that local leaders did not want the new organization to focus only on these issues. Further, one of the “points of agreement” expressed in the March 2005 meeting was that the new organization be “advisory in nature” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0160323X12439214">UWRF 2005</xref>). Several local officials argued vigorously against giving the proposed organization any substantive powers in relation to local governments. Thus, while it was clear from the beginning that anything resembling a regional government was not an option in western Wisconsin, it remained unclear as to what degree the nascent organization would promote effective regional governance, and how local jurisdictions in the three counties would respond.</p>
<p>Throughout the rest of 2005, the details of the new organization were developed, and in 2006, the WWIC was officially born and registered as a nonprofit corporation with the State of Wisconsin. Membership was voluntary and would be open to officials from any of the ninety-seven separate jurisdictions in Pierce, Polk, and St. Croix Counties (ninety-four local governments and the three counties). The WWIC’s main goals were spelled out in its bylaws: “The members, through the organization, will: share information, experiences and best practices on key issues and problems; serve as an ‘Issues Clearinghouse’; engage in regional problem solving for such topics as, but not limited to, dealing with waste water, storm water management, transportation, economic development, creating sustainable communities; develop a more visible regional identity; serve as a voice for the three-county region to influence public policy; help to provide advice and expertise by drawing upon the resources of U.W.-River Falls and U.W. Extension; and explore the potential of governmental cost savings through shared services” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0160323X12439214">WWIC 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>At the 2005 preliminary meetings, several attendees expressed opposition to the new organization having the ability to lobby, and so serving as a “voice for the region” was intended to enable the organization to have formal, regular dialogue with state legislators and other regional leaders at meetings. The bylaws also made clear that the WWIC was not created for fostering collaboration in one specific area. Rather, because of the views expressed by prospective members, the goals of regional problem solving and exploring possibilities for shared services were left intentionally broad and would eventually depend on the preferences of members. To give prospective members more of a stake in the organization and to defray the costs of quarterly meetings, the WWIC adopted dues and fees for meeting attendance. Annual dues were $200 for counties, $100 for cities and villages, and $50 for towns, and each jurisdiction would be charged $20 to attend meetings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0160323X12439214">WWIC 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2006, the WWIC began to have quarterly meetings in various locations in the three counties, with each one focusing on a specific subject of interest to local governments. Transportation figured prominently in these meetings, and at least one meeting each year focused on this issue. In addition, beginning in 2007, one quarterly meeting each year was dedicated to a dialogue with state legislators from the region, and other meetings focused on various issues, including how local governments could collaborate with one another in the provision of services. Intergovernmental collaboration was a regular subject of quarterly meetings, either implicitly as it related to the policy issue discussed, or explicitly during those meetings that focused specifically on this form of governance.</p>
<p>While the quarterly meetings often generated lively discussion, the main impediment faced by the WWIC since its inception has been the lack of attendance at meetings and the relatively small number of local jurisdictions that were willing to become official members, both of which became the subject of extensive discussion at Board meetings. Meetings were held in several different locations in the three counties in an effort to facilitate attendance by representatives from a range of jurisdictions. Beginning in late 2005, informational postcards and fliers were mailed to all ninety-seven governments on a regular basis. But by early 2007, the WWIC failed to grow, and attendance at quarterly meetings remained small, with representatives from three to six local governments attending a typical meeting.</p>
<p>Thus, later in 2007, the WWIC Board, in conjunction with UWRF, decided to take extra measures to promote the organization, including the creation of a Web site and an e-mail list. While electronic communication replaced traditional mail for a brief period, Board members ultimately decided that the WWIC would continue to send materials by mail in addition to e-mail based on the belief that more forms of contact with local officials could only improve the organization’s visibility. Yet, these new forms of communication had little impact on local officials’ interest in the organization. Attendance at quarterly meetings remained consistently low, with a substantial majority of representatives from the ninety-seven jurisdictions never having attended any meetings at all. In an effort to increase meeting attendance, in 2008, the Board decided to waive fees at individual meetings and stopped collecting annual dues. This decision meant it was no longer possible to formally become a member of the organization. Rather, interest in the WWIC would be measured solely by meeting attendance. Despite the elimination of all fees, however, attendance continued to be low throughout 2008 and 2009.</p>

<sec id="section3-0160323X12439214">
<title>Survey of Local Officials</title>
<p>By the spring of 2010, despite the measures discussed above, the WWIC showed no progress in generating interest among local governments. In an effort to systematically determine the views of local governments in the three-county region regarding the WWIC and cooperative efforts with other local jurisdictions, the Board authorized a survey of all ninety-seven chief elected officials representing jurisdictions in the three counties. Chief elected officials were selected based on the assumption that they would be in the best position to know about both the WWIC and whether their jurisdiction participated in any joint governmental efforts with other jurisdictions. To maximize the response rate, the UWRF’s Survey Research Center conducted the survey over the telephone. Each elected official was called at their home telephone number up to five separate times, and those officials unable to be reached by telephone were sent a copy of the survey by mail. Combined, these measures created a response rate of 59 percent (fifty-seven total jurisdictions). To solicit the most candid responses, survey participants were guaranteed anonymity; the only information about respondents that was recorded was the type of jurisdiction they represented, the length of time they had held elective office in their jurisdiction, and the length of time they had held their current position. Survey respondents were fairly diverse and included representatives from all three counties, fourteen cities and villages (42 percent), and forty towns (66 percent). The three counties are roughly 96 percent white, and no municipalities in the region possess either substantial racial diversity or extreme wealth or poverty. Thus, it is fair to say that any sample of jurisdictions from the region closely approximates the demographics of the region as a whole. Yet at the same time, the region is less racially diverse than rural America generally, which was recently estimated to be 82 percent white (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160323X12439214">Johnson 2006</xref>, 24).</p>
<p>The survey results are presented below in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0160323X12439214">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0160323X12439214">2</xref>. In addition to the items reported in the tables, respondents were provided with an open-ended question for any additional comments which generated twenty-four separate responses. Because the survey was carried out well after membership dues were eliminated, respondents were not asked about whether they were members of the WWIC. Rather, the questions involved respondents’ perceptions of the organization, meeting attendance, and whether their jurisdiction was involved in any collaborative governing arrangements. In light of most local officials’ lack of interest in attending WWIC meetings or becoming members, the author’s expectation was that collaborative governing arrangements among local jurisdictions in the region would be few in number. Thus, even respondents who reported some collaborative efforts with other jurisdictions were not specifically asked what issue/issues these collaborations involved, but they were free to comment on such collaborations in the open-ended question.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0160323X12439214">Table 1</xref>, 53 percent of respondents were not familiar with the purpose of the WWIC, and, not surprisingly, only 5 percent reported attending meetings regularly. Other findings shed light on most respondents’ lack of interest in the organization. The two most frequently cited reasons (48 percent of all respondents) for meeting nonattendance were that the times of the meetings were inconvenient, and that respondents did not have enough time to attend. Yet, meetings have been deliberately scheduled in the evening and to not conflict with regular municipal meetings. While 22 percent said that the location of the meetings was not convenient, meetings were, in fact, held in different locations beginning in 2006 in order to minimize this potential problem. The relative popularity of these reasons for nonparticipation suggests that most local officials believed they would gain little from the WWIC.</p>
<p>To the author’s surprise, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0160323X12439214">Table 2</xref>, just over half of survey respondents (<italic>N</italic> = 29, 51 percent) indicated that their jurisdiction was involved in at least one collaborative effort with another jurisdiction, with most of these governments reporting several collaborations. When considering the diversity of respondents as well as number of jurisdictions reporting collaborative agreements, it becomes clear that all types of jurisdictions were involved in collaborations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0160323X12439214">2</xref>
</sup> Because respondents were not specifically asked about the issues they collaborated on, additional evidence was utilized to gain a better picture of the nature of interlocal collaborations in the region. Towns in Wisconsin typically rely on other jurisdictions for law enforcement, which helps explain some of the survey responses from elected officials from towns.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0160323X12439214">3</xref>
</sup> Yet, data obtained through observations at quarterly meetings, the author’s personal communications with Board members, and in the open-ended survey question revealed that municipalities in the region are engaged in several different types of cooperative efforts on issues including library services, street cleaning, road maintenance, and purchasing. While I cannot make this claim definitely, I found no evidence (at meetings, in personal communications, or in the open-ended survey responses) that any local communities in the region are engaged in efforts relating to economic development or planning, despite the fact that “economic development” and “creating sustainable communities” were both specifically mentioned in the organization’s bylaws. This is suggestive of the limited impact the WWIC has had on patterns of interlocal cooperation.</p>
<p>Other data obtained in the survey also help explain the seemingly large number of collaborative efforts reported. For example, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0160323X12439214">Table 1</xref>, 66 percent of respondents acknowledged that the purposes of the WWIC are important, while 45 percent expressed interest in attending future meetings. These responses, juxtaposed with the 51 percent of jurisdictions reporting collaborative agreements, seem to indicate not a widespread lack of interest in collaboration among local officials, but rather a preference to initiate and carry out such agreements independently.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The brief history of the WWIC and the survey of officials representing the organization’s prospective member governments tell seemingly contradictory stories. The vast majority of local officials in western Wisconsin have shown little interest in the WWIC over the course of its five-year history. Despite a wide variety of publicity, only a handful of local jurisdictions have regularly attended WWIC meetings or sought to become members. Ironically, the organization’s lack of any substantive powers, which resulted from local officials’ staunch resistance to the creation of anything resembling a regional government, may well have doomed it from the start. The WWIC’s lack of power necessarily made it a low-stakes organization, one that could easily be ignored with no tangible consequences. Yet, at the same time, a significant number of local governments in the three counties report being involved in collaborative efforts with neighboring jurisdictions. On the surface, these two facts seem contradictory. But upon closer inspection, these findings are not necessarily contradictory and can be explained by the characteristics of small town politics as well as existing literature on interlocal cooperation.</p>
<p>Since its inception, the WWIC’s Board and most active leaders have consisted primarily of small-town elected officials. And the Board members are representative of all local elected officials in the region in that they receive salaries of a few thousand dollars annually for their public service, and either have full-time jobs unrelated to politics or are not in the work force. Unlike mayors or city council members from larger cities, small-town elected officials tend not to have political ambition as traditionally understood as the desire to run for higher office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160323X12439214">Sokolow 1989</xref>). Therefore, they lack the political incentives possessed by officials representing larger municipalities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0160323X12439214">4</xref>
</sup> In the absence of constituent pressure, as part-time representatives typically not planning to run for higher office, one could hypothesize that it is unlikely for small-town elected officials to take a visible stand in favor of regional intergovernmental cooperation.</p>
<p>In addition to the motivations for interlocal cooperation discussed above, there are several other potential motivations for such cooperation, including long-term regional planning, determining the most appropriate method of decision making and policy implementation, and reasons related to local and regional identity. But none of these motivations has played a significant part of any discussions involving the WWIC. Rather, since the organization’s preliminary meetings, the entire discussion of interlocal cooperation in the region has been framed in terms of cost savings for local governments, including by many officials who never became involved in the WWIC. Thus, it is fair to suggest that the internal reasons for collaboration in the three counties revolve mainly around a desire for cost savings.</p>
<p>While survey respondents were not asked when they initiated such cooperative arrangements, both the author’s discussions with several individual Board members and the observations at many Board meetings provide support for the notion that interlocal cooperative arrangements among jurisdictions in the region have developed independent of and most likely before the creation of the WWIC. Additional evidence of local governments initiating such agreements on their own is the widespread lack of interest in the WWIC shown by local jurisdictions combined with the fact that over half of survey respondents admitted that they were not even familiar with the purposes of the organization. These findings further diminish the possibility that the WWIC has informed the decisions of local officials with respect to interlocal cooperation.</p>
<p>The part-time status of elected officials in the three-county region of the WWIC also relates to the issue of coercion or selective incentives vis-à-vis the lack of participation of a significant majority of local jurisdictions. The only selective incentives provided by the WWIC —benefits denied to local governments that do not participate in the organization—consist of information. Local governments pay no direct, tangible price for not becoming involved or attending meetings. The organization was conceived as an educational nonprofit, and meetings have focused on informing local governments about a range of policy issues, including intergovernmental cooperation.</p>
<p>To be sure, the information provided and exchanged at WWIC meetings has been valuable to the limited number of jurisdictions that have been active members of the organization. However, the chronic lack of interest among local governments suggests that officials representing most jurisdictions apparently do not believe that the benefits are sufficient to justify meeting attendance. This sentiment was confirmed by the author in several conversations with current and past Board members who echoed the notion that it was not clear to local officials with whom they had been in contact what local jurisdictions would receive from WWIC membership and meeting attendance.</p>
<p>Yet, as the survey revealed, a significant amount of interlocal cooperation is occurring in western Wisconsin, most of which probably predated the formal creation of the WWIC in 2006. This cooperation has developed because of a dedicated and creative group of local officials in a number of jurisdictions who are committed to joining forces with neighboring governments in an era of shrinking public resources, not as a result of an intergovernmental collaborative. One survey respondent’s statement in the open-ended question captured this view succinctly. This elected official said that the reason their jurisdiction has not participated in the WWIC is because they “have a number of joint projects already, and seem to cooperate (with other governments) quite well” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0160323X12439214">UWRF , Survey Research Center 2010</xref>). While the context of rural Ontario, Canada, is clearly different, the findings reported here are similar to those of Hall and Stern, who found “several examples of partial, voluntary, and ad hoc regional cooperation” simultaneous to “profound resistance more formal regional governance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160323X12439214">Hall and Stern 2009</xref>, 74).</p>
<p>In sum, the experience of the WWIC , in contrast with patterns of interlocal cooperation in the organization’s three-county region, is instructive. Policy makers and scholars examining prospective modes of interlocal cooperation among small and rural jurisdictions elsewhere would be wise not to assume such cooperation is uncommon simply because of an apparent lack of interest in an institutionalized structure oriented around regional collaboration.</p>

<p>Much of this research is based on the author’s firsthand involvement with the WWIC beginning in August 2005. Since that date, I have attended nearly all of the organization’s meetings, met with Board members individually and in small groups, and have had access to all of the organization’s documents.</p>

<p>Officials from all three counties responded to the survey, and the author’s personal communications with county officials confirmed that all three were involved in collaborations with other governments. This would leave twenty-six jurisdictions reporting collaborations, which far exceeds the fourteen respondents from cities and villages, meaning that at least twelve respondents from towns reported interlocal collaborations.</p>

<p>While “town” and “township” are often used interchangeably, “town” is the correct designation for the form of government to which I am referring. In Wisconsin, towns have less legal authority than cities and villages. For example, in addition to relying on other governments for law enforcement, towns typically possess volunteer fire departments, and do not have the powers of annexation possessed by cities and villages.</p>

<p>The argument about small town officials’ lack of political ambition for higher office is also supported anecdotally by the author’s many conversations and interactions with local officials in western Wisconsin over the course of this research.</p>
