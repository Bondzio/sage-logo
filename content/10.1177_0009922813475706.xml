<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Thyroid function tests (TFTs) are the most frequently ordered endocrine investigations in children and adolescents. Abnormalities in TFTs can help in diagnosis of primary thyroid disorders (i.e. disorders in which the defect is at the thyroid level) as well as secondary or central thyroid disorders (in which defect is at the pituitary level). Hypothyroidism is the most common thyroid disorder in the pediatric (as well as adult) population. Although there is a paucity of population studies on the prevalence of acquired hypothyroidism in children, the few studies that have been done on this subject indicate an increase in the prevalence of clinical hypothyroidism over the years. A study from the United Kingdom found a population prevalence of hypothyroidism in the &lt;22 years age-group of 0.135% for the period of 1993-1995, higher than the 0.04% to 0.06% reported prevalence in prior studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813475706">1</xref></sup> In the United States, reports based on the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) during a similar time period (1988 and 1994) as well as more recently (1999-2002) found the prevalence of clinical hypothyroidism to be 0.3%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813475706">2</xref></sup> This higher prevalence in the United States is likely because the population group studied was ≥12 years and the prevalence of hypothyroidism increases with age.</p>
<p>Symptoms of hypothyroidism are relatively nonspecific, diverse and often mild. Many children with symptoms of attention-deficit or hyperactivity, fatigue, obesity, constipation and hair loss have TFTs ordered to rule out hypothyroidism or thyroid hormone resistance as the cause of these symptoms. The majority of these patients, however, have normal results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813475706">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In recent years, there appears to be an increase in the use of TFTs by pediatricians during annual health assessments of healthy children. The frequent thyroid function testing and the relatively low prevalence of true thyroid pathologies has led to a high detection rate of values that are minimally outside given normal ranges. In general, on finding an “abnormal” TFT, the physician informs the parents of the abnormal values and recommends referral to a pediatric endocrinologist. In many cases, however, these values represent nonpathologic normal variants. The aim of this review is to provide pediatricians with guidelines that will help them distinguish between variants of normal from true thyroid pathology, and in doing so, avoid unnecessary parental anxiety and unwarranted subspecialist referrals.</p>

<sec id="section2-0009922813475706">
<title>Thyroid Hormone: Synthesis, Secretion, and Regulation</title>
<p>Iodine is the rate-limiting substrate for synthesis of thyroid hormone and the first step in the synthesis of thyroid hormone is iodide trapping by the thyroid gland. This inorganic iodide is organified by the enzyme thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and incorporated into thyroglobulin (Tg), a large glycoprotein synthesized by thyroid follicular cells, and mono- and diiodotyrosine (MIT and DIT) residues are formed. Subsequent coupling of these iodotyrosines within Tg molecule leads to the formation of the thyroid hormones: triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) that are stored in follicular colloid, the proteinaceous material contained within the thyroid follicular lumen. Under the effect of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), there is colloid resorption by the follicular cells and enzymatic degradation by lysosomal enzymes release MIT, DIT, T4, and T3. Whereas T4 and T3 are subsequently released in the circulation, MIT and DIT get deiodinated for recycling of iodine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813475706">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Only 20% of the total T3 in bloodstream is secreted by the thyroid gland; the remaining 80% is derived from conversion of T4 by deiodinases, which are enzymes present in peripheral tissues. Most of the thyroid hormone circulating in the bloodstream is bound to carrier proteins: thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), thyroxine binding prealbumin (TBPA or transthyretin), and albumin. Although TBG is the most important carrier protein for T4, T3 appears to be equally bound to TBG and albumin. These bound hormones are in equilibrium with their free forms and in euthyroid state, free T4 accounts for &lt;0.1% of the total T4 and free T3 accounts for ~0.3% of total T3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813475706">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion is closely regulated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) synthesized in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus travels across the medial eminence to the anterior pituitary through the hypophyseal portal venous system. TRH stimulates secretion of TSH from the pituitary. TSH is released into the systemic blood circulation and transported to the thyroid gland where it stimulates thyroid hormone synthesis and release. Regulatory feedback loops working at the level of pituitary and hypothalamus modulate thyroid hormone secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922813475706">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Measures of Thyroid Function</title>
<p>A number of tests are available to assess thyroid function and these can be broadly divided into 2 main categories:</p>
<list id="list1-0009922813475706" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Thyroid profiling tests</italic> to detect or exclude disturbances in thyroid function. This includes TSH and total and free levels of T4 and T3. Additional tests that are often included in “thyroid panels” of commercial laboratories include Tg, TBG, and T3 uptake (T3U) or T3 resin uptake (T3RU).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Definitive tests</italic> of thyroid to identify the etiology of thyroid disease. These tests mainly include antibodies against various thyroid antigens, which are markers of autoimmune thyroid disease—both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, namely, antithyroglobulin antibody, antithyroperoxidase antibody, TSH receptor antibody, and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Several comprehensive reviews in the past have discussed abnormalities in these tests, which suggest hyperthyroid or hypothyroid states. This review will focus on “abnormalities” in these lab tests that do not necessarily indicate a pathologic state.</p>

</list>
<p>An elevated TSH level on a newborn screen should alert a practitioner to the possibility of congenital hypothyroidism. However, awareness of the thyroid adaptation in the immediate period after birth is very important for careful interpretation of this “screening” test.</p>
<list id="list4-0009922813475706" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>An abrupt increase in pituitary TSH secretion occurs soon after birth and reaches a peak of about 60 to 80 µIU/mL at 25 to 30 minutes of life. Serum TSH concentration decreases rapidly over the first 24 hours of life, and thereafter more slowly and generally falls to below 10 µIU/mL by 1 month.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813475706">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813475706">6</xref></sup> Therefore, results should be compared with the age-appropriate normal ranges for interpretation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922813475706">Table 1</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Newborn screen (NBS) for hypothyroidism may use a primary TSH test or a primary T4 test and this varies from state to state. The New York State hypothyroidism screening program is an example of a T4-based screening program. Total T4 is measured on these specimens and the lowest 10 percent are retested for T4 with additional TSH measurement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813475706">6</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>NBS specimens obtained before 48 hours of life have an increased rate of false positives especially for TSH-based assay. Although T4-based assays tend to be less affected by sampling time, at least a 24-hour wait is advisable before drawing the heel stick specimen to get satisfactory results. With shortening hospital stays this has become increasingly difficult. Hence, the NBS should be drawn after 48 hours of birth (optimal: between 2 and 6 days) or just prior to hospital discharge whichever comes first and results should be interpreted in relation to the postnatal age at time of sampling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813475706">7</xref></sup></p></list-item>

<p>A low total T4 with a TSH value in the normal range should alert a practitioner to the following possibilities:</p>
<list id="list16-0009922813475706" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Central hypothyroidism (CH)</italic>: This is characterized by inadequate thyroid hormone production (hence, low total and free T4) due to insufficient stimulation by TSH of an otherwise normal thyroid gland. The TSH level, however, is generally measurable and is frequently in the normal/ low range. The reported prevalence of CH ranges from 1:20 000 to 1:80 000 in the general population and has been reported to be about 1:160 000 among live newborns. It should be noted that newborn screening tests based on first-line TSH measurement will miss CH. The majority of CH cases are sporadic but there are some genetic forms. CH usually occurs as a part of combined pituitary hormone deficiencies and isolated forms are less common. In an otherwise healthy child who is clinically well, without midline defects (which can be associated with pituitary deficiencies), no history of a central nervous system insult or infection and no evidence of other pituitary hormone deficiencies, central hypothyroidism is very unlikely.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922813475706">11</xref></sup></p></list-item>

<list-item><p>(a) Hereditary TBG deficiency: The prevalence of hereditary TBG deficiency varies from 1:5000 to 1:12 000 newborn infants. TBG deficiency is an X-linked trait.

<list-item><p>(b) <italic>Acquired forms of TBG deficiency</italic>: Endocrine diseases such as Cushing syndrome and acromegaly are associated with low TBG levels.

<p>If the history and examination are not suggestive of an underlying systemic or endocrine illness (such as Cushing syndrome or acromegaly) and patient is not taking any drugs implicated in abnormalities of TFTs, the major differentials are central hypothyroidism and hereditary TBG deficiency. The following tests can help differentiate these diagnoses:</p>
<list id="list19-0009922813475706" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>T3 resin uptake (T3RU)</italic>: This test gives an indirect measure of serum TBG. The test is performed by incubating patient’s serum with radiolabeled T3 tracer, which binds to the unoccupied T4-binding sites (mostly TBG). Subsequently an insoluble resin (eg, dextran-coated charcoal) is added which traps the remaining unbound radiolabeled T3. The percentage of resin bound tracer is reported, which varies inversely with the number of available unoccupied T4-binding sites in serum (thus indirectly measuring TBG). The T3RU is therefore increased in TBG deficiency, whereas it is generally low in patients with true hypothyroidism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813475706">14</xref></sup></p></list-item>

<p>Although there are several types of thyroid autoantibodies described, antibodies directed against the thyroglobulin and thyroperoxidase enzyme (antithyroglobulin or TgAb and antithyroperoxidase or TPOAb, respectively) are most prevalent. Before the identification of TPO, antibodies against the thyroid microsomal antigen (located on the exocytic vesicles through which newly synthesized thyroglobulin is transferred to the follicular lumen) were detected in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. Later assays, showed a significant degree of correlation between antimicrosomal and TPOAb. Most of the newer assays are against TPO, however, antimicrosomal assays are still used in some laboratories and the term can still be found in the laboratory test lists and in the laboratory reports. Their presence is usually associated with Hashimoto’s autoimmune thyroiditis and consequent hypothyroidism.</p>
<list id="list32-0009922813475706" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (or chronic autoimmune thyroiditis) is the most common cause of nonendemic goiter and hypothyroidism in children older than 6 years. Up to 30% to 40% of patients with this disorder have a family history of thyroid disease and similar to most other thyroid disorders, occurs more often in females. Serum concentrations of TPOAb or TgAb are elevated in more than 95% of patients with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. In the NHANES III data, the prevalence of clinical hypothyroidism was strongly associated with positive TPOAb but not with positive TgAb. None of the hypothyroid individuals had positive TgAb in the absence of positive TPOAb, thereby making anti-TPO a more sensitive test for autoimmune thyroiditis (although most of the times, these antibodies are ordered together).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813475706">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813475706">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922813475706">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922813475706">19</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>These antithyroid antibodies are not specific for Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and are also found in more than 70% patients with Graves’s disease. In addition, 15% to 20% of otherwise healthy subjects with no evidence of thyroid disease may also have antithyroid antibodies (NHANES III).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>While patients with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis can develop hypothyroidism, they may also be euthyroid. Although the hypothyroid patients usually have the highest titers of antithyroid antibodies, the titer of antibodies does not always correlate with thyroid function. In most of hypothyroid patients with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis TPOAb titers tend to decrease with levothyroxine replacement; however, they do not correlate with thyroid function status and therefore following the titers in these patients is not of much clinical relevance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922813475706">19</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Positive antibodies in otherwise healthy individuals are thought to correlate with the presence of foci of lymphocytic infiltration within the thyroid gland. Despite being positive for these antibodies, these individuals may not develop thyroid dysfunction for several decades or their entire life span. Though some of these individuals may have early Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (presence of thyroid autoantibodies without hypothyroidism), these are more likely the individuals with a family history of thyroid disease and/or goiter and hence, may be followed with TSH and total T4 measurements every 6 to 12 months. However, in otherwise healthy individuals with isolated positive antithyroid antibodies, especially low titer, without any other risk factors (family history of thyroid disease or goiter) evidence for recommending routine follow-up TFTs is not strong. Hence, until further data becomes available, this subgroup may just be followed clinically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922813475706">20</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In the past decade, there have been some studies to investigate a possible benefit of prophylactic levothyroxine therapy in euthyroid patients with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. These are mostly animal models or studies done in adult subjects and whereas some of these have found a decrease in serological and cellular markers of thyroid autoimmunity, others have reported a decrease in size of thyroid gland as determined by ultrasound.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813475706">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922813475706">22</xref></sup> However, currently there is no consensus about this proposed benefit and the long term clinical advantage of this approach is not known.

<p>Thyroglobulin (Tg) undergoes proteolytic cleavage in the thyroid follicular cells to release T4 and T3. About 90% or more of the Tg molecule undergoes degradation by lysosomal enzymes and is recycled. However, a fraction of Tg remains “undigested” and enters the circulation. An elevated Tg level in a child with no preexisting thyroid disease and with normal thyroid hormone levels is of limited diagnostic significance as of itself it cannot rule in or rule out a diagnosis. Hence, routine measurement of Tg levels as a part of “thyroid panels” is not indicated and should only be done in postoperative thyroid cancer monitoring or in evaluation of specific diagnoses like congenital hypothyroidism and congenital goiter.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Recent studies on the prevalence of thyroid disorders have found that most patients with hypothyroidism have a subclinical disease (i.e. subclinical hypothyroidism - see above) with a prevalence of 3.4% (compared to 0.3% prevalence of clinical hypothyroidism).2 The diagnosis in these patients is based on abnormal TFTs in apparently asymptomatic patients. Hence it is important to differentiate the abnormal thyroid function results from variants of normal. The clinical scenarios discussed above highlight that an “abnormal” value reported in thyroid function test results does not necessarily mean pathology. Several of these “abnormal” results are likely variations of normal and not true thyroid pathology.</p>
<p>In summary,</p>
<list id="list37-0009922813475706" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Recognize that normal ranges provided by laboratory may not always be age appropriate. Hence before interpreting a result as abnormal, compare it with age-appropriate normal range.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>TSH is a very sensitive marker of primary thyroid disease. Therefore, an isolated derangement in T4 and/or T3 without any change in TSH is less likely to represent true thyroid pathology.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Abnormal lab tests should be interpreted taking the whole picture into account. If symptoms are scant, family history and clinical findings such as goiter may be helpful in making clinical decisions about the significance of the lab results and formulating follow-up plan.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When considering primary thyroid disease, ordering serum TSH alone or TSH with total T4 should suffice. If these suggest hypothyroidism, TPOAb and TgAb may be added.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When considering hyperthyroidism in the differential, order serum TSH and total T3 with or without a total T4 (and/or free T4) as the initial tests.</p></list-item>
