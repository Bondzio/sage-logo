<p><bold>Aideen Dunne, Angela Scriven from Brunel University and Carole Furlong from NHS Harrow, assess the thorny relationship between evaluation, evidence and funding for health promotion interventions</bold></p>
<p>There is an emerging, problematic and synergistic association between the evidence of effectiveness of health promotion interventions and the availability of funding. This was recently highlighted in a UK Government directive calling for greater accountability for public health funding, resulting in Directors of Public Health having to decide which health improvement initiatives should be sustained and which should be cut.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913912444047">1</xref></sup> In future, from April 2013, councils will be given a ring-fenced budget, a share of around £5.2 billion based on 2012/13 funding, and will be able to choose how they spend it according to the public health needs of their population. More importantly, those who make the most improvements will be rewarded with a cash incentive. So, local authorities will be paid a new health premium for the progress they make against the public health indicators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913912444047">2</xref></sup> Funding linked to evidence is now the norm.</p>
<p>Such economic expediency applied to health promotion funding highlights a fundamental requirement. In essence, in times of financial rationalisation, the field of health promotion has to embrace an evidence informed approach, with the primary source of evidence being derived from evaluating practice, reporting and disseminating the results. Moreover, if this is to work, health promotion must be high on the political agenda, there must be effective evaluation systems in place to generate a body of evidence of effectiveness and finally there must be availability of funding. If one of the elements in this three way relationship is absent or weak the relationship fails and the other elements become significantly challenged. This presents a Catch 22 scenario. Funding is needed to pull evidence from practice through evaluation, before this evidence can be used to influence the political agenda and justify a continued funding stream.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913912444047">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are other obstacles to evaluating health promotion. There has long been a consensus that rigorous and appropriate evaluation makes a vital contribution to the development of practice and knowledge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757913912444047">4</xref></sup> and reduces uncertainty in planning and commissioning of future health promotion interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757913912444047">5</xref></sup> Despite this consensus, evaluation in practice has been variable and <italic>ad hoc</italic>. This is the result of several conundrums: lack of universal agreement of what counts as evidence in health promotion; lack of guidance on what constitutes rigorous evaluation; and consequently, the use of inappropriate methods to derive evidence from practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757913912444047">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757913912444047">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>A key problem is that the principles underpinning the practice of health promotion are complex. Interventions are often targeting the wider determinants of health and are developed specifically for the situation and communities within which they are implemented; they are not standardised procedures but often dynamic processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757913912444047">6</xref></sup> Health promotion can be both a process and an outcome and evaluation of the success of a health promotion intervention has to capture multiple effects. Within the context of the complexity of health promotion practice, it becomes very difficult to prioritise or define what counts as evidence. There are those that argue that it is inappropriate to follow protocols from other fields of practice (such as the biomedical approach to evidence) and apply them directly to health promotion. The hierarchy of evidence used by other practitioners often does not lend itself to the complex nature and degree of uniqueness of some health promotion interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757913912444047">8</xref></sup> However, some form of parameters or guidance is required to ensure a degree of standardisation of approach and generalisability of evaluation findings across health promotion practice settings.</p>
<p>Evaluations may also fail to capture the explosion of effects (expected and unexpected) that can occur at an individual, organizational or community level. If health professionals apply the biomedical model of evidence based practice to health promotion it will be at a disadvantage and the emergent outcomes of health promotion, not biomedically related, may be overlooked. This has been addressed in the past by distinguishing between health promoting outcomes and health outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757913912444047">9</xref></sup> Health promoting outcomes act as an indicator of longer term health improvements, and fit with the new public health outcomes framework. The framework emphasises reduced differences in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy between communities and the four domains, two of which, improving the wider determinants of health and health improvement, fit with the ethos of health promotion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757913912444047">10</xref></sup> In developing a framework for health promotion evaluation and evidence, both health promoting and health outcomes must be considered. This allows practitioners to demonstrate evidence that makes inferences to health outcomes that are often heavily weighted in public health, allowing health promotion to compete on a similar level to interventions that directly affect morbidity and mortality rates.</p>
<p>Linked to the issue of defining a hierarchy of evidence is the debate of appropriate methods and the use of RCTs in health promotion evaluation. In medical and some healthcare practice, the RCT is recognised as the gold standard for evaluating interventions and collecting reliable evidence data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757913912444047">11</xref></sup> However, such stringent methods are unlikely to be achieved in health promotion programmes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757913912444047">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757913912444047">11</xref></sup> Criteria such as randomisation of participants, standardisation of implementation, identification of a similar control group to the treatment community and prevention of contamination of the control group cannot be guaranteed in complex large scale health promotion campaigns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757913912444047">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757913912444047">12</xref></sup> Furthermore, the RCT is not considered an appropriate method for pulling evidence out of practice due to the method being more outcome focused, and less concerned with process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757913912444047">11</xref></sup> There is also the inability of methods, such as the RCT, to capture the experiences of the individual and detecting change at a community and societal level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757913912444047">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many of the issues associated with the evaluation of health promotion appear to be associated with a perceived need to apply stringent and inappropriate rules and restrictions, taken from an ideologically different field of practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757913912444047">7</xref></sup> A new approach to solving the practice of the evaluation of health promotion would be to allow practice to inform the development of evaluation tools. Evaluation is being conducted to some degree in practice, albeit without uniformity or regularity. A review of these practices can begin to inform a generic evaluation framework for health promotion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757913912444047">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, the current economic climate demands that public spending is executed in the most efficient manner. It will be to the detriment of health promotion if evaluations of interventions are not advanced. Without evidence, funding could be jeopardised and capacity to deliver high quality health promotion will be weakened. Evaluation is hugely important to pulling the evidence from practice, and it is this evidence that provides the platform for practitioners to justify the refunding and reimplementation of successful health promotion interventions. Therefore, to strengthen health promotion structures and services through the collection of relevant and high quality evidence, the ambiguities and uncertainties surrounding health promotion evaluation must be resolved. Essentially, when funding linked to evidence is the policy driver, the future for health promotion must be to fully embrace rigorous evaluation processes and evidence based practice.</p>
