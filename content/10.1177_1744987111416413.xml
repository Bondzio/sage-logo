<abstract>
<p>This review explores the literature with regards to interprofessional learning (IPL) for qualified nurses and other health care workers. Three research studies were found. These showed that IPL can promote interprofessional trust, knowledge and skills. There is as yet no evidence that patient outcomes are changed, and taken as a whole, the evidence is not strong. There is also evidence that the providers of IPL for post-registration health care workers also tend to be the researchers. This is not ideal; it raises the possibility of the inclusion of bias and, using the values of evidence based practice, weakens the evidence.</p>
<p>It is suggested that workers who comment on their own IPL initiatives should make explicit the measures they have taken to minimise bias. Comparison of findings from the literature is made with pre-registration IPL and a tabulated summary of much of the published evidence is included, which may be a useful source for future authors in this field.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1744987111416413" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The need for improved working between health and social care professions is driven by changing health care agendas, including more complex case loads caused by an ageing population and the shift from acute to chronic care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987111416413">Reeves et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, failures in patient safety due to poor team working have gained high profile notoriety, as evidenced by problems of delivery of complex surgical care to children in Bristol, UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987111416413">Bristol Inquiry, 2001</xref>) and communication, for example, the ‘Baby Peter’ case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987111416413">Care Quality Commission, 2009</xref>) As a response these issues are being addressed through various national and international interprofessional education (IPE) initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987111416413">Anderson and Lennox, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This review will explore the research-based literature which concerns IPE for qualified health care workers. We have adopted the term ‘post-registration’ to refer to any formal learning that health professionals undertake following registration with a statutory body, which will enable them to work in specialist or advanced roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111416413">Department of Health, 2004</xref>). This is synonymous with the term ‘Learning Beyond Registration’, which has some currency in the UK, including the main contractors of such education, the Healthcare Workforce Deaneries. Within this heading, numerically the largest group is the nurses. This paper is thus intended as a resource for providers of nurse education, within both higher education and practice. Interprofessional Learning (IPL) is synonymous with the term ‘Interprofessional Education’, defined by the UK Centre for the Advancement of Interprofessional Education (CAIPE) as occasions <italic>‘</italic>when two or more professions learn with, from and about each other to improve collaboration and the quality of care’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987111416413">Hammick et al., 2007</xref> p. 736).</p>
<p>There is a slowly growing evidence base supporting the value of IPL, particularly in pre-registration learning. However, the quality of evidence is still limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987111416413">Hammick et al., 2007</xref>). This discrepancy is highlighted by a Cochrane review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987111416413">Reeves et al. 2009</xref>), which concluded that although there is a trend towards producing valid and reliable evidence of the effects of IPE, this has not been achieved, as yet. They conclude that ‘it is not possible to draw generalisable inferences about the key elements of IPE and its effectiveness’ (p. 2). However, using the Cochrane rhetoric, ‘absence of evidence’ is not necessarily the same as ‘evidence of absence’. Studies such as those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987111416413">Anderson and Lennox (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987111416413">Curran et al. (2009)</xref> add educational research and evaluation to the topic and show that IPL can change attitudes positively.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1744987111416413"><title>Review objectives</title>
<p>The three objectives of this review are:
<list id="list1-1744987111416413" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>To identify and summarise published papers on post registration</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To identify the characteristics of high quality post registration IPL</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To compare the identified literature on post-registration IPL with the literature on IPL in pre-registration training (using the CAIPE literature review conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987111416413">Hammick et al., 2007</xref> as a basis), to determine differences between pre- and post- registration models</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1744987111416413"><title>Review methods</title>
<p>Bibliographic database searches were conducted on Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, ASSIA, CINAHL, BNI, Social Care Online, ERIC, Social Services Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, BEI, and The Cochrane Database.</p>
<p>The search strategy used the following search terms: ‘interprofessional education’, ‘inter-professional education’, ‘IPE’, ‘interprofessional learning’ ‘inter-professional learning’, ‘IPL’, ‘learning beyond registration’, ‘post registration’, ‘post-registration’.</p>
<p>The searches were undertaken in May 2009 and were restricted to papers written in English. There was no restriction on date range.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1744987111416413"><title>Results of the literature review</title>
<p>A total of 131 papers were identified from the searches prior to screening. Only 10 were considered appropriate to be included in the review. The full text of these was then evaluated for this review. The remainder of the papers (<italic>n</italic> = 121) were excluded, either because they did not consider post-registration IPL, or because they did not meet the IPL definition, or were duplicate papers.</p>
<p>Of the 10 included papers, 5 were from the UK, and one each were from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Netherlands and USA. Five were simple descriptions of the particular IPL programme provided, with opinion on its value rather than formal evaluation or research. Three could be defined as research papers, one was a literature review, and 1 was a perspective article. Three of the 10 included papers were published in the <italic>Journal of Interprofessional Care</italic>, two in <italic>Social Work Education</italic>, and the remainder were dispersed amongst a variety of journals.</p>
<p>Details of the three research papers are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744987111416413">Table 1</xref>. A meta-analysis was not possible, owing to the small number of studies and the heterogeneity of measured outcome, therefore the results are presented in a narrative format. The details of the other publication types (<italic>n</italic> = 7) are included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1744987111416413">Table 2</xref> and are intended as a resource to aid further study.

<sec id="sec5-1744987111416413" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our aim was to identify and summarise published research papers on post-registration IPL. This review located 10 eligible papers. Surprisingly few research papers were identified (<italic>n</italic> = 3), and these studies were of limited methodological quality, having no control groups, and containing small sample sizes which limited their ability to provide a convincing level of generalisable evidence for the effects of the IPL interventions. Of these studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111416413">Barnes et al. (2000)</xref> used a longitudinal survey format to explore multi-professional attitudes within community care, using a pre-validated questionnaire. Two small cohorts (<italic>n</italic> = 25 and <italic>n</italic> = 46) were included. The key findings were that values and attitudes were largely shared by different professions, that stereotypes did indeed exist, and that there was no evidence that IPL broke these down. Inspection revealed that what was taking place had elements of shared learning rather than IPL; much of the teaching was provided by an expert (e.g. lecturer). In addition to the weaknesses noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744987111416413">Table 1</xref>, the mixed method element was unclear; there was no formal discussion of how different data sources were aligned. The study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987111416413">Nauta et al. (2006)</xref> used two professional groups of medical doctor, namely general practice trainees (<italic>n</italic> = 34) and occupational health physicians (<italic>n</italic> = 20). Therefore, there is at the outset some question over the transferability of these findings to the wider international context; there is also the issue as to whether they actually were different professional groups. A four-day training programme was used to develop mechanisms for sharing knowledge and enhancing collaboration. The findings did show that there was a statistically significant increase for two attitudes, ‘trust variables’ and ‘knowledge of guidelines’. However, the authors themselves identified that transferability is an issue, and that these findings do not demonstrate a long-term effect.</p>
<p>Lastly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987111416413">Pullon and Fry's (2005)</xref> study used a cross-sectional postal survey (<italic>n</italic> = 114, 75% response rate) to explore reflection on a common IPL element, described in some limited depth within their paper, undertaken by various cohorts over a period of 4 years in New Zealand. Therefore there was an uncontrolled variable of varying time between teaching and investigation. They determined that the education was seen as positive and it was reported to have provided a modest increase in collaboration between health professional groups, and the participants felt that they were able to influence their workplace by introducing new skills.</p>
<p>However, as noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744987111416413">Table 1</xref>, there are limitations, notably that the findings were retrospective and subjective, making bias in response a possibility. Taking these three papers together, although they are satisfactory in terms of providing a meaningful evaluation of the effect of their respective interventions, their ability to be generalised outside of these modest scaled projects is limited and essentially unproven. Furthermore, although the evidence may support the individual teaching strategies, they do not demonstrate any causality with outcomes of patient care.</p>
<p>A second aim of this review was to identify the characteristics of high-quality post registration IPL. The other published papers (<italic>n</italic> = 7) were mainly simple descriptions of IPL models, or recommendations for IPL with no formal research evaluation. Due to the lack of quality research papers it was not possible to pull out evidence-based characteristics from the literature, but descriptive findings can be presented. They are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1744987111416413">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>The third aim of this review was to compare the characteristics of the literature on post-registration IPL with the literature on pre-registration IPL, using the CAIPE literature review conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987111416413">Hammick et al. (2007)</xref> as a basis. The main difference identified was related to subject topics in IPL. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987111416413">Hammick et al. (2007)</xref>, along with other authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987111416413">Thistlethwaite and Nisbet, 2007</xref>), found that in pre-registration learning, IPL often centred around in-house activities relating to generic skills such as communication, teamwork, ethics, professional development, and early patient contact. They reported that in the more senior years of pre-registration learning IPL often involved clinical placements in inter-professional teams, and centred around patient journey mapping, discharge planning and referrals, group discussions and patient safety. Recommended topics for IPL in post-registration courses by comparison included quality, patient safety, health systems improvement, patient management, critical incident analysis, conflict and collaboration between professions, and the sharing of knowledge and skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987111416413">Ladden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987111416413">Thistlethwaite and Nisbet, 2007</xref>). Hammick and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987111416413">Hammick, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987111416413">Hammick et al., 2007</xref>) stated that for IPL in pre-registration training, the interprofessional nature of the learning group is the primary aim of the IPL and learning tends to focus on interpersonal skills and attitude shaping. This is in contrast to post-registration IPL, where the interprofessional nature of the learning group is not the primary aim of the IPL, but a ‘valuable adjunct for initiatives delivered with the underlying purpose of addressing a practice development need’, which may be interpreted as implying a more managerial goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987111416413">Hammick et al., 2007</xref>, p. 745). Due to the limited nature of the 10 papers included in this review, it was not possible to determine other differences between pre-registration and post-registration IPL models.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1744987111416413" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This review has identified that there is a need for more and better quality research into post-registration IPL. The published evidence on this topic to date is extremely limited, and mainly consists of simple descriptions of IPL models with no formal evaluation of their effectiveness. The available research data are not rigorous and therefore are of limited use. More research is needed to demonstrate evidence of the characteristics of high quality post-registration IPL, and to determine the differences between, and similarities with, successful pre-registration models. An issue for educators and researchers wishing to develop evidence-based IPR, is the best type of investigation to use. The evidence-based movement uses primarily quantitative research and particularly randomised controlled trials to judge effectiveness. These seem unlikely to be applicable here, where the gaps in both time and uncontrollable variables – between the provision of training and the measured outcomes of increased quality of client patient care – are so large. Although less evidentially strong, cohort controlled studies may be more feasible and the use of validated quantitative questionnaires over extended periods, for example one to five years, could provide more robust evidence as to the effectiveness, or otherwise, of IPL.</p>
<p>One final item of methodological concern is that there is evidence that the people charged with delivering the IPL are also commonly the researchers. This appears to be the case here in the three research papers discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111416413">Barnes et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987111416413">Pullon and Fry, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987111416413">Nauta et al., 2006</xref>); there is certainly no evidence presented to the contrary. Research has been shown to be sensitive to unintentional bias, for example, in the construction of questionnaires and data analysis, hence the development of single and double blinded studies in rigorous research design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987111416413">Bowling, 2009</xref>). This trend does not support the strength of the evidence. It is therefore important that researchers within the field consider the structure of their research and formally address possible bias and limitations to their studies, including, for example, payment for the delivery of IPL. Another step which could add to the authority of the research would be the recruitment of independent investigators.</p>
<p>Post-registration IPE does demand large resources, and so the need for a properly provisioned research study to assess its affect on patient outcomes is needed. These findings are slowly being brought to light in pre-registration provision, as illustrated in the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987111416413">Reeves et al. (2009)</xref>. This is an update of an earlier Cochrane Library review from 2000, which found no studies which qualified as evidence within the heading of pre-registration IPL. Clearly some progress has been made within their remit, as six studies are now included, including four randomised controlled trials, although it is noted that ‘more rigorous IPE research is… needed to demonstrate the impact of’ (p. 9) IPE on practice and health care outcomes. By contrast, as a collateral novel finding this review has shown that the evidence for post-registration IPL lags some way behind.</p>
