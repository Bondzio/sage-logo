<abstract>
<p>Interdisciplinary approaches often bemoan international law’s lack of theoretical sophistication and naïve utopianism. Instead of offering effective tools of governance, it seems committed to outdated ideas about an international public realm and a dubious teleology of progress. This essay – given as the E. H. Carr lecture at the University of Aberystwyth in 2011 – reviews efforts to reform international law into a science and a more efficient instrument of international rule. Such efforts have been a part of international law’s internal development but their lack of success depends on a mistaken view of the field as a ‘discipline’ − a set of theoretical or technical propositions. This essay defends a view of international law as an argumentative practice in which political claims are defended and attacked, rather than as a governance tool or institutional blueprint. At its worst, law may buttress bureaucratic privilege. At its best it may offer, for a cynical world, a vocabulary for imagining better futures. It may also sharpen political thought and strategic awareness, but it cannot replace them.</p>

<title>I The persistence of teleology</title>
<p>In the context of compiling a history of international law historiographies I recently came across an 18-volume <italic>Histoire de droit des gens et des relations internationales</italic> published by the Belgian law professor François Laurent (1810−87). The work was published at a time when international law was being created as a professional practice in European law schools and among a Europe-wide network of political and legal activists. Laurent was one of these men.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0047117811433080">1</xref></sup> He had begun his enormous project in 1851 with the first volume dealing with the ‘Oriental’ empires, followed up by volumes on Greece, Rome and Christianity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0047117811433080">2</xref></sup> For the fourth volume Laurent composed a new preface in which he recounted that his colleagues had contacted him with doubts about the title of his undertaking: was this a history of international law or a history of humanity? A point well taken. From that volume onwards, the instalments had two title pages. One contained the old reference to the ‘History of the law of nations and international relations’, another denoting ‘Études sur l’histoire de l’humanité’ – studies on the history of humanity. This made no difference to the contents, however. For Laurent, and to the international lawyers of the period, the history of international law simply <italic>was</italic> the history of humanity − more specifically, as Laurent wrote, ‘l’histoire de l’humanité considérée au point de vue du progrès qu’elle accomplit vers l’unité’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0047117811433080">3</xref></sup> History led from separation to unity, its intrinsic teleology expressed by and accomplished through international law.</p>
<p>This idea of progressive history was not only widely shared by men of Laurent’s sensibilities at the time, but has continued to animate the international legal project up to our days. It gives pride of place to <italic>law</italic> in history: according to this view, world history is but the raw material to which law gives meaning and direction by pointing to its <italic>telos</italic> in a normative goal, understood as a humanity united under universal law. In a recent sketch of the history of international law, the late Antonio Cassese characterized the legal modernity of the post-Cold War era in terms of the ‘interpenetration and cross-fertilization’ of the different areas of international law. What this showed, in his view, was that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>at least at the normative level the international community is becoming more integrated and – what is even more important – that such values as human rights and the need to promote development are increasingly permeating various sectors of international law that previously seemed impervious to them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0047117811433080">4</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Cassese and countless other international lawyers, the field in which we have made our professional careers is more than just another technical discipline. It possesses an inbuilt moral direction to make human rights, justice and peace universal. To ‘do’ international law is to operate with a teleology that points from humankind’s separation to unity. <italic>From Bilateralism to Common Interests</italic> – the title of an enormous recent collection of international law essays – rehearses over again that cherished international law <italic>topos</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0047117811433080">5</xref></sup> Whatever differences may exist between international lawyers, we tend to be united in our understanding that legal modernity is moving towards what an influential Latin American jurist labelled in 2005 a new <italic>jus gentium</italic> uniting individuals (and not states) across the globe, giving expression to ‘the needs and aspirations of humankind’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0047117811433080">6</xref></sup> The anti-state rhetoric of ‘international community’ is everywhere:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>employed both as a descriptive device, explaining and rendering intelligible certain developments in international legal doctrine and in international legal institutions as well as embodying a normative vision of what international law should increasingly (although not exclusively) be about.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0047117811433080">7</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There is today even an urgency in this vocabulary, prompted by concerns raised in the register of ‘globalization’. An ever intensifying ‘process’ is being witnessed that leaves ‘no choice’ to the actors − a ‘juggernaut’ to borrow a term from Anthony Giddens. In the search for sociological language to describe what is happening, international lawyers have learned to quote Niklas Luhmann to bear witness to the way territorial systems are being replaced by intrinsically global, functional ones.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0047117811433080">8</xref></sup> All this operates to make international law, too, a global law that both illustrates and brings to consciousness the fact that humanity is one.</p>
<p>If international lawyers are about the only group of human beings who still use the vocabulary of progress, it is because of our commitment to something like the view expressed by Immanuel Kant in his famous 1784 essay: ‘The Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose’. Here Kant assumed that history conspires with nature so as to lead humanity ‘from barbarism to culture’, by which he meant the move to a ‘cosmopolitan system of general political security’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0047117811433080">9</xref></sup> The principles of operation of this system would be articulated by law: namely, a ‘perfect political constitution’ that would lead the nations from their ‘barbarous’ freedoms to a ‘great federation’ whose security would be derived from a ‘united power and the law-governed decisions of a united will’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0047117811433080">10</xref></sup> There has been much debate on what precisely Kant meant by this. What, for example, was the sense of the ‘unsocial sociability’ that he assumed would push even reluctant nations to see the virtues of integration under a constitution?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0047117811433080">11</xref></sup> Some have regarded this as hopelessly idealistic while others have seen there the outlines of the dark shadow of European imperialism – not unjustifiably, as Kant himself assumed, in a strictly matter-of-fact way, that Europe ‘will probably legislate eventually for all other continents’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0047117811433080">12</xref></sup> But I think Kant’s teleology must be understood neither as a natural force nor as a definite institutional proposal. It was a (‘transcendental’) presupposition reasonable humans must make in order to make sense of what they know of the world. Kant had been encouraged in that supposition by having witnessed the ‘universal yet disinterested sympathy’ that the French Revolution had aroused across Europe; this was surely an experience humankind could no longer forget.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0047117811433080">13</xref></sup> The way to progress could no longer be closed, while progress meant life under a constitution that would make reality of everyone’s freedom. It is this assumption, I think, that international lawyers are unable to exorcise from their vocabularies. It seems impossible, or at least very difficult, to do international law without some such teleology, some sense that one is working not only to coordinate the activities of states but for the good of humanity itself. This essay is a reflection on that predicament.</p>
<p>Rereading E. H. Carr’s <italic>Trevelyan Lectures</italic>, delivered almost exactly 50 years ago, I found to my surprise that Carr, too, thought in similar terms. Writing about the meaning of the historian’s objectivity, Carr insisted that this was more than just getting one’s facts right. That the historian’s choice of the relevant facts was conditioned by deeply ideological frameworks and prejudices was an indispensable precondition for objective historical work. Carr wrote of the historian’s ‘vision’ (had he thought of himself a Kantian, he might have preceded that expression with the word ‘transcendental’), which included the ability to rise above the particular context. (Later Kantians such as Jürgen Habermas would have spoken of the ability to ‘de-centre themselves’ and to adopt the point of view of ‘the other’ – more of that later). But it also included more than just passive ‘watching’; to carry out his job properly, the historian must have:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the capacity to project his vision into the future in such a way as to give him a more profound and a more lasting insight into the past than can be attained by those historians whose outlook is entirely bounded by their own immediate situation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0047117811433080">14</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Only by taking a standpoint in the future would the historian be able to make sense of the continuum between the past and the present. Carr did not precisely agree with Kant and international lawyers about the direction of progress. He claimed instead that when the goals of history appeared – as they did when he was writing – in the form of ‘economic and social ends’, they showed a society more advanced than one that imagined its future only in ‘constitutional and political’ terms. ‘Historiography’, Carr concluded, is ‘progressive science in the sense that it seeks to provide constantly expanding and deepening insights into a course of events which is itself progressive.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0047117811433080">15</xref></sup> This is not too different from Laurent or from the international lawyers whose idealism Carr had targeted two decades before. He was of course speaking as a historian. But he could equally well have spoken as a lawyer whose search for objectivity would also compel him to think in terms of a historical continuum that adopts the standpoint of an ideal future. For both, the examination of the past is premised upon some concept of progress, while its ideal future receives shape and plausibility by reference to how things have turned out in the past, and what we have learned from them. Teleology appears ineradicable from both, especially when we think of them as forms of <italic>practice</italic>. I will come back to what this means later.</p>
<p>But why do I keep insisting? Because there is hardly a more <italic>passé</italic> idea than that of progress in history in the academy where everyone subscribes to the Foucauldian genealogy of the past simply as incommensurate <italic>épistemes</italic> following each other in a more or less random sequence. Teleologies are grand narratives whose time is over. In a recent series of essays by a generation of international lawyers born between 1955 and 1965 on the state of the discipline, the authors struggle with the well-nigh impossibility of putting their teleology into words. A Spanish professor despairingly confessed that ‘je crois sincèrement que le droit international sert à quelque chose; il existe afin d’accomplir une finalité déterminée.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0047117811433080">16</xref></sup> But aspiring to articulate that <italic>finalité</italic>, he retreated behind the most general formulations – ‘axiological values that defend life, dignity and the future of the human being’, confessing to ‘un certain pessimisme’, not least owing to his identification of the objective as an ‘international community’ with ‘common interests’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0047117811433080">17</xref></sup> Other authors in that volume repeat the clichés about common values, <italic>jus cogens</italic> and legal hierarchy. Even Antony Anghie, a well-known postcolonial critic in the profession, confesses to a certain bewilderment about the fact that alongside research on the imperial origins of international law he has also tried to find ways whereby the law ‘might be used by people of the Third World to pursue their own interests’. ‘Contradictions and tensions seem to be an inescapable element of international law’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0047117811433080">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Such hesitations underline the difficulty of being teleological in the vein of the late nineteenth century. Experience has taught us to be wary of institutional blueprints and vocabularies of progress: nationalism, imperialism, fascism, communism and capitalism – perhaps also industrialization and ‘development’ – have turned out to be tragically destructive, or at least to have conveyed very partial benefits. If the language of ‘progress’ remains, it operates at such a general level that no commitment to actual policy is implicated. And yet teleology and progress are ineradicable from international law. I am consoled that the scholar in whose memory these lectures are held thought likewise about the study of history. History, like law, does not just ask ‘who did it?’ but also ‘<italic>what kind of a world do we want?’</italic></p>

<title>II A brief history of teleologies</title>
<p>Teleology is, of course, a complicated notion and often translated into everyday language as goal-directness, intentionality and function. To enquire about teleology in its broadest sense is to ask the question ‘what is this thing <italic>for</italic>?’ Teleology in nature and the natural sciences has a long and venerable history from Aristotle and Darwin to systems theory and beyond. If today’s scientists refrain from invoking a cosmic teleology, this is not to say that recourse could not still be had to forward-looking causalities, including ‘teleomatic’ processes in which the end state is produced automatically (a stone falls to the ground) and ‘teleonomic’ ones where that state is reached with the help of a program (genetic adaptation through coding).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0047117811433080">19</xref></sup> Aristotle famously used teleology as a general notion that would be applicable in social life, too, in terms of finalist and intentionalist approaches to understanding human behaviour. Although political modernity involved a rebellion against the respectability of such explanations in natural science, philosophies of history, as Karl Löwith has told us, not only persisted in presuming goal-directedness, but even intensified in the twentieth century in invoking ‘progress’ as providing the meaning for modernity itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0047117811433080">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The most famous modern political teleology is that laid out by Kant together with his contemporary Adam Smith (1723−90), as well as other thinkers of the Scottish enlightenment, who operated with a view of historical development that would progress in stages of which commercial society was the highest. Kant and Smith were both updating the principles of natural jurisprudence that had, since the Great Discoveries, suggested that all human societies shared a common origin – the state of nature – from which they had thereafter developed differently.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0047117811433080">21</xref></sup> The stages theory was meant to explain these differences in terms of the societies’ position at different levels of a single developmental trajectory. The histories of humanity, such as that by Laurent, would invariably describe Europe as being at the highest level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0047117811433080">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Histories of law, again, suggested that each developmental stage was accompanied by typical kinds of legal institution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0047117811433080">23</xref></sup> In his inaugural lecture as the Whewell Professor of International Law in 1887, the greatest legal historian of the Victorian period, Henry Sumner Maine (1822−88), explained how the turn from ‘status to contract’ in the legal systems of progressive societies had been based on the application of the individualist principles of Roman law. The same turn would take place in the development of international law between civilized nations as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0047117811433080">24</xref></sup> Indeed, one aspect that separated civilized from non-civilized societies was precisely the greater individualism of the former, as also suggested by the period’s most widely accepted social theory, Neo-Darwinism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0047117811433080">25</xref></sup> The process of modernity would be constituted of the transformation from a collectivist <italic>Gemeinschaft</italic> to an individualist <italic>Gesellschaft</italic>, with sociology left to explain how it would be held together by the interdependence of the paths to individual self-fulfilment that constituted the <italic>telos</italic> of life in modernity.</p>
<p>After the Great War, individualism gave way to organic theories. In 1923 a leading legal historian of the generation following Maine, Sir Paul Vinogradoff (1854–1925), sketched five historical types of international law, in which what he called ‘modern developments’ would point beyond nationalism to a ‘political union’ based on a new conception of the state that was to be ‘wider and more just than that of absolute territorial sovereignty’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0047117811433080">26</xref></sup> Vinogradoff’s history peaked in the ‘collectivistic organization’ that would form the highest stage after those of the tribe, the city, the church and the contractual association.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0047117811433080">27</xref></sup> Not ‘commercial society’ but a centrally planned modern bureaucracy would become the ideal of academic intelligentsias.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0047117811433080">28</xref></sup> Interwar lawyers were reacting to the collapse of the nineteenth-century diplomatic system. The war, they argued, had been caused by excessive nationalism, a type of egoism as destructive as individualism. Both were becoming anachronistic as economics and technology were tying states into an ever intensifying set of dependencies. History’s <italic>telos</italic> was now expressed in the move to universal institutions such as the League of Nations and the International Labour Organization (ILO).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0047117811433080">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hersch Lauterpacht (1897−1960), the century’s leading Anglophone international lawyer, wrote all his works as critiques of statehood – at a moment of excess enthusiasm even writing an indictment of sovereignty into his drafts of the opening and closing statements of the British prosecutor at Nuremberg, Sir Hartley Shawcross.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0047117811433080">30</xref></sup> Lauterpacht was a staunch federalist and shared the functionalist ideas that would become a credo of much legal and political analysis. Even the otherwise sceptical Aberystwyth professor Alfred Zimmern (1879−1957) wrote in his <italic>League of Nations and the Rule of Law</italic> (1936) of the need for a change in the politics and psychology of foreign affairs. Although the League did not bring about a new world, it was still useful as an instrument for interstate cooperation that might in due course bring about the political and psychological conditions that would be needed for a more united world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0047117811433080">31</xref></sup> Interwar legal thought operated with a teleology of interdependence: the joint interest to resolve problems of international government would override formal sovereignty and bring about something like a law-governed world. It was this theory that the Carr of the 1930s dismissed as an ideological obfuscation, or, as he memorably wrote:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Biologically and economically, the doctrine of the harmony of interests was tenable only if you left out of account the interest of the weak who must be driven to the wall or called in the next world to redress the balance of the present.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0047117811433080">32</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>During the long years of the Cold War, international lawyers were compelled to modesty in their ambitions about international government. But it was unsurprising when after 1989 they began to dust off the teleologies of the interwar period. The intervening years, it was suggested, had signified only a temporary halt in the liberal progress of humankind. The activation of the UN Security Council, the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1994, and the adoption of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 1998, as well as increasing activity in the spheres of human rights and the environment, illustrated the fact that sovereignty was out. New normative and institutional approaches were expressed in the language of the ‘rule of law’, and the vocabularies of human rights, economic integration, development and ‘responsibility to protect’ spread everywhere. The constitutionalization of this or that aspect of international law became a leading theme of academic debates, so that it seemed perfectly logical for the UN General Assembly to declare the end of the millennium as a ‘Decade of International Law’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0047117811433080">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>But international lawyers have not been skilful producers of international blueprints. The cycle of UN-sponsored world conferences in the 1990s did not turn into a system of global governance, and the Millennium Development Goals they produced remain subject to the push and pull of UN diplomacy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0047117811433080">34</xref></sup> The ‘international community’ that bombed Belgrade in 1999, is waging a war in Afghanistan, and intervened in Libya still appears to be a code word for Western policy in the developing world, claiming authority by its ability to protect vulnerable populations in a subtle protection/obedience dialectic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0047117811433080">35</xref></sup> Even the ‘fight against impunity’ has met resistance among African leaders suspicious of being subjected to yet another civilizing mission.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0047117811433080">36</xref></sup> It was perhaps symptomatic that the ‘Decade’ never received a substantive programme; all it attained was a meeting of scholars and practitioners at UN headquarters with no operative agenda beyond the publication of yet another set of papers on perennial issues of international law and policy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0047117811433080">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Teleology has not fared well as a ground for institutional reform. Proposed universals have turned out to be representative of particular interests. A historical logic seems to be at play here. When Abbé Sieyès labelled the Third Estate the universal estate, or when Marx saw the proletariat as the universal class, they were trying to pinpoint actors capable of bearing the weight of progress. It did not turn out that way. The middle class and the proletariat have been blown to pieces and represent scarcely more than a nostalgic desire of intellectuals to be at the avant-garde of something. The Grand March to Cambodia that Kundera created in <italic>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</italic> was split between the Americans who used it to stage an anti-communist demonstration and the French left who saw it bringing help to the Cambodian people. Progress could serve as a unifying force only as an abstraction, as kitsch, Kundera suggested. This has been the fate of many legal institutions, too: the civilizing mission, modernization, development, global governance, <italic>jus cogens.</italic> Once they receive concrete shape, they no longer unite, but divide.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0047117811433080">38</xref></sup></p>

<title>III Beyond teleology: ‘realism’ in politics and law</title>
<p>Teleology may have been inextricable from the juridical languages through which liberal spirits have surveyed the international world, but its intellectual reputation has been poor. An arbitrary moralism, or providentialism, it has appeared uncontrollable and Eurocentric, an altogether implausible guide for thought and action. Already in 1884, J. K. Stephen (1859–1892) son of the famous British criminal lawyer James Fitzjames Stephen, in a delightful essay entitled <italic>International Law and International Relations</italic>, raised the question of why it was that international relations had so far always been discussed through the juridical metaphor, in a search for a code of mankind. International relations, he suggested, had existed up to his day as ‘no more than an assertion of the existence of international morality which we have already agreed to take for granted’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0047117811433080">39</xref></sup> We confuse the ‘ought’ with the ‘is’. It was high time to set up a ‘study of International Relations as they are and to speak of international right and wrong incidentally, and in a manner appropriate to the inevitable vagueness and uncertainty by which the topic is surrounded’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0047117811433080">40</xref></sup> Stephen was never able to pursue this new science but ended his short and tragic life suspected of being Jack the Ripper. But what he was saying had compelling force, and others soon followed who also insisted that in a study of the world ending the indefensible predominance of law had become a necessity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0047117811433080">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Accordingly, Viscount James Bryce (1838–1922) opened his 1921 lectures on international relations by professing to introduce his audience to history as ‘a statement, clear and impartial, so far as I can make it so, of Facts’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0047117811433080">42</xref></sup> If we examine history through that perspective, he suggested, we shall see that the relations of nations were those of a state of nature in which the only history was natural history – the eternal movement between peace and war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0047117811433080">43</xref></sup> The establishment in 1919 of the Woodrow Wilson Chair at Aberystwyth was based on motives that still confused the sciences that Stephen wanted to separate, and Zimmern, the chair’s first holder, though not prone to utopian speculation, still believed in the civilizing role of international law and the League of Nations, especially when aligned with the ideas of freedom and internationalism he associated with the British Commonwealth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0047117811433080">44</xref></sup> Carr, who was one of Zimmern’s successors, was not impressed, and lumped his predecessor with international lawyers whom he saw as teleological and utopian through and through. With this, generations of students learned to think of interwar international thought as ‘idealist’ in a way that does justice neither to Bryce and his many followers nor to international lawyers, both groups being much more heterogeneous than the standard narrative suggests.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0047117811433080">45</xref></sup> Even Carr pointed to the impossibility of being a consistent realist; any politics needed ‘a finite goal, an emotional appeal, a right of moral judgment and a ground for action’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0047117811433080">46</xref></sup> But his best (or at least more memorable) arguments were reserved for his critique of ‘utopianism’, so that he came to be permanently associated with a position he never really endorsed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0047117811433080">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the Second World War the call to be realistic about the international world became quite important for the disciplinary identity of international relations. In his famous 1940 article in the <italic>American Journal of International Law</italic>, the Frankfurt jurist Hans Morgenthau (1904−80) called for a ‘functionalist’ approach to international law that would move from the ‘indefatigable repetition of magic formulae’ to the examination of the ‘rules of law as they are actually applied’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0047117811433080">48</xref></sup> By ‘functionalism’ Morgenthau meant a mixture of empirical analysis, mass psychology and decisionism, but never followed up on this himself. The ‘six principles of political realism’ that opened the second edition of <italic>Politics among Nations</italic> carried a rather commonplace image of law as an instrument of policy. In later years, Morgenthau would continue to stress the role of law as part of the kind of prudential statesmanship whose sensitivity to the lessons of history could not be reduced to the ‘rationalism’ or behavioural empiricism that was beginning to dominate US political science.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0047117811433080">49</xref></sup> In later years he, like other Weimar ‘Realist’ refugees, went on speculating about world government, ethics and the rule of law by insisting expressly on the need of a transcendental standpoint.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0047117811433080">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>But Stephen found himself an audience among a new generation of US political scientists who were imagining the empirical as the real and organizing it into units and patterns from which ‘models’ would be constructed to help predict events and guide decision-makers. Kenneth Waltz’s <italic>Theory of International Politics</italic> (1979) re-imagined the field as a kind of natural science where ‘patterns recur and events repeat themselves endlessly’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0047117811433080">51</xref></sup> The expression ‘international law’ did not make one appearance in the book. Nevertheless, Waltz was engaged in the same enterprise as jurists had been since Samuel Pufendorf’s careful adaptation of Grotian natural law in accordance with promises laid out by Thomas Hobbes. Waltz opened his work with a discussion of ‘laws’, which were expected to ‘establish relations between variables’. That he thought of these as <italic>causal</italic> relations put Waltz’s structuralism alongside the naturalist theories that have, since Pufendorf, sought to re-articulate the operation of law in terms borrowed from natural science.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0047117811433080">52</xref></sup> The assumption of ‘anarchy’ among self-interested actors called ‘states’ whose search for a ‘balance of power’ provides the ‘rational’ operating principle was after all derived by Waltz from Hobbes and Rousseau – precisely the universe of debates where modern international law, too, arose. This was a universe of the social contract dominated by the binary opposition between anarchy/hierarchy and a teleology pushing from its left to its right. Natural law may be dead (with the exception of some religiously inclined jurisprudence departments), but its spirit lives on in the ambition to grasp causal patterns of international behaviour to assist policy-makers embarrassed by the richness of alternatives between which they are expected to choose. In the last chapter of <italic>Theory of International Politics</italic> Waltz sketched a system of ‘management’ for an anarchical system by those who have a stake in it: ‘the principal entities that constitute the system are also its managers’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0047117811433080">53</xref></sup> Waltz’s careless use of the first-person plural mixed smoothly with his sketch of the standpoint of the manager. Like Pufendorf, and his followers in eighteenth-century European public law, he assumed that the burden of ruling could be lightened by conceiving it as a timeless technology.</p>
<p>If that standpoint grounds the realist theory of hegemonic stability, it likewise dominates the most widely available historiography of international law today. Wilhelm Grewe’s <italic>Die Epochen des Völkerrechts</italic> (1986, translated into English in 2000) takes its cue from Carl Schmitt’s notion of the <italic>Nomos</italic> and his ‘concrete order thinking’ (<italic>konkretes Ordnugsdenken</italic>), sketching the history of international law as a succession of great epochs – the Spanish age, the French age, the British age and the Anglo-American age – each identified by the presence of an imperial centre radiating its power to the periphery.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0047117811433080">54</xref></sup> To understand international law, Grewe suggests, one should see it as an offshoot of each period’s imperial (hegemonic) system. The view that international law relies on balance between hegemonic powers was, however, first put forward by Lassa Oppenheim (1858–1919) in one of the first truly ‘modern’ international law textbooks in 1905/6 and it peaked in Heinrich Triepel’s 1930s legal-realist work on hegemony as a legal concept.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0047117811433080">55</xref></sup> Today it is most visible in critical analyses of international law’s role in legitimating Western imperial policies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0047117811433080">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>‘Every science thinks of itself as dealing with “realities”.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0047117811433080">57</xref></sup> This is true of international law as much as of international relations. ‘Law’, Carr wrote in <italic>The Twenty Years’ Crisis</italic>, is ‘a function of given political order, whose existence alone can make it binding’, adding that the question to ask is never whether there is international law but: ‘“What law? Whose law”. The law is not an abstraction. It cannot be understood independently of the political foundation on which it rests and of the political interests which it serves.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0047117811433080">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>Far from a revolutionary insight, this expresses a commonplace view among twentieth-century international lawyers who became realists together with everyone else. We, too, professed the view that law is a causal variable or a ‘dynamic reflection’ of the underlying structures of power and policy and learned to repeat (in Latin as lawyers are wont to do) <italic>ubi societas, ibi jus.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0047117811433080">59</xref></sup> As one of the members of the new generation of international lawyers wrote in the above-mentioned collection, it is imperative that modern international law learns to ‘respond’ to its environment – ‘s’adapter à la réalité sociale qui fait l’objet de la régulation’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0047117811433080">60</xref></sup> The political science criticisms of the lawyers’ ‘idealism’ or ‘utopia’ were always beside the point – we knew those criticisms as well as anybody else, and routinely rehearsed them against opponents in the academy and the courtroom. Whatever else we may think law is, at least we have learned to understand it as a product of social and political forces, a ‘reflection’ of the world of power, a concrete emanation of the way the world is. Of course, lawyers have disagreed about how power and fact translate into law and how, for example, law-creating facts can be distinguished from deviation. Debates about such matters are the stuff of jurisprudence and the doctrine of legal sources. But the fact that there is disagreement does not mean that anyone would have advocated the position that law is not founded on social factuality, only that the way facts are interpreted inevitably vary.</p>
<p>But jurists have also insisted that law cannot be just pure factuality − a mere sociological or historical account of something. Law does not just describe what human beings or institutions do or have done but <italic>what they should do</italic>. In the course of centuries lawyers have disagreed over how to explain the mystery of legal obligation, but that has not led to the dismissal of the notion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0047117811433080">61</xref></sup> For it is as much a key part of legal competence to realize that law is based on facts and interests as it is to understand that it possesses ‘relative autonomy’ from any <italic>momentary</italic> fact or interest, that it is not just pure immanence, a passive product of power. To learn law is to learn to integrate the opposite concerns of realism and critique, or the standpoints for concreteness and normativity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0047117811433080">62</xref></sup> As Julius Stone (1907−85), a student of Roscoe Pound’s from Harvard and a well-known representative of sociological jurisprudence, put it in 1956:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>what is given to us is neither merely what is concrete nor merely the abstract principles concerning it, but the immediate experience of both together as a complex section of reality, the cognitive priority either of abstract principles or of concreteness must be rejected.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0047117811433080">63</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>International law – like all law – needs to be both normative and concrete. If it lacked normativity, it would degenerate into mere apology − a façade legitimation of what power has achieved. If it were independent of social factuality, it would collapse into utopia − a bag of dreams inextricable from the preferences of the dreamer. In the former case, we would have no way of distinguishing between the Mafioso and the policeman; in the latter, we could never know the law’s content in a reliable way. Carrying out that balancing act is not an easy task, and an overview of past legal scholarship would show reformist projects typically trying to push it in one direction or the other so as either to fit law closer into its ‘sociological background’ or to develop a more critical attitude towards power. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0047117811433080">64</xref></sup> Such efforts have often been associated with turns to ‘natural law’ or ‘legal positivism’, but the positions are much more fluid than such labelling suggests. Naturalism usually presents itself in a sociological vocabulary (suggesting ‘positivist’ verification), while positivist projects tend to come with a more or less finely tuned ethics of legal decision-making. Neither is able to stand alone. Natural law, morality and other forms of ‘oughtness’ are needed to explain the law’s binding force, while positivism, realism and other languages of factuality are necessary to show its (concrete) content. If the former tend to dominate in times of transformation or crisis, when basic aspects of the world are questioned, the latter occupy the foreground in stable periods of consensus or apathy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0047117811433080">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>It may seem paradoxical that although twentieth-century international law has always been profoundly ‘realist’, sociological jurisprudence has not had much of an influence on it. The early enquiry by Max Huber (1874−1960) into sociological foundations pointed to the forms of interdependence that bound states in an economic community and gave international law its functional orientation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0047117811433080">66</xref></sup> Like Waltz, Georges Scelle (1878−1961), the most visible international lawyer in interwar France, took part of his inspiration from Émile Durkheim and based international law on the ultimately biological need for social solidarity among states and international institutions, but ultimately among humans generally.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0047117811433080">67</xref></sup> Alejandro Alvarez (1868−1960), to mention just one Latin American legal activist, wrote throughout his career from the first to the second half of the twentieth century about the way the inexorable laws of modernity had changed the conditions of lives of peoples everywhere and forced a thorough-going change of the political and legal structures whereby the world was governed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0047117811433080">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1956 Julius Stone gave a series of lectures at the Hague Academy of International Law where he pointed out the great difficulties of actually studying the forms of communication between states that disclosed the application of international law. Official statements often turned to propaganda, while conducting interviews and opinion surveys among diplomats was undermined by their notoriously having been called upon to lie for their country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0047117811433080">69</xref></sup> If the ‘real’ could not be deciphered from the intentions of those who acted therein, perhaps it could be ascertained from the ‘functions’ that appeared to account for its operations. Stone, like the Belgian Charles de Visscher (1884−1973), or Percy Corbett (1892−1983) from Princeton and Virginia Law School, was disappointed by the idealism of the interwar jurists and sought a legal idiom more respectful of diplomacy and political interests.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0047117811433080">70</xref></sup> From the 1960s international reform was always advocated in such functional-realist terms so as to make law better ‘reflect’ societal transformations that were already under way somewhere. The title of the most famous international law book of the 1960s, <italic>The Changing Structure of International Law</italic> by Wolfgang Friedmann (1907−72), said it all: as aspects of modernity, transformations in international trade, technology, development and human rights were uniting the world in fact, so that now it was necessary to transform the legal superstructure to reflect those changes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0047117811433080">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>The developmental rhetoric was as popular on the left as on the right. In the 1970s, the ‘School of Reims’ in France, with Charles Chaumont and his disciples, took a Marxian view on decolonization and the New International Economic Order (NIEO) as the bases of new global and legal relationships. Chaumont saw present international law as an ideological expression of economic conflict in the world and, like E. H. Carr, insisted on the alignment of law on the side of the world’s oppressed – though in so doing he had to depart from the sociological realism of his critique into a legal activism whose epistemic status remained wholly unclear.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0047117811433080">72</xref></sup> Today’s Marxian frames of international legal arguments appear, not surprisingly, to have much less faith in the ability of international law to assist in progressive change. Only the immanence of capitalism’s contradictions might leave room for a counter-hegemonic possibility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0047117811433080">73</xref></sup> In a sense, this has been the fate of all the great projects of legal change: linking law with human rights or development, for example, began with great promise, but the more seriously the vocabularies became part of the government of societies, the more they tended to become entangled in regular political struggles over the setting of governmental priorities – with the result, often, that the more significant choices of social distribution escape into the private realm, and out of the reformers’ reach.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0047117811433080">74</xref></sup></p>

<title>IV Dreams of interdisciplinarity: law and international relations</title>
<p>Suggestions for taking the ‘realist’ strand of international law seriously have not led to any profound overhauling of international legal competence: in fact, no more so than suggestions to strengthen its critical power. International law has become neither science nor morality. Commitment to a teleological project – an international community ruled by law – remains prevalent in a profession that struggles to translate it into a stable institutional blueprint. In the course of the past half-century, however, offers of assistance have often been made from United States political science departments. The integration of American legal realism and empirical policy-science peaked in the well-known collaboration between Harold Lasswell (1902–78) and Myres McDougal (1906–98) at Yale Law School in the 1950s and 1960s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0047117811433080">75</xref></sup> Pragmatic, rule-sceptical and policy-oriented, the Yale School openly broke with how international law had been taught in Europe and the US in the past. But notwithstanding the Yale School’s theoretical sophistication, its impact on the profession remained limited, partly owing to its much- commented-upon esoteric language, partly owing to its unabashed celebration of US foreign policy agendas. Perhaps more importantly, the Yale approach suffered from the formalism of its policy conceptualizations. It is one thing to suggest the replacement of ‘backward-looking’ rules with foreword-looking ‘policies’, and another to spell out just what those ‘policies’ might entail. The Yale scholars succumbed to critiques of indeterminacy they themselves had used against traditional rules and precedents; the language of policy-science appeared no less ‘unscientific’ than the vocabularies it hoped to replace.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0047117811433080">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>Not everyone shared the Yale School’s right-wing preferences, but their anti-formalism spread around the US academy. Richard Falk from Princeton, a student of McDougal’s, enlisted his legal activism to the Palestinian cause and the anti-globalization movement, while Abram Chayes (1922–2000), a Harvard professor and a former State Department legal advisor, developed a centrist ‘process-orientation’ that shared its research programmes with regime scholars in political science faculties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0047117811433080">77</xref></sup> A whole ‘Manhattan School’, led by Columbia’s Oscar Schachter (1915–2003) and New York University’s Thomas Franck (1931–2009) from the 1960s onwards, used the critique of rules and aspects of liberal political theory to support the UN and other institutional causes, often against US foreign policy elites.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0047117811433080">78</xref></sup> Franck’s 1990 work on the role of ‘legitimacy’ came to be widely used as a defence of international law’s force in the political world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0047117811433080">79</xref></sup> Here a full-bodied social science vocabulary was put to use within an ostensibly legal discourse, inextricable from Franck’s liberalism and his attachment to international institutions. Although legitimacy did not constitute a properly normative language, it helped to bridge the gap between Franck’s individualism and his positivist image of social science. Like most of his colleagues in the US and Europe, Franck also professed an openly teleological faith in individualism whose world-wide realization, he cautiously stressed, was always only ‘emerging’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0047117811433080">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>Three phases may be distinguished in efforts to update international law into part of the US political science project. The first began in the 1960s with the extension of the behavioural turn to international law. In <italic>Political Foundations of International Law</italic> (1961) Morton Kaplan and Nicholas Katzenbach, acknowledging their debt to Lasswell and McDougal, tried to elucidate international law’s political context by describing ‘the substantive constraints on international law and the normative constraints on political behavior’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0047117811433080">81</xref></sup> Kaplan and Katzenbach were particularly concerned to explain the operation of law beyond the limited world of international courts and tribunals. For that purpose, they suggested undertaking a systematic analysis of ‘the interests that support [the rules of international law] … the means by which they are made effective, and the functions they perform’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0047117811433080">82</xref></sup> They assumed that international order – which they saw as a ‘loose bipolar international system’ – existed at least in part through what they called ‘law-government’ whose operations they were concerned to explain. The ‘facts of international politics’ dictated a limited number of normative choices between which states were to decide in order to maximize their values. Although the ‘range of possibilities is large and efforts at exact prediction would be unscientific’ it was nevertheless possible to analyse broad trends in the occurrence of cooperative or uncooperative behaviour.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0047117811433080">83</xref></sup> Such instrumental, state-centric studies of international law were continued in William D. Coplin’s 1966 study of <italic>The Functions of International Law</italic>, which focused on the way the law communicated values and expectations and structured decision-making contexts. States needed international law to pursue their policies; its reality was guaranteed by its functional usefulness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0047117811433080">84</xref></sup> A summary of behaviouralist works in this vein, and the most elaborate of them, was the 1971 overview by Wesley Gould and Michael Barkun of the ‘patterns, units, structures and processes’ through which international law operated and which were concerned with the time-lag that seemed to exist between the development of international society and its laws. Their ambition was to produce a typology of laws that would correspond to a typology of societies so as to ‘determin[e], as far as possible, the changed conditions on international law itself, or on legal systems’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0047117811433080">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second generation of interdisciplinary scholarship began in the late 1980s, partly as an offshoot of the spread of normative approaches and ‘constructivism’ within international relations in general, in part owing to the rise of a liberal millenarianism connected with the end of the Cold War and the resuscitation of internationalist themes drawing upon increasing activity within global and regional institutions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0047117811433080">86</xref></sup> Regime theory and neo-institutionalist economics rearticulated international law through a language of ‘regimes’, ‘governance’, accountability’, ‘legitimacy’ and the turn to democracy and human rights in international institutions. Anne-Marie Slaughter from Princeton read the new developments into a ‘dual agenda’ whereby international relations scholars and international lawyers were called upon to cooperate in developing research agendas on the institutionalization of international policy-making and the spread of ‘liberalism’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0047117811433080">87</xref></sup> Others suggested the study of the ‘legalization of international politics’, especially by examining the operation of formal and informal rules in international ‘regimes’ where they would serve ‘functions’. Issues such as regime design and typologies of normativity appeared important for a managerial scholarship worried about the efficiency with which international institutions were fulfilling the objectives of their founders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0047117811433080">88</xref></sup> But very little collaboration followed. Most lawyers failed to see the point of translating law into the vocabulary of political science of which they would no longer be the native speakers. ‘Cooperation’ always sounded more like conquest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0047117811433080">89</xref></sup> Moreover, behind the apparently empirical concerns was an identification with a managerial standpoint and a normative teleology that saw global developments lead towards an increasing acceptance of electoral democracy, human rights and capitalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0047117811433080">90</xref></sup> The ‘dual agenda’ was espoused by a liberal elite and they collapsed together in September 2001.</p>
<p>As the 1990s brought identity politics to US campuses, international relations departments reacted by turning to the kind of abstraction that was always liberal theory’s natural home. ‘Constructivism’ concentrated on subject formation but avoided examining the relations of domination that controlled it. In its determination to remain part of the ‘social science project’, constructivism also separated itself from its postmodern home and geared itself towards instrumental effect and managerial control. Might law (for example) become a better strategic tool of statecraft if research focused on how it embodied ideas about security, respect, reputation or legitimacy? Might it be possible to enhance the internalization of norms and socialization of recalcitrant agents by cleverly designed legal apparatuses?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0047117811433080">91</xref></sup> To what extent might actors’ perception of their ‘interests’ be manipulated by ideological work around legal regimes and concepts? Instead of secret agents, ought governments to apply ‘norm entrepreneurs’? Of course, as Kelsen and others have shown, law is a ‘construction’. But as such it is always both unstable and contested.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0047117811433080">92</xref></sup> Where international relations constructivism believes in homogeneous ideas and undistorted communication, international law highlights the polemical aspects of the ‘constructed’ world – indeed it thrives on the constant putting into question of such constructions as ‘state’, ‘minority’, ‘reputation’ and so on.</p>
<p>Like ‘constructivism’, the third and the most recent effort to integrate political science vocabularies into international law is ideologically conservative, statist, and closely aligned with the preferences of US academic institutions. This is the turn to law and economics, rational choice and game theory. The overriding concern rests with effectiveness and compliance, or, as Andrew Guzman puts it: ‘to offer a satisfying theory of how and when states comply with international law or when international law is more likely to work’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0047117811433080">93</xref></sup> How in an ‘anarchical system’ is it possible to compel states to do what one wants them to do? This question is put forward not as an intellectual puzzle but from the perspective of a powerful institutional player, with stakes to win or lose as a result of choices made and policies chosen. Law and economics comes with a firm commitment to the epistemic virtues of positivism, including to ‘the essential unity of the social sciences’ based upon ‘rational analysis’ and ‘methodological individualism’ that is expected to ‘[hold] … great promise to international law’ as it ‘suggests useful methods for analyzing the actual or potential consequences of legal rules’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0047117811433080">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>Turning law into an economic mechanism has a number of well-known problems. How is building on state preferences compatible with individualism and value-neutrality? What about the conditions under which the agents come to espouse some values instead of others, and grow out of inherited ones? How is reliance on models, ideal-types and presuppositions about anxious prisoners helpful in solving concrete social problems? Rational choice and the economic approach epitomize the paradox that the firmer the grasp one wants on a complex reality, the more formal and abstract one’s categories become and the less action-guiding effect they will have. But to be fully determinative they ought to be like Borges’s map − as expansive as the ground they cover. Which is why everything depends on the choice of <italic>which actor</italic> and <italic>which value</italic> should be highlighted and which not. Here economics emerges as a series of structural biases. Though ‘self-interest’ is offered as an analytic category, a hypothesis, it turns almost always into a set of commonsense ‘realist’ presuppositions that ‘validate both selfishness and the drive to acquire and consume’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0047117811433080">95</xref></sup> Economics is both an ideology and a set of cultural norms – which would be no problem if it recognized itself as such, instead of parading, in all the relevant literature, as neutral and ‘scientific’. The most striking problem with the economic theory, however, comes with its commitment to intentionalism − the view that the meaning of a rule or institutions is derived from the (actual or presumed) <italic>intent</italic> of the one who enacted it or set it up. Once a venerable part of nineteenth-century classical legal thought, this view has since been thoroughly discredited, and not least by the legal realism on whose shoulders law and economics as well as rational choice stand.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0047117811433080">96</xref></sup> The ‘will of the legislator’ is not the object of the interpretative process, but its product. The construction of the meaning, including the <italic>telos</italic>, of legal rules and institutions is, as the cliché goes, ‘an art and not a science’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0047117811433080">97</xref></sup> But if international law is indeterminate in this way, then we do not know – that is to say, <italic>we do not know as a matter of law</italic> – what it is to comply with a rule or how to assess the ‘effectiveness’ of an institution independently of choosing between rival interpretations. The question of ‘compliance’ is not a legal but a technical or a managerial question. Nor is there anything distinctly legal in the interest of ‘explaining compliance’. Instead, the relevant question always concerns <italic>what there is to comply with in the first place</italic>, what, of the many possibilities, is the preferable meaning of the rule, and should the rule be applied, or the exception?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0047117811433080">98</xref></sup> Actors alleged to be in ‘non-compliance’ will invariably claim that the allegation is based on a mistaken interpretation of the rule, that the rule does not concern them, or that they do comply, albeit in an unorthodox way. It is precisely the openness of the legal language, including any object and purpose it is alleged to have, that is at the heart of the legal debate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0047117811433080">99</xref></sup> And the debate ends – if it ends at all – with a legally competent institution providing an authoritative view on the matter.</p>
<p>This is why law is profoundly different from mere ‘governance’ or ‘administration’ and what makes it frequently appear counterproductive or obstructive in view of the institutionally dominant actors. Interdisciplinary approaches are blind to the difference between the objectives of particular, especially dominant, actors and the point of law. Or because such approaches associate the latter with the former, the only interesting question that appears to remain is always how to achieve compliance with that objective with maximal effect and minimal cost. But there is no legal answer to that question. On the contrary, legal arguments will continue to contest that dominant objective, or the dominant interpretation of its institutional implications. Only jurisdictional competence will dictate the end point of the legal polemic, and even it is powerless to prevent the legal argument from continuing outside the institutional frame.</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary agendas could be left to the side were it not for their intention to become the new international law. ‘There is a more sophisticated international law literature in the international relations subfield of political science’, Goldsmith and Posner have wanted to claim.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0047117811433080">100</xref></sup> The ‘literature’ is the one meant to facilitate international governance − not surprisingly if, as noted by Steve Smith a decade ago, the ‘subfield’ in its many permutations is ‘still an American social science’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0047117811433080">101</xref></sup> What makes it such is its positivism and its methodological individualism, its looking away from present contestation and its admiration of, and usual alliance with, dominant institutional actors. A particularly striking illustration of the biases of the ‘subfield’ is a recent collective volume on neorealist approaches to international history, among whose contributors we find such leading lights of the movement as Richard Rosecrance, Robert Keohane, Niall Ferguson and Paul Schroder. None of the 16 essays takes up colonialism or the developing world. The obsession is with US power, and any historical examination has meaning only if it illuminates problems or dilemmas in American foreign policy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0047117811433080">102</xref></sup> The only concession to a pseudo-normativity in this literature generally is occasional reference to an instrumental notion of ‘legitimacy’: might dominant objectives be realized more efficiently if they were accompanied by a feeling of legitimacy within the targeted populations? No attention is given, however, to whether such a feeling might have been caused by force, fear, manipulation or ignorance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0047117811433080">103</xref></sup> To this type of policy-science the scathing criticism by Herbert Marcuse is today as pertinent as ever:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the criteria for judging a given state of affairs are those offered by … the given state of affairs. The analysis is ‘locked’; the range of judgment is confined within a context of facts which excludes judging the context in which the facts are made, man-made, and in which their function, and development are determined.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0047117811433080">104</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is not to say that such problems would have been invisible to international relations. On the contrary, it often appears that no academic field is more obsessed with methodological problems and political biases. But it has been difficult to find powerful alternatives to realism, in particular ones that would share the kind of teleological standpoint law has: that is to say, a standpoint that looks for, and seeks to engage with the <italic>point</italic> of international institutions (instead of immediately asking how a given point should be implemented). True, Wendt and Patomäki have recently raised the question of teleology. In their contributions they have oscillated between functional and intentional approaches, highlighting either the mechanistic causalities operative in the international world, or the processes of deliberate action and contestation under which world developments ought to be analysed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-0047117811433080">105</xref></sup> While welcome, the opposition between ‘objective’ and ‘subjective’ approaches to the <italic>telos</italic> of international institutions they illustrate repeats the structure/agency dilemma while pushing towards a centre where each is read in terms of the other. Both ‘world state’ and a global culture of democratic socialism resemble what jurists have been saying about the coming of a law-governed ‘international community’. This does not make them any the worse, of course, but I want to suggest that the teleology of law cannot be reduced to particular institutional blueprints or utopian architectures.</p>

<title>V Into counterdisciplinarity</title>
<p>Interdisciplinary vocabularies of ‘scholarship’ and ‘science’ miss what for most international lawyers is the most obvious aspect of our trade: namely, its craft-likeness, its being above all a practice. International law is not a social science. It is not a (theoretical) science at all – that is to say, it does not operate on the basis of demonstrable, even less empirical truths, nor with ideas about moral goodness. Legal ‘truth’ or ‘goodness’ is concerned with what Panu Minkkinen calls the <italic>correctness</italic> of the legal decision. This is a product of legal practice, argument and persuasion, not its precondition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn106-0047117811433080">106</xref></sup> Even as lawyers may use empirical arguments from ‘theory’ and sometimes invoke moral sentiments, the practical reasoning – <italic>phronesis</italic> – that best characterizes what lawyers do cannot be reduced to either one or the other. What works depends on the context. Above all, discussing it through a methodological vocabulary borrowed from social sciences – such as a choice between realism, liberalism and constructivism, for example<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn107-0047117811433080">107</xref></sup> – while perhaps useful in a political science context, conveys no sense of the eclectic and pragmatic character of legal <italic>praxis</italic>. To take an almost random example from the same otherwise well-written interdisciplinary work, the sentence ‘The dominance of realism in IR is matched by the dominance of positivism in IL’ is either meaningless or at least misleading as a characterization of those argumentative moves that are usually called ‘positivism’ within (international) law and their place among other legal techniques.</p>
<p>To begin to approach the nature of law as practice, reference could be made to Kant’s Third Critique that discusses a type of (‘reflecting’) judgment that is neither theoretical or verifiable, nor simply a statement of subjective pleasure but one that is subject to rational assent or disagreement within a community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn108-0047117811433080">108</xref></sup> This is how Hannah Arendt famously characterized political judgment, but that characterization is equally well (if not better) applied to law.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn109-0047117811433080">109</xref></sup> Much of mainstream Anglo-American jurisprudence also approaches law in this way, as a hermeneutics of interpretation that aims to ensure the coherence of the legal order – and thereby the acceptability of the system of distribution of material and spiritual values that goes with it. There is much that is right in this jurisprudence. Law is an interpretative craft. But it underestimates the open-endedness of the interpretations and mistakes ‘coherence’ as the point of legal activity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn110-0047117811433080">110</xref></sup> A better view is to take one step backwards, accept the irreducible indeterminacy of interpretation and the contradictoriness of legal argument (which, in any case, most lawyers accept), and build on the way legal argument brings out into the open the contradictions of the society in which it operates and the competition of opposite interests that are the flesh and blood of the legal everyday.</p>
<p>Law is an argumentative practice that operates in institutional contexts characterized by adversity. Its point is to persuade but also to ‘win’ against polemical adversaries. Moreover, it seeks to do that in situations where somebody has a stake in the matter, when the interests of the adversaries are in question. This need not be a court; it can be any kind of collective body – a committee of experts, or the editorial body of a journal, say. What counts as a persuasive argument in one context is not the same as what might win in another and practising lawyers are often very skilled in noticing such differences and adjusting their arguments accordingly. A good legal argument is not the product of method, but, as I have put it elsewhere, style.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn111-0047117811433080">111</xref></sup> It is, for example, sometimes necessary to argue in a strictly ‘positivist’ manner by reference to black-letter law while at other times passion and reference to large (naturalist) principles are required. Where European audiences tend to be persuaded by ‘formalism’, American ones need to be addressed in an anti-formal idiom. To mistake the context is to seem unpersuasive, and thus to ‘lose’ the argument, with whatever this might mean to those having something at stake.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn112-0047117811433080">112</xref></sup> From this perspective, law is not a supporter of social consensus but a participant in its conflicts, giving form to social adversity in order to support some values against others, to affirm or contest prevailing distributionary structures.</p>
<p>International law is taught at law schools as part of the legal curriculum. Cultures of international law teaching vary just like legal cultures generally. For example, the gap between European and US international law is often noted, though perhaps still not well understood<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn113-0047117811433080">113</xref></sup> – and it falls completely under the radar screen of descriptions of international law as ‘science’. But although views of the lawyer’s craft differ, everywhere it is expected to focus on <italic>legal problems</italic>: that is to say, problems about the content and the application of law. ‘What does the law say?’ and ‘how should the law be applied in this case?’ are typical formulations of those two problems – one having to do with the meaning of law <italic>in abstracto</italic>, the other with its application in a concrete situation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn114-0047117811433080">114</xref></sup> These are <italic>normative</italic> problems but they are not problems of morality – although giving a professionally competent response to them may involve taking a stand on some disputed moral questions. They are <italic>factual</italic> problems, too, but what count as relevant facts and how their importance should be assessed is determined from within the relevant context of argument, through the adversarial procedures that law provides for social agents. This is the truth of law as an institutional practice: its standards and performances are internally validated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn115-0047117811433080">115</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of course, it is possible to detach the normative and the factual questions from their legal-institutional contexts and to treat them as problems of <italic>pure</italic> normativity or pure factuality. International relations experts such as Allen Buchanan, for example, may want to elaborate on the ‘moral foundations of international law’, focusing on such large expressions as ‘justice’, ‘self-determination’, ‘legitimacy’ and so on.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn116-0047117811433080">116</xref></sup> Or they might want to rule on the ‘effectiveness’ of international law by asking, with Anthony Arndt, ‘do legal rules matter?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn117-0047117811433080">117</xref></sup> That is fine. But neither pursuit participates in the practice of legal argument. To suggest otherwise is to invite re-imagining law as either ‘in fact’ moral philosophy or descriptive sociology: that is to say, a kind of natural law. And while natural law has played an important part in moments of international crisis, when fundamental questions about legal institutions themselves need to be posed, it is still vulnerable to arguments from 3000 years of Western political thought.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn118-0047117811433080">118</xref></sup> The recent turn in international law to the ethical vocabularies of humanitarianism, ‘dignity’ and ‘crimes against humanity’, for example, manifests a wish to get rid of social conflict by glossing it with languages of passion, engagement and moral necessity – and yet, when pressed by legal argument in concrete contexts, they turn into placeholders of contested positions about authority, often indicating the international system’s Western bias.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn119-0047117811433080">119</xref></sup></p>
<p>International law may be a university discipline, but it is above all a rhetorical practice that, to follow Fritz Kratochwil, has to do with the ‘principled use’ of legal arguments ‘in application’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn120-0047117811433080">120</xref></sup> It is not a random production of speech-acts. Only some arguments are acceptable; others are not. But although the practice of legal argument is formally very rigorous, it is substantively open-ended. It does not represent some ideal future world that would, as it were, have been already written into it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn121-0047117811433080">121</xref></sup> That ideal world must still be created; it cannot be ‘found’ to exist already in the legal system. The hugely important contribution of legal realism was to demonstrate that for every rule there is an exception, for every principle a counter-principle. Every legal rule and policy can be understood in different ways, and even the same ones create differing consequences when their context of application changes. Even when there is no disagreement about the content of a rule, the world in which it is to be applied is usually hard to interpret – what aspect is significant in the world, and what is not?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn122-0047117811433080">122</xref></sup> Judgment is needed. This is why, as Hersch Lauterpacht wrote many years ago, in the most important English-language book on international law: ‘the existence of a sufficient body of clear rules is not at all essential to the existence of law … the decisive test is whether there exists a judge competent to decide upon disputed rights and to command peace’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn123-0047117811433080">123</xref></sup></p>
<p>One need not share Lauterpacht’s enthusiasm for formal courts. Alternative approaches focus on the institutions of diplomacy, NGO activism, humanitarian relief work, intergovernmental organizations. There is a wealth of contexts and ‘interpretative communities’ within which international lawyers argue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn124-0047117811433080">124</xref></sup> Each such context is also normally biased in favour of some types of argument and some types of distributionary outcome. Human rights bodies decide differently from trade panels. Though legal argument is indeterminate, the contexts of argument are not.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn125-0047117811433080">125</xref></sup> This is why the ‘fragmentation of international law’ – the proliferation of legally relevant institutions and interpretative communities – has become the most important site for political contestation in international law today. Which institution ought to decide?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn126-0047117811433080">126</xref></sup> But the bias of single institutions is never complete. Like McDougal’s ‘policy’, the formal objectives of such institutions (security, human rights, free trade, the environment) remain open-ended and conflictual even among the relevant expert groups, thus opening yet again a forum for legal contestation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn127-0047117811433080">127</xref></sup> Law has a never-ending character (as political decision-makers sometimes despairingly notice). It makes it possible to constantly produce new interpretations of its rules and prior judgments, thus cultivating the gap between the institutional present and the legal ideal and doing it less as an incident of method or discipline than as a commitment.</p>

<title>VI Law’s teleology</title>
<p>Even today international law uses a vocabulary of progress against the Polybian heresies of realism and postmodern invocations of the end of grand history. International lawyers are ideologically committed to their craft. We believe it is more than a technique and that it embodies something intrinsically valuable for social life. It is not obvious what this something might be. Why would it be good to operate with ‘rules’, ‘rights’ and legally circumscribed procedures in the international world? Standard responses point to the protection humans receive from law against unjustified interference in our liberty, and the way law makes it possible for us to participate in the ruling of our communities, and be responsible for our choices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn128-0047117811433080">128</xref></sup> Law is thought to bring such benefits through offering a neutral way to resolving social conflict and allowing individuals and human groups – and states – to go about their business in an orderly fashion. There is something to this, of course. Everyone agrees with the importance of neutrality, transparency, accountability, good faith and all the other qualities of the ‘inner morality of law’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn129-0047117811433080">129</xref></sup> We make a distinction between the law’s ‘principled application’ and its manipulative use. Making it with consistency is to recognize the virtues of good legal practice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn130-0047117811433080">130</xref></sup></p>
<p>These virtues have to do with law’s universalizing pull, the way it invites us to treat everyone as equals, abstracting from particular qualities. ‘Rules’ by definition universalize single situations. ‘Rights’ lift ideas about the good from matters of personal preference to public entitlements. Legal procedures aim to guarantee fair and equal treatment to all. Every deviation from universality requires a special justification. From this inbuilt bias towards the universal, and against the particular, international lawyers have derived their cosmopolitan leanings, their ideological commitment to international institutions, their critique of sovereignty. Most international lawyers would say without hesitation that law is intrinsically teleological in the way Kant suggested, that it has a preference for international institutions over domestic ones, perhaps for a ‘world state’ or at least a world federation. But this conflicts with another historical experience, referred to above, namely that international institutions have over again fallen short of what we have expected from them. However universal, rules and right-formulations have also reinforced privilege, and procedural standards have discriminated as much as they may have empowered. Above all, a universal system of international law has been able to coexist with massive global inequality and injustice. How is this possible?</p>
<p>It follows from law’s indeterminacy that there is no concrete institutional form in which the virtues of legality would be finally realized. Instead, law as practice will always have to be accompanied by sensitivity to the contexts of its application and an eye for its effects on the patterns of privilege in the communities concerned. When the virtues of legalism are projected onto institutional structures, they may also operate as blinding mechanisms, making us forget that every institutional choice, every response to questions about the content and application of law, is also a ‘politics of law’ that alongside the general formulation of the rule or the right will contain a suggestion as to what it might mean here and now.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn131-0047117811433080">131</xref></sup> Indeed, it is only on the basis of the legal ‘decision’ that law begins to ‘tick’, that is receives concreteness and applicability, that legal institutions receive the structural bias that make them act predictably – for better or for worse. To join that bias, or not to join, remains a choice which, even as it deals with the single case, will reflect on the institution’s objectives and what it is expected to stand for.</p>
<p>Much of the debate concerning the relation between international law and politics has focused on the applicability of universal standards in the international world. From Hans Morgenthau’s Frankfurt doctoral thesis, to Hersch Lauterpacht’s views of the completeness of the international legal system, to Julius Stone’s defence of politics in a fragmented world and Thomas M. Franck’s exploration of the ‘political questions’ doctrine, lawyers have debated the wisdom of generalizing about the facts of the international world, supposedly the realm of the singular, the extreme, the historically specific.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn132-0047117811433080">132</xref></sup> There are not many cases from international practice (in contrast to academic writing), however, where lawyers would have raised their hands in deference to ‘the political’. The International Court of Justice, for example, has given legal answers to such politically loaded questions as the Iran−US hostage crisis, the legality of nuclear weapons, the Palestine Wall and the declaration of the independence of Kosovo. To the claim that it ought not judge on them, it has routinely responded that the fact that a matter has political implications is no bar to pronouncing upon its legal aspects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn133-0047117811433080">133</xref></sup> Nor has this fact occasioned the kind of political crises that those invoking <italic>de maximis non curat praetor</italic> may have expected. This is so because law invites its appliers to exercise the kind of practical judgment of which ‘politics’ at its best consists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn134-0047117811433080">134</xref></sup> Lawyers defer to ‘sovereignty’ or the ‘needs of peace’ not irrespective of but by reference to legal rules. Whether we regard something as political’ or ‘legal’ results, as Morgenthau and others noted a long time ago, not from the intrinsic character of that item or topic, but from the frame in which it is observed, the language that is used to deal with it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn135-0047117811433080">135</xref></sup> Sovereignty, a thoroughly political notion, is also created and sustained by international law – as much, in fact, as ‘international organizations’ or ‘integration’. ‘Security’ and ‘defence’ are likewise legal notions, like ‘war’ and ‘intervention’. There is no conflict between ‘disciplines’ here, only a choice between professional languages. And that choice is no different from any we have to make in a world ‘fragmented’ between different idioms of power and ‘ways of worldmaking’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn136-0047117811433080">136</xref></sup> International law’s potential, I think, lies in how attractive it is as an invitation to worldmaking, to what extent its teleology covers relevant forms of international power.</p>
<p>International lawyers’ institutional imagination has been constrained by eighteenth- and nineteenth-century cosmopolitan thought – the domestic analogy and the pull towards a constitutionally governed global federation in particular. The embarrassment has always been with the way it has been able to coexist with massive international injustice. Some of this has been brought about by the states and empires it has helped to support. But this has always been seen as problematic, too, and in need to reform in view of the ideals of statehood and public power themselves. More importantly, that nineteenth-century sensibility excluded large chunks of power from its compass, namely that exercised through private law, property and contract − forms of international power often associated with informal empire or the ‘empire of civil society’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn137-0047117811433080">137</xref></sup> At the beginning of the twenty-first century, that exclusion seems increasingly unfounded. There is as little reason for lawyers to be intuitively in favour of the ‘international’ as there is to concentrate on the public realm of diplomacy and international organizations as privileged sites for questions of distribution and policy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn138-0047117811433080">138</xref></sup> Our official teleology is at odds with the virtues of legality. Might the false derivation from law’s universality be corrected by focus on its historicity?</p>
<p>Law constructs its universals in an intensely historical way: it looks both backwards and forwards in time so that a prima facie plausible resolution of a legal problem ought to take account of what has taken place in the past (to be used as evidence) and how it might affect the future (as precedent). Legal argument creates a temporal sequence in which the past informs the present, while the future serves as the ideal of the present, its standard of criticism. That legal argument creates historical narratives in this way is very familiar. As Philip Allott has put it, ‘international law, like any other legal system, is a bridge between the social past and the social future through the social present’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn139-0047117811433080">139</xref></sup> It offers a continuing self-interpretation to society in terms of what has taken place in the past and how society sees its own future. Nineteenth-century men such as Laurent were very conscious of this. They were extrapolating into the international world what French and English lawyers had been doing in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as they engaged in nation-building by appealing to ancient customs and constitutions against the timelessness of universal empire. They were following what Carl Friedrich von Savigny had done in the early nineteenth century when he juxtaposed the spirit of the (German) nation against (French) rationalist abstractions. Indeed, history-writing was also the writing of law. As Hayden White observes:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The more historically self-conscious the writer of any form of historiography, the more the question of the social system and the law that sustains it, the authority of the law and its justification, and threats to the law occupy his attention.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn140-0047117811433080">140</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For nineteenth-century historians, law and constitutionalism were privileged languages through which the social conflicts of modernity could be dealt with by reference to the ‘nation’ as a historical and political unity and a horizon of progress. From such sources twentieth-century jurists received their language of the international community. From the critique of individualism at home we received our critique of sovereignty that became such an important aspect of our teleology. Today, however, clichés about ‘community interests’, ‘universal human rights’, the ethics of humanitarianism, <italic>jus cogens</italic> and all the formal paraphernalia of textbook law sound somehow beside the point. They grasp only a very limited part of international power, leaving the functional laws that pertain to the management of ‘globalization’ by private actors and the international market invisible.</p>
<p>There is increasing interest in historical sociology in international relations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn141-0047117811433080">141</xref></sup> Something similar is needed, and perhaps is starting to be visible in international law, too. The point of such histories would be to trace the way legal institutions – both private and public – and forms of legal thought and sensibility have come to expand in the world, organizing the distribution of wealth and poverty between the world’s populations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn142-0047117811433080">142</xref></sup> With such studies it might be possible to move the discipline’s orientation from institutions of a certain nineteenth-century sensibility to the many legal techniques, institutions and vocabularies that today organize the allocation of material and spiritual resources through property and contract, commerce and financial transactions. It has been customary to view international law’s <italic>telos</italic> in one or another version of the (Kantian) theme of a universal federation and to limit its jurisdiction to the ‘public’ activities of sovereigns. In view of the historical construction of sovereignty itself, this has been a mistake. Since the middle of the nineteenth century, successive types of Western law and Western legal consciousness have colonized the world, determining the roles that public and private law should have in managing interdependence. It is possible to have a grasp of the way we are governed, and how power is exercised in the world, only by retracing that history. We only have reason to hope that there will be an international law in the future, too, if it is able to encompass all forms of legal power. Only then it may serve as a platform on which the direction of ‘globalization’ may be defended and contested, and made subject to questions about its point and purpose − teleological questions, in other words. This, again, seems needed so that the fate of human communities would appear to be in their own hands, instead of being the objects of the whimsical moves of anonymous global forces.</p>
<p>Some time ago I participated in a case before the International Court of Justice that had to do with the legality of the declarations of independence given by Kosovo’s organs of self-determination. In preparing my oral statement I did what all the lawyers did, whatever the position they defended.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn143-0047117811433080">143</xref></sup> Descending into the libraries, my colleagues and I examined not only the history of Kosovo or the former Yugoslavia, but the intricacies of Balkan policies in the past century, the relations between the ethnic and religious groups, the forms of external intervention and the role of international bodies in the conflicts. From this we tried to extract a pattern that could be articulated in the applicable legal doctrines of statehood, self-determination, sovereignty minority rights, secession, use of force and so on. This would enable us to present a ‘principled argument’ that the Court could take to justify its decision. Indeed, it was impossible to argue about the lawfulness of the unilateral declaration of independence without a general view of the significance of nationhood and sovereignty today, the role of international institutions and the experience of war and peacemaking in Europe and more widely. The (universal) legal concepts and the specific histories were then woven together by the legal ‘teams’ in a proposal to decide the case one way or another. At the same time, the available legal concepts enabled the understanding of the differences in genuinely political terms – as differences about how to understand Balkan history and the relations of the several communities there – and the assessment of them through a vocabulary that, although it was open-ended, reaffirmed the need to obtain some minimal agreement from the populations themselves about how to live together in the future.</p>
<p>Statehood, self-determination, sovereignty, minority rights, secession, non-use of force − there are many well-founded critiques of all that. But they are part of institutional vocabularies that make it possible to express the character of collective life as a <italic>project</italic> – and our institutions and practices as platforms on which the point of that project is constantly imagined, debated, criticized and reformed, over and over again. What kind of history would it be that contained no sense of such collective projects? And what kind of politics would not assess how the present fares in view of such collective ideals? Law’s teleology is situated at that crossing. Through it, we embrace the past as experience and criticize the present for its incomplete fulfilment of our ideals. In upholding collective lives as projects, law transforms individuals into citizens with a stake in their communities, and communities into participants in the world political process.</p>
<p>International law invites everyone to participate in the imagining of humankind’s collective <italic>telos</italic>, not <italic>despite</italic> its indeterminate character but precisely by virtue of its openness. No institution or system of governance should be immune to legal controversy. Formal government and private governance, international, regional and local rules, religion and science, and the various regimes of truth and expertise all operate in ways that use law and can be captured as forms of law – as long as our vision is not clouded by stereotypical images of what ‘ruling’ or ‘law’ are. The exercise of power in the international world has been increasingly taking the form of economic or technical measures whereby officials and businesses react to crises that arise from, as it were, nowhere. The acting agents are rendered invisible and responsibility lies with no one. It is against this, I think, that the <italic>telos</italic> of international law has recently become visible, as law has come to be the vocabulary for many of those who to want to express their frustration and anger about a global (post)modernity. International law may be weak and contestable as a sociological theory, a morality of spiritual renewal or a technique of administering global life. And while there is a temptation to turn it into another instrument of dominant institutions and expert power, it also has the resources to reveal the particularity of those institutions and contested nature of claims of expertise. Perhaps paradoxically, the way international law speaks of rules and rights stands as the last platform on which collective futures may be imagined and constructed without taking the present distribution of wealth and knowledge as a given, but through which it can be articulated as a problem. To think this is to be apprehensive about claims concerning the requirements of the ‘real world’ voiced in dominant quarters. For ‘realism’ is the problem, and thinking beyond it requires thinking teleologically.</p>

<p>Professor Martti Koskenniemi delivered the 2010−11 E. H. Carr Memorial Lecture at Aberystwyth University on 24 February 2011. This series of annual lectures was inaugurated to honour the contribution to the field of Edward Hallett Carr (1890−1982). Carr was the fourth Woodrow Wilson Professor in the Department of International Politics, and during this period, 1936−47, he wrote − among others − his landmark book <italic>The Twenty Years’ Crisis 1919−1939: An Introduction to International Relations</italic> (1939, 2nd edn 1946). The first Memorial Lecture was delivered in 1984 by Professor William T. R. Fox, Bryce Professor Emeritus of the History of International Relations at Columbia University.</p>

Even such otherwise useful recent works as those by David Armstrong and his colleagues, or Adriana Sinclair, provide little sense of professional debates within international law (for example, in international law journals), and while the former has a few references to French publications, the bibliography in the latter contains only English-language works.

The opposition of ‘naturalism’ and ‘positivism’ in international law is as pervasive and as much part of the ‘tyranny of false polarities’ as ‘idealism’ v. ‘realism’ and other dichotomies in international relations, as discussed in Michael C. Williams, <italic>The Realist Tradition and the Limits of International Relations</italic> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), especially pp. 9−18 and 128−68.</p>

<p>The point was made with especial clarity in the <italic>Tehran Hostages</italic> case where the Court pointed out that ‘disputes between sovereign States by their very nature are likely to occur in political contexts’, and that if the Court ‘contrary to its settled jurisprudence’ were to see this as a reason for refusing to deal with the case, ‘it would impose a far-reaching and unwarranted restriction upon the role of the Court in the peaceful solution of international disputes’. International Court of Justice, <italic>Tehran Hostages</italic>, Reports 1980, p. 20 (para. 37). The most exhaustive discussion of the matter is now in International Court of Justice, <italic>Construction of a Wall</italic> (Advisory Opinion), Reports 2004, pp. 155−6 (para. 41).</p>
