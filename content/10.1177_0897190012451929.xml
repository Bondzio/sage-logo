         <abstract>
            <p>Lung disease associated with FOLFOX (oxaliplatin/5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) chemotherapy is uncommon. We describe a case of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) occurring in a 78-year-old woman after receiving 2 cycles of modified FOLFOX6 as adjuvant chemotherapy for treatment of resected nonmetastatic colon cancer. This patient presented with respiratory symptoms including cough with scant clear sputum and wheezing on day 10 of the second cycle of mFOLFOX6. Despite therapy with systemic antibiotics and supplemental oxygen, she had a steady and relentless progression of her respiratory symptoms and status, with chest radiographs revealing progressive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Further chest radiograph evaluation demonstrated findings consistent with COP. Antibiotics were discontinued and methylprednisolone sodium succinate initiated as the mainstay of management for COP. The patient required a higher dose of methylprednisolone sodium succinate than typical for initial response with doses up to 3 mg/kg per d leading to prompt improvement in her respiratory symptoms and function and declining need for supplemental oxygen therapy. Chest radiographs also showed improvement. The Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a probable relationship (score of 5) between the patient’s COP and the FOLFOX chemotherapy. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for this uncommon, yet severe adverse reaction associated with the FOLFOX chemotherapy.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Several chemotherapy agents have been associated with lung toxicity including diffuse alveolar damage, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, and eosinophilic pneumonia, with agents such as bleomycin, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide.<sup>

         <p>The most common types of adverse reactions associated with the FOLFOX regimen are peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.<sup>

         <title>Case Report</title>
         <p>A 78-year-old woman with a diagnosis of Duke’s stage IIB colon cancer, pT3 N0 M0 (TNM classification), with bowel obstruction underwent a hemicolectomy for surgical resection of the tumor. She subsequently began adjuvant chemotherapy 6 weeks after surgical resection, with the modified FOLFOX6 regimen (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m<sup>2</sup> day 1, leucovorin calcium 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> day 1, and 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> day 1, followed by a 2400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> continuous infusion of 5-fluourouracil over days 1 and 2 [46 hours] repeated every 2 weeks). Her height was 5′2′′, weight 74 kg, ideal body weight 50.1 kg, and body surface area 1.79 m<sup>2</sup>. No other adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy was received prior to the start of the FOLFOX6 regimen. The patient had a past medical history of lung nodules (noted 2 years prior and was noted to be stable on computed tomography [CT] imaging a year later), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, coronary artery disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and depression. Her reported medication allergies included penicillin, meperidine, codeine, and sulfa drugs, all to which she reported an adverse reaction of swelling. This patient was a retired bookkeeper and had a past history of smoking and a pertinent family history of cancer in both parents and sibling. A chest x-ray performed prior to the start of chemotherapy revealed normal pulmonary vascularity and clear lungs. The patient subsequently underwent 2 cycles of mFOLFOX6.</p>
         <p>On day 10 of the second cycle of mFOLFOX6, the patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of cough with scant clear sputum, nausea, dizziness, poor appetite, and energy level but denied any complaints of fever or night sweats. She was afebrile on admission and was noted to have some wheezing but without labored respirations. Medications prior to admission included sertraline 50 mg orally (po) daily, lisinopril 40 mg po daily, atenolol 50 mg po daily, over-the-counter multivitamin one po daily, folic acid 0.4 mg po daily, simvastatin 20 mg po daily, warfarin 1 mg po daily, and the following oral supportive care agents: megestrol acetate 800 mg po daily, ferrous fumarate 324 mg po daily, and as needed ondansetron and prochlorperazine for nausea and vomiting. She denied taking any herbal or dietary supplements. The patient’s pertinent baseline labs on admission have been included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190012451929">Table 1</xref>. The complications of the chemotherapy regimen noted on admission were neutropenia (grade 4), thrombocytopenia (grade 1), and anemia (grade 2) according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE ver4.0).<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190012451929">15</xref>
            </sup> She was subsequently begun on sargramostim 500 mcg subcutaneous daily for 4 days with resolution of her neutropenia. An initial chest x-ray done on admission showed clear lungs with no pleural effusion and normal pulmonary vascularity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0897190012451929">Figure 1</xref>). However, based on her presentation at admission, pan cultures were obtained and she was begun on intravenous piggyback (IVPB) antibiotics including moxifloxacin and vancomycin.</p>

         <p>On day 3 of admission, the patient had persistent cough and lung examination revealed crackles with wheezes. A repeat chest x-ray showed perihilar and infrahilar congestive changes. A CT scan showed peripheral patchy areas of nodules, some of which coalesced into frank areas of consolidation and patchy ground glass opacities observed in bilateral upper, lower, and right middle lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0897190012451929">Figure 2</xref>). At that time, these findings were thought to be due to an infectious process. A small right-sided and left-sided pleural effusion was observed as well for which the patient received bolus doses of furosemide. An arterial blood gas done at this time showed pH 7.44, PCO<sub>2</sub> 34.8, PO<sub>2</sub> 66, HCO<sub>3</sub> 23.7 with oxygen saturation of 94% on 3 L/min oxygen via nasal cannula. Of note, no swelling or other allergic reaction to furosemide therapy was observed despite the patient’s reported allergy to sulfa drugs on admission. Her blood, urine, and sputum cultures came back negative. A bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage revealed a scant growth of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> with no other pertinent findings. The patient’s antibiotic therapy was subsequently adjusted to include aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, and continued vancomycin therapy, and antifungal therapy with fluconazole was added.</p>

         <p>After the 10th day of admission and worsening of the patient’s clinical status with the presence of wheezes on lung examination, continued use of increasing quantities of supplemental oxygen therapy, and repeat chest x-rays showing a steady progression of the pulmonary infiltrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0897190012451929">Figure 3</xref>), methylprednisolone sodium succinate 30 mg IVPB every 6 hours therapy was initiated. By the 12th day of admission, due to no evidence of infection and lack of response to antimicrobial therapy, the pattern of the chest radiograph findings including the initial CT scan were determined to be consistent with ILD, specifically a COP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0897190012451929">Figure 2</xref>). This was thought to be associated with the use of adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy as there was a temporal correlation and no other definite alternative etiology identified. The patient was, however, determined to be too weak to undergo a lung biopsy for confirmation of the clinical and radiographic findings. Antibiotics were immediately discontinued and methylprednisolone sodium succinate was increased to 60 mg IVPB every 6 hours (approximately 3 mg/kg per d based on actual body weight) due to the presence of progressive infiltrates on chest x-ray, and lung examination still revealing fine rales, crackles, and bilateral wheezes. Thereafter, a prompt clinical improvement was demonstrated with declining oxygen requirements. Intravenous steroid therapy was continued as the mainstay of management with no further reinitiation of the FOLFOX chemotherapy. Improvement was also noted in the chest x-ray findings as well, which lagged the clinical improvement observed earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0897190012451929">Figure 4</xref>). The patient was maintained on methylprednisolone therapy for a total of 18 days during the inpatient stay with a tapering of the dose attempted due to the development of steroid induced myopathy. However, due to a worsening of respiratory symptoms, she was maintained on the initial dose with a plan for slower gradual tapering over a few months. She was discharged to continue oral methylprednisolone 60 mg every 6 hours by the 28th day of hospital admission. The patient was then subsequently readmitted a few days after discharge due to a cardiorespiratory arrest. The cause was indeterminate but not felt to be related to the primary ILD. The patient was later discharged to hospice care with gradual withdrawal of care.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>The patient’s initial presentation on admission with nonspecific respiratory symptoms and a normal chest radiograph is similar to the findings reported by Muller et al, that in cases of drug-associated ILD, patients may initially present with a normal chest radiograph, despite the presence of symptoms due to the drug reaction.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012451929">1</xref>
            </sup> However, a few days into admission, her respiratory symptoms worsened and the chest radiographs thereafter revealed progressive infiltrates. The patient improved clinically only after receiving systemic steroid therapy along with supplemental oxygen and no further resumption of the FOLFOX regimen. Systemic steroid therapy is a mainstay for the management of COP with initial doses of 0.75 to 1 mg/kg per d and gradual weaning over 6 to 12 months.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012451929">16</xref>
            </sup> Our patient required higher doses of systemic steroids at 3 mg/kg per d for initial response. Her poor response to a more rapid tapering of steroid therapy emphasized the importance of a slower gradual tapering of doses over several months.</p>
         <p>This patient had a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, but no prior history of receiving rhythm controlling medications including use of amiodarone. In addition, she denied the use of alternative medication products and her prior occupation did not pose a risk factor for the development of COP. In addition, connective tissue disease and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis were ruled out since she did not have a prior diagnosis of these conditions nor did she present with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of these disease states. No other potential medication or disease-induced causes of COP were identified in this patient. The Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale was utilized to assess the likelihood of this adverse drug reaction and it revealed a probable relationship (score of 5) between the patient’s COP and the FOLFOX chemotherapy.<sup>

         <p>A literature search was conducted using PubMed (1966 to December 2011) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to December 2011), using combinations of the search terms “organizing pneumonia,” “oxaliplatin,” 5-fluorouracil,” “leucovorin,” “FOLFOX,” and “pulmonary disease” and was limited to the English language. Results revealed only 2 other reported cases of COP secondary to FOLFOX chemotherapy.<sup>

            </sup> The patient had resolution of dyspnea and cough after 4 days of oral prednisone treatment at 1 mg/kg per d and resolution of CT findings 4 weeks later. The patient later resumed therapy with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan, without complications. This suggests that the COP may be due to oxaliplatin therapy alone or due to the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin.<sup>

         <p>Our patient case was unique from the others reported in literature in that it occurred early, after only 2 cycles of mFOLFOX6, and responded only to higher dose intravenous steroid therapy at 3 mg/kg per d. This case highlights the importance of suspecting COP early on in FOLFOX therapy and the need to consider higher dose steroid therapy in patients without prompt improvement to usual starting doses of 1 mg/kg per d. This improves our understanding of FOLFOX-induced COP and how the management may differ among patients based on the potential severity of this adverse event.</p>
         <p>In understanding the risk factors for FOLFOX-induced COP, it is uncertain whether underlying lung disease is a predisposing factor. Wilcox et al reported on 3 cases of patients with underlying ILD who had a worsening of their respiratory status after initiation of oxaliplatin-based therapy.<sup>

            </sup> Our patient had lung nodularity first observed 2 years ago that was noted to remain stable a year later, and we are uncertain whether this may have served as a predisposing factor to her probable FOLFOX-induced COP. This may help to further improve our understanding of risk factors for this adverse drug event.</p>
         <p>With increased use of FOLFOX in clinical practice, there have been several reported cases of other types of ILD associated with this chemotherapy regimen, including descriptions of interstitial pneumonias, eosinophilic pneumonia, and pulmonary fibrosis.<sup>

            </sup> Currently, there is no standard treatment guide for FOLFOX-induced ILD, but early detection and management is key.</p>
         <p>A limitation of this patient case is the lack of a biopsy, which is suggested in the diagnosis of COP. However, the decision not to perform a biopsy was a clinical decision based on the patient being determined to be too weak to undergo one. In addition, the patient’s clinical presentation and radiographic findings on the CT scan were consistent with a COP and she showed positive response to systemic steroid therapy. Another limitation is the lack of additional diagnostic tests to rule out connective tissue and autoimmune disease. However, these tests were not ordered since the patient’s clinical presentation and past medical history did not support these diagnoses. This case highlights a unique mode of management of FOLFOX-induced COP than previously reported in literature with the use of higher dose intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate therapy at 3 mg/kg per d with a gradual tapering of doses based on patient response.</p>
