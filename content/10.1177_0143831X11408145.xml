<abstract>
<p>This article analyses how the introduction of variable pay systems (VPS) has affected the role of trade unions and collective bargaining in company pay setting, and the role of these institutions in shaping VPS in Norwegian companies in blue-collar machinery production and white-collar banking services. The development of VPS has been fairly smoothly handled by the actors within, and with the help of, the established industrial relations institutions. In the machinery companies, VPS implied minimal changes in collective bargaining, whereas in banking significant individualization and more ambiguous effects for the role of company unions in pay setting were found.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>The rise of variable payments systems (VPS) over the past decades, involving a shift towards more flexible, performance-related pay, is often considered to be at odds with the egalitarian logic of industrial relations and collective bargaining in the Nordic countries. Influenced by changes in markets, technology, production and work organization, VPS have been viewed as a centrepiece in human resource management strategies aimed at increasing employer discretion in reward policies and tying pay more closely to performance through decentralization, individualization and differentiation of pay determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11408145">Marginson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143831X11408145">Van het Kaar and Grünell, 2001</xref>). By implication, VPS have thus been expected to weaken the impact of collective bargaining on pay developments, prompting scepticism among trade unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143831X11408145">Hanley and Nguyen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143831X11408145">Kessler and Purcell, 2003</xref>). Yet empirical studies of the interrelations between VPS and collective bargaining remain sparse. Some earlier studies have indicated a positive relationship between the diffusion of certain types of VPS and presence of works councils and trade unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143831X11408145">Van het Kaar and Grünell, 2001</xref>). The sector-based comparative analyses conducted in the European project of which this national study was part, suggest that development of VPS is more easily accommodated in well-integrated, two-tiered systems of collective representation than in systems with single-employer negotiations or weak articulation between local and central actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11408145">Arrowsmith et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11408145">Nergaard et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11408145">Traxler et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To further examine to what extent such relationships are influenced by specific properties of the sectors in this article we analyse and compare the interaction between VPS, collective bargaining and trade unions in the Norwegian machinery and banking sectors. Both sectors entail the characteristic Nordic two-tiered pattern of collective bargaining with workplace representation through trade unions, but their product markets, employee composition and way of production vary substantially; with banking representing a white-collar services industry and machinery blue-collar manufacturing of goods, they are well suited to examine the relative impact of national institutions of collective bargaining and of sector particularities on VPS developments. Focusing on the main occupational groups in six banking and six machinery companies that have introduced VPS, we discuss the role of collective institutions and trade unions in the development of VPS and the implications of VPS for collective bargaining in these companies.</p>
<p>Based on a brief review of central assumptions in the literature, our main analytical questions and framework are spelled out in section 2, and the methodology of the study in section 3. The regulatory frameworks of company wage setting are depicted in 4.1, the use of different kinds of VPS in our case companies are traced in section 4.2, while similarities and differences in the roles of company actors in the development of VPS and the implications for local wage setting and collective bargaining in the two sectors are reviewed in sections 4.3 and 4.4. In section 5 we summarize and discuss our main findings.</p>

<sec id="section2-0143831X11408145">
<title>2. Analytical issues and perspectives</title>
<p>Most western countries have seen tendencies towards more decentralized wage setting and a rise in VPS in the past decades. While decentralization refers to devolution of pay setting from higher to lower levels of organization within sectors or companies, VPS have to do with a shift at company level from standard/hourly pay to more variable forms of remuneration. The two processes are often intertwined, but not necessarily. Criteria for VPS can in principle be determined in central agreements, but in practice development of VPS tends to imply shifts in the pattern of decision-making in company pay setting and collective bargaining. The introduction of VPS is commonly seen as an expression of management desire to increase its discretion in pay issues and to link rewards more closely to the needs of the company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143831X11408145">Brown, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143831X11408145">Brown and Heywood, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143831X11408145">Kessler, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11408145">Lawler, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>The defining feature of VPS is an explicit attempt to make a greater share of pay subject to performance- and output-related criteria,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0143831X11408145">1</xref></sup> whether focused on the company, site, work group or individual, and, as a consequence, increase the proportion of pay which is ‘at risk’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X11408145">Marginson et al., 2008</xref>). Three types of VPS are conventionally identified: output and productivity related bonuses, including payments-by-results (PBR), where there is a direct relationship between pay and employees’ production or sales; profit-related bonus schemes, which entitle employees to a share of the company’s business success; and individual merit or performance-related pay (IPP) based on qualitative management appraisal of the employees’ work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X11408145">Marginson et al., 2008</xref>). As witnessed by the long tradition of piecework-based pay systems in manufacturing and sales provisions in banking and insurance, variable pay is far from new. Whereas individual piecework-based schemes have been phased out in many industries, there is no doubt that new kinds of VPS have attained growing importance in local pay setting in recent years. Little is known, however, about the implications of newer forms of VPS for collective bargaining and trade unions in different sectors.</p>
<p>Variable, performance-related individual pay contrasts sharply with the standardized, collective logic of time-based pay conventionally associated with collective agreements. It has thus been assumed that the Norwegian context of centrally coordinated wage policies and strong trade unions with extensive bargaining and codetermination rights at the firm level would constrain management attempts to introduce more variable and differentiated pay elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11408145">Nergaard et al., 2009a</xref>). The Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise (NHO) has since the 1990s called for much more decentralized and individualized remuneration policies in order to reward performance and enhance innovation and flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11408145">NHO, 2001</xref>). Also the Finance Sector Employer Association (FA) has pushed for more performance-based, individual pay. In spite of the strong collective bargaining institutions recent studies show that VPS have become widespread in Norway; 55 percent of private sector companies (11 employees and more) in 2003 reported to have introduced some kind of VPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143831X11408145">Barth et al., 2008</xref>). According to the latest figures almost one-third of private sector employees reported to be covered by some type of bonus pay arrangement – 31 percent in 2006 – compared to 12 percent in 1989.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0143831X11408145">2</xref></sup> Similar trends are reported in other Nordic countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X11408145">Jensen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X11408145">Scheuer, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>As pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11408145">Arrowsmith et al. (2008)</xref>, trade unions and variable pay elements are not necessarily opposed; from an employer perspective, there are indeed indications that ‘employee involvement in pay system design and implementation is critical to ensuring acceptance and effectiveness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143831X11408145">Cox, 2000</xref>: 372) and that union participation can offer management the advantages of ‘voice’, identifying employee concerns, problem-solving and ‘loyalty’ in the process of implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X11408145">Bowey and Thorpe, 1986</xref>). While managements with an interest in introducing VPS might be willing to offer trade unions something in return, local trade unions can view such initiatives as an opportunity to demand increased pay and extend the scope of collective bargaining at company level. Trade union approaches and willingness to engage in such development processes are thus likely to vary between different sectors, companies and institutional contexts of local wage setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11408145">Traxler et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Productivity bonus, profit-related pay and IPP tend to have different implications for pay patterns, workers, union representatives and for decision-making. Union approaches are therefore likely to be contingent on the choice of schemes and their specific design, organization and significance. The level at which VPS operate is anticipated to influence workers’ exposure to earnings fluctuations and the conditions for employee influence, whereas the quantitative significance of VPS – how large is the share of workers’ actual earnings – will influence the associated risks and shape local union perceptions and strategies.</p>
<p>Productivity bonuses at individual or group level are a long-established type to which organized labour has accommodated, as with negotiations over piecework. Profit-related pay is periodic and usually of less quantitative significance, normally coming on top of basic pay. Operating at the group or organizational level, which is remote from individual or work group effort, it is of less immediate concern to members and their representatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11408145">Pendleton, 1997</xref>). By contrast, IPP is subjectively assessed at personal level and is usually of some quantitative significance, thus representing a greater challenge to existing conventions and outcomes. Moreover, because it undermines the principle of the common rule which has long underpinned collective pay setting and trade union pay policies, it may threaten both the capacity of representatives to foster collective organization and goals and their procedural role as collective agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143831X11408145">Heery, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Various kinds of exchanges and compromises over VPS can thus be expected between management and trade unions at the local level. The extent to which VPS become part of the local collective bargaining agenda is further likely to vary between different stages of VPS development, for example associated with the introduction/design, implementation and operation of schemes. Rather than considering the link between VPS and collective bargaining as part of an antagonistic, zero-sum relationship, one can envisage a wide scale along which the extent of cooperation can reach from joint regulation through collective agreements at one end, via various forms of consultation, project groups, information and ad hoc contact, to schemes unilaterally determined by management or the owners at the other end.</p>
<p>In order to uncover the importance of sector differences, e.g. related to product market conditions, work organization and composition of the labour force, for the impact of VPS on industrial relations and trade union approaches, we have compared experiences with VPS in companies in banking and manufacturing of machinery and equipment (machinery). Banking represents a domestically oriented service industry with predominantly white-collar employees, whereas machinery represents an internationally oriented manufacturing sector where blue-collar workers still are in majority. At the same time sharing common traits of the national system of collective bargaining, they are well suited to reveal the impact of national institutions vs sector-specific factors on the development of VPS and the role of collective bargaining and trade unions. As new VPS can have profound implications for the role of collective bargaining in company pay setting, it can be studied as a strong test of the capacity of organized actors in different sectors to govern current trends towards more decentralized and differentiated industrial relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11408145">Traxler et al., 2008</xref>). Former studies of decentralization of wage formation and working time in the Nordic countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X11408145">Due and Madsen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143831X11408145">Ilsøe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143831X11408145">Stokke, 2008</xref>) indicate that union representatives are willing to go quite far in accepting more flexible, differentiated conditions insofar as such changes are anchored in central agreements that secure local unions a proper role in development and governance of the systems at company level. A central issue in our study was the extent to which the sensitive issue of variable, individual pay was subject to similar dynamics, whether they varied between manufacturing and services companies, and, if so, how and why.</p>
<p>Reviewing Norwegian experiences with VPS in selected machinery and banking companies, this article aims to analyse (1) whether and how the collective bargaining institutions and trade unions have contributed to shaping VPS developments at company level and, conversely, how the development of VPS has affected the role of the trade unions in company pay setting. More specifically, how does the role of collective actors vary between different kinds and stages of VPS? Comparing companies in blue-collar machinery production and white-collar banking services, (2) we further aim to examine how sector differences, caused, for example, by differences in occupational and skill structure, product market situation and the pattern of industrial relations, matter in these respects. Thereby we aim to shed light on the relative impact of common national institutions vs sector particularities in shaping the interplay between VPS, collective bargaining and trade unions. As will be seen, management and labour in our case companies in both sectors have to a considerable extent collaborated on developing new kinds of VPS, such as individual performance pay, which are expected to sit uneasily with the Norwegian legacy of collective bargaining. In this view, we discuss in the concluding section the implications of VPS for the Norwegian system of industrial relations, and whether its multi-tiered collective bargaining system is actually a resource rather than a constraint when it comes to governing VPS.</p>

<title>3. Data and methodology</title>
<p>The data on VPS, collective bargaining and trade unions in Norway is part of a comparative, European project covering Austria, Norway, Spain and the UK. The empirical study – of which the Norwegian data are part – is based on a case-in-sector approach, allowing us to compare cases across sectors within each country and compare matched cases in each sector across countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143831X11408145">Marginson and Sisson, 2004</xref>: 20; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11408145">Nergaard et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11408145">Traxler et al., 2008</xref>). Research teams in each of the four countries conducted interviews at company as well as sector level. The project focused on two sectors, banking and manufacturing of machinery. In banking we included business and saving banks (monetary intermediation, NACE 65.12) and in machinery we included different subsectors within manufacturing of machinery and equipment (NACE 29). In both sectors national as well as foreign-owned companies were included. While the main occupational groups in banking are white-collar and in machinery blue-collar, both sectors are highly unionized. With long-standing collective bargaining traditions, they therefore lend themselves to comparative studies of the interaction between VPS, collective bargaining and trade unions in sectors producing respectively traded goods and intangible services.</p>
<p>Interviews were first conducted with representatives of the employer associations and main unions at sector level during 2005,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0143831X11408145">3</xref></sup> focusing on their strategic views and actual policies regarding VPS, and the role of sector collective agreement in regulating and facilitating company VPS. Both sides were also helpful in identifying potential case companies that could meet the criteria defined by the international research team. Six companies with some kind of VPS were selected in each sector in the participating countries, based on a matching of cases across countries by type of product (NACE codes), size and ownership, thereby limiting variation. The subsequent case studies conducted during 2005–6 built on interviews with representatives of management and the trade union(s). These interviews were complemented by a questionnaire for collection of quantitative data concerning the type, criteria and importance of VPS used at company level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0143831X11408145">4</xref></sup> Enabling us to collect detailed, first-hand qualitative information from actors at different levels and in different positions, combined with quantitative data, the case studies gave deep insight into the factors shaping the evolution of VPS and the role of trade unions.</p>
<p>The 12 Norwegian companies varied in size from around 100 employees up to several thousand employees, i.e. medium large to large companies in a Norwegian context (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0143831X11408145">Appendix</xref>), including savings as well as business banks, and both foreign and Norwegian owned companies in each sector. Union density varied from 60 percent to 100 percent. All companies were covered by collective agreements, and all but one were members of the relevant employer association. Within the machinery sector, the majority of the cases were mainly occupied with standard manual production but also included two high-tech companies with white-collar dominance.</p>
<p>The purpose of the study was not to produce data that were representative for the entire population of companies in the two sectors, but to study selected cases in each sector that could provide information about the interplay between VPS, collective bargaining and trade unions in companies that actually had experience with VPS, and compare these with similar companies in other countries and across sectors. In this respect, we were more interested in whether and how VPS brought about change in industrial relations and the mechanisms and principal effects shaping developments than their exact size or prevalence. Doing so, we focused, as mentioned, on the main occupational group in each company and their trade union, implying that personnel related to supervision and management were left out. In the larger banks we concentrated on retail banking, and did not look at pay systems in corporate banking. It should further be underscored that case companies with VPS in the Norwegian machinery sector were harder to find and probably are less typical for that sector than the bank cases,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0143831X11408145">5</xref></sup> where almost all companies have some kind of VPS.</p>

<p><italic>Banking</italic> is today part of the industrial relations system of the wider financial sector. Over the past two decades companies in the banking and insurance sectors have become integrated in larger financial groups through cross-sector mergers – in the late 1990s spurring mergers also between the respective trade unions and employer associations in the entire financial sector. The dominant union – the Finance Sector Union of Norway (Finansforbundet) – organizes all groups of employees, and the employers are represented by the Finance Sector Employer Association (Finansnæringens Arbeidsgiverorganisasjon). Both sides are renowned for high organizational rates although there are reports of declining union density within the finance sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143831X11408145">Nergaard and Stokke, 2010</xref>). The Finance Sector Collective Agreement has since 2002 covered all types of jobs within the banking and insurance sectors.</p>
<p>Both the machinery and banking industries maintain multiemployer bargaining at sector level, complemented by formalized company agreements. In articulated, two-tiered bargaining systems like the Norwegian, the scope for company bargaining will to a large extent be subject to regulations in the sector agreements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143831X11408145">Stokke, 2008</xref>); these agreements may open up for certain pay systems, or block them, and may define procedures shaping the roles of company-level parties with regard to VPS.</p>
<p>Among the blue-collar workers in the <italic>machinery industry</italic>, the sector agreement only determines minimum pay rates. Supplementary company bargaining is a compulsory element of wage setting, taking place under a peace duty and normally without involvement of the sector-level parties. VPS such as bonus arrangements and piecework may be used under the precondition that they are regulated in a local collective agreement, in effect granting the local trade union a strong say in the development of such schemes. The metal workers’ trade union is renowned for a strong egalitarian legacy according to which skill levels and to some degree seniority have been the only/main criteria for differentiation.</p>
<p>The <italic>banking industry</italic> has over the past decade seen a wholesale overhaul of the collective agreement, creating a new framework for company-level bargaining. Besides merging the two former separate agreements for banking and insurance, both parties saw the need for more decentralized pay setting and meeting the demands for more local differentiation and flexibility. While central negotiations still determine a general pay increase, the introduction of compulsory company agreements provided the local unions (new) opportunities to influence pay systems and working time arrangements which are today under the purview of the parties at company level.</p>
<p>In banking, wage regulation at company level can follow one of two alternative models. According to the present Basic Agreement in the finance sector, an individual wage assessment will take place annually (§14.5). The final decision on the individual distribution of extra pay increments lies with the employer; union representatives in the Employment Committee will receive a list of proposals, and can influence the outcome by launching their own candidates. The parties at sector level in 2002 also agreed to open up for, and recommended, the so-called ‘pay-interview model’ where the employer adjusts individual pay after a structured pay interview with every single employee is undertaken. Within this model unions have no direct role in the annual local pay revisions. The pay-interview model can only be chosen if the parties at company level agree, and today the trade union no longer favours this model compared to the more traditional §14.5 model.</p>
<p>Compared to the machinery industry, the local pay systems in banking are based on a much stronger employer initiative regarding the annual, individual increases in base pay. This partly reflects different industrial relations traditions; the tolerance for individual differentiation has been low among unions in manufacturing, while banking has always had a tradition for employer discretion with regard to individual pay adjustments. As elaborated in section 4.4, such differences in institutional traditions are probably associated with differences in product markets, customer relations and occupational composition.</p>

<title>4.2 Variable pay systems in banking and machinery: An overview</title>
<p>Two main types of VPS were the most common in the 12 companies studied: individual performance pay (IPP) and profit sharing bonuses (PSB) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0143831X11408145">see Appendix</xref>). Productivity- or output-based bonuses were interestingly not seen in any of our case companies, but different kinds of ad hoc, effort-related bonuses were used in most of the banks. While all IPP systems were regulated by local collective agreements, this was more mixed when it came to profit sharing bonuses, and the management-driven ad hoc bonuses in banking were kept out of the collective bargaining sphere in all but one of the banks.</p>
<sec id="section7-0143831X11408145">
<title>4.2.1 Individual performance pay (IPP)</title>
<p>In <italic>banking</italic> all the companies applied some kind of individual pay setting based on appraisals determining the consolidated wage of each employee. Individual performance is only one of several factors that should be considered in such appraisals; among the others are skill level and job responsibilities. In three of the six banks the social partners had agreed to introduce the pay-interview model in which the union does not play any role regarding the actual distribution; the others used the more traditional model (§14.5) where union representatives are presented the lists of nominations for individual increases. As mentioned above, all these schemes have to be anchored in local collective agreements. In most of the banks the annual allocation of individual pay rises takes place within a predefined economic framework set by the top management (for instance 1.5 percent of the wage budget), usually determined after informal discussions with the trade union.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0143831X11408145">6</xref></sup> The implication is that only a minority of the employees will receive an individual rise per year, whereas all employees will receive the general increase determined in the sector agreement.</p>
<p>Four of the six <italic>machinery companies</italic> practised pay schemes based on some kind of individual appraisal among blue-collar workers (IPP). Individual pay rises resulting from such appraisals were consolidated into the worker’s basic pay. The schemes varied in design and sophistication, but usually included factors such as performance, skills, extra responsibility and in some cases also factors such as reliability and interpersonal skills. The most elaborate ones implied a formalized evaluation of a number of such factors – where the individual pay increases were directly linked to the quantitative outcome of the appraisal process. As such, appraisal systems are atypical for Norwegian manufacturing where pay systems for blue-collar workers normally do not allow for much individual differentiation. All of these schemes were anchored in collective agreements, implying that changes in them would require consent. The sums set aside for individual increases were in most cases very moderate (2–3 percent for those who got one). These came on top of the general increases agreed in collective bargaining at sector and company levels, implying that this individual element added a third tier to the bargaining system in the sector.</p>
<p>As IPP systems influence the basic, consolidated pay of each worker – and hence go to the core of wage setting – they were without exception anchored in collective agreements in both sectors. This implies that the local partners have agreed on a set of objectives, procedures and criteria to be used in the evaluations, their frequency (annually), and in some cases also complaints arrangements. Unions normally also get access to the results of the annual wage assessments. These features open up for union influence on the processes and on the overall distributional profile, but usually not on the individual nominations. An important difference between the sectors, however, is that in banking the IPP system is the only local source of growth in basic wages, whereas in the machinery companies the annual local bargaining round normally provides everyone a pay hike on top of the central increase. The trade unions in banking have thus gone much further than those in machinery in accepting that individual wage growth is subject to management discretion, though in accordance with criteria and frameworks defined by company-level collective bargaining.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0143831X11408145">
<title>4.2.2 Profit sharing bonuses (PSB)</title>
<p>Bonuses of this kind were used in all the banks, while they were seen in three of the six companies in machinery. PSB normally covered all employees. Payments were linked to economic performance at company or group level, and in some instances also to additional measures such as customer satisfaction. The majority of these bonus systems were highly formalized, for instance linking the size of the bonus to specific levels of profit as well as describing coverage and distributional criteria, and the employees were well informed about the criteria and the cap for payouts. In other cases (some of the banks) the size of the bonus was decided discretionally, but based on known principles.</p>
<p>Usually this kind of bonus is paid once per year, after the annual accounts are closed. A few of the schemes within the banking sector were not based on annual payouts, but the bonuses were transferred to employment funds investing in shares in the bank. Here payments would take place when the employee retired or left the bank.</p>
<p>Flat bonus rates were the main rule both in banking and in machinery, but in one of the machinery companies the bonus was linked to pay level with a ceiling of two weeks’ pay. The sums involved would vary, but normally payouts would (in a good year) mean 4–6 percent of annual pay. The highest as well as the lowest bonus ceilings were seen in the machinery companies.</p>
<p>As regards profit-based bonuses, detailed regulation by collective agreement was seen in two of the three machinery companies with such systems. In banking, such systems were with one exception not part of the collective agreements, but were usually subject to consultation in some form or another. Since this type of unconsolidated bonus tends to be regarded as ‘extra pay’ and comes in flat rates to all, the trade unions seem less concerned about integrating PBS into the collective bargaining agenda than is the case with IPP. Furthermore, as bonus systems are vulnerable to questions about fairness and the possibility of manipulation, employers tend to be prepared to revise such systems if they are viewed as unjust by the employees or unions.</p>
<p>One of the medium-sized banks had also introduced a more elaborate bonus system based on balanced score cards as well as on sales and profit. The bonus, with the exception of the profit-based element which covered all employees, was based on group-wide comparisons, implying that employees in the best performing bank offices were given an annual bonus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0143831X11408145">
<title>4.2.3 Supplementary ad hoc bonuses</title>
<p>In addition to IPP and PSB, almost all the cases in banking practised so-called ‘one-time’ payments determined by line managers, which can be described as performance-based, individual ad hoc bonuses. Management in banks apparently looks for flexible ways to reward employees for extra effort, good performance related to special projects, or for taking on extra responsibilities for a limited period. These bonuses were not anchored in collective agreements and were not governed by any explicit/detailed criteria. Union representatives were seldom involved in the distribution process. The sums involved could be substantial (sometimes up to 10–15 percent of average annual pay, but normally less), and line managers would usually have to find funding within their unit budgets. A more formalized kind of one-off bonuses was seen in two of the larger banks, where the unions apparently had accepted that the line managers could have considerable freedom to distribute such rewards as they saw fit among their staff. No such bonus systems were seen among blue-collar employees in the machinery companies, although we were told that similar systems for rewarding employees were used among white-collar employees in some of the machinery companies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0143831X11408145">
<title>4.2.4 Within-sector variation in VPS</title>
<p>The case companies were, as mentioned, selected with the purpose of comparison with matched pairs of international counterpart companies as regards the impact of collective bargaining and representation systems on the development of VPS, and vice versa. Although the cases gave useful insight into the conditions and way in which VPS are developed and their impact on company wage setting within the particular industrial relations setting of the Norwegian sector, the small numbers and strong heterogeneity bode caution in drawing conclusions about the causes of variation among these cases within each sector. A few remarks can be made though. In banking, larger commercial and saving banks tend to have developed more extensive and formalized systems of VPS for ordinary staff, often combined with decentralized ad hoc bonuses which give bank management an instrument for rewarding employees. None of the smallest banks had adopted the pay-interview model, but we found both models among the larger banks. Within the machinery sector there was no distinct variation in VPS systems between smaller and larger companies, and IPP was found in the largest as well as the smallest of the companies. Furthermore, there was no evidence of systematic differences in types of VPS or the quantitative importance of VPS between Norwegian and foreign-owned companies. In some of the latter cases elements of the VPS were shaped in view of practice and experience from the home mother company, for instance by introducing a group-wide bonus system to the Norwegian unit. In others, some inspiration from the mother company could be seen, but the Norwegian unit had developed country-specific variants of the schemes.</p>

<title>4.2.5 VPS and collective agreements. main patterns and variations</title>
<p>Although the development of VPS in banking and machinery shows some common traits, the differences are more striking. First, the banks tended to combine several types of VPS, while the development in the machinery cases was more restrained, and usually comprised only one scheme. Second, IPP systems, which affect the basic, consolidated pay of each employee, were regulated in collective agreements in all companies in both sectors, whereas additional and more occasional bonuses coming on top of basic pay, such as PSBs and the ad hoc bonuses in banking, seemed to prompt less trade union concern and more seldom were subject to joint regulation. Third, since the banks had introduced more of the latter systems and don’t offer general local pay increases – which they do in machinery – a greater share of local wage formation in banks emanated from VPS among which a larger part was not subject to collective regulation or consultations with the trade unions.</p>

<title>4.3 The interaction between VPS, collective bargaining and trade unions at company level</title>
<sec id="section13-0143831X11408145">
<title>4.3.1 Strong consultation in introduction phase</title>
<p>Introducing new elements of variable pay can be controversial as an element of uncertainty and risk will be involved, especially if the systems are unfamiliar to unions and their members. There was thus a shared understanding among unions and management in the case companies that pay systems are not easily changed. Moreover, introduction of VPS would according to the collective agreements in these sectors, normally have to be subject to local agreements or to consultation with the unions.</p>
<p>When it comes to IPP systems, which influence basic, consolidated pay, most of the companies in our study put considerable resources into the preparatory and introductory phase, among others by setting up joint working groups and visiting companies with experience with the relevant type of VPS. External experts – including representatives of the sector federations – were rarely involved, except occasional requests for clarification of whether the VPS was in compliance with the sector agreement. We found, as mentioned, less extensive consultation with unions over PSB (profit sharing bonuses), which only occasionally were anchored in collective agreements, and even less over the ad hoc bonuses in banking.</p>
<p>While it is commonly assumed that the development of VPS is driven by the employers, this study shows that trade unions also take an active part in initiating and shaping new VPS. In banking, the pay-interview model adopted in three of six banks in our study was originally put on the agenda by the sector-level parties in 2002 and was included as an option in the sector agreement eventually recommended by the union as well as by the employer organization (see section 3). Apparently, the unions were as strong a driver as management in those banks that had left the traditional model for the pay-interview model. Even more surprising, the initiative in two of the machinery companies with IPP schemes came from the local union (see below). Likewise, company unions in both sectors claimed to be the initiator – or at least share the responsibility for the initiation – of several of the recently introduced PSB.</p>
<p>The strong union involvement in the preparatory and introduction phase of especially IPP naturally reflects that this is the period when the parameters of such systems can most effectively be influenced. As part of the pay system, introduction of VPS will often also require regulation by local collective agreement or other forms of consultation that trigger union engagement. More substantially, both management and unions in the case companies were concerned with trust and acknowledged that new pay systems that are viewed as unfair among the employees most likely would be counterproductive. Management viewed union involvement and consent as key to preventing such failures. There were thus several examples in the machinery companies where experience with unsuccessful VPS had eroded the future willingness to experiment with pay systems. New systems were therefore initially often labelled as ‘trial/experimental schemes’, opening up for renegotiation without any of the parties losing face.</p>
<p>When systems had been implemented and came into the operational phase, the trade unions naturally retreated into more monitoring roles. Although the intensity of their engagement diminished, the operation and especially the distributional effects of the IPPs were followed closely and were in some cases also subject to discussions and adjustments in the joint supervisory bodies that were set up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0143831X11408145">
<title>4.3.2 Trade union motives, interests and concerns</title>
<p>Contrary to the expectation that strong trade unions and collective bargaining institutions will tend to obstruct development of individual performance-based pay systems, these institutions proved in our study to be of great importance in facilitating the introduction of such systems in the selected Norwegian banking and machinery companies. What were the main motives and considerations behind the fairly pragmatic actor approaches that we found in our case companies?</p>
<p>For the trade unions, opening up for differentiation according to individual performance, attitudes, or other ‘subjective’ criteria implies a significant challenge to their traditional principles of wage setting and equity. This is not only the case among blue-collar workers in machinery, but also among white-collar employees in banks where the pay regulative until recently had secured slow but steady advancements within lifelong tenures as bank functionaries. When deliberating introduction of VPS, the two key concerns among the local trade unions in our case companies were therefore to secure common increases in basic pay and ensure that the links between efforts and rewards were perceived as fair among the members. Given that these preconditions were met, the trade unions tended to adopt fairly pragmatic approaches to VPS as a potential source of additional pay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11408145">Nergaard et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143831X11408145">2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>When local unions supported, or accepted, the introduction of IPP, traditional collective bargaining considerations had thus often been at play. In one of the machinery companies where the trade union had initiated an IPP system, almost all their members (skilled workers with long seniority) had exhausted their possibilities for wage mobility in the old system. By accepting increased differentiation according to skills and certain performance-related elements, more members could expect future pay increases. Similar pragmatic considerations were also expressed by union representatives in other machinery companies with IPP, and in several of the banks, where they claimed that the pay-interview model would ensure members with long seniority better prospects for upward wage adjustments.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the pay-interview model (chosen by three of the six banks) would, according to these union representatives, grant the members some influence over their pay development by ‘forcing’ the managers to sit down and discuss pay and job performance face to face with each and every employee. As the shop steward in one of the medium-sized banks argued:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>I wanted the pay setting to be more fair, and to make all employees visible, not only the ones who knock on the manager’s door every six months and complain about their wages, and finally win through. So it seemed interesting to try out a system where the managers have to follow up on all their employees, also the ones who do a good job without making a lot of fuss about it. I guess that was my main ambition by supporting the pay interview model.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Several representatives also conceded – especially in larger banks – that in the traditional system they would in reality have to accept most of management’s nominations since they had no adequate knowledge about (or were not in a position to judge) the performance of individual members: As one of the shop stewards noted:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>When the number of employees had increased, it was no longer possible that the HR manager and I sat down with the lists, and I was to know who had done a good job.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In other, smaller banks, the traditional model reportedly worked well for both unions and employees, so they saw no need to shift to the more individualistic pay interview model.</p>
<p>In both sectors the unions emphasized the need for transparency in systems and objectivity in IPP evaluations. This was done by defining a number of factors that should be taken into consideration, making sure that qualifications and responsibilities as well as different aspects of performance should be part of the process (‘not just sales’). In some cases the pay systems even attributed a predefined weight (number of points) to each factor. The most formalized systems, in terms of linking pay to a predefined score were seen in machinery companies, whereas the bank unions accepted more management discretion and distribution of pay increases based on overall assessments. The higher degree of formalization in the machinery cases presumably reflects that such systems were unfamiliar among blue-collar workers, and in several cases met with scepticism among the rank and file union members. Formalization was sought to reduce the impression of subjectivity in the evaluations.</p>
<p>Among the shop stewards, however, another reason for accepting more individual differentiation was the desire to reward, retain and attract personnel who were willing to acquire new skills, take on responsibility and make an extra effort. This must partly be seen in light of the very tight labour markets at the time. Shop stewards within banking also argued that the pay system had to take into consideration that personal performance varies:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>From the union’s side we argue that fair pay is not equal pay, but correct pay. From that, it’s self-evident that we need a pay system that follows your performance. This is what has been the basic idea regarding the pay system we have been working on.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Greater individualization was also, especially in banking, seen as a way to respond to changing expectations among new and more educated employee groups and hence attract and retain members.</p>
<p>Aiming to balance these contradictory concerns, the unions in both sectors keep a close eye on the distributional outcome of IPP systems, trying to secure that the overall profile is acceptable. They therefore stress (and include in their agreements) that statistics should be provided once a year or more often. Further, in several cases the unions had demanded arrangements enabling employees to file a complaint if the pay assessment was felt to be unfair. The unions were reluctant to enter discussions about the individual evaluations, however, which they usually saw as an inappropriate task for union representatives.</p>
<p>Clear differences could still be noted between companies in the two sectors. In banking the potential for accumulating pay increases over time, by the same persons being nominated year on year, could eventually lead to substantial pay differentiation – although the range of individual variation had thus far remained limited. The IPP schemes in machinery would normally not allow for accumulation of such inequalities in individual wages since the sums available for differentiation were restricted and since several of the systems had caps defining maximum individual increases through IPP. Such measures were seen as necessary to gain acceptance among the rank and file members:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>We would never [have] got backing from the members [for this] without a cap on how much people can get. We in the union determine how much this is. And the cap was low enough to ensure membership acceptance when we had the vote.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Profit sharing bonuses (PSB)</italic> were, as mentioned, seen in a majority of the case companies. Management tended to emphasize that such systems were important means for communication and encouragement of identification with the company. Also trade union representatives conceded that they make employees more committed and interested in the economic results of the company and therefore more inclined to make an extra effort when needed. As the shop steward in one of the machinery companies stated: ‘We put down some serious efforts here when the deadlines are approaching.’ Both trade unions and management highlighted the simplicity of the bonus systems as a strength; no huge administration or monitoring is required, and all the employees can be included in the same scheme even if they have different pay systems. The interdependency between units in modern work organizations is also listed as an argument in favour of such all-embracing schemes – especially in the machinery sector. Both management and the union in the machinery company with the largest bonus meant that it was regarded as fair that all groups were part of the same bonus scheme, also contributing to improved relations between the shop floor and the administration. Still, according to both the trade unions and the HRM units, the direct, individual incentive effects of PSB are rather moderate, since no single employee is able to influence the economic results of the company or group.</p>
<p>The trade unions take, besides their priority on maintaining stable increases in basic pay, a strong position in favour of bonuses that are flat-rate and thereby also separate from other parts of the pay system where differentiation occurs. As expressed by one of the machinery shop stewards:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Management/they first suggested a model based on a certain percentage of the pay, where those with best wages would have got the highest bonuses. As we saw it, this was not solidarity. When we create a result together, we should share it equally. We got acceptance for this, so they changed the model.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In practice this principle means that the lowest paid will get the highest bonus payments (as percentage of basic pay) – but, as seen in recent years, parts of management and the administration are often part of other, more lucrative schemes in addition. A challenge for the unions connected with PSB systems is the potential trade-off between increases in fixed pay and annual bonuses. In the British system with only company wage setting, this has been an issue related both to profit- and productivity-based VPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X11408145">Marginson et al., 2008</xref>). There was however no evidence that the companies with the most generous PSB arrangements lagged behind the going fixed rate in the machinery sector, indicating that the PSB served as additional income there. Still unions in both sectors were very conscious of the potential trade-off between bonuses and consolidated pay, and were very intent on resisting management attempts to create such a linkage:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0143831X11408145">7</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote><p>When we decided to support the bonus arrangement, we made clear [to the employer] that the basic pay rates here should follow the same pace as the industry average. And so they have, wages here were 10–12 percent over the average when we started and they still are. (Shop steward in larger machinery sector company)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is plausible that generous bonus schemes, by serving as ventilation mechanisms, can curb the pressure from the rank and file members for additional wage compensation in extra good years. Allowing for extra compensation without committing the employer to pay out in subsequent years with less good results, such PSBs insert an element of pay flexibility – or a buffer – that both sides seem to appreciate, possibly also helping to stabilize development of wages and the collective bargaining system over the cycle.</p>
<p>Whereas the strong trade union involvement in design and regulation of IPP systems seemed to delimit differentiation, and PSBs usually pay out the same sum to all employees, <italic>the ad hoc bonuses</italic> (one-time payments) that were common in banking left more discretion to the line managers, often at rather decentralized level. The rationale behind such bonuses was mainly to furnish line managers with means to reward persons and teams that take on an extra effort or responsibility. Banking unions often accept this kind of ad hoc employer-driven bonus system as long as acceptable pay increases are secured through the ordinary channels of wage setting. However, both the union representatives at sector and company levels expressed concern that such bonuses could come at the expense of fixed pensionable pay increases; in several banks, the unions had therefore blankly refused to open up for one-time payments as an element of the annual pay revision. Still, such gratifications have become popular among especially the younger union members, as an appreciation of extra effort and job performance. The unions therefore try to find a proper balance between their long-term policy (shielding consolidated pay) and short-term considerations, allowing members to be rewarded through some extra individual bonus payments. As pointed out by the union representative in one of the large banks:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>One-off bonuses do not contribute to the future wage level, and that is why we don’t support them as an alternative to ordinary increases. When people retire they ought to have a decent pay, not just a beginner wage and a lot of one-off bonuses. . . . But as an extra appreciation, it’s OK.</p></disp-quote></p>

<title>4.4 Similar systems, different outcomes: Sector matters</title>
<p>What can the similarities and differences we have found between the banking and machinery sectors tell about the impact of national institutions vs sector-specific factors on the role of collective bargaining and trade unions in development of VPS? As shown, two main types of VPS were observed in both machinery and banking, notably IPP and profit bonuses, and their development and governance displayed clear common traits. As far as IPP systems affecting basic, consolidated pay were concerned, the trade unions were actively included in the introduction and design, and the content and governance of the schemes were anchored in collective agreements with safety clauses and complaint procedures. A certain convergence across the two sectors can thus be noted especially with respect to the role of collective agreements in framing local procedures and shaping actual developments. These similarities presumably reflect the impact of the common national institutional frameworks, where the two-tiered system of collective bargaining enables articulation between centrally agreed principles and local negotiations over the specific design and operation of VPS that affect basic pay.</p>
<p>At the same time the companies in the two sectors displayed clear differences with respect to the actual significance of VPS in local pay setting. Whereas individual performance-related schemes have become standard operating procedure in banking – determining all local development of basic pay – they are less widespread and more limited in impact in machinery where company bargaining still ensures equal, local increases in basic pay for all blue-collar workers. In addition, line managers in banking were allowed to use ad hoc bonuses with strong performance elements to grant quite substantial rewards to individuals or teams that somehow had distinguished themselves. More specifically, in <italic>machinery</italic> companies the development of VPS, related to tightly regulated IPP systems and collective, flat-rate profit bonuses, has apparently had minimal effect on the trade unions’ role in collective bargaining – mainly adding a third tier of individual bonuses on top of the wage increases bargained at sector and company levels. VPS schemes can be seen as a minor (and probably welcome) supplement to the collectively governed two-tier system of wage formation in the sector. In <italic>banking</italic>, the impact has been more ambiguous; the individualization of local increases of basic pay, together with the spread of profit sharing and ad hoc bonuses determined by management, imply that a much smaller proportion of pay is subject to direct trade union influence through collective bargaining than in machinery. However, for the trade union in the banks, where no local pay bargaining formerly existed, the centrally agreed introduction of company agreements accompanying the IPP system also opened new avenues for influencing the criteria and procedures for local pay increases. These changes can be seen as defensive trade union adjustments to management and employee-driven trends towards decentralization and individualization of pay – and the pay interview model clearly implied less direct union influence – but the changes reportedly also contributed to a certain vitalization of the local level of participation and trade unionism.</p>
<p>The differences in the impact of VPS and in trade union approaches between the two sectors can in our view partly be attributed to different traditions of industrial relations and trade unionism associated with sector differences in skills and occupational structures, and partly to interrelated differences in the product markets and the organization of work between customer-oriented services and manufacturing of goods. First, as to the legacy of industrial relations, company agreements in banking were not formally established before 2002, almost hundred years later than in the metal trades. While individual rewards have had a long tradition in banking, the less developed company level of collective bargaining has apparently enabled greater room for management development of ad hoc patterns of variable pay as well as a more individualist employee culture and weaker local unions than in machinery. Hence, the recent reforms of the system of pay and collective bargaining partly can be viewed as a codification, or institutionalization, of former practices that gradually had grown in importance in banking. When defensively trying to reign in such informal practices and support the individual employee, the banking unions evidently saw no other option than aiming for procedural, framework regulations as the available means to achieve some influence and order in local pay practices. In machinery, by contrast, where virtually no individualization of pay existed, the unions were in a much stronger bargaining position and chose to adopt a more restrictive approach. These contrasts can indeed be associated with the distinction between the rationale and identify of trade unionism among blue-collar workers and white-collar occupational groups identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143831X11408145">Scheuer (1986)</xref>, distinguishing between collectivist blue-collar and professional while-collar unionism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0143831X11408145">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Second, the impact of the variations in industrial relations and union traditions has apparently been reinforced by sectoral differences in product markets. Whereas workers in manufacturing of goods are part of a collective production process and normally have limited contact with the customers of the end-product, the shift from ‘tellers to sellers’ in banking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X11408145">Regini et al., 1999</xref>) – a trend also referred to in many of our interviews – means that the employees increasingly are measured by their sales and direct servicing of the individual customers, both individually and team-wise. Managers and union representatives alike thus referred to the importance of developing incentive and pay systems that reflect the increased emphasis on market- and customer-oriented performance and respond to changing perceptions of fair compensation among employees.</p>
<p>To sum up, while commonalities in the manner in which various kinds of VPS have been developed and governed can be seen in view of the common IR system both sectors are part of, the variations in the actual significance and impact of VPS between companies in the two sectors can in our opinion best be explained by the interplay between differences in institutional traditions, product market conditions and occupational composition.</p>

<title>5. Summary and conclusions</title>
<p>Since variable, performance-related pay has often been seen as a threat to the role of trade unions in collective wage setting and difficult to develop in the Norwegian context of industrial relations, the aim of this article was to discuss (1) how the trade unions and collective bargaining institutions have contributed to shaping VPS developments, and how the development of VPS has affected the role of trade unions in company pay setting. Comparing companies in blue-collar machinery production and white-collar banking services, (2) we further aimed to examine whether and how sector differences mattered in these respects.</p>
<p>The interplay between VPS and trade unions’ role in collective bargaining is indeed marked by a certain tension, but according to our study in 12 Norwegian companies the relationship is hardly antagonistic – and can, under certain conditions, be complementary. Even in contexts of high collective agreement coverage and strong trade unions, such as in banking and machinery, the development of VPS in our case companies has not been subject to much conflict between management and unions. As shown, VPS affecting basic pay are in all instances covered by company-level collective agreements, indicating that joint regulation of such schemes is a precondition for getting the trade unions and employees on board. Union involvement is most intense during the initial phase of design and implementation, but they remain engaged in monitoring, follow-up and revision of schemes, if necessary. Other kinds of VPS are in most companies also subject to consultation, exchange or other forms of labour voice, and the trade unions are pretty relaxed as long as it has to do with flat-rate bonuses or occasional payouts that come on top, and not instead of, basic pay growth.</p>
<p>Hence, contrary to expectations, the development of VPS has been fairly smoothly handled by the actors within, and with the help of, the established industrial relations institutions. The national institutions of collective bargaining and trade unionism have contributed to condition, shape and adjust the development of VPS to the reality of Norwegian industrial relations. The other way around, we found notable differences in the impact of introduction of VPS on the role of trade unions and local collective bargaining in the companies in the two sectors. In the machinery sector, the add-on of a tiny individual tier of variable pay in some cases, alongside flat-rate profit sharing bonuses, on top of the pay increases regulated by sector and company collective agreements, imply only minimal changes in the collective bargaining system and may, in fact, serve a stabilizing buffer function (ventilation) which allows for a certain upward pay flexibility during good times. In banking, where the collectively agreed IPP system spurred introduction of a two-tier collective bargaining system at the same time as proliferation of profit-based bonuses and ad hoc bonuses outside the sphere of collective bargaining during the bonanza reduced the direct impact of trade unions on actual pay, the effects have been more significant and ambiguous. The differences in the actual significance and impact of VPS across the two sectors can in our view be explained by the interplay between differences in industrial relations traditions, product market conditions and occupational composition between customer-oriented, white-collar services and blue-collar manufacturing of goods.</p>
<p>In a comparative, European perspective, our study suggests that for employers who are willing to include the workers and trade unions in developing VPS, the Norwegian system seems to provide conditions and mechanisms that actually are better suited for that purpose than the single employer bargaining system in UK and the dual system of sector agreements and local works councils in Austria and Spain. As spelled out in other articles from the project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11408145">Arrowsmith et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11408145">Nergaard et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11408145">Traxler et al., 2008</xref>), the main advantage of the Norwegian – or Nordic – model in this respect is the two-tier structure of collective agreements, providing a developed arena for company bargaining within a framework of sector agreements and single channel trade union representation. As shown also in other recent comparative studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X11408145">Due and Madsen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143831X11408145">Ilsøe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143831X11408145">Stokke, 2008</xref>), such institutional configurations tend to enable an extent of articulation between local and central trade unions that seems to enhance a level of trust and parity between the local actors that is more rarely seen in the other countries. By ensuring stable growth in basic pay and defining procedures and criteria for local negotiations over VPS, the sector agreements secure local trade union voice and predictable frameworks, relieving the local arena from much of the strain and conflict seen in the more adversarial, decentralized British context, while the single channel system enables more coherent labour approaches than in the countries with dual systems. It may thus seem that the Norwegian – or Nordic – systems are better equipped to govern the dynamics of decentralization and differentiation of pay and incentive systems than their continental and British counterparts. As indicated by developments in the Norwegian banks, it remains to be seen, though, whether the local trade union representatives will have capacity to handle the growing complexity of rewarding performance and ensuring justice in pay systems at the revitalized company level of industrial relations.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this study, we chose to apply a broad understanding of variable pay systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11408145">Traxler et al., 2008</xref>), basically including elements of pay that differ from ‘standard’ (‘fixed’) pay and are based on a relationship between the actual pay that an employee receives and individual or collective performance measured in terms of either quantitative criteria (production output, sales, economic results, etc.) or qualitative criteria (effort, skills, attitudes, quality of work, etc.). Variable pay can include both performance-based elements of remuneration that are permanently added to an individual’s fixed pay (consolidated and pensionable increases) and one-off payments that are not consolidated (and sometimes not involving earning of pension rights).</p></fn>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-0143831X11408145">
<label>3.</label>
<p>In the four sector associations (both sides in banking and the machinery sector), interviews were carried out with representatives who were in charge of collective bargaining and pay policies (one or two persons in each of the sector-level associations).</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0143831X11408145">
<label>4.</label>
<p>At company level, interviews were mostly made with managers in charge of HRM, in some cases also with line managers or bank managers, and on the trade union side we met with the local shop stewards. In the larger banks we interviewed trade union representatives at both company and branch office levels. All together 18 interviews were made. One to two persons participated in each interview. Trade union representatives and managers were interviewed separately in all but one of the companies.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-0143831X11408145">
<label>5.</label>
<p>Within banking our cases most probably represent typical Norwegian banks in the categories, whereas the machinery companies with certain types of VPS (IPP) for blue-collar workers were considered much rarer and can probably be regarded more as pioneer test-cases than as average Norwegian companies within this sector.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-0143831X11408145">
<label>6.</label>
<p>The sector agreement does not allow the company-level parties to enter agreements on the size of this economic framework.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-0143831X11408145">
<label>7.</label>
<p>The only exception to this was a machinery company in which the union, as a result of a major crisis, had agreed to refrain from the local annual wage increment and instead accept a bonus if the economic objectives were achieved.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-0143831X11408145">
<label>8.</label>
<p>In this respect, it is notable that the pay systems of white-collar employees in machinery reportedly had much in common with those in banking, calling for further studies of the interrelations between occupational and sectoral variations in reward systems.</p></fn>
