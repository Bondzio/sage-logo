<abstract>
<p>Persons with visual impairment have consistently shown a preference for one alternative reading format over another, often because of factors outside their control. This study adopted survey research design to investigate alternative format preferences among secondary school visually impaired students, focusing on Southwestern Nigeria. Using total enumeration technique, data were gathered from 123 students from six purposively selected secondary schools through the use of a questionnaire and an interview schedule with reliability scores (α = 0.77) and (α = 0.75) respectively. Interviews were carried out with 104 (84.5%) visually impaired students. The study found that talking books/audio recordings were the most preferred format (53%) – 51% for blind and 55% for partially sighted students respectively. Reasons for talking book preference include ease of understanding and playback, time savings, teacher’s ineptitude, difficulty and volume of Braille materials. The study recommends collaboration of libraries and other stakeholders in improving talking book collectieons, provision of digital talking books, Braille literacy and a national strategy for training of Braille teachers and Braillists.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The visually impaired in Nigeria have been classified into the blind, partially sighted and low visioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961000611435139">Abosi and Ozoji, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961000611435139">Mba, 1995</xref>). This classification is consistent with those in almost all countries (Harris, 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961000611435139">Mason et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The visually impaired in Nigeria, being mostly uneducated, are faced with the challenges of dependence and isolation from the educational, social and cultural life of the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961000611435139">Obani, 2002</xref>) despite Nigeria’s National Policy on Education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961000611435139">1997</xref>, revised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961000611435139">1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961000611435139">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961000611435139">2004</xref>) which provided for the education of those with special needs generally, and the education of the visually impaired in particular. This has encouraged the establishment of special schools and the mainstreaming of visually impaired children in regular schools in some states in Nigeria. The establishment of special schools has been regrettably restricted to primary schools while secondary education for visually impaired children in Nigeria comes in a mixed form (visually impaired children mixed with the sighted in regular schools).</p>
<p>The educational space for the visually impaired in Nigeria is limited and grossly inadequate. Children and young people with disabilities, who ironically have the greatest need for education, are amongst the least likely to receive it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961000611435139">Hegarty, 1990</xref>). Unlike sighted persons, the visually impaired receive information and study materials in alternative formats such as Braille, talking book/audio recording and large print. Secondary schools with visually impaired students in Nigeria also strive to provide information materials or reading materials in these formats. These materials provide the opportunity for these students to read and communicate like sighted students. However, materials are usually not available in quantities desirable for the visually impaired students. Visually impaired students in Nigerian secondary schools depend on charities and philanthropists to provide them with information materials. Parents and families of these students are mostly poor and therefore cannot afford the facilities to help their education. Students themselves make private and individual arrangements for study materials. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961000611435139">Atinmo (2002)</xref>, there is an acute shortage of reading materials in alternative formats in Nigerian schools.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Pacelli School for the blind and partially sighted, a Roman Catholic primary school in Lagos, Nigeria, provides information materials at the primary school level. In addition, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and private associations also make information materials available to persons with visual impairment. Notable among these are Nigerwives, an association of foreign women married to Nigerian men, the Anglo-Nigerian Welfare Association for the Blind (ANWAB), the Nigerian Society for the Blind, Hope for the Blind, Gindiri Material Centre for the Blind and similar organisations and associations around the country.</p>
<p>Nigerwives and ANWAB have, over the years, been using computerized Braille facilities for the transcription of materials into alternative formats at their libraries in Lagos. They have been making available reading texts for primary and secondary school students. ANWAB in particular has to some extent made reading and audio texts for learning and work available to some tertiary level students and blind workers. ANWAB has an extensive library of Braille and audio-recorded books. Both organisations act as producers and distributors of reading materials to those with visual impairment. They also exchange master copies of Brailled materials, to avoid duplication. The Nigerian Society for the Blind has a large collection of Brailled materials and talking books. It has a library with the full complement of a recording studio and other facilities needed in a standard library for the visually impaired. This library caters for the needs of those in vocational rehabilitation centres and others who were accidentally blinded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961000611435139">Atinmo, 2002</xref>). Some state libraries, in Oyo, Imo and Abia states for instance, make available readable materials for persons with visual impairment in some secondary schools. They do not produce materials in Braille, however, so they are more of distributors of information materials. However their efforts are minimal, relative to the needs of persons with visual impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961000611435139">Atinmo, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Visually impaired students have been known to have a preference for using one alternative format over the other. While some have argued that Braille is the only tenable means for literacy and communication, others have viewed audio materials as easier to use and move around than Braille. Several other reasons are responsible for the students’ preference for alternative materials as a means of reading and study. This has implications for information provision in terms of access to and availability of materials as well as the reading interests and information needs of the visually impaired.</p>

<sec id="section2-0961000611435139">
<title>The problem</title>
<p>As indicated above, visually impaired persons generally, and particularly those in schools, have consistently shown a preference for reading materials in different formats e.g. Braille, talking books or audio recording and large print. In Nigeria, this primarily depends on the nature of visual impairment of those making such preferences. However, preference for using a reading format in recent times may have been consequent upon factors outside the control of the visually impaired students themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611435139">Adetoro, 2005</xref>). It is strongly believed that the use of reading materials in alternative formats may have been shaped by factors relating to teaching staff, the school system and the environment. Teachers’ mastery of formats, ill-equipped schools and the attitude of government and society in providing adequate attention to the visually impaired probably explains why visually impaired students prefer one format over the other as a means of reading and study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961000611435139">Adetoro, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961000611435139">Atinmo, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Objectives of the study</title>
<p>The general objective of the study is to investigate alternative format preference among visually impaired students in secondary schools in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The specific objectives of the study are to:</p>
<list id="list1-0961000611435139" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>determine the alternative format preferred for reading and study by visually impaired students in secondary schools;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>compare the alternative formats preferred by blind and partially sighted students;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>find out the reasons for the preference for each alternative format for reading and study purposes.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0961000611435139">
<title>Literature review</title>
<p>There is empirical evidence pointing to preference for all the alternative formats as a means of reading and study for visually impaired persons generally and visually impaired students specifically. Casey (1983) examined user satisfaction among visually impaired persons and found that the great majority of visually impaired persons in Ohio preferred books recorded on tapes for reading. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961000611435139">Bruce et al. (1991)</xref> reported that 48% of blind and partially sighted adults in the United Kingdom (UK) read print material with aids, 24% preferred large print, 1% personal reader, 13% preferred reading on tape and 1% preferred Braille for reading. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961000611435139">Annichiarico (1994)</xref> found that Braille is the most preferred reading format in Israel while in an assessment of large print use in Netherlands, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961000611435139">Schols (1995)</xref> reported that the partially sighted who preferred reading in large print were considerable in number. He argued that the high preference for large print can be attributed to the aging population, which has resulted in a rise in the number of elderly people and concomitantly in the frailties associated with old age such as poor vision.</p>
<p>A preference for recorded materials on tape was, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435139">Hatlen (1996)</xref>, because individuals who lost their sight through the aging process may never master Braille and they will, in all probability enjoy their remaining years listening to talking books. Also, children with multiple/complex disabilities are confined to learning by listening as their physical disabilities may preclude their ability to write Braille (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611435139">Hatlen, 1996</xref>). Studies including those by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961000611435139">Elissalde (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961000611435139">Johnson (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961000611435139">Ryles (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961000611435139">Schroeder (1996)</xref>, have evidence for the usefulness of the Braille code as an impactful format. Preference for Braille appears to be on the decline in favour of talking books/audio materials in many countries, however.</p>
<p>In the UK, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961000611435139">Chartres (1998)</xref> found that talking books/tape recording was the preferred reading format of most visually impaired persons while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961000611435139">Davies et al. (2001)</xref> found that 83% of persons who were blind and partially sighted preferred tape recordings. A mere 3% of the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB) users read Braille while 4% of the National Library for the Blind (NLB) users read Braille (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961000611435139">Davies et al., 2001</xref>). In Israel, 3.9% were found to prefer Braille, according to a study on the Central Library for the Blind, Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961000611435139">Getz, 2003</xref>). Getz further revealed that the majority of the readers of talking books are visually impaired persons who generally have no other way to read unless they read Braille. About 5% prefer to read computer disks, 3.8% prefer their reading material in large print, 14% in standard print and 13% on recorded tapes. Almost 46% of blind and partially sighted persons aged 60 and above read seven or more large print materials every month and 30% read about 13 or more large print items each month (Harris, 2005). In Nigeria, the poor quality of teachers and the commonplace nature of listening and talking devices, especially among students, have also brought talking books/audio materials to the fore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611435139">Adetoro, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In spite of the foregoing literature indicating student preferences, it is important for students in schools to be flexible and not rigid in their preference for a particular format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0961000611435139">Tuttle, 1996</xref>). It is also pertinent for the students to understand the importance of Braille as probably the only medium of literacy and communication recognized by the IFLA/UNESCO manifesto for public libraries serving the visually impaired.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>The study adopted a survey research design and the population of the study was made up of all visually impaired secondary school students in Southwestern Nigeria. In Nigeria, a few secondary schools admit visually impaired persons as students alongside sighted students as there are no secondary schools specifically meant for visually impaired students. A preliminary investigation by the author puts the number of secondary schools with visually impaired students in Southwestern Nigeria at six. These schools were purposively chosen for the study because they have an appreciable number of visually impaired students and information materials in alternative formats. The schools have a total population of 123 students who are visually impaired (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961000611435139">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Total enumeration technique was used to cover all the 123 visually impaired students in the six schools. Data were gathered using a questionnaire and interviews. The questionnaire elicited information on the background of respondents, preference for alternative formats and reasons for such preferences. The interview was based on a prepared interview schedule which probed the reasons for the student’s preference for a specific alternative format for leisure and study purposes. The validity of instruments was achieved through expert advice while their reliability came through pre-tests of the instruments to visually impaired students at the Federal College of Education (special) Oyo who were not part of the study. The questionnaire and interview schedule both obtained a reliability score of α = 0.77 and α = 0.75 respectively. The questionnaire was read to the respondents and their responses were noted directly on the questionnaire. This was followed by interview sessions in each of the schools. Of 123 respondents, the researcher and his assistants were able to administer correctly and interview a total of 104 visually impaired students which represents an 84.5% response rate.</p>

<title>Preference for alternative formats for reading and study by secondary school visually impaired students</title>
<p>The study found that talking books or audio materials was the alternative format most preferred by the visually impaired students for reading and study purposes – 55 (53%) respondents. Braille materials were also desired by the visually impaired students in the schools – 46 (44.2%) respondents. It was made evident in this study that large print was not a preferred format for reading among visually impaired secondary school students in Nigeria; 3 (2.9%) wanted large print. It is pertinent to add that large print for the visually impaired is hard to find in libraries in Nigeria.

<title>Reasons for preference of alternative format by visually impaired students</title>
<p>Interview sessions were conducted with the students in each of the six schools in order to ascertain why they preferred specific alternative format for reading and study. The interviews showed that the majority of the students preferred talking books/audio recorded materials. There was a general agreement among the visually impaired students that talking books were preferred for the following reasons:</p>
<list id="list2-0961000611435139" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Talking books ensure better understanding, given the right diction and style of reading;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There is ease of play back for audio recordings;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It saves time and reduces the stress of learning Braille;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Many teachers in the schools have not been helping Braille literacy adequately;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Braille materials are difficult to learn, it is time consuming, voluminous and not portable;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Braille encourages dependence on sighted persons.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>For instance, students commented:
<disp-quote>
<p>after each class work, we have to Braille our notes ourselves with the help of our sighted friends who read their notes and we type in Braille… without them we can’t prepare our notes…</p>
<p>we rely on our sighted mates for almost everything in school and sometimes they do not cooperate….</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Those who preferred Braille argued that:</p>
<list id="list3-0961000611435139" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Braille helps reading in the real sense rather than listening;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There is room for gradual improvement in reading through Braille;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Braille helps to improve spellings.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The above statements were supported by quotes from participants:
<disp-quote>
<p>with Braille you are actually reading like sighted people … you may forget what you hear, you do not always forget what you read, you can always go back and read it.</p>
<p>I am able to spell words when I read Braille … one can improve on one’s spelling and reading in a progressive way and learn at one’s pace.</p>
<p>Braille will allow you to learn step by step.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The three respondents who preferred large print were partially sighted and their preference was based on the claim that they could still read large print adequately. However, they lamented the paucity of large print in libraries, schools and institutions for the visually impaired in Nigeria.</p>

<title>Discussion of findings</title>
<p>Although the majority of the students were 20 years old and below, a sizeable number of them were older teenagers which suggests that visual impairment slows the educational progression of sufferers in many African settings. It also corroborates the high percentage of visually impaired students in this study who became visually impaired at primary school.</p>
<p>This study has shown that few visually impaired students are in school in Nigeria. The educational space for the visually impaired is limited. In effect, society and decision makers have connived to limit the educational opportunities for visually impaired children in Nigeria. For instance, at the primary level, schools for the visually impaired are terribly few and most are too weak to provide meaningful educational services. In Southwest Nigeria, this study could identify six schools with teachers, facilities and information resources capable of adequately supporting the education of the visually impaired at the secondary level.</p>
<p>Talking books or audio recordings were the preferred format for reading by the visually impaired students in the schools. This conforms to the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961000611435139">Annichiarico (1994)</xref> in a study of blind partially sighted children and young people. The study also showed an appreciable level of preference for Braille by the students. There has always been the argument in favour of a preference for Braille (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961000611435139">Johnson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961000611435139">Ryles, 1996</xref>) as a useful medium for literacy and communication. Large print was not a preferred format and this could be due to its scarcity in libraries, schools and other institutions servicing the visually impaired in Nigeria. As expected, the majority of visually impaired students who preferred Braille were totally blind and those who preferred talking books and large print were partially sighted. The data further revealed that more of the totally blind respondents actually preferred talking books while the majority of partially sighted students also preferred talking books. In effect, more of the blind and partially sighted respondents preferred talking books to Braille. This is clearly an indication of a declining preference for Braille as a reading format for visually impaired students in schools and to a great extent, visually impaired persons generally. This is consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961000611435139">Annichiarico (1994)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961000611435139">Chartres (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961000611435139">Kirchner (1998)</xref> who all identified the decline of Braille use by visually impaired persons in the United States. To further lend credence to the above, studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961000611435139">Epp (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961000611435139">Davies et al. (2001)</xref> also reported that talking books/audio recordings were more frequently utilized than Braille by students in Canada and the UK respectively.</p>
<p>A sizable number of students who preferred Braille were partially sighted. This could be because Braille materials are in much greater numbers than other formats in schools and the partially sighted students could be stating a preference for what is available. Some partially sighted persons in Nigeria have shown genuine interest in Braille and have become excellent Braille users. The preference for talking books in this study could be a consequence of factors which may be outside the direct control of the students. For instance, the respondents in this study revealed that their reasons for preferring talking books was because it brings about better understanding, they are easy to use or playback, it saves time and it reduces stress of having to learn Braille/Braille reading. It is important to note that those students who argued in support of talking books against Braille also felt that teachers had not really helped them to learn Braille adequately. They also contended that Braille is difficult to learn, is time consuming, voluminous, not easily portable and encourages dependence. Those who preferred Braille reasoned that it allows them to also read in the real sense of it, rather than listening. Their view was that improvement in reading, spelling and learning is ensured through Braille. These, coupled with scholars believing that Braille is the only means for the visual impaired to achieve literacy are some of the points to consider in favour of Braille (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961000611435139">Atinmo, 2000</xref>). There are few large print items in Nigerian libraries and other institutions and those who preferred it have to contend with the reality that producers of alternative format in Nigeria seem to have done very little in the area of large print materials production for the partially sighted in Nigeria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961000611435139">Adetoro, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study has brought to the fore the increasing preference for talking books or audio recordings as a format of readability among visually impaired students in Nigerian schools. Though the love for Braille still persists, this study clearly suggests a growing preference for talking books/audio recordings as against Braille, a situation probably accentuated by inept teaching and negative attitudes of teachers towards Braille literacy as well as an acute shortage of Braille teachers and Braillists in Nigerian schools, among other factors. That more blind students also prefer talking books to Braille means that there is an urgent need for improvement in Braille teaching and material production for Nigerian schools. The argument of students who preferred Braille gives the impression of the need for an improved talking book and large print collection in school libraries in terms of quality and quantity for the use of visually impaired students.</p>

<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>First and foremost, schools with visually impaired students in Nigeria should collaborate with NGOs to improve talking book collections covering a variety of subject areas. The record of NGO partnership with libraries for the provision of alternative formats for the visually impaired in Nigeria is impressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961000611435139">Atinmo, 2007</xref>). Braille literacy is a necessity for any visually impaired person. It is a means of communication leading to interactive activities with the sighted world. There is the need for Braille literacy campaigns in schools with visually impaired students and with other stakeholders so as to reverse the apathy towards Braille. Shortage of Braillists and incompetent Braille teachers should be addressed through a national strategy on the part of government, NGOs and training institutions to train and retrain teachers and Braillists using computerized methods. These will improve and help sustain students Braille literacy competency.</p>
