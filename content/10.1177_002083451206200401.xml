<p>62.4232 ABBOTT, Kenneth W. — <bold>Engaging the public and the private in global sustainability governance.</bold> <italic>International Affairs</italic> 88(3), May 2012: 543–564.</p>
<p>Negotiators preparing for Rio+20 are missing an important opportunity. Private sustainability governance (PSG) is thriving: organizations created by business and civil society groups, as well as public-private partnerships, adopt and apply significant regulatory standards and undertake valuable operational activities, including pilot projects and financing. However, even though reforming the institutional framework for sustainable development is a central part of the Rio+20 agenda, negotiators are focusing almost exclusively on inter-governmental organizations such as the UN Environment Program (UNEP), the Commission for Sustainable Development and the Economic and Social Council. This public-private engagement gap isolates international governance from the energy and innovation of PSG, and impedes efforts to coordinate the bifurcated and decentralized system of sustainability governance. States, and especially international organizations, should actively support PSG as part of the institutional framework for sustainable development.

<p>62.4233 ABOBOAIE, Cristina — <bold>Cercetarea terorismului international: abordare ortodoxĂ sau studiul critic? (Investigating international terrorism: the orthodox approach or critical theory?).</bold> <italic>Sfera Politicii</italic> 164, Oct. 2011: 77–86.</p>
<p>This study examines the epistemological, ontological, methodological and ethical challenges that the researchers of the new current of critical study of terrorism, raise to traditional research. The study begins with the presentation of the orthodox theory of terrorism and its weaknesses, as they are captured by critical theory, which stresses the need for a new research agenda. The author recognizes that both approaches are valuable. The controversies are a source of progress for the real and deep knowledge of international terrorism.

<p>62.4234 ABRAHMS, Max — <bold>The political effectiveness of terrorism revisited.</bold> <italic>Comparative Political Studies</italic> 45(3), March 2012: 366–393.</p>
<p>Terrorists attack civilians to coerce their governments into making political concessions. Does this strategy work? To empirically assess the effectiveness of terrorism, the author exploits variation in the target-selection of 125 violent substate campaigns. The results show that terrorist campaigns against civilian targets are significantly less effective than guerrilla campaigns against military targets at inducing government concessions. The negative political effect of terrorism is evident across logit model specifications after carefully controlling for tactical confounds. Drawing on political psychology, the author concludes with a theory to account for why governments resist compliance when their civilians are targeted. [R]</p>
<p>62.4235 AGUIAR-CONRARIA, Luís; MAGALHÃES, Pedro C.; SOARES, Maria Joana — <bold>Cycles in politics: wavelet analysis of political time series.</bold> <italic>American Journal of Political Science</italic> 56(2), Apr. 2012: 500–518.</p>
<p>Spectral analysis and ARMA models have been the most common weapons of choice for the detection of cycles in political time-series. Controversies about cycles, however, tend to revolve around an issue that both techniques are badly equipped to address: the possibility of irregular cycles without fixed periodicity throughout the entire time-series. This has led to two main consequences. On the one hand, proponents of cyclical theories have often dismissed established statistical techniques. On the other hand, proponents of established techniques have dismissed the possibility of cycles without fixed periodicity. We present the tools of wavelet-analysis and apply them to the study of two lingering puzzles in the political science literature: the existence of cycles in election returns in the US and in the severity of major power wars.

<p>62.4236 AHLQUIST, John S.; WIBBELS, Erik — <bold>Riding the wave: world trade and factor-based models of democratization.</bold> <italic>American Journal of Political Science</italic> 56(2), Apr. 2012: 447–464.</p>
<p>Studies of “waves” of regime-change, in which large numbers of countries experience similar political transitions at roughly similar periods of time, have fallen from favor. Replacing the “third wave” arguments are several competing models relating domestic social structure—specifically, the distribution of income and factor ownership—to regime type. If any of these distributive models of regime type is correct, then global trade has an important explanatory role to play. As world trade expands and contracts, countries with similar labor endowments should experience similar regime pressures at the same time. We propose a novel empirical specification that addresses the endogeneity and data-quality problems plaguing previous efforts to examine these arguments. We investigate the conditional impact of the global trading system on democratic transitions across 130 years and all of the states in the international system. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.4237 AITKEN, Mhairi — <bold>Changing climate, changing democracy: a cautionary tale.</bold> <italic>Environmental Politics</italic> 21(2), March 2012: 211–229.</p>
<p>Climate change has come to hold a central position within many policy arenas. However, a particular framing of climate change and climate science, underpinned by modernist assumptions, dominates policy discourse. This leads to restricted policy responses reflecting particular interests and socio-political imaginaries. There is little public debate concerning this framing or the assumptions underpinning approaches to climate policy. The implications of this are illustrated by considering the ways in which UK planning policy has adapted to reflect commitments to mitigate climate change. It is shown that the importance attributed to climate change mitigation has had negative impacts on democratic involvement in planning processes. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.5238]</p>
<p>62.4238 AKMAN, Ayhan — <bold>Beyond the objectivist conception of civil society: social actors, civility and self-limitation.</bold> <italic>Political Studies</italic> 60(2), June 2012: 321–340.</p>
<p>This article first sketches the anatomy of the dominant perspective on civil society (which I call “objectivist”) by discussing its basic postulates. Second, I highlight the main problems immanent to this conception. I demonstrate the presence of certain blind spots, erasures and contradictions which are constitutive of this dominant understanding. I argue for the need not so much to reject it outright but to try to transcend it by incorporating it in a wider and more encompassing framework. [Finally,] I propose an alternative conception of civil society based upon the orientations of social actors. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.4239 ALBERT, Craig Douglas — <bold>Defining our terms: bringing rigour to ethnic studies.</bold> <italic>Politics</italic> 32(2), June 2012: 70–76.</p>
<p>For decades, political scientists have grappled with the role identity has played in ethnic conflict. Surprisingly, these scholars have been unsuccessful in rigorously conceptualizing some key terms in the field of ethnic studies. How can the causal forces of ethnic strife be unraveled if scholars cannot even agree on the meanings of essential concepts? This article carefully delineates the differences between ethnicity, ethnic groups and ethnic group identity, while showing the conceptual mistakes of some of the field's leading scholars. Often treated synonymously, these concepts are quite distinct: ignoring this not only makes for sloppy scholarship, but has grave policy consequences. [R]</p>
<p>62.4240 ALCAÑIZ, Isabella — <bold>Democratization and multilateral security.</bold> <italic>World Politics</italic> 64(2), Apr. 2012: 306–340.</p>
<p>This article argues that democratic transitions increase the incentives of states to cooperate in multilateral security and that this is observable in the rate at which new democracies ratify international treaties of arms control, nuclear nonproliferation, and disarmament. New democrats seek a positive international reputation as an insurance mechanism against future regime reversals. By becoming “good citizens” of the global system, newly elected democratic leaders seek to expose potential conspirators to the possibility of diplomatic and economic sanctions if they were to attempt to reverse the transition. Using original data on the ratification rates of 201 states for twenty major arms-control, nonproliferation, and disarmament treaties, the study shows conclusively that new democracies outpace older democracies and all autocracies in committing to multilateral security.

<p>62.4241 ALIGICA, Paul D.; TARKO, Vlad — <bold>Polycentricity: from Polanyi to Ostrom, and beyond.</bold> <italic>Governance</italic> 25(2), Apr. 2012: 237–262.</p>
<p>The article overviews and elaborates the concept of polycentricity, defined as a structural feature of social systems of many decision centers having limited and autonomous prerogatives and operating under an overarching set of rules. The article introduces the concept as it was advanced by M. Polanyi and developed by E. and V. Ostrom. It introduces possible instances of polycentricity as well as related notions, to further elaborate the concept through a concept design approach that systematically applies the logic of necessary and sufficient conditions. It argues that the polycentricity conceptual framework is not only a robust analytical structure for the study of complex social phenomena, but is also a challenging method of drawing non<italic>-ad hoc</italic> analogies between different types of self-organizing complex social systems.

<p>62.4242 ALIMI, Eitan Y.; HIRSCH-HOEFLER, Sivan — <bold>Structure of political opportunities and threats, and movement-countermovement interaction in segmented composite regimes.</bold> <italic>Comparative Politics</italic> 44(3), Apr. 2012: 331–350.</p>
<p>How do changes in the structure of political opportunities and threats shape movement-countermovement interaction in composite regimes where different groups within the population are divided along ethnonational lines? In cases where one movement is structurally disadvantaged and the other is structurally advantaged, valuable theoretical insights into movement-countermovement interaction can be generated. Employing the case of the Palestinian and Jewish settler movements during the 1987–1992 Intifada, three theoretical propositions are critically examined as they relate to how changes in the structure of political opportunities and threats influence the emergence and endurance of movement-countermovement interaction, the strategy and tactics of both movements, and the internal dynamics within each.

<p>62.4243 ALLOUCHE, Jeremy; NICOL, Alan; MEHTA, Lyla — <bold>Water security: towards the human securitization of water?</bold> <italic>Whitehead Journal of Diplomacy and International Relations</italic> 12(1), Winter-Spring 2011: 153–171.</p>
<p>An assessment of the existing understandings and meanings of water-security realities is necessary in order to analyze their role in contexts ranging from water and food security to water and health debates. The historical evolution of the concept of security from the end of the Cold War to the current period provides the necessary context for an evaluation of the ways in which different uses of water suggest particular understanding and meaning of security. Furthermore, various definitions of security and water uses are used in the wider paradigmatic “competition” over definitions of water security. The emerging human securitization of water has many implications for global processes including rights-based approaches to development, consumer awareness, and collective action on climate change.

<p>62.4244 ALMENDARES, Nicholas — <bold>Blame-shifting, judicial review, and public welfare.</bold> <italic>Journal of Law and Politics</italic> 27(2), Winter 2012: 239–322.</p>
<p>On the conventional account, blame-shifting is thought to enable policies that make the public worse off, allowing for more special-interest legislation that benefits a select group at the public's expense, which has led to calls for a strengthened non-delegation doctrine to bar the sorts of delegations that make blame-shifting possible. I argue that the conventional account of blame-shifting is founded on inconsistent premises. In its place, I propose a reconstructed account of delegation where such broad delegations of policy-making authority are part of a strategy that allows the public to take advantage of the agency's expertise. While something resembling blame-shifting can occur within this reconstructed account, these broad delegations of authority overall make the public better off. Contrary to the conventional account, then, I find little reason to institute a stricter non-delegation doctrine. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.4245 ANDREWS, David M. — <bold>The rise and fall of EU studies in the USA.</bold> <italic>Journal of European Public Policy</italic> 19(5), 2012: 755–775.</p>
<p>This article employs original data to assess the development of EU studies as practiced by political scientists in the US. Several challenges to the conventional wisdom result. EU studies has not been a boom field in the US: it is in decline both with respect to developments in Europe and in absolute terms. Fewer US scholars self-identify as EU experts now than a decade ago, and leading US journals of international relations devoted less space to integration topics in the first decade of the 21st c. than during the 1970s. It is true that EU studies has become more professionalized over the past 30 years, developing its own journals and conferences—as is also true of most other academic subfields. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.4246 ARCENEAUX, Kevin — <bold>Cognitive biases and the strength of political arguments.</bold> <italic>American Journal of Political Science</italic> 56(2), Apr. 2012: 271–285.</p>
<p>Competition in political debate is not always sufficient to neutralize the effects of political rhetoric on public opinion. Yet little is known about the factors that shape the persuasiveness of political arguments. I consider whether cognitive biases influence the perceived strength of political arguments, making some arguments more persuasive than others. Lessons from neurobiology and recent political psychology research on emotion lead to the expectation that individuals are more likely to be persuaded by political arguments that evoke loss aversion via a fearful response—even in the face of a counterargument. Evidence from two experiments corroborates this expectation. I consider the normative implications of these empirical findings and potential avenues for future research. [R]</p>
<p>62.4247 ARDELEAN, Ben-Oni — <bold>Religious freedom ethic's dimensions: individual vs. communitarian.</bold> <italic>Sfera Politicii</italic> 161, July 2011: 21–29.</p>
<p>Vivid debates have happened in recent years on the subject of religious freedom ethics. The political correctness attitude has often become a coercion instrument for suppressing communitarian interests, instituting a minority tyranny that reduced the communitarian interests to silence. This might also create a disproportional representation in society for communitarian religious interests. The question is: whose religious interests should prevail? Should there be more guarantees given by the governments for the long existing, larger, and traditional religious groups, compare with the guarantees provided for the newer and smaller religious groups? Those questions provide a glimpse of the existing tension in the society on the subject of religious freedom. The present paper seeks to answer these types of questions, explaining the tension and giving possible answers from a religious freedom normative approach.

<p>62.4248 ART, David — <bold>What do we know about authoritarianism after ten years?</bold> <italic>Comparative Politics</italic> 44(3), Apr. 2012: 351–374.</p>
<p>The study of authoritarian regimes has become one of the hottest subfields in comparative politics over the last decade. The books covered in this review take up the critical questions of how authoritarian regimes are created and maintained. While this research program has profitably opened up the black box of authoritarian polities and taken their institutions seriously, there has been an asymmetric attention to the quasi-democratic features of these regimes—such as political parties and legislatures—at the expense of their coercive ones. Future work in this area would do well to address this imbalance, as well as to provide richer explanations of how institutions matter and better evidence of their effects. [R]</p>
<p>62.4249 ASHE, Fidelma — <bold>Harnessing political theory to facilitate students' engagement with graduate “employability”: a critical pyramid approach.</bold> <italic>Politics</italic> 32(2), June 2012: 129–137.</p>
<p>Both the business sector and government have claimed that there is a skills-deficit among graduates in the UK. Universities are now under increasing pressure to develop graduate “employability” strategies to improve the stock and quality of graduates' generic skills. Critical subject communities have been skeptical of an employability agenda that frames graduate employment solely around notions of personal career development and planning. This article discusses the intellectual and pedagogical debates that have surrounded the employability agenda in higher education. It details a critical pedagogical approach to graduate employment that was developed through a project funded by the Higher Education Academy's Subject Center for Sociology, Anthropology and Politics.

<p>62.4250 ASHWORTH, Lucian M. — <bold>The poverty of paradigms: subcultures, trading zones and the case of liberal socialism in interwar International Relations.</bold> <italic>International Relations</italic> 26(1), March 2012: 35–59.</p>
<p>In “Beware of false prophets: biology, human nature and the future of International Relations theory”, [<italic>International Affairs</italic>, 82(3), 2006: 493–510; <italic>Abstr.</italic> 57.1487], D. Bell argued that the work of P. Galison in the history of science could be usefully applied to the study of the history of IR. I take up Bell's challenge, claiming that Galison's post-Kuhnian history of science approach can be used both to understand the history of IR and to replace the ultimately confusing notion of “paradigm” in the study of IR theory. Galison's method of using “microhistories” to explore the workings of “subcultures” in science is applied to the case study of liberal socialism in interwar IR. Through this case, I argue that microhistories can help us understand why certain subcultures in IR theory thrive, and others decline. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.4251 BALAS, Alexandru; OWSIAK, Andrew P.; DIEHL, Paul F. — <bold>Demanding peace: the impact of prevailing conflict on the shift from peacekeeping to peacebuilding.</bold> <italic>Peace and Change</italic> 37(2), Apr. 2012: 195–226.</p>
<p>Once the Cold War ended, the international community expanded the mandates given to its peace operations. Traditional thinking suggests that this trend occurred because of an increase in the number and a shift in the type of conflicts prevalent in the international system. This “demand-side” explanation argues that as predominant conflict in the system changes from interstate to intrastate, the tasks shift accordingly from traditional peacekeeping to peace-building. [However], no systematic studies empirically test its validity. Considering conflict and peace operation patterns since 1945, we analyze whether conflict occurrence, conflict type, negotiated agreements, and international intervention changed fundamentally after the Cold War. We find that the greatest support for this demand-side argument comes from the proliferation of negotiated agreements that terminate conflicts, in which disputants often request peace-building assistance.

<p>International policies often make the conferral of aid, debt-relief or trading opportunities to a country depend on its having successfully implemented specific policies, known as conditionality arrangements, e.g., respecting human rights. Many objections advanced against such arrangements are unconvincing, and the possible benefits of human rights conditionality are sufficient to warrant serious intellectual and practical exploration.</p>
<p>62.4253 BASHIR, Bashir — <bold>Reconciling historical injustices: deliberative democracy and the politics of reconciliation.</bold> <italic>Res Publica (Journal of Legal and Social Philosophy)</italic> 18(2), Summer 2012: 127–143.</p>
<p>This article explores the ability of J. Habermas's theory of deliberative democracy to accommodate the demands of historically excluded social groups in democratic plural societies. It argues that the inclusive, transformative, and empowering potential of his theory falters when confronted with particular types of historical injustices. The historical dimension of longstanding injustices gives rise to a set of distinctive demands, such as collective memory of exclusion, acknowledgement of historical injustices, taking responsibility, and offering apology and reparations for causing these injustices, which go beyond the type of democratic inclusion that is often offered by deliberative democracy. Yet, it remains a valuable basis for forward-looking political decision-making. In order to achieve inclusive, empowering and transformative deliberation in consolidated democracies that have experienced historical injustices, the politics of reconciliation is indispensable.

<p>We present a legislative bargaining model of the provision of a durable public good over an infinite horizon. In each period, there is a societal endowment that can either be invested in the public good or consumed. We characterize the optimal public policy, defined by the time-path of investment and consumption. In a legislature, representatives of each of <italic>n</italic> districts bargain over the current period's endowment for investment in the public good and transfers to each district. We analyze the Markov perfect equilibrium under different voting <italic>q</italic>-rules where <italic>q</italic> is the number of yes votes required for passage. We show that the efficiency of the public policy is increasing in <italic>q</italic> because higher <italic>q</italic> leads to higher investment in the public good and less pork. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.4255 BAWN, Kathleen; SOMER-TOPCU, Zeynep — <bold>Government versus opposition at the polls: how governing status affects the impact of policy positions.</bold> <italic>American Journal of Political Science</italic> 56(2), Apr. 2012: 433–446.</p>
<p>We argue that governing status affects how voters react to extreme versus moderate policy positions. Being in government forces parties to compromise and to accept ideologically unappealing choices as the best among available alternatives. Steady exposure to government parties in this role and frequent policy compromise by governing parties lead voters to discount the positions of parties when they are in government. Hence, government parties do better in elections when they offset this discounting by taking relatively extreme positions. The relative absence of this discounting dynamic for opposition parties, on the other hand, means that they perform better by taking more moderate positions, as the standard Downsian model would predict. We present evidence from national elections in Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the UK, 1971–2005, to support this claim. [R]</p>
<p>62.4256 BEBER, Bernd; SCACCO, Alexandra — <bold>What the numbers say: a digit-based test for election fraud.</bold> <italic>Political Analysis</italic> 20(2), Spring 2012: 211–234.</p>
<p>We exploit individuals' biases in generating numbers to highlight suspicious digit patterns in reported vote counts. Fair election procedures produce returns where last digits occur with equal frequency, but laboratory experiments indicate that individuals tend to favor some numerals over others. We should observe relatively few instances of repeated numbers in manipulated vote tallies. Laboratory experiments demonstrate a preference for pairs of adjacent digits, which suggests that such pairs should be abundant on fraudulent return sheets. Subjects avoid pairs of distant numerals, so those should appear with lower frequency on tainted returns. We test for deviations in digit patterns using data from Sweden's 2002 parliamentary elections, Senegal's 2000 and 2007 presidential elections, and previously unavailable results from Nigeria's 2003 presidential election.

<p>62.4257 BEDNAR, Jenna; PAGE, Scott E.; TOOLE, Jameson L. — <bold>Revised path dependence.</bold> <italic>Political Analysis</italic> 20(2), Spring 2012: 146–156.</p>
<p>We define a class of revised path-dependent processes and characterize their basic properties. A process exhibits revised path dependence if the current outcome can revise the value of a past outcome. A revision could be a change to that outcome or a reinterpretation. We first define a revised path-dependent process called the accumulation process: in each period, a randomly chosen past outcome is changed to match the current outcome and show that it converges to identical outcomes. We then construct a general class of models that includes the Bernoulli process, the Polya process, and the accumulation process as special cases. For this general class, we show that, apart from knife-edge cases, all processes converge either to homogeneous equilibria or to an equal probability distribution over types.

<p>62.4258 BEGBY, Endre — <bold>Collective responsibility for unjust wars.</bold> <italic>Politics</italic> 32(2), June 2012: 100–108.</p>
<p>This article argues against A. Stilz's [“Collective responsibility and the state”, <italic>Journal of Political Philosophy</italic> 19(2), June 2011: 190–208; <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4514] recent attempt to solve the problem of citizens' collective responsibility in democratic states. I show that her solution could apply only to state actions that are (in legal terminology) unjustified but excusable. Stilz's marquee case—the 2003 invasion of Iraq—does not fit this bill; nor, in all likelihood, does any other case in recorded history. Thus, this article concludes, we may allow that Stilz's argument offers a theoretically cogent case for citizens' task-responsibility in democratic states (given the right conditions); it just so happens that few if any cases satisfy these conditions.

<p>Are citizens in consensus democracies with developed direct democratic institutions more satisfied with their political system than those in majoritarian democracies? Individual-level data from the second wave of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems and an updated version of A. Lijphart's multivariate measure of consensus and majoritarian democracy covering 24 countries are used to investigate this question. The findings from logistic multilevel models indicate that consensual cabinet types and direct democratic institutions are associated with higher levels of citizens' satisfaction with democracy. Furthermore, consensus democracy in these institutions closes the gap in satisfaction with democracy between losers and winners of elections by both comforting losers and reducing the satisfaction of winners.

<p>Arguments for increasing the number of women representatives in parliament are not about an abstract numerical parity, but rest on a claim about the distinctive voice and experience that women bring to political debate and decisions. For some, the difference turns on the view that women bring a more empathetic and less adversarial style to politics. A number of feminist scholars have suggested that the quality of deliberation is correlated with the presence of women in a group: for J. Mansbridge, for example, the process of persuasion is related to a consultative and participatory style that seems to characterize women more than men. For others, arguments for increasing the number of women representatives in parliament turn on a difference of values. [R, abr.]</p>

In particular, two key assumptions of the legal liberal international order are flawed. (1) The attempt to establish a two-tiered international liberal order based on law and democracy results in intervention (both forceful and performative) that counterproductively embroils liberal states, generating resentment and counter-democratic movements. (2) The assumption that security in a globalizing world can only be created by the total globalization of the liberal order and the removal of “outlaw” states creates a new version of the security dilemma in which the actions taken to secure the liberal world order create the very conditions of its insecurity.

<p>There has been much debating on the end of ideology, and in each case, the debaters adopted, voluntarily or involuntarily, ideological positions. Beyond any differences, discourse has stood between two components: truth and solidarity. One could say that ideology is the effort to transfer a truth from the elite to the masses in an effort to create a type of solidarity different from that generated by faith and fear. At the opposite end of the society of truth there lies pragmatic society. The feeling that the society of truth is fading and that the latter is being built is apparent in the debates about the end of ideology. Signs of this end have been spotted in phenomena such as the regression of politics into economics or the proclaimed triumph of liberal democracy. Yet, no one can decide to enter or leave ideology. As soon as we project ourselves in terms of truth (whatever that may be) or solidarity, we already find ourselves within an ideology.

<p>Citizens are generally uninterested in information concerning to the voting decision, justified by the need for cognitive economy and efficiency, and by the fact that the aggregation of their decisions usually lead to a satisfactory result. However, often in election contexts, the use of biased information in estimating the utility associated with voting alternatives generates some inefficiency in representing citizens interests. Starting from the paradigm of the average voter and how it builds its voting decisions and judgments solely on affective significance of information describing the attributes of political actors, we propose the concept of impaired Affective Electoral Utility as one that can support analysis on how the rule of decision is applied in electoral choice based on biased information.

<p>Scholarly work on models of party organization tends to treat stratarchy and hierarchy as analytical opposites. Based on two different visions of stratarchy that co-exist in the literature, this article presents a threefold typology locating party stratarchy as a model between party hierarchy, as one counter-image, and party federation, as the other. The types differ in the extent to which core competences and resources (e.g., selection of parliamentary candidates, mechanisms for conflict resolution, finances) are centralized, and in the extent to which interest representation in national party organs follows territorial lines. The typology is applied to durable yet organizationally new parties (founded since 1978) that maintained a national presence across eight West European democracies. With few exceptions, each of these parties fits neatly within one of the categories. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The author develops a critical perspective of the concept of governance. It focuses on the conceptual relationship between the nation-state and governance, to show the limits of governance processes. The dialectic of state governance is applied to both the international scenario and the scenario of the theory of power. In the first, the author utilizes the concept of nation state as a key to understanding the failures of <italic>global governance</italic>. In the second scenario, a Bourdieusian's view of state as the holder of symbolic power is introduced, so as to bring out a new perspective on the concept of state and to make the concept of symbolic power a tool capable of revealing the authoritarian risks underlying the processes of governance. The author concludes with a brief analysis of the relationship between governance and Foucault's concept of governmentality, useful in clarifying the reorganization and relocation of power in complex societies.

<p>At the beginning of the 21st c., politics has come to display itself, in all its forms, in front of a mass public through communication media, in the daily exercise of democracy practice. All political actors know that one of the main conditions for a successful intervention in the public debate, and in making decisions is to understand how communication and the media work. The growing presence of mass communication media in the political arena with increasingly violent and aggressive acts, in the absence of arguments, the way in which political parties and politicians use public relations, marketing and advertising techniques in electoral campaigns testify to the political fervor and degradation of political discourse.

<p>In democracies where no party enjoys a parliamentary majority, various multi-party governance arrangements have evolved to accommodate the respective interests of the parties involved. Such arrangements reflect, [<italic>inter alia</italic>], the political imperatives facing the parties in question, in particular the quest for an effective and durable government (which typically requires significant inter-party discipline) and the competing desire for parties to retain their distinctiveness in order to protect their electoral support (which implies less discipline). In New Zealand, efforts to balance governmental unity and party distinctiveness have generated several innovative solutions, including agree-to-disagree provisions in coalition agreements and hybrid arrangements enabling minor parties to participate within the executive while being free of the usual conventions of collective cabinet responsibility. This article explores the origins, nature, merits and impact of the recent developments in New Zealand. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The relationship between <italic>jus ad bellum</italic> and <italic>jus in bello</italic> has been characterized differently throughout European history. Three main positions [are] exemplified by H. Grotius, S. von Pufendorf and E. de Vattel: (1) both the cause and the conduct of warfare must be just; (2) the cause must be just, but the conduct of the war is unconstrained in order to achieve the goal of peace; and (3) we must assume justice on both sides, and concentrate on ensuring just conduct in armed conflict. Each attempted to distil customary practices, which they saw in some relation to Natural Law. It is contended that the relationship between just war and just conduct in war during the 20th and 21st c. has mirrored the three classic positions, and since 9/11 [2001], the relationship is in flux.

<p>The literature offers individually valid yet collectively inconsistent hypotheses concerning the nature of public agencies' responsiveness to interest groups. This article examines the brokerage potential of public agencies among interest groups. [This] potential is hypothesized to follow from agencies' preferences for policy goods as well as the tendency of interest groups to seek access to public agencies. It combines analyses of agencies' demand for policy goods with interest groups' preferences for seeking access to specific policy venues. The analyses are based on survey data of national civil servants and interest groups in the UK and in the Netherlands. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Conflict appears more often between neighboring states. Adjacency generates interaction opportunities and arguably more willingness to fight. We revisit the nature of the border issue and measure geographical features likely to affect states' interaction opportunities as well as their willingness to fight. We do so for all on-shore borders from the period 1946–2001. Although each border is unique, a general result shows that the longer the border between two states, the more likely they are to engage in low-intensity conflict. This is particularly so for conflicts active during the Cold War and located in highly populated border regions. [R]</p>

<p>Innovations that would be of immense value to severely deprived people are not widely available although the marginal costs of providing them are low.

<p>The recent developments in political communication, in particular the popularization of politics and the diffusion of internet, are notably challenging the relationship between citizens and media. In this rapidly evolving context, it is worth analyzing the role of political discussion in personal networks and small groups. Also, very recent research has offered new evidence to the old thesis that, despite the massive presence of mass media, personal discussion shapes the formation of political opinion. A particularly important aspect concerns the nature of opinion leadership: who are the new opinion leaders able to influence processes of interpersonal communication? This article reassesses such a theoretical framework by reviewing the state-of-the-art and providing a foundation for a debate on the themes of trust in information sources and the impact of opinion leaders.

<p>This symposium article examines how the threefold governance framework of the symposium actually works across multiple policy sectors and multiple politically systems. It undertakes a comparative survey of governance-related developments across three policy sectors: environment, education/higher education and forests. To control for differentiation in political structures, the article studies the policy sectors with respect to three political systems—Canada, England and Germany—taking into account the role of the EU, the federal systems and international actors.</p>
<p>This broad macro-comparative focus enables the authors to make one of the first empirical efforts to assess the presence and sweep of governance arrangements across both policy sectors and states; and to assess the degree of convergence around particular governance practices.

<p>Legacy unions—formerly state-backed unions that survived democratic transitions—are one of the most persistent legacies of authoritarian rule. While usually successful in maintaining their pre-eminent position, legacy unions have in some cases been overtaken by competing unions. Deploying a set of paired comparisons of legacy unions that entered the transition with similar legacies but experienced different fates—Indonesia with South Korea and Poland with Russia—this article examines why some legacy unions continued to dominate (Indonesia and Russia) and others did not (South Korea and Poland). The author identifies four pathways of change: endurance (Indonesia), attrition (South Korea), hegemony (Russia), and rupture (Poland). Several features of the transition context propelled legacy unions down distinct pathways of change. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Laissez-faire liberals are often criticized by egalitarians for their exclusive concern with “merely formal” freedom and their consequent neglect of “substantive” or “effective” or “real” freedom. The supposed contrast between substantive and formal freedom is a mistaken one, however, and it is therefore misleading to characterize the difference between laissez-faire liberals and egalitarians in terms of such a distinction. The mistaken attribution of a concern with “merely formal freedom” may well depend on a confusion of two distinctions: on the one hand, the distinction between interpersonal freedom and freedom as ability, and on the other hand, the distinction between freedom as a normatively neutral concept and freedom as a normatively loaded concept.

<p>62.4280 CASAL, Paula — <bold>Progressive environmental taxation: a defence.</bold> <italic>Political Studies</italic> 60(2), June 2012: 419–433.</p>
<p>The need to use green taxes to protect the environment is urgent, particularly because of climate change, and can be justified via sound deontological and consequence-based arguments. One very influential criticism of such taxes, however, claims that they disproportionately burden relatively poor individuals who tend to contribute to environmental problems far less than wealthier persons. Critics can also object that because of the link between economic inequality and environmental destruction, it is preferable to adopt environmental measures that impede rather than accelerate the growth of inequality. Various types of green fiscal reform can both avoid disproportionally burdening those who pollute least and reduce the economic inequalities that income taxes leave behind, and slow down the collectively self-defeating consumption arms race that currently besets so many affluent societies.

<p>The New Research on Gender in Political Psychology Conference brought together teachers with interests in gender politics. The session “Teaching Gender throughout the Curriculum” generated a great deal of discussion concerning the pedagogical practice of gender mainstreaming. Gender mainstreaming—the integration of gendered content into courses required for a major—was recognized as one of 11 recommendations for reforming the undergraduate political science curriculum in the 1991 APSA “Wahlke Report”). Little information is available on the prevalence of gender courses in the undergraduate curriculum, but the data suggest such courses are uncommon. This absence of data suggests gender mainstreaming has not emerged as a serious priority for curricular reform. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4269]</p>

<p>Employing the conceptual frameworks provided by U. Beck and C. Schmitt, this article argues that the reconstruction of the enemy in the global risk society reflects a reincarnation of a “crude” form of “the political”. As the powerful—the US—determines our knowledge on global terrorism, the global risk society itself becomes political, through the reconstruction of the enemy as inhuman and, thus, right-less: an enemy who should be captured and punished severely. This also refers to a deconstruction of the classical conception of war and its reconstruction as a special kind of war which involves the use and legitimization of measures that violate all rules of war, international law and human rights.

<p>This paper explains the frequent phenomenon of the weaker side of an enduring rivalry instigating repeated military confrontations against a stronger foe. When sensing they are in the domain of loss, leaders often take excessive risks in the hope of stopping or reversing their decline. This tendency to “gamble for recovery” is complemented by these leaders' strategic opportunism, seeking foreign intervention to advance their agenda. This strategic opportunism in turn creates a moral hazard in that the prospect of foreign intervention can encourage these leaders to escalate disputes with their stronger counterpart in the first place. Therefore, interventions that prevent the stronger belligerent from crushing the weaker one and that mediate temporary truces may have a perverse effect of actually making some rivalries endure longer and the recurrence of military clashes more likely.

<p>In recent years, multiple studies have confirmed that terrorism occurs in democracies more often than in non-democratic regimes. There are five primary groups of explanations for this phenomenon, including the openness of democratic systems, organizational pressures resulting from democratic competition, the problem of underreporting in authoritarian regimes, gridlock resulting from multiparty institutions, and the coercive effectiveness of terrorism against democracies. Most of these studies, however, examine the relationship only through 1997. I explore whether terrorism has continued to occur more in democratic countries through 2010.

<p>The international standings of currencies form a principal characteristic of the international monetary order, shaping the world economic and political system by influencing the economic and political relationships among countries. This paper provides a systematic review of the literature on international currencies, encompassing both economics and political science, with the aim of providing useful groundwork to help develop a better analytical framework for the study of international currency standing. It discusses the international currency concept, the benefits and costs of issuing an international currency, and the determinants of international currency standing. It also assesses conflicting prospects for the future of the US dollar as the world's key currency, addressing the likelihood of further internationalization of the euro and the renminbi, the dollar's main potential rivals.

<p>Several trends—immigration and unknown alienation, inadaptability of the second and third generation of immigrants, new forms of radicalization in Germany, France and the US—are causes of violence, as well as conversion to radical forms of religion, e.g. Jihadist Islam, “new religions”—apocalyptic, hedonistic or satanist. The problem lies with the major religions. They have became increasingly commercial institutions, selling faith and moral comfort, and more than moral reference models. That leads some to seek other alternatives, and adopt radical Islam, Jihadist sects and other types of cults and “newly born” religion. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4432]</p>

<p>The paper focuses on the concept of technical rules (according to an Aristotelian interpretation—propositions that express a necessity: if you want <italic>x</italic>, you must do <italic>y</italic>). The thesis argued is that this concept is helpful in coping with some of the problems of both teleological and deontological planning theories.

<p>Societies in Western civilization enforce their rules through formal secular institutions (SES), whereas less developed civilizations often rely on informal, often religious, institutions (RES). This paper explains the determinants of societies' choice between different enforcement systems, and their implications for society development using an example of two different enforcement models: one informal (RES) and one formal (SES). We find that, because the RES is based on beliefs, its efficiency depends heavily on its credibility, making it hardly flexible and highly susceptible to conflicts in dynamic environments. In contrast, because under the SES societal rules are enforced through a formal legal enforcement sector, the SES is more flexible, although also more costly than the RES. The empirical evidence strongly supports our findings. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>For the past two decades, scholars of International Political Economy and the environment (IPEE) have focused on the study of various international cooperative initiatives that seek to link economic and environmental issues in the wake of the 1987 Brundtland Report and the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. This important work has enhanced our understanding of topics such as the economic dimensions of international environmental governance, the environmental activities of international economic institutions and regimes, and new kinds of private international regimes governing the environment-economy interface. This focus of IPEE scholarship has, however, steered attention away from larger structural trends in the international political economy: e.g., the globalization of financial markets; the rise of newly powerful states such as China and India in the global economy; and the recent emergence of high and volatile commodity prices.

<p>We develop a model of opinion writing in the judicial hierarchy. The model adopts a case-space approach to judicial decision-making with informational asymmetries across levels of the hierarchy. In the model, a lower court writes an opinion with two features: a legal rule and a level of quality. An upper court must then decide whether to review the decision. The model yields new insights about the strategic incentives created by the judicial hierarchy, including relationships among judicial ideology and opinion quality, judicial quality and the content of an opinion's rule, and the effect of the case facts on these relationships. The findings suggest that several common tests employed in the literature may not discriminate among competing sets of first principles. [R]</p>

<p>Within our democratic political system too many of the pressing and serious political, economic and social challenges of our times are delayed or put off, deposited in the ‘Too Difficult Box’. This happens for a variety of reasons which include failure correctly to identify the best solution, failure to understand obstructions in implementing the proposed solution, difficulties in placating or overcoming a range of vested interests, glitches in circumnavigating a range of legal constraints, lack of appreciation of the international dimension of the issue, succumbing to the vicissitudes of the political process and evaporation of the necessary political creativity and energy. It is a responsibility of democratic politics to find ways of dealing with these problems, through more collaborative or consensual politics if necessary.

I conclude that the inclusion of an additional control variable is unlikely to decrease the estimated standard errors and that the tradeoffs involved with including a new control variable are simply too large.

<p>62.4297 CLIFFORD, Stacy — <bold>Making disability public in deliberative democracy.</bold> <italic>Contemporary Political Theory</italic> 11(2), May 2012: 211–228.</p>
<p>Deliberative democracy harbors a recurrent tension between full inclusion and intelligible speech. People with profound cognitive disabilities often signify this tension. While liberal deliberative theorists sacrifice inclusion for intelligibility, this exclusion is unnecessary. Instead, by analyzing deliberative locations that already include people with disabilities, I offer two ways to revise deliberative norms. (1) The physical presence of disabled bodies expands the value of publicity in deliberative democracy, demonstrating that the publicity of bodies provokes new conversations similar to rational speech acts. (2) The inclusion of people with profound disabilities necessitates a form of collaborative speech in which individuals make claims collaboratively. J. Habermas offers an ideal site to pursue this analysis. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The resurgence of religious violence at the start of the 21st c. has reinforced the myth of secular tolerance—the notion that whereas religious believers are instinctively intolerant, tolerance comes naturally to the secular mind. This article challenges that myth. It suggests that secular people are not immune from the temptation to persecute and vilify others, and argues that the Christian Gospel fostered the rise of religious toleration. Facing the rise of “new secularism” since 2008, it is important to go to the roots of the myth of secular tolerance. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4716]</p>

<p>Global governance and revolution are the implications of austerity and of the political uses of the economic crisis to further the concentration of wealth and centralization of power. However, this project takes place in a context where workers in many parts of the world previously excluded from the mainstream of production and political influence now hold logistically strategic positions in transport and communications, export industries and state services. They are able to paralyze part of the state's working and resist privatization of the public sector.</p>

<p>This article discusses, models and quantifies the relationship between the number of parties in government and the degree of policy change or instability. Single-party governments, such as those formed in the UK for several decades, tend to produce very high levels of policy changes and reversals, whereas multiparty coalition governments, such as the ones in Switzerland or Israel, tend to produce a high degree of stability and little policy change. This relationship is studied for 295 elections and the subsequent governments in twenty-four countries since World War II. According to the study, there is a strong negative correlation between the number of parties in government and the degree of policy change. The fewer parties in government the more changes, and vice versa. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4464]</p>

<p>This article examines the institutional, political and regulatory dimensions of environmental assessment (EA) processes. While EA is most often conceptualized as a regulatory instrument, we contend that viewing EA in this narrow fashion obscures the broader implications and significance of EA as a distinct form of governance. When conceived as a mode of governance, EA varies considerably in terms of the key governance characteristics emphasized in this symposium. The empirical evidence rests upon three cases studies looking at very different multi-level governance contexts: the Tamar Valley Pulp Mill in Australia, the Whites Point Quarry in Canada, and the Byströe Canal Project in the Ukraine. The case-study analysis identifies large variations in the institutional, political and regulatory form that EAs take, indicating that approaches identifying EA as a form of “New Governance” are overly simplistic.

<p>Those in the “neoliberal” camp view international capitalism as an unalloyed benefit that spurs economic growth, but consider strong, interventionist states counterproductive and repressive. Critics of globalization view international markets with skepticism, but champion the need for strong redistributionist governments in spreading both wealth and welfare. Using a maximal sample of LDCs [Least Developed Countries] over the longest time period possible (1960–2007), we employ pooled time-series analysis with country-fixed effects to determine whether a <italic>prima facie</italic> case can be made for either perspective. Regressing both economic growth and changes in infant mortality, our results broadly justify a “neoliberal” perspective in the contemporary development of LDCs, but some forms of government spending also contribute to prosperity and human welfare (i.e., education and the military), which tempers our conclusions.

<p>Do the logics of entry and coordination that hold in pure single-member district plurality (SMDP) systems and in pure proportional representation (PR) systems hold in the SMDP tier and the PR tier of mixed-member systems? The fact that single-member districts are embedded in multimember districts means the logic of entry and coordination in either may be contaminated by the existence of the other. How can we establish the counterfactual of how many parties we should expect in one tier if the other tier did not exist? We leverage the design of districts in the UK to address this challenge, observing voting in the same (or very similar) districts but under multiple electoral systems. We find only limited support for the hypothesis that contamination occurs across tiers of mixed-member systems. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article [examines] the determinants of party-system polarization by moving beyond the (almost exclusive) emphasis placed in the literature on the role of the electoral system and the number of parties. We propose a larger menu of explanatory variables that includes both institutional and voters-related factors. Regarding the institutional factors, we highlight the consequences of expectations of coalition formations as well as office-related elections (e.g., presidential ones) on party-system convergence in legislative elections. For the voters-related factors, we address the importance of specific characteristics of the electorate following insights from the spatial theory of voting. To test our hypotheses, we use survey data covering 33 nations and 67 elections. The new variables that we consider involving institutions and voters matter significantly. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Previous authors have found greater political support among electoral winners than losers, but they define winners and losers at a single time point, and employ a dichotomous categorization that neglects possible variations within each group. This study considers both the past history of winning or losing and the impact of ideological distance from the government on a political support indicator—satisfaction with democracy. Using a multilevel model covering thirty-one countries, the authors show that the relationship between winner/loser status and satisfaction with democracy has a marginal dynamic nature and a policy content. Among present losers, previous experience of victory assuaged dissatisfaction, while among those presenting a consolidated “winning” record, only high ideological proximity to the current government boosted political support.

<p>This article [examines] the state of the discipline of IR in Poland. In the communist era, IR was an arena of ideological confrontation. The political science approach was based on Marxist ideology. The transformation after 1989 can be described as a transition from real socialism to common sense realism, and hence an approach that is practical, but lacking in more far-reaching theoretical reflection. The closure of this gap is inevitably a slow process. However, it has been possible to sense some creative spirit within the discipline recently, as attested by the publication of a series of major works by Polish and foreign authors, initiating a debate on the condition of IR and the establishment of the Polish International Studies Association.

The essay [then] offers an analytical framework for examining civic cultures. Civic cultures can support democratic agency and are shaped by a variety of factors. The media, however, are of particular importance here. The framework is modeled as a circuit with six mutually reciprocal dimensions, each opening up an avenue of possible empirical research.

<p>The shock of the 9/11 [2001] attacks had complex and profound effects on US policy in the Middle East. One result was the decision of G.W. Bush's administration to place the discourse of democracy-promotion at center stage in its policy towards the region. This decision was based on the notion that the spread of democracy would serve as antidote to the emergence of Islamist terrorism and enhance Western security. This paper challenges the assumption that the causes of Islamist terrorism can be solely or primarily reduced to the political factors of exclusion and repression. The paper then argues that if authoritarianism is not the cause of Islamist terrorism, we must look elsewhere for an explanation. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4381]</p>

<p>Studies of environmental policy performance tend to concentrate on the impact of particular policy institutions or of single policy instruments. However, environmental policies most often consist of a package of policy instruments. Further, these studies pay no or very little attention to policy instruments directed at the demand side of the market. Therefore this article develops a policy typology for government intervention aimed at creating green markets. The typology distinguishes between four types of policy based on the balance between the supply-side and demand-side policy instruments. On the basis of the typology, a hypothesis on their ability to expand green markets is generated and tested in a comparative analysis of the performance of organic food policies in Denmark, Sweden, the UK and the US, focusing on their impact on organic consumption.

<p>Federalism embodies principles of fairness in a society marked by a pluralism of national identities as the best way of implementing fair terms of recognition. This alternative justification consists of two central moves: federalism is often better at accommodating identities than seceded states (because individuals may be members of both the federal and the sub-state nation simultaneously), and federalism is a fair way to adjudicate between conflicting identities among the citizens making up the component nations.</p>

<p>Case-study evidence suggests that inequality between regions in federations affects the risk of secessionist conflict. However, the conventional quantitative literature on civil war has found little support for a link between economic inequality and civil war. We argue that this seeming discrepancy in part stems from differences in the conceptualization of inequality and its operationalization, which has focused on individual-level wealth differences. In contrast, we investigate regional-level inequality, which is more readily applicable to understanding possible incentives for internal conflict. We adopt a spatial approach, based on new geo-coded data on administrative units in 31 federal states between 1991 and 2005, economic wealth, and ethnic settlements, and demonstrate strong evidence that regional inequality affects the risk of secessionist conflict.

It takes issue with the claim made by R.A.W.

Contra Rhodes, the view presented here is that biography has made a tangible, yet often understated contribution to the field of political studies in Britain. We concentrate on what political biography can offer accounts that explore the complex relationship between ideas and institutions in British politics. [R]</p>

<p>The varieties of capitalism and employment relations literature have largely focused on formally regulated market economies, with a general neglect of the informal economy and of emerging markets where this work arrangement is dominant.

To start to unpack this variety of capitalism, this article explores institutions and employment relations practices in the African economy of Mozambique. The outcome is a conceptual framework that includes both formal and informal institutions and considers the implications for work and employment relations. [R]</p>

<p>Social mobilizations devoted to contesting development and creating alternative economic arrangements conducive to the pursuit of a dignified life have recently sprung up. Not only do they criticize the current state of affairs but they actively seek and experience new ways of living, inspired by another reality not yet materialized but which can be already experienced. This article argues that these mobilizations are not adequately captured by the term “social movements”. The uniqueness of these mobilizations requires a conceptual and epistemological turn able to accommodate the post-development critique of development as well as their emancipatory dimension. We propose to name them “hope movements” to account for the collective action directed to anticipate, imperfectly, alternative realities that arise from the openness of the present one.

<p>This article investigates emerging governance arrangements at the intersection between forest management and climate policy. The authors deploy the symposium's three-dimensional framework to describe and evaluate developments within two distinct policy sectors (forestry/climate-change adaptation and mitigation) at several levels of governance (bi-national, national, and sub-national) to explore the nature and operation of the emerging governance arrangements, and assessing and measuring change within these arrangements over time. Drawing on four contemporary case studies from the US and Canada, New Zealand, British Columbia and Alaska, the authors discern little evidence of a generalized, linear trend from “government to governance”. Instead, across institutional, political and regulatory dimensions of governance, a more variegated and diverse picture emerges. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4531]</p>

<p>After highly fragmented civil wars, order is often secured through the selective co-optation of rebel field commanders and atomized insurgents. This paper presents a formal model of civil war settlement as a coalition formation game between various regime and rebel factions. This approach emphasizes the ability of installed civilian rulers to lure warlords into the state based on promises of future wealth, then use divide-and-rule tactics to pit different warlord factions against one another. Quantitative and qualitative data from Tajikistan, including an original data-set of warlord incorporation and regime purges during wartime reconstruction, are used to evaluate the model.

<p>A long-acknowledged but seldom addressed problem with political communication experiments concerns the use of captive participants. Study participants rarely have the opportunity to choose information themselves, instead receiving whatever information the experimenter provides. We relax this assumption in the context of an over-time framing experiment focused on opinions about health care policy. Our results dramatically deviate from extant understandings of over-time communication effects. Allowing individuals to choose information themselves—a common situation on many political issues—leads to the preeminence of early frames and the rejection of later frames. Instead of opinion decay, we find dogmatic adherence to opinions formed in response to the first frame to which participants were exposed (i.e., staunch opinion stability). The effects match those that occur when early frames are repeated multiple times. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The realization of people's right to natural resources necessitates a de-concentration of the right to the resources' management from the government. A tiered process of citizen involvement in the management and ownership of the resources in the domestic legal context can be applied to cases such as Nigeria's. It involves equity participation and ultimately private ownership. A set of policy choices can vastly enhance natural-resource management for the public benefit, while the modification of the approach under the Texas Relinquishment Act can serve as a model for citizen equity participation. The unwillingness of national leaders to acquiesce to the changes will necessitate the incorporation of these ideas in the jurisprudence of international tribunals and the formulation of a new convention on natural resources.

<p>A look at irregular migration from a global perspective requires distinguishing between economic and political “push-and-pull” factors. It is also necessary to consider the five aspects that determine an immigration status: exit, entry, residence, employment and birth. Immigration status can be subject to change and depends on law enforcement practices. The way labor markets are shaped likewise has an influence on worldwide irregular migration, although it affects the production, consumption and fiscal outcome of receiving countries, even when migrants are not active on the labor market. “Irregularity” is thus anything but a clear-cut category and very few migrants live an “underground life”. Instead, irregular immigrants generally live in the midst of our societies but are almost unrecognizable.</p>

The article divides the Weberian formula into its constituent parties (“monopoly of violence” and “legitimate violence”) in order to understand whether it meets the aforementioned criteria. The conclusion emphasizes the difficulties of this definition for simultaneously being exclusive and exhaustive. [R]</p>

This article discusses and analyzes the results of a survey conducted in 2006–2007 among those involved in environmental projects in the Netherlands (323 respondents, 111 of whom were managers of these projects). The respondents were asked questions about their background, trust, project characteristics, network management activities, and outcomes (both process and content outcomes). This article uses the data collected on network managers to study some of their background characteristics, the management activities they use, and project outcomes. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>We know surprisingly [little] about the interfaces between environmental change and violent conflicts. The debate still focuses on whether or not resource scarcity leads to violent conflict—and thereby risks to fall into a “double climate trap”. First, it conceptualizes the environment as a structural condition that could be transmitted to influence factors exogenous to society. Second, the quest for the causes of conflict is not separated analytically from the conditions of violent or peaceful conflict management. Social and political conflicts seem to result in violence in a quasi-deterministic way. We point out blind spots in current research on environmental change and conflict. Peace research can particularly contribute to the debate by analyzing the pathways of conflict escalation—a necessary condition for constructive conflict-management. [R]</p>

<p>In recent times, “just war” discourse has become unfortunately associated with the idea of the forcible promotion or imposition of democracy as a legitimate just cause. It would thus be understandable if supporters of just war theory were to disavow any particular linkage of its tenets with the democratic ideal. However, this article contends that the theory in its most plausible and attractive form does exhibit certain biases towards the ideal, in both <italic>jus ad bellum</italic> and <italic>jus post bellum</italic>. If these biases fall short of shackling the theory to claims such as “only democracies can fight just wars”, they may nevertheless place taxing justificatory burdens on a non-democracy's claim to have a war-waging right and on non-democratic conceptions of the just peace that should ideally follow a just war.

<p>This article argues that long periods out of office make parties impatient and more willing to make concessions over portfolio-allocation in exchange for participation in a coalition cabinet. Two hypotheses are analyzed: on the one hand, being in opposition for a long time should put parties at a disadvantage when bargaining over office payoffs. On the other, this effect should not apply to the formateur party, since formation offers are based on the receivers' impatience. The empirical results largely support these expectations. Additional evidence of the causality of the main effect is obtained through the use of matching techniques based on the propensity score. [R]</p>

<p>The network governance school has been engaged in a set of macro-level questions about the extent to which networks are changing the nature of state-society relations. The policy network analysis school has focused on the relationship between processes of interest intermediation and their impact on policy-making outcomes. We examine how each school is underpinned by important epistemological differences between positivist, interpretivist and critical realist approaches. We argue that these differences complicate and make contestable what would otherwise seem to be an intuitively attractive argument in favor of combining these two schools. In seeking to understand better how these two schools might be combined, we adopt a critical realist approach and make a distinction between vertical coordination on the state-society axis and horizontal coordination on the interest integration axis.

<p>While vote-buying is common, little is known about how politicians determine whom to target. We argue that vote-buying can be sustained by an internalized norm of reciprocity. Receiving money engenders feelings of obligation. Combining survey data on vote-buying with an experiment-based measure of reciprocity, we show that politicians target reciprocal individuals. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of social preferences in determining political behavior. [R]</p>

<p>Coping with future water crises will require methods that involve thinking about water in terms of its value rather than in terms of its quantities and ownership. The Water Allocation System (WAS) and the Multi-Year Water Allocation System (MYWAS) models are economics-based, yet not economic in a narrow sense: they permit the user to take account of the special nature of water by imposing water policies, which reflect social rather than private values. The plans are useful in resolving water disputes, as results from Israel, Jordan, and Palestine demonstrate. There are some possible objections to the MYWAS, which need to be considered in detail in order to evaluate the opportunities that it presents for the future, both in the Middle East and around the world.

<p>Since the early 1990s, the large-<italic>N</italic> civil war research program has reached an analytical plateau because methodological issues have obscured fundamental conceptual and theoretical concerns. This article discusses gaps in the literature, and proposes conceptual, theoretical, and methodological remedies. Five main lacunae are identified. (1) Civil war may be a longer process than generally described in the extant literature. (2) Existing theories conflate civil conflict with violence—war onset and violence may be conceptually distinct. (3) We have few systemic-level theories of civil-war onset and duration. (4) We need better theories that allow us to determine whether civil wars are different from other types of wars. (5) We need to go beyond state-centric monadic approaches, and be more rigorous when building our models for explaining civil war onset, duration, or termination. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Elections are the centerpiece of efforts to rehabilitate countries devastated by civil conflict, and they are held increasingly often and early. We argue that the inability of post-conflict politicians to commit credibly to respect peace and democracy implies that elections will inflame tensions unless countries have previous democratic experience or elections are delayed to allow for institution-building. We test this theoretical framework with a statistical model of economic recovery and conflict recurrence. We show that early elections, particularly in new democracies, hasten recurrence; delaying elections two years in new democracies or one year in more established democracies can help forestall renewed violence.

<p>Recent research on the sources of individual attitudes toward trade policy comes to very different conclusions about the role of economic self-interest. The skeptical view suggests that long-standing symbolic predispositions and sociotropic perceptions shape trade policy opinions more than one's own material well-being. We believe this conclusion is premature for two reasons. (1) The practice of using one attitude to predict another raises questions about direction of causation that cannot be answered with the data at hand. (2) The understanding of self-interest employed in most studies of trade policy attitudes is unrealistically narrow. In reality, the close relationship between individual economic interests and the interests of the groups in which individuals are embedded creates indirect pathways through which one's position in the economy can shape individual trade policy preferences.

<p>What kind of equality should we value and why? Current debate centers around whether distributive equality is valuable. However, it is not the only (potentially) morally significant form of equality. D. Miller and T. M. Scanlon have emphasized the importance of social equality—a strongly egalitarian notion distinct from distributive equality, and which cannot be reduced to a concern for overall welfare or the welfare of the worst-off.</p>
<p>However, as debate tends to focus on distribution, social equality has been neglected and we do not have a clear understanding of what it is and why it might be valuable. This paper addresses this gap. [R]</p>

<p>Spatial interdependence—the dependence of outcomes in some units on those in others—is substantively and theoretically ubiquitous and central across the social sciences. Spatial association is also omnipresent empirically. However, spatial association may arise from three importantly distinct processes: common exposure of actors to exogenous external and internal stimuli, interdependence of outcomes/behaviors across actors (contagion), and/or the putative outcomes may affect the dimensions along which the clustering occurs (selection). Accurate inference about any of these processes generally requires an empirical strategy that addresses all three well. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4339]</p>

<p>The economic crisis brings attention back to the neglected issue of welfare state retrenchment and pressures to scale down social spending. Recent literature on the welfare state has shifted the focus from the ideal types of welfare state to institutional constraints that affect the ability of governments to change the status quo. The analytical veto player framework provides a useful tool not only for the affluent Western societies but also for the analysis of postcommunist states. In the case of Romania, the core hypothesis of a “new politics” of the welfare state, namely the correlation between institutional stickiness and the success of social policy retrenchment proves sound.

<p>The invasion of Iraq and the subsequent attempt to engineer a democratic state highlights the strengths and limitations of democratization studies to explain why, where, and how democracy occurs. This article argues that the way power is played out globally and locally determines the nature of democratic success or failure. Traditionally, democratization studies has focused on internal structures and agents of change. However, Iraq indicates that democratization is more complex than traditional comparative politics approaches have ascribed it. This article [argues that]: (1) the drive for democratization is shaped by the display of power and disputes over global authority at least as much [as], if not more than, national-level politics. (2) The display of power internally determines two key dimensions of democratization: state capacity and societal security. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Threat-perception is a powerful tool in international and intergroup conflict. Realists in IR argue that the perception of threat in intergroup conflict is a function of power asymmetries between groups. In contrast, social constructivists in IR suggest that a shared sense of identity or similarity can reduce, and in some cases eliminate, perceptions of intergroup threat. Consequently, threat-perception might be influenced by both the value similarities and the power asymmetries between the ingroup and the out-group. We test empirically how individuals evaluate the similarity of cultural and political values compared with another nation (out-group) and assess its implications for cooperation among states in the international system. The results demonstrate that both power and perceived value similarity play an important role in threat-perception among states and discuss implications. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>World War I began in a weakly integrated portion of Europe with which highly integrated powers were entangled through the alliance system. Crises among the highly interdependent European powers in the decades leading up to the war were generally resolved without bloodshed. Among the less interdependent powers in Eastern Europe, however, crises regularly escalated to militarized violence. Moreover, the crises leading to the war created increased incentives for the integrated powers to strengthen commitments to their less interdependent partners. In attempting to make these alliances more credible, Western powers shifted foreign policy discretion to the very states that lacked strong economic disincentives to fight. Had globalization pervaded Eastern Europe, or if the rest of Europe had been less locked into events in the east, Europe might have avoided a “Great War”. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Despite the absence of formal institutions to constrain opportunistic behavior, some autocracies successfully attract private investment. Prior work explains such success by the relative size of the autocrat's winning coalition or the existence of legislatures. We advance on this understanding by focusing on the key constraint limiting coalition size and legislative efficacy: organizational arrangements that allow group members to act collectively against the ruler. We introduce three new quantitative measures of the ability of ruling party members to act collectively: ruling-party institutionalization, the regularity of leader entry, and the competitiveness of legislative elections. These characteristics are robustly associated with higher investment. Our evidence also points to an effect on the risk of expropriation in non-democracies. [R]</p>

<p>In recent years, a consensus has developed that the conditional logit (CL) model is the most appropriate strategy for modeling government choice. We reconsider this approach and make three methodological contributions. (1) We employ a mixed logit with random coefficients that allows us to take account of unobserved heterogeneity in the government-formation process and relax the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) assumption. (2) We demonstrate that the procedure used in the literature to test the IIA assumption is biased against finding IIA violations. An improved testing procedure reveals clear evidence of IIA violations, indicating that the CL model is inappropriate. (3) We move beyond simply presenting the sign and significance of model coefficients, suggesting various strategies for interpreting the substantive influence of variables in models of government choice.

<p>When collective violence breaks out during regime change, the root cause is ordinarily assumed to be a failure of state and/or governmental organizations, alongside transition. However, violence sometimes erupts during regime change, even when state and executive organs remain intact. This paper addresses those puzzling cases, by arguing that transitional violence can be a by-product of competition between, or within, a state's security services, for power and resources in an emerging regime. Competition develops where there is intense uncertainty about the form that the new regime might take and associated uncertainty about the distribution of power and state funds among state security services within that regime. The dynamics of transitional violence through intrastate competition are illustrated through treatment of two “most different” cases: Indonesia (1998) and Romania (1990). [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The question of “old” versus “new” terrorism has been debated vigorously. Proponents of “new terrorism” point to a radical transformation in the character of terrorism, while skeptics point out that today's terrorism is not a fundamentally or qualitatively new phenomenon but grounded in an evolving historical context. I take stoke of the debate by means of juxtaposing ideal types of “traditional” and “new” terrorism along the axis of five distinguishing variables: organizational structure; operational range; motives; tactics; and attitude towards the Westphalian system. The analysis reveals similarities, instead of rigid distinctions, that point in favor of evolution rather the revolution of terrorist activity. The article, thus, questions both the analytical value and empirical veracity of “new terrorism”. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4381]</p>

<p>That neither the assumptions nor the predictions of standard government-formation models entirely correspond to empirical findings [suggests] that theoretical accounts of government-formation should be reconsidered from the bottom up. We present a zero-intelligence model of government-formation, in [which] three or more parties that care about office and policy make random government proposals. The only constraints that we impose on government-formation correspond to the two binding constitutional constraints that exist in all parliamentary systems: an incumbent government always exists and all governments must enjoy majority legislative support. Despite its deliberately limited structure, our model predicts distributions over portfolio allocation, government types, and bargaining delays that approach those observed in the real world. Our analysis suggests that many formation outcomes may result from the institutional foundation of parliamentary democracies, independent of the strategic behavior of party leaders. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This paper assesses the relative importance of force-employment as a cause of military victory. It focuses on the adoption of the modern system in interstate wars since 1917. Using cases, contingency tables, and regression-analysis, we find that war participants who use the modern system are significantly more likely to succeed in decisive battlefield engagements. However, the modern system does not predict victory at a higher rate than more traditional unit-level explanations for combat effectiveness, suggesting that it might function as a causal mechanism linking factors like regime-type and material endowments with martial capabilities. We find that more materially powerful states and democracies tend to implement the modern system at a higher rate than other types of actors, but more extreme autocracies also frequently adopt.

<p>The concept of governance has provided many ways to theorize the shifting power relations between the state, interest groups and civil society over the last 30 years. Theorizations have culminated in “spatial imaginaries” for visualizing new governing practices and their associated power relations. By paying attention to these imaginaries, it is possible to see how each theory of governance brings particular spatialities of power to the fore, while necessarily foreclosing others. Rather than starting our analyses of governance arrangements with theoretical models which appear to predetermine our understanding of the spatial workings of power, we should remain open and attuned to the complex geographies of power that might actually operate in practices of governance on the ground.

<p>Declining citizen trust in government is an important driver for NPM-style reforms. Increasing people's knowledge by providing factual knowledge about government performance outcomes is seen as an important way of increasing citizen trust in government. Does this promise hold or is knowledge about performance outcomes not that important? Two rivaling hypotheses are being investigated. One proposition postulates a link between knowledge and trust, whereas the alternative hypothesis borrows from social-psychological research arguing that subconscious and affective cues are more important. In order to investigate this question, this article presents the results of an experiment (N = 658) investigating the effect of performance outcome transparency on citizen trust in a specific government organization.

<p>Political science's development in Iceland has been remarkable, from its small beginnings in 1970 to hosting the largest political science conference in Europe in 2011. However, political science must always be aware of new challenges and be prepared to innovate and adapt to new realities. The financial crisis that hit Iceland and the world economy in 2008 embodies significant challenges to the discipline, but also opportunities—and notably the opportunity to retrieve the dominance that market economics secured over many political economy analyses. The specific experience of Iceland, as a small state in the north, represents a wake-up call for the discipline, raising key questions relating to the contribution political science can make to understanding the current transformation and to the capacity of the discipline to maintain its relevance.

<p>This article examines how globalization, government ideology, and their interaction have shaped income distribution in 59 developing countries from 1975 to 2005. Using pooled time-series data-analysis, the results show that globalization, measured by trade flows and FDI, has significantly expanded income inequality in developing countries. However, countries with leftist government parties and chief executives have experienced significantly smaller income gaps and even moderated the income inequality from increasing world market integration. The results suggest that the traditional role of government ideology for income redistribution, drawn from the experiences of advanced countries, is applicable to the developing world as well. Rather than being diminished by the integration of international markets, the influence of government ideology will continue to play a key role in shaping the outcomes of globalization. [R]</p>

<p>This article presents PRIO Conflict Site, a geo-referenced dataset on armed conflict, which provides geographic information on the location, scope, and size of all conflicts in the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset, 1989–2008. In contrast to earlier efforts to map the incidence of conflicts, this dataset is structured in a country-year format that accounts for the temporal dynamics of conflicts. The article reveals that unlike the well-known post-Cold War decline of conflict, there is no contemporaneous decline in the spatial extent of conflict. Furthermore, it is shown that governmental conflicts are more dynamic, both in terms of location and scope, than separatist conflicts. [R]</p>

<p>Within the subfields of political psychology and the study of gender, the introduction of new data-collection efforts, methodologies, and theoretical approaches are transforming our understandings of these two fields and the places at which they intersect. We present an overview of the research presented at a conference “New Research on Gender in Political Psychology” in March 2011. This scholarship represents the expanding questions and approaches that enhance our understanding of gender within political psychology. We suggest further innovation with regard to theory and methods to understand better how gender shapes the political attitudes and actions of individuals. Our discussion covers the use of data, interdisciplinary methods, and intersectionality to study gender. We [discuss] the theoretical implications of this recent scholarship and the future of political science research on gender. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4269]</p>
<p>62.4368 HARRIS, Jerry — <bold>The world economic crisis and transnational corporations.</bold> <italic>Perspectives on Global Development and Technology</italic> 11(1), 2012: 168–181.</p>
<p>Although the world economic crisis has slowed the flow of global investments and production, transnational capitalism has become more centralized through greater monopolization. We can trace this development in the auto industry with an examination of state intervention, transnational alliances and global competition. Far from developing a nation-centric recovery plan, the Obama bail-out deepens the auto industry's global character. This example shows how the transnational capitalist class works through the state to strengthen its dominant position over national capital. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4794]</p>

<p>Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) have received a great deal of attention since they appeared as critical investors during the global financial crisis. Reactions have ranged from fears of state intervention and mercantilism to hopes that SWFs will emerge as model long-term investors that will take on risky investments in green technology and infrastructure that few private investors are willing to touch. We argue that both of these reactions overlook the fact that SWFs are deeply embedded in the political economy of their respective sovereign sponsors. This paper focuses on four political entities that sponsor some of the largest SWFs worldwide: Kuwait, Abu Dhabi, Singapore and China. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>62.4371 HEALD, David — <bold>Why is transparency about public expenditure so elusive?</bold> <italic>International Review of Administrative Sciences</italic> 78(1), March 2012: 30–49.</p>
<p>This article identifies the specific meaning of transparency about public expenditure, defined in terms of the four directions of transparency: inwards, outwards, upwards and downwards. It identifies barriers to the effective transparency of public expenditure, characterizing these as intrinsic or constructed. Tackling these barriers, especially those constructed by policy actors, constitutes a route towards more effective transparency, not only about public expenditure itself but about surrogates for it. It is not just quantity that matters: different varieties of transparency will have differential effects on the achievement of public policy objectives. How transparency mechanisms are structured will therefore shape their impact on public policy—on efficiency, on equity and on democratic accountability.

<p>There have been growing calls to reframe the politics of poverty reduction and of social protection in particular, in terms of extending the “social contract” to the poorest groups. This is often understood as relocating social protection within a broader project politics of rights and justice as opposed to patronage. However, such calls belie the serious differences that exist between different strands of social contract and between the forms of social protection that might emerge from these different approaches. The experience in Africa suggests that contractual approaches may take regressive as well as progressive forms. It seems unlikely that international development agencies could promote progressive social contracts around social protection without significant reforms to the way in which aid currently works.

<p>This paper assesses the impact of the current changes in international conflicts on the ethics of war. It shows how the fact that interstate wars tend to be superseded by irregular wars is both a moral and political challenge that democracies now have to face. The effects of the changes in international law on the ethics of war are also analyzed. The Grotian law of war, based on the just war theory inherited from ancient times, initially put limits to resorting to strength when considering the war death toll. The law of armed conflicts law, part of international humanitarian law, regards war as a pathology which may justify military intervention when is motivated by humanitarian reasons. Two logics are here confronted: they correspond to two different definitions of just war. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4601]</p>

<p>H. Bull, in the passage in <italic>The Anarchical Society</italic> [<italic>A Study of Order in World Politics</italic>, 1977] which introduces the “three competing traditions of thought” associated with the articulation of the modern states-system, cited O. von Gierke as the originator of this influential way of organizing international theory. This article examines Gierke's work in order to assess the extent of the influence on the English School that can be ascribed to him. In fact, Gierke's version of the three traditions bears little resemblance to that of Bull; by “international society”, Gierke was referring to confederal structures of political power. Through an analysis of a significant strand of American revolutionary thought, the paper demonstrates the potential that further attention to the Gierkean understanding of international society could have for advancing the English School's research program and building on its achievements.

<p>The internet and computer-mediated communications (CMCs) have drastically changed the way that individuals communicate and share information across the globe. Over the last two decades, financial institutions, private industry, and governments have come to rely on technology in order to access sensitive data and manage critical infrastructure, such as electrical power grids. As a consequence, the threat posed by cybercriminals has increased dramatically and afforded significant opportunities for terrorist groups and extremist organizations to further their objectives. The complex and intersecting nature of both crime and terror make it difficult to clearly separate these issues, particularly in virtual environments, due to the anonymous nature of CMCs and challenges to actor attribution. Thus, this study examines the various definitions for physical and cyberterror and the ways that these activities intersect with cybercrime. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4456]</p>

<p>This article discusses the attempt [of] several aid agencies since [2000] to integrate political economy assessments into their decision-making on development assistance. The article discusses: the Drivers of Change adopted by the UK's Department for International Development; the Strategic Governance and Corruption Analysis (SGACA) developed by the Dutch Directorate General for International Cooperation; and the new thinking on political economy analysis, policy reform and political risk advanced by the World Bank. On the basis of a political-economic interpretation of development agencies, two factors hinder the successful application of political economy assessment: (1) the agencies' professional outlook leads them to see development in primarily technical terms; (2) the nature of incentives for development professionals leads them to resist the implementation of political economy analyses.

<p>This essay highlights the key findings, methodological tool kit, and production process of this issue. We argue that communication researchers are uniquely positioned to analyze the relationships between social media and political change in careful and nuanced ways, in terms of both causes and consequences. Finally, we offer a working definition of social media, based on the diverse and considered uses of the term by the contributors to the collection. Social media consists of (1) the information infrastructure and tools used to produce and distribute content that has individual value but reflects shared values; (2) the content that takes the digital form of personal messages, news, ideas, that becomes cultural products; and (3) the people, organizations, and industries that produce and consume both the tools and the content.

<p>One of the most problematic aspects of the “Harvard School” of liberal international theory is its failure to fulfill its own methodological ideals. Although Harvard School liberals subscribe to a nomothetic model of explanation, in practice they employ their theories as heuristic resources. Given this practice, we should expect them neither to develop candidate-causal generalizations nor to be value-neutral: their explanatory insights are underpinned by value-laden choices about which questions to address and what concepts to employ. A key question for liberal theorists, therefore, is how a theory may be simultaneously explanatory and value-oriented. The difficulties inherent in resolving this problem are manifested in J. Ikenberry's writing: his recent attempts to develop prescriptions for US foreign policy reproduce, in a new form, key failings of Harvard School realism. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The concept of electoral competition is relevant to a variety of research agendas in political science, yet the question of how to measure electoral competition has received little direct attention. We revisit the distinction proposed by G. Sartori between competition as a structure or rule of the game and competitiveness as an outcome of that game and argue that to understand which elections can be lost (and therefore when parties and leaders are potentially threatened by electoral accountability), scholars may be better off considering the full range of elections where competition is allowed. We provide a data-set of all national elections between 1945 and 2006 and a measure of whether each election event is structured such that the competition is possible. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Path dependence is commonly used to describe processes where “history matters”, which encompasses many different kinds of temporal dynamics. This essay distinguishes path-, or equilibrium-, dependent processes where early conditions continue to matter, from outcome-dependent processes where recent history matters and from outcome-independent processes where history does not matter. Others have argued for a precise and restrictive definition of path dependence. We build on this and distinguish among different types of outcome-dependent processes when these conditions for path dependence are not fully satisfied. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4339]</p>

<p>This article surveys the field of terrorism studies since 9/11 [2001] and assesses some of its main successes, perennial issues and future challenges. It suggests that terrorism studies has grown and matured in the decade since the attacks, in part through its rising popularity and institutionalization in new university teaching programs, a growing number of think tanks and research institutes, and scholarly activity in new networks and journals. While some of its successes include new dedicated scholars and researchers, improving standards of scholarship, and diversification of research and methodological approaches (including the rise of critical terrorism studies), a number of perennial issues continue to haunt the field.

<p>There is widespread agreement that any military intervention, even when justified on humanitarian grounds, should be conducted “as a last resort”. But what is last resort? The article highlights the epistemological problems in this classic criterion of the just war doctrine, which is also counterintuitive when facing a humanitarian emergency: is exhausting all other measures, not losing precious time? This criterion is also problematic as it implies that the use of military force is always the worst option, which is not necessarily the case. The article corrects and reformulates the principle of last resort into one of the last bad option, within the framework of a realist ethics of the least evil.

<p>Previous research on interstate war and counterterrorism has suggested that targeting enemy leaders does not work. Most studies of the efficacy of leadership decapitation, however, have relied on unsystematic evidence and poor research design. An analysis based on fresh evidence and a new research design indicates the opposite relationship and yields four key findings. (1) Campaigns are more likely to end quickly when counterinsurgents successfully target enemy leaders. (2) Counterinsurgents who capture or kill insurgent leaders are significantly more likely to defeat insurgencies than those who fail to capture or kill such leaders. (3) The intensity of a conflict is likelier to decrease following the successful removal of an enemy leader than it is after a failed attempt. (4) Insurgent attacks are more likely to decrease after successful leadership decapitations than after failed attempts. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4463]</p>

<p>Patriotism poses a threat, not just to democracy but also to life itself. It finds expression in a new species of civic memorial dedicated to animals. In wartime, the animal world, including dogs, horses, elephants, and mules, is forced to serve. It is treated as militarily indispensable but also utterly disposable. Millions of animals have been killed in the name of country—not despite the patriotic love professed for them, but precisely because of it. The treatment of animals mimics the treatment of citizens and vice versa, where no sacrifice ultimately lies beyond justification. Thus, patriotism's dependence on and even addiction to death acquires added intensity and depth. [R]</p>

<p>There has been a serious disturbance in the categories of criminal and enemy. Whether or not new regimes will prove to be effective, they present substantial challenges to the modern political imagination which carefully maintains the distinction between criminals and enemies as a matter of both formal law and informal representation. Locating the theoretical character of the challenge will prepare for a closer look at some contemporary popular films which reveal the way in which this categorical disturbance is finding expression. At stake in the criminal/enemy distinction is the relationship of sovereignty to law. These are not just categories of theory but the organizing principles of political and personal narrative. When we lose control of the categories, we lose the sense of who we are.</p>

<p>How should the burdens of material losses caused by a war be allocated? Using J. Locke's writings on war and property to consider a normative conception of post-war liability, two distinctive issues are relative to the proper design of a reconstruction fund: who should contribute and who should benefit? In most cases, collective liability is likely to run out before the minimal satisfactory baseline can be reached; therefore property constraints are bound to play a substantive role.</p>

<p>Experiments have become an increasingly common tool for political science researchers over the last decade, particularly laboratory experiments performed on small convenience samples. We argue that the standard normal theory statistical paradigm used in political science fails to meet the needs of these experimenters, and outline an alternative approach to statistical inference based on randomization of the treatment. The randomization-inference approach not only provides direct estimation of the experimenter's quantity of interest—the certainty of the causal inference about the observed units—but also helps to deal with other challenges of small samples. We offer an introduction to the logic of randomization inference, a brief overview of its technical details, and guidance for political science experimenters about making analytic choices within the randomization inference framework.

<p>The idea of fate dominated the Western political thought from Machiavelli to Schopenhauer and Nietzsche up to Oswald Spengler and therefore stands in the focus of current political research. The assumption that this historical motive has lost its importance since the 20th c. has not been confirmed. Quite the opposite seems to be the case: the existing debate on <italic>ökologiebewegung</italic> [environmental movement] in current political research cannot be understood sufficiently without taking the fate motive into consideration. Hence, the political importance of the belief in fate should not be underestimated as it shows the connection of political thought/action and historical beliefs.

<p>This study argues that a state's power is best conceptualized by considering how a state interacts with all other states in different networks within the international system. This social-network explanation for national power is applied to militarized conflicts, one of the most widely studied empirical phenomena in international relations, focusing on their power explanations. The empirical analysis of militarized conflicts at the dyadic level produces findings that strongly support power preponderance theory over balance of power theory. The evidence from non-parametric model discrimination statistics and information criteria measures also shows that our conflict models with new social network power measures have greater explanatory power than or statistically outperform models relying on attributional power measures, such as Correlates of War index and GNP.

<p>Existing studies of the trade-conflict relationship focus primarily on dyadic trade and its implications for the opportunity cost of conflict. Most states maintain economic relations with numerous partners, yet few studies have examined the effects of extra-dyadic trade on dyadic conflict. In an influential discussion of economic interdependence, A. Hirschman ([1945] 1980) draws attention to the importance of both direct trade ties and the extent to which a state's total trade is monopolized by any one trading partner. Building on this notion, we present and test a theoretical argument about the conflict-reducing implications of third-party trade. The findings provide support for our prediction that greater concentration of trade outside the dyad is associated with a reduced risk of interstate hostility and violent disputes. [R]</p>

<p>Territorial self-determination and global distributive justice seem to be at loggerheads. Cosmopolitans hold that institutions such as states can be justified only derivatively on global justice. But “self-determinists” insist that territorial self-determination is independently significant. The current article hypothesizes that the core disagreement is not over the justification of global resource egalitarianism, but rather over the conception of resources per se. The article presents three conceptions of resources—the familiar “natural resources” conception, T. Hayward's “physical” conception and R. Dworkin's “constructivist” conception—and argues that, particularly when appended to egalitarian global distribution principles, each is importantly flawed. The article then presents and defends an “intentional” conception of resources as fungible means. [R, abr.]</p>

This essay reviews efforts to reform international law into a science and a more efficient instrument of international rule. Such efforts have been a part of international law's internal development but their lack of success depends on a mistaken view of the field as a “discipline”—a set of theoretical or technical propositions. This essay defends a view of international law as an argumentative practice in which political claims are defended and attacked, rather than as a governance tool or institutional blueprint. At its worst, law may buttress bureaucratic privilege. At its best it may offer, for a cynical world, a vocabulary for imagining better futures. It may also sharpen political thought and strategic awareness, but it cannot replace them. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article calls for a holistic appraoch to parliamentary change through the analytical lens of parliamentary agenda powers. In addition to agenda control, the concept of agenda powers refers not only to the ability of parliamentary actors to influence parliamentary output directly through legislation (efficiency), but also to exert indirect influence through controlling the government (effectiveness) and through affecting public opinion (legitimacy). The concept of agenda powers comprises the formal institutional rules underlying the distribution of the parliamentary agenda, the factual application of these rules and the organizational powers enabling actors to make use of their time. The distribution of agenda powers can be explained by the sequencing of legitimacy, effectiveness, and efficiency reforms. Consequently, the concept allows for a comparative long-term analysis of parliamentary change. [R, abr.]</p>

Spokespeople for the US government often highlight the precision of UAVs and argue that this quality enables military action to comply with the international humanitarian law principles of distinction and proportionality. This article criticizes the technologically advanced weapons on the same ground on which the US government has defended them: meeting international standards of distinction and proportionality. The article opens with a discussion of the legal implications of Just War theory. It then offers a critique of the politico-military discourse surrounding UAVs and presents a philosophical framework that might lessen the confusion surrounding the ethics of modern warfare.

<p>IR has cultivated an image as a discipline with strong divisions along paradigmatic, methodological, metatheoretical, geographical, and other lines. This article questions that image, analyzing the latent structures of communication in IR. It uses citation data from more than 20,000 articles published in 59 IR journals to construct a network among IR journals and finds a discipline with a center consisting of pedigreed IR journals, albeit closely related to political science. Divisions are identifiable as specialty areas that form clusters of specialized journals along the periphery of the network-security studies and IPE in particular—but communication is also divided along the lines of geography and policy/theory. Divisions notwithstanding, IR communication remains centered around American, general, and theoretical IR journals. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>I investigate the rationality of challenge and escalation when a third party, allied either to defender or challenger, is uncertain about the enemy's power. The analysis illustrates how third-party ally power impacts general and immediate deterrence and willingness to intervene. In alliances with the defender, uncertainty about the enemy's strength leads the third party to support the defender with a probability that decreases with the benefits that his intervention would provide although the likelihood that he is facing a strong challenger in war has increased. If the third party is allied to the challenger, ally behavior is more nuanced. [R]</p>

<p>Why are some former colonies more democratic than others? The British Empire has been singled out in the debates on colonialism for its benign influence on democracy. Much of this scholarship has focused on colonialism's institutional legacies; has neglected to distinguish among the actors associated with colonialism; and has been nation-state-focused. Our subnational approach allows us to isolate the democracy effects of key actors operating in colonial domains—Christian missionaries—from those of colonial powers. Missionaries influenced democracy by promoting education; education promoted social inclusivity and spurred social reform movements. To make our case, we constructed colonial and post-colonial period district datasets of India and conducted panel-analysis of literacy and democracy variations backed by case studies. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Many theorists believe that, unlike election promises, vote-buying <italic>per se</italic> is bad from the point of view of democracy. This asymmetrical evaluation is puzzling to the extent that both phenomena tend to involve candidates trying to get elected by offering self-interested reasons for voting for them and voters deliberating on that basis.

More constructively, it argues that the most plausible grounds for rejection of vote-buying commit us to quite radical and much less commonly accepted views about the requirements of democracy.

<p>Recently, alternatives to both the structure and content of “orthodox” just war theory have been proposed by J. McMahan and D. Rodin. I show that key ideas in just war theory can be disputed in both of these respects. More broadly, it is unclear how we should assess the debate between differing conceptions of individual principles (such as just cause and proportionality) and the competing wider theories in which they might be situated. I employ the idea of reflective equilibrium, taken from J. Rawls, to show how these conflicting viewpoints might be understood and assessed. I argue, then, that contemporary just war theory faces both important questions of substance, and a set of difficult metatheoretical issues concerning the grounds on which competing just war theories can be assessed.

Gordon provides an astute history and critique of the evolution and application of smart sanctions within the UN system since the mid-1990s. Her analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the discrete types of smart sanctions is part of a growing discussion among both academics and practitioners about the future and the utility of these measures. Her continued skepticism about the effectiveness and ethical dimensions of economic sanctions deserves serious consideration and evaluation. She raises three central concerns: (1) smart sanctions are no more successful than traditional trade sanctions; (2) each type of targeted mechanism has serious flaws; and (3) targeted sanctions did not end the humanitarian damage or the related ethical dilemmas that are embedded into sanctions design and implementation.

<p>Many colonial injustices were enabled, supported or perpetuated by international, transnational and local structurally unjust social processes and background conditions. Agents who are not direct perpetrators, but who participated in the production of unjust structural social processes and conditions that enabled or supported others' wrongdoing, share a political responsibility to effect structural reforms that prevent the reproduction of similar unjust processes and outcomes. Contemporary agents bear political responsibility to correct inherited structural injustices, and reparative measures that enable former victims or victim groups to exercise effective political and social agency constitute one requirement for social structures to be considered just. The argument is illustrated through an examination of responsibility for injustices associated with Japanese colonial practices in Korea (1910–1945), including the military “comfort women” system.

<p>It has been suggested that secular liberal thought and political practice often misrecognize the nature of the injury involved in speech that violates the sacred and that much secular thought about religious injury (and free exercise more generally) is premised on unacknowledged Protestant conceptions of what real religion is. I argue against the ideas that secular liberalism tends to treat religion only as a matter of freely chosen belief and that the unchosen, habituated nature of much religious experience raises a problem for the defense of speech that violates the sacred. I argue that secular thought and practice should remain very concerned about the social and political harms of speech directed unambiguously at social groups but need not eliminate the gap between religious attachments and religious persons.

<p>Is terrorism successful? This oft-asked but infrequently answered question is at the heart of understanding terrorism's use. Effective policy and practice rest on a clear appreciation of how terrorism succeeds and fails. This paper identifies and reviews the literature on terrorism's effectiveness and considers its strengths and weaknesses. To organize the review, a multi-level framework for conceptualizing the goals of terrorism and its enactors is presented. Crucially, this includes the perspective of both sides of the conflict dyad, and considers the tactical, organizational, strategic and ultimate goals of extremist groups. This speaks to the need for a comprehensive framework within which to situate the question of terrorism's goals, and aims to assess the state of the knowledge with respect to terrorism's efficacy.

<p>Slavery is universally condemned by scholars and politicians alike. However, by foregrounding the depredations suffered by slaves, scholarly and public condemnations of slavery elide the moral and political problems of mastery. This article revisits the problem of mastery in light of the writings of the novelist E.P. Jones, the philosopher F. Nietzsche, and the theologian St. Augustine. The article argues that mastery is a primary, and not a tangential, problem of slavery. The article further contends that theories about a slave's repudiation of mastery provide crucial conceptual and normative resources for diagnosing and combating the temptation of mastery within post-slavery liberal democracies.

<p>Consider a state that chooses security levels at two sites (Targets A and B), after which a terrorist chooses which site to attack (and potentially a scope of attack). The state values A more highly. If the state knows which target the terrorist values more highly, he will choose a higher level of security at this site. Under complete information, if the terrorist's only choice is which site to attack, the state will set security levels for which the terrorist prefers to attack A over B if and only if the ratio of the value of B to the value of A is greater for the state than for the terrorist. In total, the results reveal that the state's choice of security is heavily influenced by the terrorist's target valuations. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article argues that repression amplifies trends in cooperation or conflict existent in a movement before the onset of repression. All movements have some institutional arrangement, meaning a set of procedures and relationships that structure decision-making and behavior. These “rules of the game” distribute power within the movement, and thus favor some actors over others. Repression disrupts the equilibrium of these institutions, after which the members might engage in either more cooperation or more conflict, depending on the level of satisfaction with preexisting institutional arrangements. The authors illustrate these propositions through comparative analysis of four repression shocks from two nationalist movements: the Kurdish movement in Iraq and the Palestinian national movement.

<p>The term “open government” is often used to describe initiatives of putting government information on the internet.

This analysis shows the differences and similarities between economic, political science and legal perspectives on open government and argues that a multidisciplinary approach needs to be taken.

<p>Theoreticians of deliberative democracy have sometimes found it hard to relate to the seemingly contradictory experimental results produced by psychologists and political scientists. We suggest that this problem may be alleviated by inserting a layer of psychological theory between the empirical results and the normative political theory. In particular, we expose the argumentative theory of reasoning that makes the observed pattern of findings more coherent. According to this theory, individual reasoning mechanisms work best when used to produce and evaluate arguments during a public deliberation. It predicts that when diverse opinions are discussed, group reasoning will outperform individual reasoning. It also predicts that individuals have a strong confirmation bias. [R, abr.]</p>

The article evaluates 20 cases of participatory governance and 19 deliberative forums. The findings show that different designs produce different democratic effects, but also that the suitability of a particular design depends on the type of policy issue. Tensions between representative and direct democracy are more likely to exist for participatory governance than for deliberative forums. [R]</p>

<p>A historical version of the statist theory claims that states gain territorial rights by increasing the value of territory over time, but such historical entitlement theories are implausible in the case of states. In contrast, the article argues that an adequate justificatory theory of territorial rights must treat peoples—nations or indigenous groups—as the primary bearers of these rights. Peoples gain such rights by adding material value to the territory in question, and endowing it with symbolic value. After responding to objections from global egalitarians and others, the article concludes that such a justificatory theory can unite the three elements of territorial rights distinguished at the outset.

<p>I advance a theoretical and empirical framework that puts time and thus the temporal dynamics of candidate-evaluation front and center in order to advance our understanding of the lifespan of information effects while enhancing the external validity of our experimental approaches. With these temporal properties in mind, I designed a “panel experiment” with research conducted over twelve weeks. This represents the first experimental approach to combine control over information exposure with attention to information processing throughout the course of a multiweek campaign. Against the backdrop of partisanship, empirical tests assess the ability of transient exposure to issue and character information to produce effects that endure beyond the moment the information is encountered either via memory-based or on-line processes.

<p>Which should be preferred in a federal system, state- or national-level policy-making? Though theory suggests that more voters are satisfied by local control, we identify new conditions under which national policy-making is preferred based solely on the distorting influence of interest groups. Even when interest groups capture state policy-making at the same rate as states' national representatives, a “distortion gap” exists between the two regimes. We find that national policy-making provides more aggregate welfare when voters widely disagree with moderately prevalent strong interest groups, refining Madison's prescription for national policy-making to counter local factions. We show that other justifications for national policy-making (such as avoiding spillovers and overcoming interest groups' easier capture of state than national politics) are not necessary to prefer national policies.

Given the ubiquitous and multi-faceted nature of globalization, we evaluate the effect of economic, social, and political global integration on a particularly important outcome—human well-being. Theoretically, we argue that globalization has a large number of different effects on human well-being, including multiple positive effects and multiple negative effects. Empirically, we analyze the impact of globalization on well-being using a pooled data-set, including 132 countries over the time period 1970–2007. We find that, on balance, all three forms of globalization positively affect well-being. [R]</p>

In many of their colonies, conquest, and clients, they have propagated ideals and institutions conductive to democratization. At the same time, they have defeated numerous rivals whose success would have had ruinous consequences for democracy. The global spread of democracy, therefore, has been endogenous to the game of great-power politics. [R]</p>

We draw on data from US state transportation agencies to test the relevance of two theoretical perspectives about the effect of public participation on organizational performance. The traditional perspective holds that there is a trade-off between democratic and administrative decision-making. A competing perspective suggests that citizen input provides administrators with valuable site-specific information and contributes to more efficient and effective public programs. We find strong support for the latter perspective. [R, abr.]</p>

Yet global health is a complex and uncertain policy issue. This article uses narrative analysis to explore how actors deal with these complexities and how uncertainties affect global health governance. By comparing three narratives in terms of their basic assumptions, the way they define problems as well as the solutions they propose, the analysis shows how the unstructured pluralism of global health policy making creates a wide scope of policy conflict over the global health crisis.

<p>The appropriate management of natural resources following conflict can help prevent conflict relapse. It is accordingly incumbent upon people working in a post-conflict country to consider natural resources as they develop governance projects to support peace-building. There are a few broad lessons and approaches for governing various resources to support long-term peace. These include: restoring capacity for governance, legal pluralism, decentralization, adaptive governance, and transparency and accountability. Nevertheless, these approaches do not constitute a specific or universal formula. The applicability and usefulness of these approaches and models will depend on the specific characteristics of each post-conflict country. The challenging cases of Sudan, Angola, Iraq, and Afghanistan, can be thus contrasted to promising developments in Liberia and Timor-Leste.

It is made clear that Germany, as other western society, in many respects is only insufficiently prepared for the complex challenges of cyber warfare. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The success of a democracy depends, in part, on public demand for democratic institutions. How does internet use shape citizens' preferences for regime type? Combining individual public opinion data from Africa and Asia with country-level indices, we test a multilevel model examining the relationship between internet penetration, individual internet use, and citizen demand for democracy across 28 countries. We find that internet use, but not national internet penetration, is associated with greater citizen commitment to democratic governance. Furthermore, greater democratization and internet penetration moderates the relationship between internet use and demand for democracy. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4377]</p>

<p>An omnipresent tension involves the proper role of the Strasbourg Court between the need to protect individual rights and the concern to do so in a manner which does not overly impinge on the constitutional order. This tension has permeated the Court's case-law on Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 since 1954. The minimum standards established by the Court in the area of electoral rights contrast with the much higher protection afforded in the case-law to freedom of political expression, freedom of association and freedom of assembly. This is certainly due to the broad formulation of Article 3 but also to the general reluctance of the Court to meddle in the electoral affairs of a state except in certain cases.</p>

<p>Is it reasonable to demand that irregular forces, including guerrilla groups and national liberation movements, should comport themselves like state armies, even in cases where this would stymie their capacity to effectively pursue their military goals? This article examines M. Gross's recent provocative response to this question [<italic>Moral Dilemmas of Modern War: Torture, Assassination, and Blackmail in an Age of Asymmetric Conflict</italic>, Cambridge, 2010]. Gross contends that the laws governing battlefield conduct should be revised to allow irregular forces waging an otherwise just war greater leeway to pursue their cause. Controversially, he extends this concession to the use of qualified terrorist tactics.

<p>Much of the literature on natural-resource conflicts overlooks the effect of human interactions. Moreover, differences between resources and their origins of scarcity are often ignored. The concept resource-scale highlights the multifaceted environmental resources that are often involved in conflict. It also allows for the consideration of the characteristics and conditions set by resource location and to see how these factors influence scale complexity along three dimensions: place, actors, and relations between those actors. A model of scale for environmental conflict suggests that resources vary on a significant number of dimensions, and that each of these has an effect on the conflict's scale. The understanding of natural-resource scale also clarifies how people, places, and resource usage are connected to one another. [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4433]</p>

By assessing the hyperlink structure of the issue network and a subsequent content-analysis of the claims presented by the various actors on the issue the study finds that even though the network contains the overall structures for a functioning deliberative space, the actual deliberation occurring between the actor is very limited. The issue network approach in this case study is seen to be a good way to identify relevant political issues online, but it does not manage to bring together the various antagonistic actors in one deliberative space online.

<p>It is unpromising to make an argument for open borders based on a concern for distributive global justice. Migration regimes can be designed to provide protection to some refugees and asylum seekers. But it is not the worst off who migrate in the first place. Open borders would withdraw human resources from the countries of origin that would be needed to improve the economic and political conditions in these countries. An appropriately designed migration regime in view of global equality would have to be sharply selective and entail strong conditions of mandatory and definitive remigration as well as mandatory remittances.</p>

<p>The question whether political conflict affects the course and outcomes of policy implementation is debated among scholars in public administration. Whereas some scholars emphasize the mediating effects of procedures for political control of bureaucracy, other scholars highlight the actions and preferences of agencies. This study combines both perspectives and argues that policy divergence is explained by political conflict in interaction with agency preferences. Political conflict is specified in conjunction with the decision-making context. Conflict among decisive legislators—rather than the legislature as a whole—is hypothesized to reinforce the effect of agency preferences on policy divergence. Using a cross-classified multilevel design, data on local policy-making and implementation in the Netherlands offer support for these hypotheses. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Numerous international laws frame the beginning of war and the way wars are fought. In addition, several of these laws assume a strategic significance and a moral sense. In order to complete our analysis of the numerous impacts of war on international life, we therefore need to consider the end phase of war. The objective of this article is to construct a general theory of the plausible principles that could guide communities that seek to justly and decently resolve their armed conflicts. We can turn to two important and contrasting models of justice after war: revenge and reconstruction. I criticize the model of revenge by examining the peace accords that followed World War I, and later the first Persian Gulf War. I suggest that the purpose of justice after war should be the construction of a “regime of minimal justice” in the state of the defeated aggressor.

<p>The success of a bioweapons program is dependent on intangible factors, such as work organization, program management, structural organization, and social environment, which can enhance the advancement of a program or create obstacles to progress. When assessed within smaller state and terrorist bioweapons programs, such as those of South Africa and the terrorist group Aum Shinrikyo, these intangible factors produce the same constraining effects as in larger programs. More important, intangible factors have a significant effect on covert programs, because clandestinity imposes greater restrictions on knowledge diffusion. By taking into account these intangible factors, analysts and policy-makers can improve their threat assessments and develop more effective nonproliferation and counterproliferation policies.

<p>This article explores institutional diffusion in international environmental governance, specifying the conditions under which an existing set of institutions provides a template for new institutions. Prior institutional experiences can help to resolve bargaining problems, reduce transaction costs and provide information about likely performance. We discuss five examples of institutional diffusion in international environmental affairs and outline some causal mechanisms and conditions that facilitate or block the diffusion of institutional characteristics. As a baseline analysis, founded on assumptions that abstract from politics, a functional argument is developed about the conditions under which mimetic diffusion, reflecting a pattern of imitation, can occur. Although we focus on this functional argument, we recognize that state interests and power, ideology, and private interests also play significant roles in facilitating or inhibiting institutional diffusion in international environmental affairs.

<p>Insofar as crises are “turning-points”, an important question for Marxists today, especially given the impasse of the Left in face of the first capitalist crisis of the 21st c., is whether this crisis will also be a turning-point in the way the Left thinks about crises. The current crises' nature cannot be grasped if it is not first understood that the way the 1970s crisis was resolved set up the conditions for the sub-prime crisis three decades later. The failure to recognize this obscures the fundamental differences between the 1970s crisis and the present one in terms of the degree of working-class strength; the transformations in finance, technology and the international division of labor; and the institutional learning that has occurred with and among states.

<p>By more than a decade scholars, politicians and experts discuss participatory democracy and engage in the theorization of the governance models that can increase citizens' decision making processes. Hence the dissemination of “best practices” political, administrative, social to overcome the democratic deficit that seems to characterize contemporary societies and to combat the rampant anti-political attitudes, as well as antisocial. The article identifies a common purpose between participatory practices, active citizenship and the wider process of building the knowledge society. Starting from the consideration of the strategic role of lifelong learning, a monographic in-depth focusing on study circles is offered, as a training practice called to play key functions in the construction of active citizenship and in the creation of spaces for the promotion of participation and democratic culture.

<p>The legitimacy of the military is frequently overlooked in standard accounts of <italic>jus ad bellum</italic>. Accordingly, this paper considers how the military should be organized. It proposes a normative conception of legitimacy—the “Moderate Instrumentalist Approach”—that outlines the qualities that a military should possess.

The paper argues that the AVF, despite some notable problems, is the most legitimate way of organizing the military. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4272]</p>

If the US leads this drive for development, then in the end, as with thermonuclear weapons, space weapons will make the world more, not less, secure, and will contribute to the spread of democratic peace and globalized capitalism.

Note the fifty-plus-year lag in enfranchising women in Switzerland, a self-evident democratic advance held back by “the voice of the people” in successive referendums.

<p>According to the standard policy-seeking model of party behavior, a party should always want to join a coalition if its inclusion would decrease the policy distance between the party and the winning coalition. However, in multiparty systems where no party has a majority, policy influence always comes at a cost to the party's preferred policy. A party has to moderate its own policy principles in order to join winning coalitions and influence public policy. Based on data from 14 Danish parties from 1971 to 2005, this article shows that the policy-seeking behavior of political parties is affected by the organizational constraints a party poses on its representatives in parliament. Parties strongly constrained by the party organization tend to ask more questions and raise more interpellations in parliament than parties with weaker organizational constraints. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>An adequate configuration of the US Army's professional and ethical self-understanding should integrate the soldier's ethicopolitical obligations toward the indigenous other—the person who lives where soldiers are deployed. The argument first posits a distinction between cosmopolitan and patriotic configurations of the soldier's obligations. Second, H. Arendt's distinction between Work and Action instructs that one does not “build” a polity; political foundations are fugitive and unpredictable. Third, the soldier as a political agent cannot produce stability or build a nation with instrumental certitude; however, the soldier can foster conditions and intervene in ways to nudge circumstances toward a better state of affairs. Finally, military professionals should cultivate a cosmopolitan attitude informed by W. Connolly's ethos of engagement to help them fulfill their obligations to the other. [R, abr.]</p>

This article frames the existing literature on crime-terror interaction to demonstrate that threat convergence is more complex than policy-makers and practitioners often realize. With terror and crime groups evolving to resemble one another, convergence is undermining the conventional wisdom that limited crime-terror interaction to short-term relationships due to divergent motives. The contemporary threat environment is promoting longer-term cooperation between organized crime and terrorism, in some cases resulting in hybrid organizations that merge elements of both. This article gives suggestions for future multidisciplinary research in this field and supports the formation of new strategies to combat threat convergence.

<p>Several states, including Israel and the US, have put decapitation tactics, which seek to kill or capture leaders of terrorist organizations, at the forefront of their counterterrorism efforts. The vast majority of scholarly work on decapitation suggests, however, that leadership decapitation is ineffective at best and counterproductive at worst. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, leadership decapitation significantly increases the mortality rate of terrorist groups, although the results indicate that the effect of decapitation decreases with the age of the group, even to a point where it may have no effect at all. This finding helps to explain the previously perplexing mixed record of decapitation effectiveness. Terrorist groups are especially susceptible to leadership decapitation because their organizational characteristics (they are violent, clandestine, and values-based) amplify the difficulties of leadership succession.

It has been recently used in relation to declining US soft power and the rise of Chinese soft power. Some researchers focus on the EU's, Japan's, and Russia's soft power.

<p>We hold two key duties to future people: to leave them enough, and to leave them their fair share.

A comparison can be drawn with exploitation, in which both parties may come out ahead, but the exploiter takes more than her share of the “social surplus” from interaction. Victims often accept exploitation in order to ensure that they, and not someone else, receive a benefit. In such cases, to prevent a race to the bottom, we render their rights inalienable. For the same reason we should regard the rights of future people as inalienable, and not as something that they could “waive”. [A]</p>

<p>The British tradition of political life history has six conventions: “tombstone” biography, separation of public and private lives, life without theory, objective evidence and facts, character and storytelling. I describe each in turn and review the main debates in the tradition before turning to the swinging critique by “the interpretive turn”. Post-modernism deconstructed grand narratives by pronouncing the death of the subject and the death of the author. I outline an interpretive approach that reclaims life history by focusing on the idea of “situated agency”: that is, on the webs of significance that people spin for themselves against the backcloth of their inherited beliefs and practices. I explore, with examples, the implications of this approach for writing life history, stressing the different uses for biography open to political scientists. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>If the demise of the Soviet system allowed some to think of a global triumph of Western democracy and capitalism, as well as of an unchallenged American hegemony over the world, it became clear over the last decade that not only were other nations beginning to have their say in international affairs, such as the BRICs and the IBAS, but, and most importantly, that other political cultures were also emerging, especially some from the Southern hemisphere. This paper examines, first, the possible contribution Brazil and other Latin American societies could give to the world, helping to shape an ideal of democracy more open to democratic “affectivity”, which would replace a too rational view of politics; and, then, the importance of China and other nations that can negotiate the terms of their globalization.

<p>This essay provides an introduction to prosumption, the topic of this special double issue. The term prosumption refers to a combination of production and consumption. Various social changes (e.g., the rise of the internet and of social networking on it) have greatly expanded both the practice of prosumption and scholarly attention to it. Prosumption has its most obvious and direct relevance to the economy. As a result, the authors also frame it in terms of contemporary capitalism. Finally, they offer a brief overview of the articles in the issue. [R, abr.] [Introduction to a thematic issue of the same title, edited by the authors.

<p>It has been said that the 2010 WikiLeaks disclosures mark “the end of secrecy in the old fashioned, Cold-War-era sense”. This is not true. Advocates of WikiLeaks have overstated the scale and significance of the leaks. They also overlook many ways in which the simple logic of radical transparency—leak, publish, and wait for the inevitable outrage—can be defeated in practice. WikiLeaks created only the illusion of a new era in transparency. In fact, the 2010 leaks revealed the obstacles to achievement of increased transparency, even in the digital age.

<p>Academic workers generally take it as axiomatic that they should make no professional distinction between colleagues on the basis of their ethnic origin, nationality, sex, religion or any other factor that is irrelevant to their academic merit. Academic boycotts, which typically involve discrimination on grounds of nationality, challenge this “Principle of Universality”. The moral basis for the Principle of Universality lies both in the obligation not to diminish the welfare-generating effects of academic work and in the rights of academic workers to be free from inappropriate forms of discrimination. Each of these moral grounds contains implicit defeasibility conditions, which create the potential for morally justified academic boycotts. However, examination of the defeasibility conditions shows that a strong case needs to be established for a boycott to be justified. [A]</p>

<p>The progressive enlargement of the citizen-government relationship to the digital space is neither a panacea against voter weariness nor an attack on the democratic system. Its lowest common denominator is a logical development of new technological possibilities. Governing and administering is not only done by legislation, but through downloads of forms.

<p>The conventional wisdom holds that security in Iraq improved only after Gen. D. Petraeus implemented a new counterinsurgency doctrine that stressed population security instead of aggressive operations against insurgent forces. This interpretation is strikingly similar to the historiography of the Huk Rebellion, the Malayan Emergency, and the Vietnam War. In each case, observers criticized initial efforts as brutal and counterproductive, only to be rescued when enlightened new leaders arrived on the scene. This article challenges the familiar hero narrative, arguing that critics routinely exaggerate the importance of leadership changes because they view conflicts as experiments in counterinsurgency rather than exercises in state-building. The “heroes” of late-stage COIN might actually depend on the earlier “villains” who did the dirty work of establishing political order and coercing the population into obedience.

<p>62.4477 ROZENAS, Arturas — <bold>A statistical model for party-systems analysis.</bold> <italic>Political Analysis</italic> 20(2), Spring 2012: 235–247.</p>
<p>Empirical researchers studying party systems often struggle with the question of how to count parties. Indexes of party-system fragmentation used to address this problem have a fundamental shortcoming: since the same index value may represent very different party systems, they are impossible to interpret and may lead to erroneous inference. Instead of focusing on index measures, we develop a model that predicts the entire distribution of party vote-shares and, thus, does not require any index measure. First, a model of party counts predicts the number of parties. Second, a set of multivariate models predicts party vote-shares. Compared to the standard index-based approach, our approach helps to avoid inferential errors and, in addition, yields a much richer set of insights into the variation of party systems.

<p>Neoliberalism is based on the systematic use of state power, under the ideological guise of “non-intervention”, to impose a hegemonic project of recomposition of the rule of capital at five levels: domestic resource allocation, international economic integration, the reproduction of the state, ideology, and the reproduction of the working class. A description of these elements is necessary in order to locate the contradiction leading to the current crisis. Neoliberal financialization has imposed specific modalities of social discipline upon key social agents, the working class in particular. Furthermore, neoliberalism's contradictions lead to instability on five distinct levels. The institutional imperatives of reproduction of neoliberalism, however, make it difficult for governments to introduce a new economic policy framework. [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4448]</p>

<p>This article examines the norms promoted by the <italic>jus post bellum</italic> and transitional justice theories in light of the ethical models that they invoke. The transitional vocation assigned to trials concerning mass atrocities ambivalently oscillates between a desire to provide a sentimental education that would affectively awake a rejection of the crimes, and a staging of deliberative rationality. They oscillate between a consensual vision of the political, and a vision that tries to articulate liberal pluralism and a post-modern conception of dissensus. Finally, these trials oscillate ambivalently between a redistributive vision of punishment that seeks to individually judge those responsible for the crimes in the name of the struggle against impunity, and the desire to establish, or re-establish, a nation by means of a historical trial, in the name of a consequentialist vision of punishment.

<p>The paper presents a mathematical model on the basis of which it is possible to define maximum compact well-separated constituencies, which can vary with respect to the number of voters by at most 5 per cent. The model is set up so as not to favor any political option and is based on the application of cluster-analysis, taking into account the rule according to which constituencies should have roughly the same number of voters. The method is illustrated [for Croatia] on the example of the available data from 2007. The distribution of constituencies then obtained should not be taken as the final solution proposal, but only as a demonstration of the possibilities offered by this methodology. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The complexity of social phenomena and mechanisms of government policies has resulted in the expansion of the public sphere to include a vast set of collective actors in the production of public services. The forms and processes of that participation have led to the creation of new organizational entities, usually described as networks. Given the centrality of the network form of government in this “enlarged” public sphere, the concepts of governance and network governance tend to coincide. The author discusses the forms and processes that characterize the “government by networks”, drawing on two theoretical sources, social network analysis and symbolic interactionism.

<p>In the course of the debate regarding the origin of nationalism, some scholars have argued that nationalism has filled the void left by historical religions.

First, he explores the sociological origins of the theory of nationalism as a religion of modernity deriving from Durkheim's sociology of religion. Second, he provides an overview of the different versions of this theory. Finally, he assesses the weaknesses of these approaches and proposes an alternative theoretical framework in which to reconsider the relationships between secularization and nationalism.

<p>[Several] authors—e.g., A. Lijphart, L. Hill and B. Engelen—have recently advocated compulsory voting. It is often said that such measures are necessary to realise democracy fully, for instance ensuring that everyone casts one vote. This argument rests on the commonly-held assumption that low turnout is a problem for democracies—a claim that the present article resists. I argue that democracy as it should be understood requires only that citizens have the opportunity to exercise power. I show that the right to vote can be valuable, even if it is not actually exercised. Leaving people to decide for themselves whether or not to vote is not only more liberal but democratic insofar as it respects their choices and makes it more likely that decisions are made by the relevant constituency.

<p>Due to the euro crisis, the executive has been strengthened and financial flows have become more vertical.

<p>This study introduces the new concept of targeted partnership, which encourages robust dialogue between military officers and policy-makers to create and implement effective military strategy such as counterinsurgency. Targeted partnership is a distillate form of concordance theory or agreement involving reciprocity between the military, political elites, and society for a limited period of time to accomplish a very specific objective. Targeted partnership may involve the temporary co-mingling of military, political, and societal boundaries even when the broader institutional and cultural relationship between military and society may be one of separation. In other words, separation and integration may exist at the same time for very specific reasons central to a nation's foreign policy. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Connections between global governance and poverty are usually made in relation to what are loosely called “poor countries” of the “global south”. However, global governance also significantly shapes dynamics of impoverishment in “rich countries” of the “global north”. These impacts become all the more apparent when global governance is understood to involve not only well-known intergovernmental agencies such as the UN and the WTO, but also additional institutional forms such as transgovernmental networks and private regulatory mechanisms. This broad complex of global governance has often exacerbated poverty in the global north, for example through neglect of the issue, through marginalization of the people affected, and through the promotion of neoliberal policy frames.

<p>The point of departure for this article is the realization that the regional dimensions of international society have not been conceptualized adequately by IR scholars. One consequence of this is that what could have been understood as regionally-led change has been framed as revolutionary exceptions or imperialist drives for power aggregation.

<p>From the Paris Commune to the Red Shirt uprising in Bangkok, revolutionaries lacking the power to overthrow their states or depose unpopular politicians have captured parts of major cities and formed their own temporary enclaves of resistance. These groups create intra-urban borders by building barricades, arming themselves, and fighting to protect their space. The borders, while temporary and usually ineffective, are powerful symbols as they separate a sphere of active resistance from territory under state control. While these borders stand, they are challenges to state power—lines marking the limits of what states can control. This essay looks at how these borders arise and how they relate to more familiar types of borders. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>An important objection to the idea of public reason is that it permits and perhaps encourages citizens to give insincere justifications for their political decisions. Against this objection, I defend a principle of sincere public justification. First, I claim that political justifications must be public in two senses. They must be (1) based on shared reasons and (2) presented in public discourse. Actual publicity is valuable for many reasons, but I focus on its ability to improve the quality of political decisions. After defining the concept of sincerity and guarding against a form of skepticism about it, I offer a principle of sincere public justification. I then defend that principle against two alternatives and show how it can be used to answer the objection that public reason encourages insincere political justification. [A]</p>

<p>This paper argues that development studies could benefit from a closer engagement with the arguments of Karl Polanyi. Firstly, a Polanyian perspective gives greater weight to non-economic and non-material factors in making, maintaining and modifying markets. Secondly, it focuses research on the problematic, state-sponsored and contested process of bringing the market actor into being. Finally, a Polanyian approach might better link a, broadly speaking, leftist analysis to “real world” policy debates about the relative balance between market freedoms and regulation. The conclusion elaborates this final point. [R]</p>

<p>Politics is a game and a spectacle, reported by the media and followed by an audience (or, a specific fraction of the general audience). Attention is sollicited by the symbols, the stakes and the aims of politics. People, ideas or objects may become political symbols.

Thus, political symbols brings to the fore political language, discourse and interpretation, equally important now against the background of political institutions and actions.

<p>How do we know whether a country suffers from vertical fiscal imbalance (VFI)? What should be done about it? Academic appreciation of these issues in general, and the nature of political behavior in particular, both have major implications for the way federations are fiscally structured. While the latter clearly is a problem of political negotiations, our focus is on conceptual clarity, which precedes meaningful negotiations. Thus, the paper clarifies the multiple usages of the symbolically loaded terms VFI and VFG (vertical fiscal gap) by critically engaging the fundamental assumptions and premises underlying these ostensibly similar notions. It proposes an alternative conceptual framework and introduces the concepts of vertical fiscal asymmetry (VFA) and vertical fiscal difference (VFD) that have the potential to better structure public debate on issues of vertical fiscal relations.

<p>What makes some wars longer and more severe than others is an important question in IR scholarship. One underexplored answer is the role that third-party joiners play in lengthening conflicts, especially those states that intervene militarily after a war's initial stages. This article argues that late joining complicates bargaining by adding new issues to the war and increases uncertainty about the relative balance of forces. Thus, more information will be needed to resolve the bargaining impasse. This means additional fighting and a longer war. This lengthening in turn increases the number of casualties. This is a distinct process from simply having more participants in a war from the outset. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Corruption is a worldwide problem that disproportionately affects those with the fewest personal and economic resources. It was hypothesized that human development restricts corruption, and the magnitude of such an effect is contingent upon the conditions of national culture. Measures were gathered for 68 countries that account for 80% of the world's population. Support was found for the main effect of human development on corruption. Consistent with contingency theory, results also indicate that the relation between human development and corruption is moderated by power distance and individualism. Implications for policy-making to reduce corruption are discussed. [R]</p>

<p>Parties can elicit widespread electoral support by making the distribution of prizes or rewards to groups of voters contingent upon electoral support. In addition to altering which party wins, a voter's choice also influences the distribution of prizes. This latter factor, referred to in this article as prize pivotalness, tends to be the dominant influence in vote choice. The desire to win prizes can induce voters to coalesce into a highly supportive group, even if they dislike the party's policies. Characterizing voting equilibria in this framework explains the rationale for the support of patronage parties, variance in voter turnout and the endogenous political polarization of groups in both established and new democracies.

It refuses to employ coercion as means of influencing or dictating the outcome of dialogue.

Drawing on the gatekeeping literature, and utilizing a new automated content-analytic procedure, this article portrays both media content and “reality” as distributions of information. Measuring these allows us to identify the mechanism by which the distribution of information in the real world is transformed into the distribution of information in media; we can identify the gatekeeping function. Reporting on unemployment serves as a test case. Subsequent analyses focus on inflation and interest rates and on differences across [US] Democratic and Republican presidencies. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Does membership in intergovernmental organizations help developing countries enhance their environmental performance? This article argues that IGO membership can improve the environmental performance of developing countries, by linking different issues, promoting the general idea of environmental sustainability and providing a channel through which these countries receive technologies and resources necessary to reduce pollution. This argument has been tested on panel data for 114 developing countries in 1970–2000. The results confirm that, controlling for a country's income and its political system, IGO membership is indeed associated with a reduction in both air pollution and greenhouse gases. To understand the mechanisms behind this result better, IGO membership is disaggregated according to both function and the degree of institutionalization of the respective organization. [R]</p>

<p>Ethnic insurgents sometimes defect to join forces with the state during civil wars. Ethnic defection can have important effects on conflict outcomes, but its causes have been understudied. Using Sunni defection in Iraq as a theory-developing case, this article offers a theory of “fratricidal flipping” that identifies lethal competition between insurgent factions as an important cause of defection. It examines the power of the fratricidal-flipping mechanism against competing theories in the cases of Kashmir and Sri Lanka. These wars involve within-conflict variation in defection across groups and over time. A detailed study of the empirical record, including significant fieldwork, suggests that fratricide was the dominant trigger for defection, while government policy played a secondary role in facilitating pro-state paramilitarism.

<p>Ontological reflexivity is consistently posited as an important part of being a political scientist, yet the relevant literature has been criticized for being both complex and confused. In this context, the article has three aims: to clarify the purpose of ontology in the discipline; to highlight how ontological assumptions cannot be separated from other factors; and to show the relevance of ontological reflexivity. While the extant literature implies that such assumptions emerge from philosophical reflection, this article shows how epistemological decisions, mundane interests and political orientation can be just as important. Consequently, the original aims of the literature can be reinstated. [R]</p>

<p>Political theorists responding to concerns about citizen behavior in democratic politics might turn to the literature on public reason: idealized citizens are expected to abide by what we call the “public-reason-giving requirement” when engaging in political acts. We examine what the doctrine of public reason has to say to political actors in non-ideal democratic circumstances. We find that the recommendations for actual behavior in this literature rely heavily upon a forward- and backward-looking “Janus-faced” justification, focused on the way in which non-reason-giving political actions have or could serve the long-term interests of public reason itself. We suggest that public reason has nothing meaningful to say to contemporary political actors, a serious flaw in a putative standard for political behavior; the liberal commitment to “public reason” [in] non-ideal circumstances is misplaced.

<p>Civilization has been built on a set of rules, never fully rationally understood by citizens: the evolution of norms and social institutions cannot be understood through reason. Denying that, socialism replaces the individual with social morality and spontaneous order with the particular; freedom is thus removed in favor of arbitrary action. Identifying the constitutive elements of spontaneous order, [the author] argues that only reality offers the possibility to manage tacit knowledge, so as to best use the available resources and thus, produce prosperity within a free society. This can become reality only if the state takes the shape of a minimal one. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4460]</p>

<p>We investigate the relation between knowledge and political action, focusing on knowledge claims stemming from science that at the same time have relevance in a policy context.

We arrive at a distinction between knowledge for practice and practical knowledge, which we briefly apply to the case of climate-change science and policy. We state as our thesis that policy is ever more reliant on knowledge, but science can deliver ever less certainty. Political decisions and programs have to recognize this fact, either implicitly or explicitly. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Recent research provides evidence that economic integration has a negative effect on electoral turnout. This article explores the causal chain in more detail. One way by which economic integration affects the calculus of voting is through the positioning of political parties. The expectation is that the polarization between parties on an economic left-right scale is lower the more integrated an economy is. Consequently, electoral turnout should be lower with less polarization in the party system. The article employs aggregate-level data from legislative elections in 24 developed democracies. Using data from the Comparative Manifestos Project, evidence is found not only that economic integration has a negative effect on party polarization as measured on an economic left-right dimension, but also that this in turn exerts a negative effect on electoral turnout.

<p>Is it coherent and morally attractive to attribute corporate responsibility to states, as is currently done in international law? Although it makes sense to treat states as moral persons, we cannot assume that the will of the citizen is implicated in his state in a way that requires him to bear a share of responsibility for its acts. Where citizens have established some voluntary connection with their state, they may share in responsibility for what the state has done. A fully developed approach to state responsibility would thus invoke multiple principles for distributing state responsibility, according to the relative constitutional context.

<p>This article extends the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) by presenting new global data on non-state conflict, or armed conflict between two groups, neither of which is a state. The dataset includes conflicts between rebel groups and other organized militias, and thus serves as a complement to existing datasets on armed conflict which have either ignored this kind of violence or aggregated it into civil war. This thus extends UCDP's conflict data-collection to facilitate the study of topics like rebel fractionalization, paramilitary involvement in conflict violence, and communal or ethnic conflict. We present a background to the data collection and provide descriptive statistics for the period 1989–2008 and then illustrate how the data can be used in the case of Somalia. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This paper critically explores the growing assertiveness with which liberalism has approached the just use of force since 9/11 [2001]. The liberal position claims that a liberal-cosmopolitan respect for human rights forces us to reconsider the conservative, generally prohibitive, position on the use of force defended by traditional just war theory and enshrined in international law. This argument is has been most fully developed by A. Buchanan, [whose] position forms the basis for the critique of the assertive cosmopolitan attitude to the use of force that is offered [here]. Both the just war tradition and those who theorize the ethics of the law of armed conflict have taken the moral and political reality of human rights seriously but there remain compelling reasons to defend a conservative approach to the use of force.

<p>This paper explores the relationship between normative international political theory and the politics of international law. It argues that a gap between the normative (in moral terms) and the moral (in legal and social terms) still exists in the literature before examining an approach to closing this gap. This approach is common to a plurality of theoretical approaches including liberal cosmopolitanism, social constructivism and forms of particularism. In exploring “institutional moral reasoning” or “social moral epistemology”, the paper argues that respecting the institutional autonomy of the international legal order is a key component of the approach. In order to test the extent to which the various positions do respect the autonomy of the legal order, the paper considers] the extent to which human rights have become the key constitutive norm of global politics.

<p>Many organizations in both public and private sectors have recognized the challenge posed by climate change and have developed “Climate Champion”, “Green Team” or “Environmental Coordinator” schemes. On the basis of interviews with 36 champions in large organizations and analysis of their role as “environmental citizens” in the workplace, it is argued that, overall, the champions are thoroughly embedded in a neoliberal understanding of social change. They conceived of their colleagues (and their employers) as neoliberal agents and accepted that a neoliberal ethic should govern their relations with others. However, when asked about their own motivations for action, champions used a much wider range of discourses. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.5238]</p>

<p>Reading the signs of the times is one of the chief arts of leadership, not just in the race to become elected, but it also shapes leaders' abilities to consummate the authority associated with these roles: what ideas to push, which battles to wage, which problems to address and which to ignore. To make convictions matter, you need to be an opportunist. Leaders should not so much ask what the problem is, but rather what the story is, in order to think about themselves and how they fit in. Thinking in time allows leaders to make better-informed judgments about whether and where the times will suit them.</p>

Does Proportional Representation lead to higher budget deficits? Do majoritarian systems lead to more or less political violence?

<p>We argue that welfare spending contributes to sustaining peace because the provision of social services reduces grievances by offsetting the effects of poverty and inequality in society. Welfare spending serves as an indication of the commitment of the government to social services and reflects its priorities and dedication to citizens. By enacting welfare policies that improve the living standards of citizens, governments can co-opt the political opposition and decrease the incentives for organizing a rebellion. Time-series, cross-national data for the 1975–2005 period indicate that as the level of the government investment in welfare policies (i.e. education, health, and social security) increases, the likelihood of civil conflict onset declines significantly, controlling for several other covariates of internal conflict.

<p>The ability of nations to innovate technologically plays an important causal role in both security studies and IPE. Explanations for national differences in technological capabilities, however, have had little place in IR theory. This gap is partly the result of assumptions made by scholars that the rate and direction of technological change are determined by a state's domestic institutions and policies. This article brings together recent findings about the political economy of technological innovation in order to show that much of this conventional wisdom is incorrect. Instead, due to the distributive nature of technological change, different combinations of domestic tensions and external security concerns motivate elites to pursue or eschew a technologically competitive economy. Institutions are not causal, they are merely instrumental. [R, abr.]</p>

The aim is to the restate the importance of awarding conceptual positivity to passions when it comes to political affairs, and to confirm the need of making proper room to their expression in public spheres.

<p>Much of the literature on political representation provides empirical evidence that elections successfully link the policy preferences of citizens to the policy preferences of their representatives in parliament and to public policy. However, most of these studies are based on the congruence on the left-right dimension rather than on specific issues. Using empirical data from the Netherlands, we show that on specific issues, elections seem to fail as an instrument to connect the policy preferences of a large part of the electorate to the policy positions of their representatives because these issues are poorly related to the left-right dimension.

<p>Public policies are public actions carried out in a minimal institutional framework or in a welfare state. Determining the boundaries of public space is a complex action that depends on the actors involved, on how resources are allocated, on the demand for proposals, on the degree of economic development or the provision of features such as social justice or gaining power in electoral competitions. The article seeks to outline the characteristics of the minimal state and of the welfare state from the perspective of public versus private space, and to analyze their flaws and failures. Creating a such institutional construct becomes a challenge beyond ideological lines, as long as, it is almost impossible to establish it in practice. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4460]</p>

<p>This article develops a theory of bureaucratic influence on distributive politics. In the model, legislators bargain over the allocation of distributive benefits across districts. The legislature may either “politicize” a program by bargaining directly over pork and bypassing bureaucratic scrutiny, or “professionalize” it by letting a bureaucrat approve or reject project funding in each district according to an underlying quality standard. The model predicts that the legislature will professionalize when the expected program quality is high. However, politicization becomes more likely as the number of high-quality projects increases and under divided government. Further, more competent bureaucrats can encourage politicization if the expected program quality is low. Finally, politicized programs are larger than professionalized programs. [R, abr.]</p>

After describing our methodology for selecting and analyzing the case studies profiled in the symposium, we introduce the articles that apply our three-dimensional governance framework.

<p>The theme of power is perhaps the most dramatic issue that society must face. it is inevitably so, because society imposes an organizational and institutional process summoning the idea of a government in which not everyone can participate, with the resulting difference between the “governors” and the “governed”.

Considering the increasing importance of individual identity through history, new demands are involved in the democratic process, and government itself takes on a general, if not generic, dimension; with a series of dilemmas that need to be addressed and that prove to be fundamental for the future of the democratic “discourse”.

<p>This article rethinks the operation of norms in international policy diffusion. Norms do not simply standardize state behaviors, as is conventionally argued; norms also draw on and set up hierarchical social orders among states. Through a conceptual rethinking we gain a better understanding of where—among which states—new policies may first emerge: social hierarchies create incentives for new policies to develop at the margins of international society so that policies may diffuse “from below”. This article's empirical aspiration is to use these insights to help account for the international policy diffusion of legal sex quotas, a policy to increase the level of female legislators that developed first among “developing” states rather than among the so-called core of international society.

Theories are distinguished based on their theoretical and empirical progressiveness, as well as progressive intra-program problem-shifts. A Lakatosian framework enables seemingly inconsistent hypotheses to be grafted onto an existing research program, which can be determined to be progressive if they provide increased explanatory power and novel predictions that receive empirical corroboration.

<p>This article describes and analyzes patterns of “governance conversation” observed in interactions on e-mail lists that aim to support local, direct governance in a geographically co-located community in South Africa. It examines the extent to which governance conversations feature instrumental or expressive dialogue and how they subsequently support consensual or pluralist outcomes. Although each conversation pattern relates to governance, the making of consensual, “binding decisions”, which is usually seen as a key outcome of deliberative democratic processes, is almost entirely absent from the observed interactions. Nonetheless, the exchanges appear to be relevant and useful to the broader process of local direct deliberative governance. The results indicate that online interaction may be particularly suited to facilitating the pluralist deliberation required to manage complex local governance problems.

<p>Christianity understands freedom not as the freedom to do whatever one chooses, but as the freedom to do what is morally right. Freedom is to take responsibility for one's actions; hence the goal of human freedom is to live righteously and thus attain the fullness of one's dignity.

<p>This note demonstrates that in applied regression-analysis, the variance of a coefficient of interest may decrease from the inclusion of a control variable, contrasting with K. A. Clarke's assertion [“The phantom menace: omitted variable bias in political research”, <italic>ibid.</italic> 22(4), 2005: 341–352; “Return to the phantom menace”, <italic>ibid.</italic> 26(1), Feb. 2009: 46–66; <italic>Abstr.</italic> 59.7077] that the variance can only increase or stay the same. Practitioners may thus be well advised to include a relevant control variable on this basis alone, particularly when it is weakly correlated with the variable of interest. [R] [See K. A.

<p>Ethnic groups have tended to conflict since the beginning of the known human history, and the intensity of violent conflicts does not seem to have decreased during the last centuries. This paper argues that the universality of ethnic conflict can be traced to our common human nature, to our evolved disposition to ethnic nepotism. This hypothesis is tested by empirical evidence on a scale of institutionalized ethnic interest conflict (IC) and on a scale of ethnic violence (EV), which are intended to measure the degree of ethnic conflict from two different perspectives, and by the degree of ethnic heterogeneity (EH), which is used to measure ethnic nepotism, in a group of 176 contemporary countries.

<p>I argue that the rule of law consists of many dimensions and that much information is lost when variables proxying for these dimensions are simply aggregated. I draw on the most important innovations from various legal traditions to propose a concept of the rule of law likely to find general support. To make the concept measurable, an ideal approach is contrasted with a pragmatic one. The pragmatic approach consists of eight different dimensions. I show that the bivariate correlations between them are usually very low, evidence that more fine-grained indicators of the rule of law, rather than a single hard-to-interpret one, are necessary for its measurement. The paper presents a list of desirable variables that could improve the measurement of various aspects of the rule of law. [R]</p>
<p>62.4544 VOLMERT, Andrew — <bold>The puzzle of democratic authorization.</bold> <italic>Political Studies</italic> 60(2), June 2012: 287–305.</p>
<p>Most of the dominant versions of democratic theory conceive of political decisions as authorized by citizens, either directly or indirectly through their representatives, yet theorists rarely attend directly to the meaning of the concept of authorization itself. Theorists frequently debate the character of democratic authorization, yet they rarely ask the prior question of whether the concept of authorization can properly be applied to democratic citizens' conduct in the first place. After submitting the concept to critical scrutiny, the article reaches the surprising conclusion that, contrary to expectations, contemporary democratic practice cannot, strictly speaking, be properly characterized as a practice of citizen authorization at all. Although incorrect, there is an element of truth in the characterization of democratic decision-making as a practice of citizen authorization. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Building on scholarship [on] the link between participatory democracy and social movements, we show how some social movements have shifted their repertoire of practices from large mass events aimed at making demands on the national state to local-level capacity-building. It is the local struggles, especially the ways in which they have created and used institutions in civil society through extending and deepening democracy, that may be the most significant aspect of recent social movements, both for our theories and for our societies. Yet these aspects have received less attention because they are less well understood by dominant social movement theories. We look at the Brazilian Landless Workers Movement and the Justice for Janitors Campaign in Los Angeles to illustrate the important terrain of civil society as well as the role of community organizing.

<p>I argue that institutions in some kinds of dictatorships allow regime insiders to hold leaders accountable for their foreign policy decisions. However, the preferences and perceptions of these autocratic domestic audiences vary, with domestic audiences in civilian regimes being more skeptical of using military force than the military officers who form the core constituency in military juntas. In personalist regimes in which there is no effective domestic audience, no predictable mechanism exists for restraining or removing overly belligerent leaders, and leaders tend to be selected for personal characteristics that make them more likely to use military force. I combine these arguments to generate a series of hypotheses about the conflict behavior of autocracies and test the hypotheses using new measures of authoritarian regime type. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.4547 WELZEL, Christian; DEUTSCH, Franziska — <bold>Emancipative values and non-violent protest: the importance of “ecological” effects.</bold> <italic>British Journal of Political Science</italic> 42(2), Apr. 2012: 465–479.</p>
<p>This article examines the impact of values on a key phenomenon of modern politics: non-violent protest. Previous studies have examined only the individual-level effects of values. Studying in addition the “ecological” effects—how the social prevalence of values affects protest—generates new insights. Focusing on “emancipative values”, two ecological effects are shown: (1) the prevalence of emancipative values lifts people's protest above the level that their own emancipative values suggest (elevator effect); (2) the prevalence of these values enhances the impact of people's own emancipative values on protest (amplifier effect). We conclude that examining values in models of protest (and possibly of other activities), not only as individual attributes but also as ecological properties, gives “culture” its full weight in explaining behavior.

<p>62.4548 WILLIAMS, Laron K. — <bold>Pick your poison: economic crises, International Monetary Fund loans and leader survival.</bold> <italic>International Political Science Review</italic> 33(2), March 2012: 131–149.</p>
<p>Loans from international organizations impose large costs on the receiving nation. The decisions to accept such loans and then whether or not to implement the prescribed reforms are made with high stakes in mind. Domestic leaders are most likely facing punishment for the current economic crisis, but what is their incentive to implement the arrangements if the costly reforms associated with the loans may reduce their ability to satisfy their supporters? To fully understand this relationship, I develop a theory that explains leader tenure in the post-reform period as a function of the rational decision to accept a loan. With the use of a selection-duration model, I examine the interplay between electoral incentives and institutional dynamics to show that leaders governing under different institutional arrangements are affected differently for involvement in IMF loans.

<p>The issue of anti-missile defense needs to be analyzed together with that of ballistic missile proliferation and the threats it brings. The analysis should take into account the eviction from the club of major powers to which French abstention would lead. Only thus can it be seen in relation to the technological driving force it creates for the major industrialized countries. The author pleads for serious consideration of all these issues in discussion about [French] defense. [R] [First of a series of articles on antimissile defense.

<p>Drawing on quasi-experimental data from participants in structured and moderated deliberations on sexual minority rights in Poland, this study tests the relationship between attitude importance, certainty, intensity, and extremity. This study also examines the antecedents of these attributes and their consequences for several democratically important outcomes (i.e., perceived disagreement, negative affect, attitude polarization, self-reported polarization, argument repertoire, and political participation). This study further asks whether these attributes exert different effects [from] a composite attitude-strength index. Although factor-analysis suggests that these attributes represent one construct, they are differently affected by deliberation and exert differential effects. The analyses further reveal that relying on the composite index obscures substantial information and inaccurately represents strength-related processes and functions. Theoretical, methodological, and practical implications are discussed. [R]</p>
<p>62.4551 WRIGHT, Joseph; ESCRIBÁ-FOLCH, Abel — <bold>Authoritarian institutions and regime survival: transitions to democracy and subsequent autocracy.</bold> <italic>British Journal of Political Science</italic> 42(2), Apr. 2012: 283–309.</p>
<p>This article examines how authoritarian parties and legislatures affect regime survival. While authoritarian legislatures increase the stability of dictators, political parties—even when devised to quell internal threats—can destabilize dictators. The main argument is that authoritarian parties influence the distribution of power in a subsequent new democracy by helping to protect the interests of authoritarian elites. These institutions thus increase the likelihood of democratization. Using a dataset of authoritarian regimes in 108 countries from 1946 to 2002 and accounting for simultaneity, the analysis models transitions to democracy and to a subsequent authoritarian regime. Results indicate that authoritarian legislatures are associated with a lower probability of transition to a subsequent dictatorship. Authoritarian parties, however, are associated with a higher likelihood of democratization. [R]</p>

<p>The use of peacekeeping to manage conflicts in the international system has grown since the end of the Cold War. While much attention has been devoted to what makes peacekeeping successful, the outcome of peacekeeping is ultimately tied to the willingness of the intervening actor(s) to “stay the course” and continue the mission until its objectives are complete. We focus upon the empirical puzzle of peacekeeping missions' sustainability. After states and international organizations overcome the collective action problem of forming a mission and deploying it, it is puzzling that so many missions drop out before completion. We adopt a competing-risks framework in our analysis to identify the forces that determine whether peacekeepers stay until the end of a conflict or withdraw early. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article examines the practices, logics, and politics of <italic>foie gras</italic> production and consumption. It argues that scholars need to rethink both pain and sentience to account for the fact that ducks are responsive, and not just reactive. Rather than using the capacities of animals to judge when power relations between species are acceptable, it suggests that scholars should start with the power relations themselves to account for how animal and human experiences are made.

<p>The uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, and elsewhere have been credited in part to the creative use of social media platforms such as <italic>Facebook</italic> and <italic>Twitter.</italic> Yet the information policies of the firms behind social media can inhibit activists and empower authoritarian regimes.
