<abstract>
<p>In the aftermath of many disasters the silence is punctuated by the crying of infants, hungry infants. The aim of this paper is to discuss ethical issues in feeding infants after disasters. The Asia Pacific region generates 25% of the world’s GDP, but experiences 45% of natural disasters and 42% of the economic losses due to disasters. The region has 61% of the world’s population, but 86% of the population affected by disasters. Breastfeeding, exclusive to six months and continuing thereafter, is important for growth and the health of the infant in the short term and later in life. In most natural disasters, mothers and infants will both suffer, but in some disasters, such as earthquakes and building collapses, infants can survive in small spaces. Infants separated from mothers require a wet nurse (rarely available) or feeding with infant formula and sterile water. Formula companies often donate supplies of infant formula but distribution should follow ethical principles. Mothers who are injured or short of food can still continue breastfeeding and don’t need formula. Where formula must be used, health workers need to follow the highest ethical standards to avoid promoting infant formula to vulnerable communities in the post recovery phase.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 2007, the <italic>Asia Pacific Journal of Public Health</italic> published a special issue on disasters with an introduction titled “Listening to the silence: doing better at responding to disasters.” This special issue was in response to the 2004 Asian tsunami and other tragedies. But the title is not always correct. In many disasters, the silence is punctuated by the crying of infants—hungry infants. Crying infants are usually hungry infants who need to be fed. Infant feeding is one of the rare public health issues about which there is almost universal agreement on the appropriate recommendation. WHO, UNICEF, and almost all national health authorities recommend exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months of age. These principles are a key part of the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI). There is a high level of risk attached to the use of infant formula and other breast milk substitutes, particularly in countries where there is no universal supply of clean water and where there are no refrigerators for storage.</p>
<p>Some of the disadvantages of not breastfeeding include the following:</p>

<p>These risks of not breastfeeding apply to countries at all stages of economic development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539512453253">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539512453253">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this article is to discuss the appropriate and ethical way of feeding infants after disasters. We first present 3 case studies, followed by a discussion of the difficult ethical implications confronting those attempting to provide food and nutrition for infants in disaster situations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1010539512453253" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A literature search was undertaken for studies of the public health responses to the care of infants following several recent disasters. The databases included PubMed, CINAHL, and Science Direct. Keywords included the following: disaster, disaster response, Asia Pacific, infants, infant feeding, and infant formula. Constraints on the publications retrieved included English language and publication since the disasters described in this article. The 3 disasters discussed as case studies in this article are the Jogjakarta earthquake of 2006, the Wenchuan earthquake (Sichuan Province, 2008), and the north-east Japan earthquake and tsunami of 2009.</p>

<title>The Jogjakarta Earthquake</title>
<p>Many Asian countries are prone to disaster because of their location, geology, and large populations. Indonesia has a large number of active volcanoes, and many parts are prone to earthquakes and tsunamis. Hipgrave et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539512453253">5</xref></sup> have documented 1 disaster and its aftermath in Jogjakarta Indonesia. “On 27 May 2006, an earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale devastated the provinces of Yogyakarta and Central Java, killing about 6000 people and injuring another 40 000–60 000.” In addition hundreds of thousands lost their homes and employment. A month after the earthquake, UNICEF undertook a survey to monitor the distribution of emergency supplies and the nutritional impact on the affected children.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Contrary to the relevant operational guidelines that provide detailed instructions on the procurement, handling and use of donated breast milk substitutes such as infant formula, powdered milk and complementary foods, such commodities were widely distributed to families with infants and young children. Many of these products were supplied in bulk, with no instructions to relief workers on targeting, their safe use or screening of recipient families’ needs. The channels of distribution included their inclusion in the general ration given to affected households, and handouts at temporary and fixed health facilities and temporary shelters. The donated breast milk substitutes were described by donors, distributors and the media as providing essential nutrition for infants. The mothers in the earthquake area were considered less likely to breastfeed “because of stress, injury, pre-occupation with damage to property and loss of privacy.” In the survey undertaken by UNICEF it was found that 75% of households with an infant aged 0–5 months and 80% of all households surveyed received donated infant formula; 76% of all households received commercial porridge and 49% received powdered milk. Only 32% of the 0–5-month-old infants living in the area had consumed formula before the earthquake, but 43% had in the 24 hours preceding the survey (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Consumption of all types of donated breast milk substitutes was significantly higher among those who received donated commodities, regardless of age (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The one-week diarrhoea incidence among those who received donated infant formula (25.4%) was higher than among those who did not (11.5%); (relative risk = 2.12, 95% CI 1.34, 3.35). The rate of diarrhoea among those aged 12–23 months was around five times the pre-earthquake rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539512453253">5</xref></sup>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There were strong associations between receipt of BMS (Breastmilk substitute) and changes in feeding practices and between receipt of infant formula and diarrhea. The authors concluded that the uncontrolled distribution of infant formula exacerbates the risk of diarrhea among infants and young children in emergencies.</p>

<title>2008 Wenchuan Earthquake (Sichuan Province)</title>
<p>The People’s Republic of China has a land area of approximately 9.6 million km<sup>2</sup> with a population of 1.33 billion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539512453253">6</xref></sup> In 2005, the average life expectancy was 73.0 years, which is an improvement of 8 years in the past 2 decades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539512453253">6</xref></sup> The mortality of children younger than 5 years of age was 18.5 per thousand but was lower in urban areas (7.9 per thousand) than in rural areas (22.7 per thousand).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539512453253">6</xref></sup> Sichuan Province is a predominantly agricultural province in the west of China, known as the <italic>Province of Abundance</italic>. Sichuan is famous for its natural beauty and historical places and an abundance of plants and animals. The iconic panda lives in the mountains of Sichuan Province. At the end of 2007, the population of Sichuan Province was 87 million, and its per capita income was $US 1550 per year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539512453253">7</xref></sup> The majority of residents (about 95%) are from the Han ethnic group, with a population of 4.22 million from another 55 ethnic groups. Chengdu (population 11 million), located in the central Sichuan Province, is the capital city of Sichuan and has a recorded history of more than 2500 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539512453253">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In May 2008, an earthquake measuring 8.0 on the Richter magnitude scale hit Sichuan Province, killing at least 69 000 people and leaving more than 18 000 missing. More than 5 million buildings and houses collapsed, resulting in millions of people becoming homeless. The area of destruction in the Wenchuan region extended along a 300-km long surface rupture that occurred in the Longmen Mountains along its margin with the Sichuan Basin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539512453253">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The large human toll of this disaster was caused by the location of towns built on or in proximity to fault lines; the low earthquake resistance of residences, schools, hospitals, and other buildings; and the concentration of population distributed along rivers lying below steep-sloped mountains. Mortality and injury were increased by postearthquake landslides. The response of the Chinese government was immediate and most impressive with 20 000 troops and rescue workers deployed within 48 hours. But even more remarkable was the number of volunteers who came from all over China to assist, numbering up to 10 million.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539512453253">8</xref></sup> As a component of the rescue efforts, large quantities of infant formula were donated by infant formula companies for distribution through hospitals and clinics</p>
<p>Then, 2 years after the earthquake, infant nutrition studies were undertaken in Chengdu and Jiangyou. The city of Jiangyou itself is relatively small (approximately 250 000 people) and is surrounded by mountainous areas, which suffered extensive earthquake damage. In Jiangyou, nearly 400 people died, 10 000 were injured, and more than 100 people are still missing following the earthquake. Many buildings collapsed in Jiangyou or became too dangerous to inhabit, making 350 000 people in the city and surrounding area homeless. Although the construction of new housing and civic buildings in the earthquake area has proceeded at a remarkable rate, thousands of people in Jiangyou are still living in prefabricated and other temporary housing. One year after the earthquake UNICEF estimated that assistance was reaching nearly 4000 villages and towns, covering a total population of 5 million, including 300 000 infants and young children younger than the age of 5 years.</p>
<p>A cohort of 695 mothers in Jiangyou and in Chengdu were interviewed soon after birth. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1010539512453253">Table 1</xref>. Of the sample of 1516 infants, 91% were given something other than breast milk as their first feed. There were no published data available of prelacteal feed rates in Chengdu or Jiangyou prior to the earthquake. It is not possible to say if the extraordinarily high rate of prelacteal feeds is of recent origin. However, staff at the local hospitals note that large quantities of infant formula were provided to the hospitals after the earthquake and that supplies have continued to be supplied. In a city of relatively similar size to Chengdu—Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province—the rate of prelacteal feeds was 26%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539512453253">9</xref></sup> However, because of the lack of predisaster data no conclusion can be reached as to whether the suggestive evidence of a change in prelacteal feeding patterns is correct.</p>

<title>The 2009 Northeast Japan Earthquake and Tsunami</title>
<p>On March 11, 2011, a huge earthquake (9.0 on the Richter Scale) occurred off the northeast coast of Japan. A tsunami warning was issued and was soon followed by a massive tsunami that engulfed the coast of eastern Japan, including parts of Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures. The flooding engulfed homes, schools, and public buildings and devastated infrastructure. Most notably, the Fukushima nuclear power plants were severely damaged by the tsunami and were further damaged on March 12 by a hydrogen gas explosion. Radioactive discharge from the damaged nuclear plants contaminated the surrounding land and sea. Aftershocks caused additional damage to cities and industrial complexes hindering recovery from the initial earthquake. The earthquake and tsunami caused 15 741 deaths; 4467 people were missing and 271 957 houses were destroyed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539512453253">10</xref></sup> Approximately 450 000 people were evacuated to safer areas. The Japanese Government immediately activated its emergency response system and established Disaster Management Headquarters and Nuclear Power Disaster Management Headquarters. The Disaster Management Headquarters gathered information, coordinated relief, and reestablished public services in conjunction with the prefectures, NGOs, and international agencies.</p>
<p>The Miyagi, Iwate, and Fukushima prefectures requested support for infant nutrition, and 3 major Japanese formula milk production companies responded to the request and donated more than 50 000 cans of infant formula milk through the Japanese Daily Industry Association.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539512453253">11</xref></sup> Infant formula was categorized differently from other general foods among the emergency supplies. During the acute phase, it was difficult to send emergency supplies because of severe damage to the transportation system. The donated infant formula was sent by alternate methods using the ships of the Fisheries Agency and Self Defense Force Helicopters. Health sections of municipalities were advised by the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry that in distributing infant formula, they should follow the guidelines that support infants and mothers. In the recovery phase, the survivors and evacuees have returned gradually to their home areas where municipalities and supporters are providing them with living facilities.</p>
<p>In late March, radioactive iodine levels higher than the safety standards was detected in the water supplies in the Fukushima prefecture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539512453253">12</xref></sup> The affected municipal government recommended that infants not drink tap water and commenced distributing bottled water to households with infants. Mothers in the stricken area were concerned about continuing breastfeeding because of maternal exposure to radiation. The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare measured concentrations of radioactive iodine and cesium in breast milk samples from 23 mothers from the Tohoku and Kanto regions on April.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539512453253">13</xref></sup> The concentrations of radio isotopes were below detectable levels or were present in amounts too small to influence the health of recipient infants. NGOs and academic associations with an interest in infant nutrition, including the Japanese Associations of Obstetrics and Pediatrics, the UNICEF Tokyo office, and the Japan Association of Lactation Consultant and the Japanese Council for Breastfeeding have promoted breastfeeding in the stricken area through Web sites, declarations, and the actions of their members. However, the effect of distributing large amounts of infant formula in the relief areas on immediate and future breastfeeding rates is unknown. There is now a need for follow-up monitoring of the nutritional impact on the affected mothers and children to ensure that these public health measures to protect breastfeeding were successful.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1010539512453253" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although these 3 earthquakes extracted huge human tolls, the magnitudes of the Wenchuan and northeast Japan earthquakes were similar, but yet the death and injury rates in China were considerably larger. This reflects not only geographical location and population densities but also the level of disaster preparedness. The strict construction codes in Japan meant that relatively fewer were killed by the earthquake in Japan.</p>
<p>Breastfeeding is the normal way to feed all infants. Ideally, the aim is for exclusive breastfeeding until around 6 months of age and continued breastfeeding for 12 months and beyond. There is convincing evidence that being breastfed in infancy is associated with optimal lifetime health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539512453253">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539512453253">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539512453253"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539512453253">16</xref></sup> The principle of the baby-friendly hospital—the joint WHO-UNICEF BFHI, launched in 1991—seeks to eliminate hospital practices that may interfere with successful initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539512453253">17</xref></sup> One of the 10 steps of the BFHI states “give newborn infants no food or drink other than breast milk, unless medically indicated.” This principle is reiterated in the WHO guidelines on the use of infant formula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539512453253">18</xref></sup> WHO and UNICEF both emphasize the importance of initiating breastfeeding as soon as possible after birth with no other feeds. There are a number of guidelines available for the feeding of infants after natural disasters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539512453253">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539512453253"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539512453253">21</xref></sup> All the guidelines emphasize the importance of preserving and promoting breastfeeding and the precautions that need to be followed in the distribution of infant formula after disasters.</p>
<p>Both the Jogjakarta earthquake and the Sichuan earthquakes were the subject of UNICEF reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539512453253">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539512453253">22</xref></sup> However, whereas the Jogjakarta report emphasized infants and the adverse effects of infant formula distribution, the China report makes no mention of infant formula distribution and its effects. A search of the literature found that there had been 194 articles published in the health/medical literature relating to the Sichuan earthquake up to August 2011. Not a single article documents the infant feeding arrangements after the earthquake.</p>
<p>After a disaster, there is a need for immediate action. The time for planning and discussion of ethical issues is now—before the next major disaster occurs. The Asia Pacific region has 45% of the reported natural disasters, and whereas it generates 25% of the world’s GDP, it has suffered 42% of the economic losses caused by disasters. The region has 61% of the world’s population but has 86% of the total population affected by disasters.</p>
<p>There is no longer any doubt about the inevitability of climate change. Climate change over the next 30 years is going to have a serious impact on food production, by decreasing food production in some regions and increasing it in other areas. Particularly after 2050, food production will move further north and south and many populations closer to the equator will be vulnerable to food shortages, public health impacts, and population displacements. The poorer populations in the developing world will suffer most from climate change, food shortages, and population displacement. This is likely to increase malnutrition in some areas and increase the potential for conflicts over resources. The public health impact of disasters will continue to increase because of the increased frequency of disasters resulting from climate change and the increased concentrations of populations, including those in areas prone to damage from natural disasters. There will be increasing numbers of cities in earthquake zones or in areas close to tsunami prone coasts.</p>
<p>In most natural disasters, mothers and infants will both suffer, but in some disasters, such as earthquakes and building collapses, infants may be able to survive in small spaces. Infants separated from their mothers require a wet nurse (rarely available) or feeding with infant formula and sterile water. Formula companies are often prepared to donate or discount supplies of infant formula. The distribution of these supplies should be done in an ethical way. Mothers who are injured or short of food can usually still continue breastfeeding, and formula should not be given. The mothers should be supported instead. Where formula must be used, health workers and suppliers need to follow the highest ethical standards to avoid promoting infant formula to vulnerable communities in the postrecovery phase. The best option would be if required infant formula supplies were distributed by UNICEF or international aid agencies in plain label cans. But in reality, the major international companies have better logistics management. For example, after Hurricane Katrina, Walmart began to restock its supermarkets in New Orleans before the official US government agencies were able to begin their relief efforts. Usually, companies want recognition and publicity for their aid work, creating an ethical dilemma during an emergency when there is no time for debate.</p>
<p>This is a need for the promotion of a strong ethical basis for infant nutrition in the immediate- and longer-term management of disaster recovery. One of the ethical principles for the care of children proposed by the World Medical Association states, “Nutrition for proper growth, development and long-term health.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539512453253">23</xref></sup> Article 24 of the UN Rights of the Child convention includes the following statement:
<disp-quote>
<p>States Parties shall pursue full implementation of this right and, in particular, shall take appropriate measures:</p>
<p>(a) To diminish infant and child mortality;</p>
<p>(b) To ensure the provision of necessary medical assistance and health care to all children with emphasis on the development of primary health care;</p>
<p>(c) To combat disease and malnutrition, including within the framework of primary health care, through, inter alia, the application of readily available technology and through the provision of adequate nutritious foods and clean drinking-water, taking into consideration the dangers and risks of environmental pollution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539512453253">24</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These statements emphasize the importance of promoting health and nutrition for all children, and this means preserving breastfeeding if at all possible.</p>
<p>Countries should prepare for disaster relief, including making arrangements for infant formula supplies. Infant formula should be distributed in ways that do not increase the promotion of artificial feeding at the expense of breastfeeding, such as in plain packaging and only by health professionals. More emphasis should be placed on the support of breastfeeding mothers. After the acute phase of disaster management, excess supplies of infant formula should be withdrawn.</p>
<p>Courses on disasters and disaster management have become more common in US universities and are increasing in the Asia Pacific region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539512453253">25</xref></sup> In the United States, this surge of interest in emergency management and disaster response followed the 9/11 disaster and Hurricane Katrina and, internationally, the Indonesian/Indian Ocean tsunami. In the Asia Pacific region, the massive damage caused by the Sichuan earthquake and the Japanese tsunami causing the nuclear disaster and other disasters means that disaster planning and management should be a part of every public health program in our region. Part of the course should be on how to manage the difficult ethical issues in infant feeding. Guidelines should include the following:</p>
<list id="list2-1010539512453253" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>for infants younger than 6 months who are breastfed, make sure that the mother has adequate nutritional support;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>infant formula should be distributed in “plain packaging” without any company advertising;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>where infant formula is distributed, it should be accompanied by supplies of clean (sterile) water; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>infant formula should not be part of general distribution of foods but should be targeted to infants who need it.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The BFHI principles should be preserved, and leftover infant formula supplies should not be distributed as samples to mothers in any health facility.</p>
<p>In discussing the northeast Japan disaster, Lawrence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539512453253">26</xref></sup> reviewed the options for infant feeding after disasters and reminded her readers that “babies are born to breastfeed” and that after most disasters, breastfeeding remains the best option.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Breastfeeding, exclusive to 6 months and continuing thereafter, is important for growth and development and for the health of the infant in the short term and later in life. Every effort should be made to continue the public health benefits of breastfeeding in the community. In particular, study of the Jogjakarta disaster has documented the danger of inappropriate distribution of infant formula in a postdisaster situation. Relief efforts for earthquakes in Japan and China that involved the distribution of large quantities of infant formula require further studies to document short- and longer-term effects on breastfeeding. There is a need for widespread recognition of the importance of ethical principles in the distribution of infant formula in disaster situations.</p>
