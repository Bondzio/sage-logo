<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this column is to describe the experience of teaching nursing theory in Uganda, Africa. The author is a nurse educator from the United States, who with support of a Fulbright grant was a visiting lecturer at Uganda Christian University in Mukono, Uganda. The students were two cohorts of Ugandan graduate nursing students. The account is presented as a case study in exploring the nature, justification, and utility of theory for nurses internationally. Teaching and discussion strategies are described as well as the philosophical and theoretical frameworks for analyzing and defending the building and use of theory in nursing. A convergence of evidence leads to a recognition of implicit theory as constituting the nurse’s clinical gaze.</p>

<p>The purpose of this column is to provide an account of teaching nursing theory to two groups of Ugandan graduate nursing students about 2 years apart. It is a case study both in exploring perplexing questions and the view that nursing theory is fundamental to the profession across languages and cultures. It suggests that lines of evidence can be merged to achieve insights into a composite form of nursing theory and how that theory can be used to guide nursing practice. The author is grateful to the 17 Ugandan graduate nursing students for their participation in dialogues about various nursing theories. What follows is a summary description of those conversations.</p>
<sec id="section1-0894318413477141">
<title>The Challenge of Teaching Nursing Theories Internationally</title>
<p>While few would question the study of pathophysiology or pharmacology in nursing today, many do question the value of including nursing theories in nursing education. At this time, few nurses in Uganda consider what they think about and do as nurses in terms of nursing theory. If theories are used to explain or predict phenomena, why is it that nurses can function in their jobs without reference to theory or nursing? Does it mean that the only value for theories is to advance nursing research and academic exercises? What would be the impact on nursing, if nursing theory was not included in basic or advanced practice nursing education?</p>
<p>These questions regarding the application of nursing theories to nursing practice are reinforced by the diversity of theories in nursing. The term theory denotes a semantic range from an idea, to a statement of concepts in specified relationships, to linked concepts consistently supported by evidence. It is the latter definition that is found in most nursing textbooks, but because there are many different nursing theories seeking to explain the same phenomenon, it is possible that nursing students may conclude that it is more like guess work of ideas rather than rigorous science.</p>
<p>Nursing practice is also very diverse, sites and roles range from direct care in hospitals, clinics, and communities to indirect care through education, administration, and policy-making in government and non-government organizations around the world. While some nurses assisting in surgical care of patients engage in minimal verbal interactions with awake and alert patients, other nurses, such as those working in mental health clinics rely heavily on therapeutic communication skills and their relationship with patients going through difficult times. Likewise, nurses in emergency departments often care for patients in life-threatening conditions that affords them little time for patient education, while nurses attempting to equip newly diagnosed patients with needed medical and health information to help them manage their health problems may spend most of their time with patient teaching. Nurses in sub-Saharan Africa have the addition burden of learning this range of nursing practice activities and skills within their own cultural views and in circumstances hampered with severe shortages of all kinds. Theories which seek to describe and explain nursing as a whole must be broad enough to capture diverse practice sites and cultural contexts, but narrow enough to form the boundaries of the profession. Perhaps this is too much to ask of any one theory?</p>
<p>Nursing is defined by many nurses as caring and now there is a considerable amount of nursing theory and research defining nursing as caring. But is this understanding of caring different from what other health professionals think about when they see themselves as caring, or what family members think about and do when they seek to care for each other? Clearly various meanings of the word caring exist, but this does not mean that there is not considerable overlap in the meaning and actions across disciplines, as well as in everyday life and professional practice. What then are the distinctive qualities of nurses in their practice and how are these differences related to nursing theories? Many nurses also define what they mean by caring and nursing in general as being holistic in perspective and practice.</p>
<p>In addition to these questions, there are specific challenges to the appropriateness of the use of nursing theories in different cultures and political contexts. For example, a nurse may defend handwashing because of germ theory or may defend handwashing because one in a position of power has instructed all to do so. Another nurse may wash her hands because she believes that a curse will fall on her if she does not carry out a specific cleaning ritual. There may, in fact, be a multiplicity of rationales for the same activity and the outcome may be similar regardless of the theoretical rationale. It is conceivable that more than one rationale could be related to the actions of a nurse. In many parts of the world, the availability of clean running water for handwashing in hospitals and clinics remains a problem, demanding of nurses greater, not less, ingenuity and resourcefulness than nursing as it is practiced in the United States or Europe.</p>
<p>These are some of the challenges facing nurse instructors seeking to teach nursing theory in developing nations. Without the historical and educational context of the development of the nursing profession as in North America and Europe from which most of the current nursing theories have arisen, the challenges of teaching nursing theory to nursing students in Africa can be daunting. Nursing in sub-Saharan African contexts is challenged by extensive poverty and scarcities of all kinds, the immigration of rural nurses to urban settings and of native nurses leaving their home countries for better pay, respect and working conditions in foreign employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318413477141">Nguyen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894318413477141">Shinn, 2008</xref>) continues. Nursing students in sub-Saharan Africa, like other students there, are more familiar with dictation and memorizing information, rather than seeking to master abstract nursing theories that require a higher level of cognition and deeper levels of understanding and critical thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318413477141">Lovett &amp; Gidman, 2011</xref>). Yet nurses throughout the world are working in more complex and independent roles. What is needed are nurses prepared to be holistic and able to think out of the box, with innovative technologies and approaches which use available resources at low or no cost, such as inexpensive solar powered light bulbs, and Kangaroo Care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318413477141">Ludington, 2011</xref>), which encourages skin-to-skin contact with newborns, including premature newborns, and their parents.</p>

<sec id="section2-0894318413477141">
<title>Teaching Strategies</title>
<p>One useful initial exercise is to begin with the poem, “Blind Men and the Elephant” by 19<sup>th</sup> century poet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894318413477141">John Godfrey Saxe (1878/2010)</xref>, which is based on an ancient Hindu folktale. Each of the blind men happens to touch a specific elephant part and then asserts that the entire elephant is just like some metaphoric equivalent of his experience. The man touching the elephant’s side insists the elephant is like a wall, the one touching his leg, like a tree, the one touching his tusk, like a spear, and so on. From this discussion it is helpful to explore how empirical information is related to the theoretical assumptions. That sensory data is interpreted by means of an associated mental model, in this case a simile, to explain the phenomenon of interest. The speaker’s prior experience with a tree or spear or wall helped him describe, explain and predict his experience with the elephant. The mental model or figure of speech functions just as theory does: one can with this justification call such figures of speech or metaphors, <italic>theories in miniature</italic>. One could predict the nature of an encounter with an elephant’s leg by referencing what a similar encounter would be with a tree. Imaginative grasp of these relationships between empiric and theoretic are an essential beginning to a non-trivial understanding of theory.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318413477141">Lakoff and Johnson (1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318413477141">1999</xref>), metaphors structure thoughts. The way people understand and interact with the world and with each other is shaped by metaphor, one thing expressed in terms of another thing. When a metaphor is employed to express one thing in terms of another, it both reveals and conceals aspects of the target domain. For example, to perceive that an elephant’s leg is like a tree is to reveal the tree-like qualities of an elephant’s leg but also to conceal other non-tree-like aspects of the elephant’s leg. The fact that an elephant’s leg ends in a foot and not in roots is not discernible within the metaphor of elephant-leg-as-tree. The students and I began to notice similar features of nursing theories: looking at nursing through the lens of a given theory highlighted certain aspects of nursing and concealed or minimized other aspects. Conceptually grasping how one thing (nursing) was being expressed in terms of another thing (nursing theory) was an important step in understanding what theory is and how it is used. A cautionary lesson from the blind men and elephant story was that deriving a theory from the experience of a part did not give one the justification to claim that this accounted for the whole.</p>
<p>African nursing students, in the author’s experience, need to be taught to consider the difference between verbal fluency and conceptual fluency. Reflecting on this difference one student said verbal fluency had to do with the words themselves and conceptual fluency have to do with the ideas. In fact, one who is conceptually fluent will be able to express the ideas in more than one way. Indeed, one who is conceptually fluent will be able to express the ideas using a variety of alternative words or no words at all. One of the goals of learning nursing theory is to be both verbally and conceptually fluent with the theories.</p>
<p>Following the discussion in an assigned textbook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318413477141">McEwen &amp; Wills, 2007</xref>), students were encouraged to discuss whether nursing knowledge was primarily <italic>received</italic> or <italic>perceived</italic>. The students eventually agreed that nurses employ both types of knowledge and the practicing nurse may prefer one over the other depending on the clinical context. For example, educating a traditional village dweller about infection control will require a careful acknowledgement of perceptions of both nurse and client. On the other hand, a nurse responding to a life-threatening condition in an emergency department is more likely to use received knowledge.</p>
<p>Nursing theories which give priority to received knowledge may have weaknesses relative to clinical situations that require negotiation with multiple perspectives. Similarly, nursing theories that give priority to perceived knowledge may have weaknesses relative to the care of patients in situations like the operating room, the emergency department, or an intensive care unit. The nurse must be able to make warranted judgments about the clinical situation and how best to integrate received and perceived knowledge in each case.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894318413477141">Risjord’s (2009)</xref> distinction between theoretical and colloquial conceptual analysis was helpful for teaching nursing students nursing theory in Africa. The flow of affirmation or challenge among theories, their concepts, and empirical evidence reinforced the provisional recognition of the same set of conditions in the blind men and the elephant poem for approximating what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894318413477141">Risjord (2009)</xref> called a <italic>moderate realism</italic>, or discovery of mind-independent <italic>probable truth</italic> fully consistent with a contextual understanding of concepts. The stool must keep its three legs, theory, concepts, and evidence, to be stable. He also speaks to the usefulness of starting with “the knowledge embedded in nursing practice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894318413477141">Risjord, 2009</xref>, p. 690) when considering situations in which nursing theories do not yet exist. The concept of the embedded nature of nursing knowledge evolved into an important guide as the class members tried to understand the relationship between theory and practice throughout the course.</p>
<p>The nursing students in Uganda had little trouble in relating to the theories described in the textbook to actual nursing practice in their country. Theories based on human needs address clinical situations that are universal as do the theories based on interaction between client and nurse. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894318413477141">Orem’s (1995)</xref> self-care deficit nursing theory is a nursing theory that has been applied by nurses working in various developing countries and applies well to people who live in dire conditions. Roy’s adaptation model (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318413477141">Frederickson, 1993</xref>) likewise can provide nurses with a theoretical lens in places where people and nurses have had to adapt to considerable unpredictability and scarcity of resources in daily life and in hospitals and clinics. It was more difficult for many of the African students to discuss how more abstract theories, like Rogers, Parse, or Newman, related to their nursing practice. The relevance of these theories became clearer as the discussion focused more on human well-being. The class benefited from discussing the historical context and scientific antecedents for each of the theories. Exactly how efficiently these theories were being used by the nurses in practice could not be determined in this situation. It is important to keep in mind that Ugandan nurses work under extremely resource-challenged conditions as do almost all nurses in sub-Saharan Africa. It is not unusual for a nurse to have an assignment of 30 patients.</p>

<title>Nursing Practice, Looking Along, and Subsidiary Awareness</title>
<p>As a gerontological nurse practitioner (GNP) the author also gets the opportunity to make house calls for Medicare recipients in the United States. In her practice, theories enhance the interactions with clients and the assessment process. For example, human-needs theory is useful in the assessment process as well as in medication review, arranged in a hierarchy from basic safety and physiology ascending toward functional, psychological, and social health. It is also useful when seeking to understand the client’s definition of health and negotiating a shared understanding of aims and goals. Finally, theories are very important when seeking to understand and support the person’s sense of becoming and ego integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318413477141">Erikson, 1950</xref>). The often implicit use of a variety of theories in this advanced practice nursing role provides the author/educator with relevant case studies for nursing theory discussions. It also helps Ugandan nursing students to see how implicit or tacit theory often operates in their everyday nursing practice, and how this implicit use of theory is often a composite of several theories. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477141">McEwen (2011)</xref> described examples of theory application when she stated, “With few exceptions, as in real practice, the theoretical principles are implicit rather than explicit” (p. 386). She also pointed out that it is important to gain awareness of implicit theories in nursing in order for them to be made accessible for analysis and evaluation.</p>
<p>In teaching nursing theory in Africa it is also useful to discuss the hierarchical arrangement of nursing knowledge, skills, and attitudes as outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318413477141">International Council of Nurses (ICN) in 2007</xref>. The position paper on the nursing profession and discussed at what points nursing theories should become explicit. Interestingly, the Ugandan nurses agreed that nursing theories would have to become explicit at the most advanced levels of the cognitive and psychomotor domains in the ICN taxonomy, but where or if nursing theories should be explicit anywhere else in the three domains remained a matter of debate among the students.</p>
<p>Once aware of the commonality of the implicit use of theory, the Ugandan nursing students found it relatively easy to understand how theory was used in everyday life in Uganda in persons without any prior knowledge of formal theory. Theories which describe human motivation, for example, are enacted by people in many different situations without a prior awareness that the action was based upon some theory. Theory does not create the reality but, if it is based on empiric evidence, it describes a reality that already exists. Of course, if one chooses to act based on an explicit theory, theory can in that sense also create some measure of reality by the action.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318413477141">Polanyi’s (1958)</xref> discussion of focal and subsidiary awareness and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318413477141">Lewis’s (1970)</xref> discussion of the difference between <italic>looking at</italic> and <italic>looking along</italic> become relevant toward the end of the classes on nursing theory. “Subsidiary awareness and focal awareness are mutually exclusive,” according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318413477141">Polanyi (1958</xref>, p. 56). In other words, the nurse attending focally or looking <italic>at</italic> the nursing client cannot at the same time be looking <italic>at</italic> a nursing theory. The theory must be subsidiary or that <italic>along</italic> which the nurse looks. This subsidiary, implied, or <italic>looking along</italic> application of composite theories during nursing care is what constitutes the “clinical gaze” of the nurse and distinguishes the nursing gaze from those of other caring persons or those of other skilled professionals. Nurse look at and when they do, the embedded knowledge, skills, and attitudes of the nurse are deployed as subsidiary awareness in that looking. That is the theory, formal or informal, <italic>along</italic> which the nurse looks <italic>at</italic> the nursing client.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0894318413477141">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The question remains whether it is with nursing theory that a nurse is looking <italic>along</italic> or some other form of subsidiary awareness. The Ugandan nurses can be seen as acquiring a clinical gaze informed by a composite of nursing and non-nursing theories. This applied science approach in nursing involves a blending of theories from nursing and other disciplines. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894318413477141">Tokuhama-Espinosa (2011)</xref> put it: “The ability to think across academic disciplinary lines and to merge understandings from different fields is not only valued once again, but it is seen as the only true way of understanding the increasingly complex nature of human ideas” (para. 25). It cannot be assumed, however, that nurses will continue to own and use the unique clinical gaze of the profession without formally learning the theories that shape the gaze. The report here is how two groups of Ugandan nursing students discovered a convergence of evidence that supports the continued learning of relevant theories of many kinds in order for them to acquire the cognitive resources to construct, analyze, and evaluate their own subsidiary awareness and conceptual <italic>along</italic> by which they will be able to look <italic>at</italic> their nursing clients with nursing’s own clinical gaze.</p>
