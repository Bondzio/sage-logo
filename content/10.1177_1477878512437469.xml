<p>Paul Standish’s preface to this large and diverse collection of essays readies the reader for a hearty philosophical counterattack against various educational techniques born of the culture of performativity. The book, in fact, deals with much more than that, tackling a wide range of topics including special educational needs, brain-based education, learning how to learn, emotional intelligence, positive psychology, personalized learning, philosophy for children, and learning environments.</p>
<p>The book’s first section on neuro-education contains contributions by some of the most respected names in this new area of educational research. Essays by Paul Howard-Jones and Stein, Connell and Gardner focus on a theoretical problem that dogs any research attempting to link neuroscience with strategies for improving teaching and learning. This problem is that neuroscience and education operate on very different levels of explanation: neuroscience on the biological level, and education on the psychological and semantic level. Usha Goswami offers a summary of a set of ‘principles of learning’ which, she argues, are supported by established knowledge in neuroscience. The issue of educational neuromyths also features in Goswami’s essay. Why, she asks, are scientifically unfounded ideas about education and the brain (e.g. ‘left-brained’ versus ‘right-brained’ learners) so easily seeded among teachers and how can they be dispelled once they take root? Her proposed solution to this problem is to make helping educators improve their skills in reading neuroscience information critically and accurately a priority in teachers’ professional development.</p>
<p>The second section follows on thematically from the first by dealing with the nosology of psychobiological conditions commonly used to determine a child’s special educational needs. Andrew Davis’s piece sets the stage by considering the application of three basic approaches to the taxonomy of psychiatric disorders to learner categories like ‘autistic’, ‘ADHD’ and ‘dyslexic’. Next come two provocative texts that represent opposing reactions to the educational discourse on, respectively, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia. Paul Cooper’s essay is deflationary. His thesis is that the standard objections to categorizing children as ADHD betray profound misunderstandings of the scholarly literature on ADHD. By contrast, Elliott and Gibbs’s essay defends the iconoclastic claim that dyslexia is essentially an empty category indistinguishable from reading difficulty. In a different register altogether is Charlotte Moore’s personal account of living with two autistic boys. Illustrating well the value of the methodological pluralism in educational research, it makes important points about the openness of the autism concept, the pertinence of the term ‘autism spectrum disorder’, and the social meaning for families when a child is medically diagnosed with a psychological condition.</p>
<p>On the face of it, the theme of the third section, Information and Communication Technology (ICT), may seem out of place in this volume but Cigman and Davis’s portrayal of ICT as a ‘new philosophy of learning’ is convincing. The nub of their case is that the there is a normative dimension to talk of using ICT to assist learning. Some writers on ICT and education, they observe, move illicitly from the claim that ICT <italic>lends itself well</italic> to a particular student-led or ‘constructivist’ conception of learning to the claim that the existence of such technologies somehow <italic>vindicates</italic> this conception of learning.</p>
<p>Section 4, which is labelled ‘The enhancement agenda’, groups together four papers that bemoan the inroads that positive psychology has made into the field of education. More typically associated with debates about the off-label use of psychopharmaceuticals to improve academic performance, the term ‘enhancement’ rings alarmist employed here. As shocking as Wellingdon College’s widely publicized decision to introduce regular ‘happiness lessons’ might seem to some, the happiology movement, which is premised on the perennial notion that happiness should be considered a primary aim of education, seems to deserve a fairer hearing than it gets. This section presents a run of well-taken if fairly predictable philosophical objections to a science of happiness: that happiness/optimism is rational such that we can say rightly that some people should not be happy/optimistic; that some crucial distinctions are not observed about qualities of happiness and the kinds of things that people think make them happy; and that happiness is a complex emotion insofar as one may be both happy and sad at the same time. What the authors are doing, in effect, is pointing out how their respective position is more true to the nature of happiness than the one allegedly conceptualized by positive psychology. Fine as far as it goes, but readers seeking serious conceptual engagement with positive psychology on its own terms may be well advised to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>One contribution to this collection that does take positive psychology very seriously indeed is Sophie Rietti’s essay in the following short section on non-cognitive intelligences. A model of constructive dialogue between philosophy and educational psychology, it tells the story of how a basically sound psychological construct (in this case John Mayer and Peter Salovey’s concept of Emotional Intelligence) becomes distorted when appropriated by educationalists (esp. Daniel Goleman). The most important of the many lessons to be drawn from this case study echoes Davis’s prior discussion of learner categories as ‘interactive kinds’. While applied psychology ostensibly aims to act as a force for positive social change – for instance, by providing children with skills that are favourable to academic success, positive relationships, resolving interpersonal conflicts peacefully, or effective emotional self-management – it ends up illicitly ‘making up people’. That is, it becomes a force of <italic>socialization</italic> into a particular (i.e. the applied psychologist’s) set of values and beliefs about the human subjectivity and human flourishing.</p>
<p>Comprising three discrete essays on learning how to learn, philosophy with children, and learning environments, the final section in the book is something of a wastebasket category. Of particular note in this section is an exemplary work of contemporary analytic philosophy of education by Christopher Winch. Winch seeks to establish how much sense can be made of the pervasive notion of ‘learning how to learn’. Two candidate interpretations, ‘a capacity to learn’ and ‘a general ability to learn’, are considered and rejected on the grounds that both presuppose unacceptably idiosyncratic conception of the core terms ‘capacity’ and ‘ability’. Winch concludes that learning how to learn points at best to a set of transferrable learning skills – chiefly literacy and numeracy, and the stock intellectual virtues – only to dismiss this conclusion as platitudinous.</p>
<p>Standish’s concession that <italic>New Philosophies of Learning</italic> is a big tent aptly captures this book’s broad scope. More than dealing only with the philosophy of learning, Cigman and Davis’s volume allows a diverse group of eminent authors to give their minds to some of the most consequential topics in contemporary education.</p>
