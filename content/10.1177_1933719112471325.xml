<title>New Endometriosis Risk Loci</title>
<p>Endometriosis is a female health disorder that occurs when cells from the endometrium grow in other areas of the pelvic area, often leading to pain, irregular menstrual cycles, and infertility. This common condition, which is believed to afflict 6% to 10% of women, is usually diagnosed during the reproductive years. Although genetics is known to play a role in the disease, the etiology of endometriosis is not completely understood and, therefore, there is currently no cure for it.</p>
<p>In order to be able to eventually develop efficient therapies and preventive strategies, research has focused on a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the disease, in which wide genome association studies have played a major role.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Nyholt et al have just published in a letter to the journal <italic>Nature Genetics</italic> (<italic>Nat Genet</italic>, advanced online publication, October 2012) the results from a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 4604 endometriosis and 9393 controls of Japanese and European ancestry.</p>
<p>Nyholt and colleagues verified that the previously identified small nuclear polymorphism (SNP) rs12700667 in 7p15.2, which had been previously found to be associated with endometriosis in Europeans, is also significantly associated with the disease in Japanese. In addition, the authors’ results confirm a highly significant association between rs7521902 at 1p36.12 and endometriosis. This locus is near the Wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 4 (<italic>WNT4</italic>) gene, which is known to play a role in female development. </p>
<p>The authors also established an association between endometriosis and rs13394619, located at 2p25.1 spanning the growth regulation by estrogen in breast cancer 1 (<italic>GREB1</italic>) gene, which is an estrogen-responsive gene involved in an early response in the estrogen receptor-regulated pathway and thought to play an important role in hormone-responsive tissues and cancer. In addition, Nyholt et al identified a newly associated locus (rs10859871) at 12q22, near the vezatin gene (VEZT), an adherens junctions transmembrane protein.</p>
<p>When the authors excluded the cases with minimum or unknown severity with European ancestry, they were able to identify previously unknown additional association loci, which were rs4141819, rs7739264, and rs1537377.</p>
<p>All the SNPs correlated with endometriosis were replicated in an independent cohort, confirming a highly significant association. Moreover, the authors observed that many weakly associated SNPs represent true endometriosis risk loci across the European and Japanese populations. This indicates that risk prediction and future targeted disease therapy may be shared across, at least, these 2 populations. </p>

<title>On the Basis of Endometrial Cancer</title>
<p>Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy of the developed world, with 35 000 newly diagnosed cases each year in the United States alone. Of these, the serous endometrial carcinoma is the most clinically aggressive subtype, for which the genetic etiology is poorly understood.</p>
<p>Aiming a better elucidation of this devastating condition, Le Gallo et al used whole-exome sequencing to comprehensively search for somatic mutations within serous endometrial tumor samples. Their results have recently been published in the journal <italic>Nature Genetics</italic> (<italic>Nat Genet</italic>, advanced online publication, October 2012).</p>
<p>The authors sequenced approximately 22 000 protein-encoding genes in 13 primary serous endometrial tumors. The 18 genes that were mutated in more than 1 tumor sample and/or were components of an enriched functional group were then resequenced in 40 additional serous tumors.</p>
<p>Le Gallo and colleagues identified recurrent somatic mutations with a significant incidence in chromatin-remodeling genes and in ubiquitin ligase complex genes such as <italic>CHD4</italic>, <italic>EP300</italic>, <italic>ARID1A</italic>, <italic>TSPYL2</italic>, <italic>FBXW7</italic>, <italic>SPOP</italic>, <italic>MAP3K4,</italic> and <italic>ABCC9</italic>. In fact, as much as 36.5% of the serous tumors analyzed presented mutations in chromatin-remodeling genes while 35% had a mutated ubiquitin ligase complex gene. These findings strongly suggest that these processes are commonly disrupted in serous endometrial cancer, implicating their involvement in the molecular pathogenesis of the disease. Moreover, the high frequency and specific distribution of mutations in <italic>CHD4</italic>, <italic>FBXW7,</italic> and <italic>SPOP</italic> indicate that these genes are likely to play a major role in the development of serous endometrial carcinoma. </p>
<p>Altogether, the results presented by Le Gallo et al provide new insights into the somatic mutations present in serous endometrial cancer exomes. This knowledge may lead to a better understanding of the etiology of the disease opening the doors to new therapeutic strategies.</p>
