<title>Also adults had an increased risk of narcolepsy after vaccination with Pandemrix in Finland</title>
<p>THL study confirms that adults aged under 65 years had an increased risk of developing narcolepsy during the first months following vaccination with Pandemrix-vaccine against influenza A(H1N1) in 2009 and 2010, compared to unvaccinated adults in the same age group.</p>
<p>The investigation shows that 23 out of 25 adult patients, who fell ill with narcolepsy during 2009-11 were under 40 years of age, and none older than 65 years. Pandemrix vaccine had been received by 18 of the confirmed narcolepsy patients. Vaccination coverage in this age group was 50 per cent.</p>
<p>By eight months after the vaccination the risk of falling ill with narcolepsy following vaccination had returned to pre-vaccination levels.</p>
<p>THL will continue to study the association between narcolepsy and Pandemrix. The specific aim in the coming years is to verify whether vaccinated persons sought treatment sooner, which may mean that the elevated risk in the vaccinated is lower than the one reported now.</p>

<title>HIV patients have high adherence to treatment, but late diagnosis is a common problem</title>
<p>Prevention and treatment of HIV infections associated with intravenous drug use are well organised in Finland. Adherence to treatment is high among HIV patients but infections should be diagnosed at an earlier stage in order to improve treatment outcomes.</p>
<p>These observations are based on ECDC’s country visit to Finland in October 2012 to discuss with Finnish officials the prevention and control of sexually transmitted infections in Finland. The report “Country mission Finland: HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and hepatitis B and C” is now available.</p>
<p>According to the report the good results are based on an extensive national network of health counselling centres as well as on a well-functioning collaboration between municipal services, specialised health care and the third sector. All schools in Finland provide health education, which includes basic information about sexual and reproductive health.</p>
<p>The report gives an overview of the current situation in Finland with respect to HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and hepatitis B and C, and reviews the effectiveness of national strategies and programmes.</p>
