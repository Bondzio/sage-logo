<p>Due to the fact that the incidence of venous disease is rising, with 25% of the population affected to reach 35% in 2050 due to the ageing of the population and increased obesity. In view of the fact that this costs at least 1% of the national health-care budgets throughout Europe, a clear plan has to be realized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-phleb.2012.012119">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-phleb.2012.012119">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The last decade has shown changes in the management of patients suffering venous disease. The treatment of superficial venous insufficiency has shifted from invasive treatments under general anaesthesia to minimal invasive treatments under tumescent anaesthesia and the treatment of incompetent perforating veins became more popular with new techniques like endoscopic surgery and later percutaneous techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-phleb.2012.012119">3</xref></sup> Similarly the management of chronic venous disease due to deep venous insufficiency (DVI) and deep venous occlusive (DVO) disease has shown major changes. In the past more attention was paid to treat DVI, but in the last decade the burden of a deep venous outflow obstruction, mostly as a complication of a deep venous thrombosis (DVT), has been re-valuated and is now considered of much more relevance than DVI. DVO disease has also shown to be treatable with new minimal invasive techniques such as recanalization procedures with stenting of the pathological venous segments or bypass surgery, especially in the iliofemoral tract.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-phleb.2012.012119">4</xref></sup> Also, a more aggressive treatment is being developed to treat DVT in which it is expected that removing the clot in acute DVT, especially an iliofemoral DVT will significantly reduce the burden of a post-thrombotic syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-phleb.2012.012119">5</xref></sup> Compression bandaging and stockings still remain the cornerstone for the treatment of numerous patients with venous disease. Finally, the introduction of new anticoagulant drugs will also change the patient experience.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-phleb.2012.012119">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Developments as highlighted above need cooperation between industry, physicians and patients. The fast changing treatment options due to new inventions, materials and techniques make it also very demanding for funders of health care (health-insurances/governments) to decide which treatments are cost-effective and eligible for reimbursement.</p>
<p>On the other hand, physicians involved in the treatment of patients with venous diseases will use the methods they are allowed to do or what fits their expertise, sometimes ignoring potentially better treatment options for their patients. Any physician: general, dermatologist, radiologist, surgeon, vascular surgeon, angiologist, cardiologist, etc. can start treating patients with a venous disease. In all the European countries there is great heterogeneity not only with respect to physicians training and specialty but also the methods offered to the patient. This is often also related to the reimbursement system, which differs in many European countries. To make it even more complicated each country has its own guidelines, often influenced by the specialties involved.</p>
<p>However, the patient suffering from a venous disease throughout Europe is very similar. It is awareness of this that should guide us to a better-organized care for patients with a venous disease. Ideally, all patients should receive the best, reimbursed, medical care in each country by whoever treats the patient according to the highest standards.</p>
<p>In fact, one guideline throughout Europe should be sufficient and all physicians involved should be trained and taught to the level needed to provide optimal care.</p>
<p>In order to realize a standard for care the Union of Phlebology already developed a curriculum for Phlebology in 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-phleb.2012.012119">7</xref></sup> Although it covers all aspects of care for these patients it is difficult as a multidisciplinary tool.</p>
<p>A European College of Phlebology (ECoP) has been established as an organization that primarily stimulates optimal care for all patients in Europe suffering from a venous disease. In order to establish this vision the ECoP is going to write a guideline covering best medical care for the venous patient in Europe, provided by a certified physician. The guidelines should allow a wide variety of choices to be made by the physician involved, based on sound principles of best available evidence. As guidelines should not interfere with the progress and development of new better or cheaper diagnostic or treatment options new techniques should be allowed under appropriate arrangements for governance.</p>
<p>The patient has the expectation to be treated by a well-trained physician. In order to know if a physician is educated and appropriately trained to perform proper diagnostics and treatments, a Certificate of Phlebology has to be established. Such a certificate will show the patient and patient-organizations that an appropriate physician will treat the patient. Due to standardized education and training the quality of care should improve throughout Europe. To get an internationally accepted Certificate in Phlebology and allow free movement throughout Europe for the Certified Phlebologists recognition by the Union Européenne des Médecins Spécialistes (European Union of Medical Specialists [UEMS]) is essential. A separate Board of Phlebology is an illusion in Europe due to the fact that so many different specialties are involved in the care for the venous patient it has been decided to apply for a multidisciplinary UEMS Committee of Phlebology. The UEMS aims are;’ To promote and harmonize the highest level of training of medical specialists, medical practice and health care within the European Union; to promote free movement of specialists within the EU; to legally represent the medical specialist in the Member States of the EU dealing with questions directly or indirectly concerning the medical profession; to defend the professional interests of European Medical Specialists’. After the UEMS Committee of Phlebology has been established, a European curriculum for Phlebology will be developed as a modular, specialty dependent, system covering theoretical and practical UEMS exams. Together with obligatory workshops and courses throughout Europe and a list of diagnostic and treatment interventions performed each member of the ECoP can be eligible for an International Phlebology Certificate.</p>
<p>The ECoP will also develop e-learning modules to make the theoretical education modules available for everybody in Europe.</p>
<p>Besides the international guidelines, education, training and certification the ECoP will be able to support patients or physicians-organizations in each European country to try and optimize patient's care. This may involve discussions with national health insurances and governments. In order to be able to do this all phlebology societies in Europe are asked to become a member of the ECoP. This membership will accordingly allow the ECoP to represent all potential members (around 10,000)</p>
<p>In the near future appropriately certified physicians should treat patients with venous diseases according to international multidisciplinary guidelines. All health workers, patients and related industries involved in the care for these patients should collaborate under the umbrella of a European organization to guide the quality of care for patients with venous disease. It is envisaged that it will take 10 years to achieve most of these goals.</p>
