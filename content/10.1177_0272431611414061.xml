<abstract>
<p>To highlight individual and neighborhood interactions in the risk of adolescent substance use, this study examined the moderating role of neighborhood disadvantage on the relationship between pubertal development and adolescent girls’ substance use. Drawing on the contextual amplification hypothesis, it was hypothesized that the effect of pubertal development on substance use would vary by level of neighborhood disadvantage and race. The sample included 5,591 adolescent girls from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (23% Black, 15% Hispanic, 55% White, and 7% Other race). Results showed that the relationships between pubertal development, neighborhood disadvantage, and alcohol use varied for girls from different racial backgrounds. Although there was some of evidence of contextual amplification among Black adolescent girls, low levels of neighborhood disadvantage tended to be associated with higher levels of alcohol use during early adolescence. Findings highlight the importance of studying the interaction between individual- and environmental-level risk factors.</p>

<p>With the annual societal cost of substance abuse well over US$150 billion and rising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0272431611414061">Office of National Drug Control Policy, 2004</xref>), an important public health objective is to identify risk factors that are promising targets for intervention programs aimed at preventing the onset and escalation of substance use during early adolescence. The social epidemiological literature on adolescent substance use has long focused on individual-level risk factors such as affective states, behavioral skills, cognitive perceptions, and personality traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0272431611414061">Petraitis, Flay, &amp; Miller, 1995</xref>). Although this body of literature has greatly contributed to an individual-centered understanding of adolescent substance use, ecological perspectives are needed to examine the interactivity between individual and environmental, or structural risk factors (as called for by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272431611414061">Celio, Karnik, &amp; Steiner, 2006</xref>). The social ecological model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272431611414061">Bronfenbrenner, 1979</xref>) posits that multiple ecological contexts interact to influence individual-level health behaviors like adolescent substance use, including the individual, peer, family, and neighborhood contexts. Although scholars have extensively studied the interactive effects of individual, peer, and family contexts on adolescent substance use (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272431611414061">Hawkins, Catalano, &amp; Miller, 1992</xref>), less is known about the interplay between neighborhood and individual-level risk factors for adolescent substance use (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431611414061">Chuang, Ennett, Bauman, &amp; Foshee, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>One well-established individual-level risk factor for adolescent substance use, particularly among adolescent girls, is the timing of pubertal development. Puberty is an important developmental transition in early adolescence that uniquely challenges youth as they adapt to their emerging physical appearance and associated shifts in peer and family relations. Early developers are often unprepared for the new roles and expectations associated with adult-like bodies; for instance, they may be prematurely exposed to social situations in which drugs are present but lack the psychological maturity to handle those influences. Although pubertal development is a physiological process occurring at the individual level, it can also be considered a developmental transition given meaning only by the sociocultural context in which it is embedded. The extent to which an adolescent’s environmental surroundings present negative social situations and influences is therefore likely to affect the nature and severity of the substance use risk associated with pubertal development. Neighborhood environments are one such ecological context that may exacerbate the substance use risk associated with early pubertal development, given that disadvantaged neighborhood contexts are characterized by less access to social and economic resources and increased exposure to drugs and alcohol. Such ecological contexts of vulnerability may be even more detrimental to the health of young adolescents of color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272431611414061">Crane, 1991</xref>) given patterns of residential segregation that force poor minority families into concentrated, decaying neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272431611414061">Massey &amp; Denton, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Drawing on the social ecological model, the current study is in response to calls for more research on the interactivity between individual and environmental risk factors for adolescent substance use—specifically exploring the notion of “contextual amplification,” or the phenomenon whereby environmental risk factors amplify the detrimental effects of individual-level risk factors such as early pubertal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272431611414061">Ge, Brody, Conger, Simons, &amp; Murray, 2002</xref>). The study addresses the following research questions:</p>

</list>
<p>The current study focuses solely on girls due to gender differences in the underlying processes and manifestations of the substance use risk associated with pubertal development as well as neighborhood disadvantage (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0272431611414061">Ramirez-Valles, Zimmerman, &amp; Juarez, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0272431611414061">Westling, Andrews, Hampson, &amp; Peterson, 2008</xref>). This, along with the fact that adolescent girls now use most substances at rates equivalent to boys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0272431611414061">Substance Abuse and Mental Health, 2010</xref>), underscores the need for gender-specific research on risk factors for adolescent substance use.</p>

<title>Pubertal development and substance use</title>
<p>When a girl experiences puberty relative to her peers is an important individual-level predictor of substance use. Stage termination theory, or the early timing hypothesis, suggests that early developers are at risk for behaviors like substance use because they are psychologically and socially unprepared to handle the new roles and responsibilities associated with the developed, adult-like body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272431611414061">Magnusson, Stattin, &amp; Allen, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0272431611414061">Stattin &amp; Magnusson, 1990</xref>). However, a competing theoretical perspective, the off-timing or maturational deviance hypothesis, posits that adolescents who experience puberty off-time (i.e., early or late) are at higher risk of problem behaviors because they are developmentally and socially deviant from same-age peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0272431611414061">Petersen &amp; Taylor, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>As noted in recent literature reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0272431611414061">Mendle, Turkheimer, &amp; Emery, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0272431611414061">Short &amp; Rosenthal, 2008</xref>), there has been consistent empirical support for the early timing hypothesis among adolescent girls, such that more advanced pubertal development during early adolescence is associated with higher substance use whereas less advanced pubertal development is associated with lower substance use risk (i.e., late development is a protective factor). There has been limited empirical support for the off-timing hypothesis among adolescent girls and young women, with only a handful of studies reporting a positive association between late pubertal development and substance use (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272431611414061">Graber, Seeley, Brooks-Gunn, &amp; Lewinsohn, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Neighborhood contexts and substance use</title>
<p>Although there is a large body of literature documenting the substance use risk associated with more advanced pubertal development during early adolescence, to date there is a limited understanding of how neighborhood contexts influence that relationship. This lack of research is unfortunate given that adolescents likely become increasingly vulnerable to risky health behaviors such as substance use as their exposure to individual, familial, and neighborhood-level stressors accumulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272431611414061">Appleyard, Egeland, Van Dulmen, &amp; Sroufe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0272431611414061">Sameroff, Bartko, Baldwin, Baldwin, &amp; Seifer, 1998</xref>). The substance use risk associated with pubertal development may be magnified in disadvantaged neighborhoods where early developing girls may have greater access, exposure, and opportunity to use drugs and also be subject to weaker informal social control mechanisms from adult residents. Neighborhood contexts characterized by high exposure to drugs and less informal social control may amplify the substance use risk associated with pubertal development by overloading early maturers’ undeveloped coping resources during a particularly stressful developmental transition. Early developing girls residing in disadvantaged neighborhoods may therefore face a form of double jeopardy, or “contextual amplification” such that their risky neighborhood contexts amplify their individual-level risk factors for substance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272431611414061">Ge et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272431611414061">Ge &amp; Natsuaki, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0272431611414061">Susman &amp; Rogol, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Neighborhoods are indeed important ecological contexts in which adolescents’ lived experiences are embedded, particularly given their constrained geographic mobility. Building on social disorganization theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0272431611414061">Shaw &amp; McKay, 1942</xref>), contemporary theorists argue that the health risks associated with neighborhood disadvantage are largely attributable to issues of social cohesion and social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272431611414061">Kubrin &amp; Weitzer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0272431611414061">Sampson, Raudenbush, &amp; Earls, 1997</xref>). Disadvantaged neighborhoods are often defined as those with high levels of concentrated disadvantage, or the concentration of multiple forms of social and economic disadvantage such as poverty, unemployment, and undereducation. Disadvantaged neighborhoods can also be characterized by high levels of social disorder, or the observable signs of decay within a neighborhood such as crime, graffiti, litter, public intoxication, and other incivilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272431611414061">Aneshensel &amp; Sucoff, 1996</xref>). Disadvantaged neighborhoods characterized by high levels of concentrated disadvantage and social disorder are potentially risky because they provide adolescents with more exposure and opportunities to use drugs in ecological contexts plagued with eroded informal social control mechanisms. For instance, adolescents residing in disadvantaged neighborhoods have greater exposure to bars, liquor stores, drug dealers, and drug users—and hence have more opportunities or perceived opportunities to acquire drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272431611414061">Duncan, Duncan, &amp; Strycker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0272431611414061">LaVeist &amp; Wallace, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, such disadvantaged neighborhoods may collectively socialize adolescents to norms and values tolerant of substance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272431611414061">Kadushin, Reber, Saxe, &amp; Livert, 1998</xref>), while providing fewer positive social role models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0272431611414061">Wilson, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Findings from empirical research examining the direct effect of neighborhood disadvantage on substance use have been inconsistent. Although some studies suggest neighborhood disadvantage is associated with higher levels of substance use or access to substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272431611414061">Kulis, Marsiglia, Sicotte, &amp; Nieri, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272431611414061">Lambert, Brown, Phillips, &amp; Ialongo, 2004</xref>), others have found no relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272431611414061">Abdelrahman., Rodriguez, Ryan, French, &amp; Weinbaum, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431611414061">Allison et al., 1999</xref>), or even negative relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431611414061">Chuang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431611414061">Ennett, Flewelling, Lindrooth, &amp; Norton, 1997</xref>). However, with few exceptions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431611414061">Chuang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272431611414061">Foshee et al., 2007</xref>), the empirical literature linking neighborhood disadvantage with substance use has focused on adults only or aggregated samples of adolescents and adults. Despite the inconsistent findings linking neighborhood disadvantage with adolescent substance use, research does suggest that neighborhood contextual factors may influence or moderate the role of individual-level risk factors on adolescents’ behavioral outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0272431611414061">Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000</xref>). For instance, several studies have found that the effect of pubertal development on adolescent behavioral outcomes is conditional upon neighborhood contexts, with neighborhood disadvantage amplifying individual-level risk factors. In a multistate study of the relationship between pubertal development and problem behavior among African American adolescents, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272431611414061">Ge et al. (2002)</xref> found that early developing adolescents residing in disadvantaged neighborhoods and those with less supportive/involved parents had more affiliations with deviant peers. In another study examining the effect of neighborhoods on the link between pubertal development and girls’ violent behavior in Chicago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0272431611414061">Obeidallah, Brennan, Brooks-Gunn, and Earls (2004)</xref> found that early pubertal development was only related to violent behavior for girls living in disadvantaged neighborhoods.</p>
<p>There is only one study to date that has explicitly examined the moderating role of neighborhood effects on the association between pubertal development and adolescent substance use. Among a sample of suburban middle school students in North Carolina, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272431611414061">Foshee et al. (2007)</xref> found that the effect of pubertal development on cigarette and alcohol use among girls was moderated by peer contexts but not neighborhood contexts. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272431611414061">Foshee et al. (2007)</xref> speculate that the lack of observed neighborhood effects in their study may have been due to problems with the validity of their pubertal timing measure. So there is a paucity of empirical research examining the moderating role of neighborhood disadvantage on the association between pubertal development and adolescent girls’ substance use, and the available studies have been limited to specific geographic areas, racially and economically homogenous samples, or limited by psychometrically suspect measures. Given this gap in the literature, more systematic research is needed to examine the role of neighborhood disadvantage in the pubertal development-substance use relationship.</p>

<sec id="section4-0272431611414061">
<title>Racial differences</title>
<p>It is problematic and premature for social epidemiological researchers to assume that the risk and protective factors associated with adolescent substance use are similar across racial groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272431611414061">Brown, Miller, &amp; Clayton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0272431611414061">Wallace &amp; Muroff, 2002</xref>). For instance, research indicates that girls of color, particularly African American girls, experience puberty earlier than White girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272431611414061">Herman-Giddens, Kaplowitz, &amp; Wasserman, 2004</xref>) and have lower substance use prevalence than White girls (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0272431611414061">MacKay &amp; Duran, 2007</xref>). If girls of color tend to be early developers, then their reference groups of same-race same-age peers will likely be composed of other early developers. So, “early” development may be less risky for girls of color if it does not correspond with any pronounced physical or social deviance from their reference group.</p>
<p>Although adolescent girls of color may be protected from the detrimental effect of early pubertal development on substance use, neighborhood risk factors may actually be magnified for these girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272431611414061">Gruenewald, Millar, Ponicki, &amp; Brinkley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272431611414061">Lambert et al., 2004</xref>). Racial segregation in residence patterns contributes to a concentration of poverty within certain neighborhoods with large populations of racial minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272431611414061">Massey &amp; Denton, 1993</xref>). Members of minority communities are more likely to be exposed to advertising for alcohol and tobacco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272431611414061">Douglas, Esmundo, &amp; Bloom, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272431611414061">Hackbarth, Silvestri, &amp; Cosper, 1995</xref>), and thus collective socialization to norms and values tolerant of substance use may be more pronounced for young girls of color. Empirical research suggests that contextual, neighborhood-level risk factors are more detrimental to the health and well-being of adolescents of color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272431611414061">Crane, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272431611414061">Kulis et al., 2007</xref>) but that those with supportive family ecosystems may be resilient to the detrimental impact of neighborhood disadvantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0272431611414061">Yabiku, Rayle, Okamoto, &amp; Marsiglia, 2007</xref>). Thus, adolescent girls of color may be resilient to the effects of pubertal development on substance use, but be at greater risk if they reside in disadvantaged neighborhoods. No studies to date have examined racial variation in the substance use risk associated with pubertal development, neighborhood disadvantage, and the interaction between these risk factors.</p>

<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>The current study addresses several gaps in the literature by examining the relationships between pubertal development, neighborhood disadvantage, race/ethnicity, and substance use among early adolescent girls. Although previous research indicates that individual and neighborhood characteristics often interact to influence adolescent health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0272431611414061">Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000</xref>), the current study is the first to examine the moderating role of neighborhood disadvantage on the association between pubertal development and substance use with a large, nationally representative sample of adolescent girls. The current study tests two research hypotheses that are guided by theory and previous research. First, neighborhood disadvantage is hypothesized to moderate the effect of pubertal development on early adolescent girls’ alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use. Second, it is hypothesized that the moderating effect of neighborhood disadvantage on early adolescent girls’ substance use will vary for girls from different racial backgrounds.</p>

<sec id="section7-0272431611414061">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>This study analyzes restricted-use data from the first two waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cpc.unc.edu/addhealth">http://www.cpc.unc.edu/addhealth</ext-link>). The Add Health used a multistage, stratified, school-based sampling design to collect data representative of U.S. adolescents attending Grades 7 to 12 during the 1994-1995 school year. At Wave 1 (1994/1995), 90,118 students completed brief in-school questionnaires and 145 school administrators completed questionnaires. Drawn from the participating school rosters and in-school survey participants, a pool of 20,745 adolescents completed more in-depth in-home interviews. Parents/guardians of the in-home interview participants were also interviewed at Wave 1. One year later (Wave 2), a representative sample of students was surveyed from Wave 1 participants, supplemented by a sample of students absent at Wave 1. This resulted in a sample of 14,738 students interviewed in their homes in 1996 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272431611414061">Harris et al., 2009</xref> for more detailed sampling design information). The analytic sample for the current study was limited to early adolescent girls age 10 to 15 at Wave 1 with no missing sampling weights (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272431611414061">Chantala, 2006</xref>). Among these 5,591 girls, 1,266 self-identified as non-Hispanic Black (hereafter referred to as Black), 842 as Hispanic, 3,093 as non-Hispanic White (hereafter referred to as White), and 390 as another non-Hispanic race/ethnicity (hereafter referred to as Other; approximately 72% of girls in this Other category identified as Asian, 12% as Native American, and 16% as some other unspecified race).</p>

<sec id="section8-0272431611414061">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Three dependent variables were used to measure substance use at Wave 1 (when girls were ages 10-15) and Wave 2 (ages 11-16). Alcohol use was measured as an average scale score from three ordinal items (Cronbach’s α = .88): frequency of alcohol consumption; frequency of drinking five or more drinks in one sitting; and frequency of drinking to drunkenness, all in the past year (ranging from 1 = <italic>none</italic> to 7 = <italic>every day or almost every day</italic>). Tobacco use was a count measure of the number of days a girl smoked cigarettes in the past month (ranging from 0 to 30). Marijuana use was a count measure of the number of times used marijuana in the past 30 days (ranging from 0 to 150).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0272431611414061">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The key independent variables were pubertal development, neighborhood disadvantage, and race/ethnicity, all measured at Wave 1 when girls were in the developmental stage of early adolescence (i.e., ages 10-15). Add Health included a version of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0272431611414061">Petersen, Crockett, Richards, and Boxer’s (1988)</xref> Pubertal Development Scale (PDS) that asked girls three items (Cronbach’s α = .70) about increased breast size since grade school, body curviness since grade school, and physical development compared to same-age peers (1 = <italic>less developed</italic>; 5 = <italic>most developed</italic>). These three items were used to create an average scale score ranging from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating more advanced pubertal development.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0272431611414061">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Neighborhood disadvantage was measured with factor scores from a confirmatory maximum likelihood factor analysis based on seven items (Cronbach’s α = .60): the proportion of single-female-headed households with children in the respondent’s neighborhood, proportion of households with public assistance income in the neighborhood, proportion of persons below the poverty level in the neighborhood, proportion of persons over age 25 with no high school degree in the neighborhood, unemployment rate in the neighborhood, problem with litter or trash on the streets or sidewalks of the neighborhood, and problem with drug dealers or drug users in the neighborhood. The first five measures were measured at the census block level and came from the Add Health Contextual Database, which geocoded respondents’ home locations to their block group census area from the 1990 Census of Population and Housing. The last two measures of neighborhood disadvantage were based on two parent-reported items collected during the in-home parent interviews at Wave 1 (both items ranged from 1 = <italic>no problem at all</italic> to 3 = <italic>a big problem</italic>).</p>
<p>Self-reported race/ethnicity was recoded into four indicator variables representing Black, Hispanic, White, and Other race/ethnicity. Additional control variables used in all analyses included age (in years), a count of the number of the respondent’s close friends who use tobacco, alcohol, or marijuana (ranging from 0 to 9), perceived parental caring (1 = <italic>not at all</italic>; 5 = <italic>very much</italic>), perceived parental closeness (1 = <italic>not at all</italic>; 5 = <italic>very much</italic>), parental education (0 = <italic>no school</italic>; 8 = <italic>professional degree</italic>), urbanicity (urban, suburban, rural), region (West, Midwest, Northeast, South), and proportion of White residents in the neighborhood. All control variables were measured at Wave 1.</p>

<title>Analytic Strategies</title>
<p>To analyze complete data for all 5,591 early adolescent girls in the analytic sample, multiple imputation was used to impute missing values for all variables of interest. Although none of the key variables of interest was missing data for more than 16% of cases, multiple imputation provides unbiased estimates that are always at least as good as those based on other procedures such as listwise or pairwise deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431611414061">Allison, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272431611414061">Graham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0272431611414061">Schafer &amp; Graham, 2002</xref>). Twenty-five imputed data sets were created based on information from all key variables of interest as well as auxiliary variables that were not included in the analysis for this study but have been established in prior literature as correlates of pubertal development and/or substance use (e.g., academic performance, school disciplinary problems, delinquent behavior, body mass index, depressive symptoms, sexual activity). Pooled estimates and inferential statistics were calculated by pooling results across the 25 data sets using Rubin’s methods of pooling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0272431611414061">1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models were used to predict the continuously measured alcohol outcome. Diagnostics indicated that none of the alcohol models grossly violated OLS assumptions of independence and normality of residuals, homoskedasticity, and relationship linearity. Negative binomial regression models were used to predict the tobacco and marijuana outcomes, which were both nonnegative count outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0272431611414061">Long, 1997</xref>). The negative binomial regression NB1 parameterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272431611414061">Cameron &amp; Trivedi, 1998</xref>) was used to specify a linear mean-variance relationship for models predicting tobacco and marijuana use. All negative binomial regression results are presented as exp[b], or incidence rate ratios (IRR) that represent the ratio of incidence rates of times used tobacco/marijuana for a one-unit increase in a predictor, holding other variables in the model constant. A Taylor Series variance estimation method was used to estimate all standard errors to adjust for the complex survey design.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272431611414061">Table 1</xref> presents descriptive statistics for the substance use, pubertal development, and neighborhood disadvantage variables. Overall, White adolescent girls reported the highest levels of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use at both waves of data collection, relative to girls who identified as Hispanic, Black, or an Other race. For instance, at Wave 1 when girls were age 10 to 15, on average White girls reported smoking cigarettes 4.6 days in the past month, versus 2.5 days in the past month for Hispanic girls, 1.7 days in the past month for Other race girls, and less than 1 day per month for Black girls. White adolescent girls also reported the most advanced pubertal development and resided in significantly lower risk neighborhoods compared to girls from other racial backgrounds.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0272431611414061">Table 2</xref> presents pooled estimates from six survey adjusted regression models predicting the main effects of pubertal development, race, and neighborhood disadvantage on adolescent girls’ substance use. The models predict each outcome at Wave 1 (i.e., when girls were age 10-15), and 1 year later at Wave 2 using predictors measured at Wave 1. The Wave 2 models are lagged longitudinal models that additionally control for baseline levels of substance use at Wave 1. As shown in the first panel of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0272431611414061">Table 2</xref>, pubertal development had a significant positive association with adolescent girls’ alcohol use at Wave 1 (<italic>b</italic> = .10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, 95% CI [.05, .15]; β = .07) as well as at Wave 2 even after adjusting for baseline levels of alcohol use (<italic>b</italic> = .06, <italic>p</italic> = .003, 95% CI [.02, .10]; β = .04). Although statistically significant, these effects were relatively small in absolute magnitude. For instance, at Wave 1 an early developing girl with a score of 5 on the pubertal development scale had a predicted alcohol use score of 3—equivalent to 1 to 2 binge-drinking or drunkenness episodes in the past year.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0272431611414061">3</xref></sup> An average developing girl with a score of 3 on the pubertal development scale had a predicted alcohol use score of 1.76, and a late developing girl with a pubertal development score of 1 had a predicted alcohol use score of 1.56—equivalent to between 0 and 2 drinking episodes in the past year. Black, Hispanic, and White adolescent girls’ alcohol use at either wave was not significantly different from alcohol use among girls from Other racial backgrounds (i.e., the reference category), and Wald tests indicated no significant differences in alcohol use between Black, Hispanic, and White adolescent girls. Contrary to expectations from theories of neighborhood social disorganization, neighborhood disadvantage had a significant negative relationship with girls’ alcohol use at Wave 1 net of the control variables (<italic>b</italic> = −.08, <italic>p</italic> = .02, 95% CI [−.14, −.02]; β = −.06). This indicates that girls living in more disadvantaged neighborhoods during early adolescence had significantly lower levels of alcohol use than their more affluent counterparts. This effect was attenuated to nonsignificance 1 year later at Wave 2 after adjusting for girls’ baseline levels of alcohol use.</p>

<p>The second panel of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0272431611414061">Table 2</xref> shows models predicting adolescent girls’ tobacco use. Results indicate that pubertal development was positively associated with tobacco use at Wave 1, exp(<italic>b</italic>) = 1.16; <italic>p</italic> = .001, 95% CI [1.07, 1.27], although this effect was attenuated by Wave 2 after adjusting for baseline levels of tobacco use, exp(<italic>b</italic>) = 1.07; <italic>p</italic> = .092, 95% CI [0.99, 1.16]. Again, however, the statistically significant effect on girls’ tobacco use during early adolescence was relatively small in absolute magnitude. At Wave 1 an early developing girl had a predicted tobacco use score equivalent to smoking cigarettes 2.7 days in the past month, versus 2 days in the past month for an average developing girl, and 1.5 days in the past month for a late-developing girl. White adolescent girls used tobacco at significantly higher levels than did girls from Other racial backgrounds, exp(<italic>b</italic>) = 2.04; <italic>p</italic> = .009, 95% CI [1.20, 3.46], as well as Black girls, linear combination exp(<italic>b</italic>) = 3.49; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, 95% CI[2.27, 5.36], and Hispanic girls, linear combination exp(<italic>b</italic>) = 1.49; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, 95% CI[1.03, 2.14]. Neighborhood disadvantage, however, did not have a significant main effect on adolescent girls’ tobacco use at either wave.</p>
<p>As shown in the third panel of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0272431611414061">Table 2</xref>, net of the control variables, pubertal development did not significantly influence adolescent girls’ marijuana use at Wave 1 or Wave 2. There were no significant differences in marijuana use for girls from different racial backgrounds. Finally, although neighborhood disadvantage did not influence girls’ marijuana use at Wave 1, it did have a significant positive relationship with girls’ marijuana use at Wave 2, exp(<italic>b</italic>) = 1.21; <italic>p</italic> = .005, 95% CI[1.06, 1.38]. This effect was relatively small in magnitude, however; at Wave 1 a girl residing in a neighborhood with low neighborhood disadvantage (i.e., one standard deviation below the mean disadvantage score) had a predicted marijuana use score equivalent to smoking marijuana less than once in the past month (.54 times in the past month), versus .79 times in the past month for a girl living in a neighborhood with a high level of neighborhood disadvantage (i.e., one standard deviation above the mean).</p>
<p>To examine the potential moderating effect of neighborhood disadvantage on the substance use risk associated with pubertal development, multiplicative interaction terms were used to examine two-way interactions between the pubertal development and neighborhood variables. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0272431611414061">Table 3</xref>, none of the two-way interactions attained statistical significance in the models predicting alcohol use, tobacco use, or marijuana use at either wave. Thus, results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0272431611414061">Table 3</xref> do not support the hypothesis that neighborhood disadvantage moderates the substance use risk associated with pubertal development among adolescent girls.</p>

<p>The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0272431611414061">Table 3</xref> do not account for any potential racial variation in the possible interaction between pubertal development and neighborhood disadvantage, however, and may therefore mask differences in the contextual specificity of the risk associated with pubertal development and neighborhood disadvantage. To explore the possibility of such a three-way interaction, the next set of models included all two-way interaction terms along with three-way multiplicative interaction terms for each of the pubertal development, neighborhood disadvantage, and race variables. As shown in the left panel of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0272431611414061">Table 4</xref>, the only three-way interactions that attained statistical significance were in the model predicting alcohol use at Wave 1, suggesting that neighborhood disadvantage did influence the effect of pubertal development on girls’ alcohol use but that this effect varied for girls from different racial categories. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272431611414061">Figure 1</xref> shows this three-way interaction by plotting the relationship between pubertal development and girls’ predicted alcohol use at Wave 1, by level of neighborhood disadvantage and race.

</fig>
<p>As shown in the last panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272431611414061">Figure 1</xref>, the three-way interaction between pubertal development, neighborhood disadvantage, and race was driven largely by the variation in effects for girls in the Other race category. Other race girls residing in low-disadvantage neighborhoods had consistently higher levels of alcohol use compared to their disadvantaged counterparts; thus low levels of neighborhood disadvantage eroded the substance use protection associated with late pubertal development and magnified the substance use risk associated with early pubertal development. In contrast, high levels of neighborhood disadvantage eroded the substance use protection associated with late pubertal development but actually buffered the substance use risk associated with earlier development. Split sample models for Other girls indeed indicated a significant interaction between pubertal development and neighborhood disadvantage (pubertal development <italic>b</italic> = .10, <italic>p</italic> = .42; neighborhood <italic>b</italic> = .92, <italic>p</italic> = .06; interaction <italic>b</italic> = −.33, <italic>p</italic> = .03). As reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0272431611414061">Table 4</xref>, this interaction between pubertal development and neighborhood disadvantage for Other girls was significantly different from the pattern of relationships for Black, Hispanic, and White girls.</p>
<p>As shown in the left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272431611414061">Figure 1</xref>, pubertal development had a positive relationship with alcohol use among Black girls who resided in high-disadvantage or average-disadvantage neighborhoods—and the steeper slope for Black girls in high-disadvantage neighborhoods does suggest some form of contextual amplification. Yet there was an opposite trend for Black girls residing in low-disadvantage neighborhoods—indicating that less developed (i.e., late developing) Black girls in more affluent neighborhoods actually had the highest levels of predicted alcohol use—even higher than early developing Black girls. However, this interaction between pubertal development and neighborhood disadvantage was not statistically significant in the split sample model estimated separately for Black girls (pubertal development <italic>b</italic> = .04, <italic>p</italic> = .58; neighborhood <italic>b</italic> = −.22, <italic>p</italic> = .07; interaction <italic>b</italic> = .05, <italic>p</italic> = .13). So although the interaction between pubertal development and neighborhood disadvantage predicting alcohol use was different for Black versus Other race girls (<italic>b</italic> = .34, <italic>p</italic> = .02), there was no evidence of significant variation among pubertal development effects for Black girls residing in different neighborhood contexts.</p>
<p>The second and third panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272431611414061">Figure 1</xref> indicate that although the relationships between pubertal development, neighborhood disadvantage, and alcohol use were significantly different for Hispanic and White girls compared to Other race girls (<italic>b</italic> = .32, <italic>p</italic> = .04; <italic>b</italic> = .30, <italic>p</italic> = .03, respectively), there was minimal variation within these racial groups. Overall, there was a consistent positive association between Hispanic and White girls’ level of pubertal development and alcohol use during early adolescence. This positive association was slightly stronger for girls living in more disadvantaged neighborhoods (as evidenced by the steeper slopes among girls in high-disadvantage neighborhoods). Again, however, split sample models estimated separately for Hispanic and White girls failed to detect significant two-way interactions between pubertal development and neighborhood disadvantage when predicting alcohol use in early adolescence. Furthermore, alternating the racial groups used as the reference category for the interactions in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0272431611414061">Table 4</xref> indicated that the interactions between pubertal development and neighborhood disadvantage predicting alcohol use during early adolescence were not significantly different for Black, Hispanic, and White girls. Thus the significant three-way interaction shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0272431611414061">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272431611414061">Figure 1</xref> was largely driven by the differences between Black, Hispanic, and White girls relative to girls in the Other racial category.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined the effects of pubertal development, neighborhood disadvantage, and race/ethnicity on early adolescent girls’ substance use, exploring the possibility of contextual amplification effects between individual- and neighborhood-level risk factors. By furthering an understanding of the multiple ecological contexts that influence adolescent substance use, findings from this study can be used to inform the development of targeted substance use prevention programs aimed at addressing youth’s ecological contexts of risk. Overall, results were consistent with recent literature reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0272431611414061">Short &amp; Rosenthal, 2008</xref>) suggesting that pubertal development has a consistent positive relationship with girls’ alcohol and tobacco use during early adolescence such that early developing girls are at higher risk of substance use. Additional sensitivity analyses (not shown here) that included a quadratic term for the pubertal development scale indicated no significant curvilinear effects in any of the models, thus providing no support for the off-timing hypothesis that both early and late developers may be at greater risk of substance use. Results from the current study also indicate that although pubertal development may be an important predictor of alcohol and tobacco use in early adolescence, it may not be an important predictor of marijuana use. This, along with the attenuation of effects over time, perhaps suggests that pubertal development may be risky for the initiation of substance use experimentation during early adolescence, after which other risk factors (e.g., association with substance using peers) may play a more important role in predicting the escalation of substance use. It is also plausible that the lack of findings for the marijuana use outcomes could be due in part to restricted variability in the marijuana measure among this sample of early adolescent girls; studies with long-term follow-up at older ages may be more likely to observe effects for marijuana and other hard drug use as they become more prevalent in the population (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0272431611414061">Hayatbakhsh, Najman, McGee, Bor, &amp; O’Callaghan, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Results also indicated that aggregating girls from different racial backgrounds, and perhaps more importantly, girls residing in different neighborhood contexts, may provide an overly simplified view of the substance use risk and protection associated with pubertal development. Consistent with the social ecological model and the contextual amplification hypothesis, the alcohol risk associated with more advanced or early pubertal development was somewhat magnified for Black girls residing in neighborhoods with high levels of disadvantage. However, in all other instances, low (rather than high) levels of neighborhood disadvantage tended to increase girls’ alcohol use risk during early adolescence. Contrary to predictions from neighborhood theories of the detrimental effects of social disorganization, these results suggest an alternative pattern of population specific risk for alcohol use, or what might be termed “advantaged” risk.</p>
<p>One possible explanation for the population-specific or advantaged risk relationships observed could be due to differences in the constellations of substance use risk factors for early developers residing in advantaged and disadvantaged neighborhoods. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431611414061">Chuang and colleagues (2005)</xref> found that alcohol use was higher among adolescents residing in high socioeconomic status neighborhoods, partly due to the fact that adolescents in more affluent neighborhoods had less parental monitoring and had parents who used more alcohol. Thus the alcohol risk associated with low-disadvantage neighborhoods may be due to differences in family processes that increase exposure to alcohol either directly—through alcohol use in the home—or indirectly through unsupervised activities outside of the home. Furthermore, recent research indicates that compared to their less advantaged counterparts, early developing adolescents residing in more advantaged neighborhoods exhibit higher levels of anxiety, depression, and other internalizing behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0272431611414061">McMahon &amp; Luthar, 2006</xref>)—all of which are important risk factors for adolescent alcohol use. Further research is needed to examine whether the alcohol use risk associated with more advantaged neighborhoods is truly due to specific positive or negative characteristics of neighborhood environments, or other individual or familial characteristics of early adolescents residing in those environments, or some combination of those factors.</p>
<p>Another possible social-psychological explanation for the population-specific or “advantaged” risk associated with pubertal development relates to the concept of pseudomaturity. Historical, social, and economic changes in the last century have lengthened the period of adolescence and delayed the transition to adulthood and its associated role transitions related to career and family formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272431611414061">Crockett, 1999</xref>). Within the contemporary United States pubertal development (and particularly early or asynchronous development) thus uniquely challenges youth as they learn to adapt to this developmental transition and shifts in role expectations. Theorists of adolescent development have proposed three clusters of adolescent maturity: pseudomature, immature, and mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272431611414061">Galambos, Barker, &amp; Tilton-Weaver, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0272431611414061">Tilton-Weaver, Vitunski, &amp; Galambos, 2001</xref>). Pseudomature adolescents, sometimes referred to as adultoid adolescents, are those who have attained social maturity (i.e., generally as related to autonomy) but lack psychological maturity. Immature adolescents lack both social and psychological maturity, whereas genuinely mature adolescents have both. Early pubertal developers characterized as pseudomature may thus be more likely to use substances like alcohol as a route to adulthood to seemingly bridge the gap between their physical and social psychological maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0272431611414061">Moffitt, 1993</xref>). Girls living in affluent, advantaged neighborhoods may be more likely to be pseudomature given the lack of structural constraints imposed upon their daily routines and hence maturity level. For instance, due to possible economic strains within the family, early developing girls in less affluent neighborhoods may be expected to help with family chores, childrearing, and even contribute to the family’s expenses through employment earnings. These responsibilities would likely engender genuine maturity as a girl learned to handle new adult roles and responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0272431611414061">Tilton-Weaver et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast, girls in affluent neighborhoods may be free from such expectations and therefore more likely to be pseudomature and engage in seemingly mature behaviors while delaying psychological maturity.</p>
<p>A larger theoretical as well as methodological implication of the current study is that the concepts of risk, protection, and resilience may be contextually sensitive. The literature focusing on risk associated with pubertal development (whether for substance use, mental health, sexual activity, delinquency, victimization, etc.) is continually growing. But the risk associated with early pubertal development may have been oversimplified in the literature due to a reliance on solely or primarily White, relatively affluent, participants. Researchers should therefore be aware of the potential contextual sensitivity of the substance use risk associated with pubertal development when conducting research and designing secondary prevention programs aimed at addressing the risk associated with pubertal development. Otherwise, if research devoid of context is used to inform universal preventive intervention programs, incomplete findings may waste valuable research monies better spent on targeted interventions or, more importantly, universal risk/protective factors with larger effect sizes (e.g., affiliation with substance using peers). Indeed, although results from this study highlight the importance of considering larger social contexts when discussing the substance use risk associated with pubertal development, it should be noted that many of the statistically significant relationships between pubertal development, neighborhood disadvantage, and adolescent girls’ substance use were relatively small in magnitude.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to the current study that should be addressed in future research. First, for data security issues the Add Health does not include unique neighborhood-level identifiers, precluding multilevel analyses or standard error adjustments for neighborhood clusters. Future studies examining the interactivity between individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics using multilevel models can contribute to the literature by modeling contextual effects of pubertal development. Due to data limitations, the current study also used census block groups to represent neighborhoods. Census block groups do not perfectly overlap with actual neighborhoods or communities, so continued research is needed to replicate these findings using more meaningful community boundaries. Finally, because this study focused only on adolescent girls, further research is needed to explore whether similar findings of advantaged risk occur for adolescent boys from different racial backgrounds.</p>
<p>The current study, grounded in the social ecological model, examined the potential interactions between pubertal development, neighborhood dislocations, race/ethnicity, and adolescent girls’ substance use, but did not focus on mediational models to explain the social processes driving these conditional effects. Following other research in the neighborhood effects literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272431611414061">Baumer &amp; South, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431611414061">Chuang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0272431611414061">Sampson, Morenoff, &amp; Gannon-Rowley, 2002</xref>), future studies are needed to examine the complex causal pathways and social processes that might explain why the risk of pubertal development may be more or less salient for adolescent girls residing in different types of neighborhoods. For instance, an interesting line of research would employ in-depth interviews to examine adolescent girls’ lived experiences of puberty and how their reference groups vary across neighborhood contexts. Furthermore, additional research is needed to examine the relationships between pubertal development, neighborhood dislocations, and substance use among girls from different ethnic groups. Sample size limitations in the current study precluded disaggregating the “Other” racial group into more specific racial categories such as Asian, Native American, Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders, and so on, and also precluded disaggregating Hispanic girls into other more meaningful ethnic groups such as Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans. Aggregating girls into crude ethnic categories could mask the potential variation in effects among these quite diverse groups of young girls, so more research is needed in this area.</p>
<p>Continued research is needed to propel contextually sensitive understandings of risk, protection, and resilience during early adolescence. Investigating the etiology of substance use among adolescents who have been historically underrepresented in empirical research, and recognizing the importance of larger social ecological contexts is crucial for the advancement of the field. By understanding when, where, and for whom risk is relevant, researchers will maximize their contributions to applied settings and inform the design of effective substance use intervention programs.</p>

<p>The different time frames of the substance use outcomes (i.e., alcohol in the past year; tobacco and marijuana in the past month) were due to differences in item wording on the original Add Health questionnaires. The Add Health did not include any alcohol use in the past month items, nor any items on tobacco or marijuana use in the past year.</p></fn>

<p>Another common measure of adolescent girls’ pubertal development is age at menarche. Although this measure was available in Add Health, this analysis only uses the physical development items as they more fully capture changes in visible maturation that are noticeable by others and therefore more likely to elicit changes in a girls’ self-perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0272431611414061">Tanner-Smith, 2009</xref>). Exploratory factor analyses indicated that age at menarche was not an empirically equivalent measure of pubertal development. Additional sensitivity analyses using age at menarche as a control variable did not substantively alter the results reported here.</p></fn>

<p>The low, average, and high values used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272431611414061">Figure 1</xref> are based on means and standard deviations of the neighborhood disadvantage scale within each race group given the wide variability in neighborhood disadvantage across racial groups. Using grand sample means and standard deviations for the neighborhood disadvantage categories yielded a similar pattern of results, but the numbers are less meaningful given the small number of girls who would be represented in certain categories (e.g., Black or Hispanic girls in low-disadvantage neighborhoods).</p></fn>
