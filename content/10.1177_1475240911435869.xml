<abstract>
<p>This article explores perspectives and strands of thought among teachers from five countries about power dynamics in learning environments, perspectives on power of dominant cultures and impacts of power on concepts of citizenship and social justice. Discourses revealed teachers have some understanding of how power impacts teaching and learning, how language empowers/disempowers students and how teachers and students use their power. Teachers’ and students’ perceptions of power in the learning environment likely shape educational experiences for all stakeholders. Effective empowerment, particularly of students, requires recognition of these and other factors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There are few places in society where power dynamics are as significant and influential as in Kindergarten-Grade 12 (K-12) classrooms. Teacher-student, student-student and teacher-teacher relationships commonly compress dynamics related to authority, technology, language, ideology, dominant culture, race, gender and class, all of which can influence learners throughout their academic careers and adult lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1475240911435869">Crowther et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1475240911435869">Harris, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1475240911435869">Hruska, 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1475240911435869">Johnson-Bailey and Cervero, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1475240911435869">Sears, 2011</xref>). Pertinent literature indicates this area of study is in need of deeper investigation, particularly as it relates to culturally, ethnically and socioeconomically diverse learning environments. As the world becomes more informationally, economically, culturally and educationally interdependent, it becomes necessary for teachers to develop critical understandings of power, classroom power dynamics and the power-related roles of stakeholders in the learning process.</p>
<p>Culturally and educationally diffusive understandings are more critical in international learning environments because such progressive settings provide insights into the future of education in an increasingly interconnected world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240911435869">Robbins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1475240911435869">Tisdell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1475240911435869">Van Hook, 2011</xref>). Considering the unique history and evolving relationship between the USA and various South American populations, US-style K-12 schools in Latin America provide a rich environment for a study of this nature. It was hypothesized that investigations into stakeholders’ perceptions of power dynamics in these learning environments may reveal patterns of thought and trends of interaction related to race, class, ethnicity and language that help clarify how students’ needs are met, or what teachers need to do to improve their approach. Critical understandings of power and power dynamics can lead to better teaching, more effective classroom management, and an environment that is more sensitive and conducive to meeting the academic, affective and social needs of students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475240911435869">Black, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1475240911435869">Hogan, 2002</xref>). The purpose of this study was to explore perspectives and deeper strands of thought among K-12 teachers from five countries about how they describe power dynamics in learning environments, what perspectives they hold about the power of dominant cultures and how power impacts concepts of citizenship and socially just education.</p>
<p>Power, commonly understood as the influence of an individual or group upon another, or the ability to make people do what they would not otherwise have done, may be more specifically described in a variety of ways. British logician and philosopher Bertrand Russell (1938: 4) defined power as ‘the production of intended effects’ and implied that in order to understand societal trends and issues among a given population, one must first analyze the power dynamics of the environment being examined. Socialist writer Antonio Gramsci (1971) discussed ideological power and the role of cultural hegemony as a means of bolstering capitalism and the nation-state. Gramsci asserted that a power struggle exists in regular society that impacts virtually every facet of human civilization, particularly education. American writer and futurist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1475240911435869">Alvin Toffler (1990)</xref> later identified three main kinds of power found in every society: violence, wealth and knowledge. Violence, according to Toffler, can only be used in a negative way, while wealth can be used both negatively and positively. Knowledge can be used in negative and positive ways and further develop into transformational uses. Toffler’s theories contributed to the popular ‘knowledge is power’ campaign of the 1970s. The campaign espoused the idea that acts of learning, presumably in K-12 classroom settings, empower learners to learn more, control their minds and become productive members of society.</p>
<p>In educational contexts, the power of knowledge is a critical component of social, academic and cultural development and identity. What stakeholders, individuals or groups, hold power in a given educational setting? What does that power look like? How is it used or manipulated? What social, academic and cultural factors affect perceptions of power and power dynamics? How does power shape identity? Investigations into these and similar questions may offer insights into how participants perceive power as it relates to learning and the learning environment.</p>
    <p>Brazilian educator, pioneer and critical pedagogue, Paulo Freire, theorized that people develop and carry archives of social, academic and cultural knowledge within them throughout their lives. In <italic>The Politics of Education: Culture, Power and Liberation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1475240911435869">1985</xref>), Freire rejected the idea that people remain ignorant unless they have learned to communicate using the culture of the powerful, considering each person a part of a <italic>culture circle</italic> with a personal view of reality, based on the circumstances of everyday living. Similarly, feminist author and activist, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1475240911435869">bell hooks (2003)</xref>, observed that questions of power and authority, particularly relating to race, gender, culture and class, permeate the learning environment and deeply shape students’ perceptions, motivations and engagements. In <italic>Teaching Community: A Pedagogy of Hope</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1475240911435869">2003</xref>), hooks advocated educational relationships promoting learning among students and their teachers in such a way that no one acquires the kind of power to use the classroom as a space of domination. This relationship is based on a diffused hierarchy and the creation of a sense of community and autonomy. The classroom, according to hooks, should be a place that sustains life and expands minds; a place of liberating mutuality where teacher and students work together in partnership to bring about social change.</p>
<p>Dialogue can bring about social change. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1475240911435869">Freire (1985)</xref> suggested, dialogue directly opposes the monologue of the culture of the powerful, expanding understandings of the world rather than teaching a single, precise understanding. Intercultural dialogue encourages exploration of an individual’s assumptions and perceptions about culture, identity, citizenship and society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1475240911435869">Merryfield, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1475240911435869">Paige, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1475240911435869">Sunal and Christensen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1475240911435869">Tyson et al., 1997</xref>). Intercultural dialogue about power dynamics in the learning environment can help teachers and students compare and contrast their cultural and social experiences and analyze how their conceptions of identity, race, gender, culture and class are shaped within a safe environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1475240911435869">Sears, 2011</xref>). This dialogue may be particularly revealing when comparing school environments between North and South America, as there is only modest research in this comparative vein.</p>
<p>Teacher education programs working to facilitate such dialogue can be grounded in the works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475240911435869">Bennett (1993)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475240911435869">Black (2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1475240911435869">Joseph (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1475240911435869">Hogan (2002)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1475240911435869">Johnson-Bailey and Cervero (1998)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1475240911435869">Stachowski and Mahan (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1475240911435869">Zeichner and Hoeff (1996)</xref>. In their studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1475240911435869">Hogan (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1475240911435869">Johnson-Bailey and Cervero (1998)</xref> explored the classroom as a community. Their work led them to implications that power and power dynamics indicate community health and effective learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475240911435869">Black (2009)</xref> took the community concept further by investigating how the Internet and global information community affects classroom power dynamics. He determined that such technology could alter power perceptions for students and teachers based on the legitimacy of informational sources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475240911435869">Bennett (1993)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1475240911435869">Joseph (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1475240911435869">Stachowski and Mahan (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1475240911435869">Zeichner and Hoeff (1996)</xref> studied cross-cultural power dynamics in the classroom. They purport that as the world continues to change and classrooms become more diverse in terms of culture and other factors, perceptions of power can sharply impress students’ motivation, proclivities for lifelong learning and general love of learning.</p>
<p>The ever-evolving relationships between the USA and various South American populations seemed a particularly rich phenomenon for a study of this nature. Specifically, the natures and relations of US-style K-12 schools in Latin America, wherein issues of culture, perceived race and ethnicity, socioeconomics and language are such that researchers deemed this to be an ideal setting for an investigation into power and power dynamics in the classroom. Power in these settings, as it is demonstrated by teachers and students, is linked to each of these factors, and was, according to researchers, immediately observable.</p>
<p>One constant theme in the research literature is support for the idea that dialogue about classroom power dynamics provides teachers with opportunities to deconstruct stereotypes and replace them with dynamic perspectives based on evidence acquired through authentic interactions. Increasing classroom diversity presents teachers with unique opportunities to define the learning environment and demonstrate recognition of and appreciation for students’ unique identities. Increased diversity also presents teachers with considerable challenges, including helping students to recognize and assert their own identities as they understand their own power as learners and citizens. To address these challenges and to identify other implications of power, we focused on teachers’ descriptions of the power dynamics in learning environments and their views about how power impacts the concepts of citizenship and socially just education.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The study, conducted over a period of 13 weeks, utilized online dialogue between 120 teachers enrolled in graduate programs in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay and the USA. We sought to answer the following research questions:</p>
<list id="list1-1475240911435869" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>(What are teachers’ perspectives of power in the learning environment?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(How are teachers’ perspectives of power influenced by dominant cultures?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How do classroom power dynamics impact concepts of citizenship and ideas of socially just education?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The data reported here are excerpted from a larger study investigating K-12 teachers’ online sharing of perspectives on the intersections of culture and citizenship (Sunal et al., 2010).</p>
<p>This study used a content analysis methodology to analyze the data. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1475240911435869">Neuendorf (2002)</xref>, content analysis is particularly appropriate for narrative data that are largely contextual and have been collected in an electronic format. Content analysis in essence is a word frequency method. The more frequently a word or group of words is mentioned within the data, the greater importance it usually has. During coding and categorizing of the data, exhaustive categories are met as data when no data fall between two data category points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1475240911435869">Weber, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Participants (<italic>N</italic> = 120) were classroom teachers (K-12) enrolled in master’s degree programs of study offered by one of two major research universities in the southeastern USA. The two universities offered graduate coursework either on the main campus, or on site in overseas settings, or both. All teachers in schools outside the USA (<italic>n</italic> = 90, 72 percent) taught at American-style international schools, which offer most, if not all, of their instruction (at least half the school day) in English. Each school outside the USA was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). Student populations at these schools were comprised largely of children of middle- to upper-middle-class nationals and foreign nationals working in the host country (Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador or Paraguay). More than half of the teacher participants from schools outside the USA (<italic>n</italic> = 51, 57 percent) were locally hired nationals. Six of these teachers (5 percent) were US citizen spouses of nationals living permanently in the country and 23 teachers (25 percent) were US citizens. Among these overseas teacher participants, 32 (36 percent) were male and 58 (64 percent) were female.</p>
<p>The teachers in the USA (<italic>n</italic> = 30) were enrolled at either the main campus of a research university located in a city of 100,000, or a nearby partner urban university in a city of 230,000. Of the 30 US teachers, 57 percent (<italic>n</italic> = 17) were female and 43 percent (<italic>n</italic> = 13) male; 33 percent (<italic>n</italic> = 10) identified themselves as Black while the rest, 67 percent (<italic>n</italic> = 20), identified themselves as European American, and a large range of teaching experience was reported.</p>
<p>All US teachers were enrolled in master’s degree elementary or secondary social studies methods courses at one of the two southeastern universities. The Colombian and Ecuadoran teachers, similarly, were enrolled in master’s degree social studies methods courses at their respective sites. The Brazilian teachers were enrolled in a master’s degree reading course and the Paraguayan class was enrolled in a master’s degree science methods course. At all sites, researchers assumed that the participants in the social studies methods course had little or no prior social studies methods coursework, so the focus of these classes was on exploring and developing appropriate curriculum and teaching methods as needed by individual participants. All social studies courses placed significant emphasis on constructivist perspectives and methods. Instructors of the science and reading methods courses also assumed participants might have little or no prior coursework in the area and thus placed significant emphasis on constructivist perspectives and methods. All courses were founded on principles of social justice in society, in the school environment and in the classroom. The two non-social studies methods courses enabled researchers to include a sample of participants that represented a wider range of teachers than only those enrolled in the social studies methods courses. This allowed researchers to examine classroom power and power dynamics in a broader variety of curricular disciplines.</p>
<p>At all sites data were collected via a free-access Internet classroom assistant (ICA) website designed to allow teacher participants freedom to post comments or responses on discussion boards at times of their choosing. We chose this website and the discussion board format because it was conducive to discussion and reflection, making it a reliable means by which comments and responses could be posted and viewed by teachers at all sites. We also opted for this format because comments and responses appeared in chronological order by posting time/date and were visible to all teachers throughout the data collection phase of the study. The discussion board format allowed all teachers to follow threaded conversations as they developed and encouraged their careful consideration of questions, comments and responses.</p>
<p>Teachers in all classes received an initial orientation to the ICA website and the discussion boards during class time at each of the sites, and were allowed to make initial postings to questions during this time. Time was set aside in other class sessions, averaging 45 minutes, for teachers’ postings and they were encouraged to make postings outside of class. About 88 percent (<italic>n</italic> = 106) contributed to the discussions at additional times beyond those available in class.</p>
<p>We collected, analyzed and reanalyzed data through a matrix of distilled words and phrases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1475240911435869">Neuendorf, 2002</xref>) and content analysis of threaded discussions was used for interpreting meaning of teachers’ postings. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1475240911435869">Weber (1990)</xref> suggests should happen, researchers (three, in this case) independently coded data. Once further revisions to the coded titles and agreement were reached, categories were tight enough to maximize exclusivity for each theme. The research questions listed above guided the categorization process during the reanalysis of the data. These questions emerged from the initial analysis of the culture and citizenship data of the original study. As we investigated teachers’ perspectives on the intersection of culture and citizenship, we observed numerous references to the significance of power and power dynamics in their classrooms. As we probed deeper, we found that teachers’ perspectives on power dynamics significantly influenced their effectiveness and interaction with students. We determined additional findings could be inferred. Analysis of these perspectives allowed us to identify, explore and separate interwoven and interconnected conversations on power and power dynamics in the classroom, conversational gaps that became apparent in the data, tensions that emerged and continuities and discontinuities that appeared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1475240911435869">Clandinnin and Connelly, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1475240911435869">Neuendorf, 2002</xref>; Sunal et al., 2010).</p>
<p>Strategies to protect the authenticity and trustworthiness of the data were implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1475240911435869">Lincoln and Guba, 1985</xref>). To ensure inter-rater reliability throughout the data analysis process, three readers (researchers) analyzed the data and shared themes they had identified. These readers met and discussed their identifications in five extensive sessions to achieve consensus on the themes. Readers also were alert to bias among those reading the text and writing the narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1475240911435869">Glesne, 2005</xref>). To protect participants’ identities, each teacher was assigned a number. These three-digit numbers were coded to reveal the school site location of each participant. Three-digit numbers beginning with 1 (for instance 105) represent participants currently living and working in Brazil. Three-digit numbers beginning with 2, 3, 4 and 5 represent participants currently living and working in Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay and the USA, respectively.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>Analysis and reanalysis of the data identified emergent discourses among teachers relating to power and power dynamics in the classroom. These findings were applied to, organized around and presented using the three research questions and related discussion threads.</p>
<sec id="section4-1475240911435869">
<title>Question 1: What are teachers’ perspectives of power in the learning environment?</title>
<p>We identified five threads for Question 1: (a) teachers and students are aware of power dynamics in the classroom; (b) teachers use their power to initiate and encourage learning, what is learned and how it is learned; (c) the dominant language is empowering to students and teachers who speak it and disempowering to those who do not; (d) the globalization of society and internationalization of education strongly affect classroom power dynamics and (e) some teachers use their position of power to instill various values and cultural expectations in their students.</p>
<sec id="section5-1475240911435869">
<title>Thread A: Teachers and students are aware of power dynamics in the classroom</title>
<p>Teacher 303 (Ecuador) began the discourse on power dynamics with a rhetorical question: ‘What are the effects of having a teacher from the “dominant culture” teaching in a classroom of a ‘minority culture’ considering the reality of cultural imperialism?’ To this, teacher 207 (Colombia) responded: ‘As a teacher representing a dominant culture as defined by cultural imperialism, I am concerned about the effects on the identity development of my students and their perspective of their own culture.’ Teacher 508 (USA) suggested that, in this regard, a teacher’s power can be implemented both positively and negatively. Teacher 405 (Paraguay) concurred and expanded the discussion noting that the teacher’s power lies in his/her ability to speak and teach to diverse cultures through all areas of the curriculum. As she explained: ‘Most of my students are from non-American backgrounds … some are ‘third culture kids’ [who are] excited to learn about the cultures of their friends and even other cultures.’ Teacher 502 (USA) agreed, and added that teachers must be careful not to leave students with the idea that concepts such as citizenship are to be merely defined as ‘grouping people into a social class and trying to keep them there, for the power structures to take effect and remain in power’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1475240911435869">
<title>Thread B: Teachers use their power to initiate and encourage learning, what is learned and how it is learned</title>
<p>Teacher 201 (Colombia) began this discussion by proposing that classroom teachers utilize their power in both dynamic and subtle ways to pass on ideas of culture and citizenship, and to make clear their behavioral expectations. Teacher 501 (USA) opined that it also is important to look at what teaching materials educators select in order to teach certain content. The power to select teaching materials is critical to the learning process. ‘Literature,’ for instance, ‘brings to the forefront values, beliefs and customs held by particular societies. That is why it is so imperative that teachers evaluate the materials they use for bias.’</p>
<p>Teacher 502 (USA) added that teachers and administrators use their power to ‘submerge students and parents into the preferred culture through various means. The primary language being English already submerges every student into the culture of America.’ This teacher continued, noting that learning depends largely on ‘individual teachers and how they are choosing to present lessons to their students, accounting for their own biases and preferences’. Teacher 502 (USA) expanded on this idea, suggesting: ‘We, as educators, must ensure we are teaching students to embrace their own culture, while acculturating into the overall culture of the USA.’ But, to this, teacher 402 (Paraguay) suggested that teachers cannot insist on certain cultural engagements. ‘The most we can do is appreciate difference, introduce ideas, provide multicultural lessons, teach across the curriculum and share experiences.’ Several teachers agreed at least in part with teacher 402 and implied that teachers cannot abuse their power by maintaining some covert agenda or teaching only certain parts of a curriculum.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1475240911435869">
<title>Thread C: Dominant language is empowering to students and teachers who speak it and disempowering to those who do not</title>
<p>Teacher 202 (Colombia) and teacher 406 (Paraguay) then turned to language and language empowerment. Teacher 202 observed that in his school, ‘language and textbooks from the USA are primary ways USA culture is viewed’, but that these textbooks and the English language are ‘not necessarily adopted by students from Colombia or other countries’. He and other teachers suggested that, in this setting, students can become empowered or disempowered depending on how well they speak the dominant language. Teacher 404 (Paraguay) agreed and added: ‘With language acquisition one can learn a lot [more content], but it is definitely by being immersed in the culture that one constructs a better knowledge of it.’ Teacher 403 (Paraguay) tempered this statement, asserting that it depends on the language in question:</p>

<p>In Paraguay … the indigenous language, Guarani, is viewed as a language of the poor and uneducated. When students sit in Guarani class they often show disrespect toward the teacher and tell her that they think the language useless, despite the fact that the majority of people in Paraguay speak Guarani.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Teacher 102 (Brazil) suggested that in order for students to be empowered in terms of language acquisition, it is important for teachers to have had similar experiences. She posited ‘I remember teaching ESL in the States and learning so much about other cultures from my students and their families, but it never made so much sense until I actually experienced it myself through immersion in another culture.’ Teacher 514 (USA) agreed, adding that language acquisition should be accompanied by an active acculturation of students because ‘language is not a big problem in comparison with a new culture, when you cannot understand why people think and behave in a way different from you’. Teacher 401 (Paraguay) also agreed, asserting that this combined approach empowers students because language and culture (including ethnic, racial, religious and language diversity) must be complementary if students are to learn democratic values such as justice and equality.</p>

<title>Thread D: Globalization of society and internationalization of education strongly affect classroom power dynamics</title>
<p>As discourse continued, a substantial theme emerged relating to internationalization of learning environments and the implications of such progress on teacher/student power dynamics. Teacher 503 (USA) observed that as the world becomes more interconnected, cultural lines are blurred and harder to define. This globalization, she continued, ‘is becoming more and more true for everyone and not just people from the US that grew up in Military or missionary families’. Teacher 109 (Brazil) concurred, adding: ‘Travel and living in other countries can change one’s perspective radically.’ Teacher 315 (Ecuador) expanded this comment by saying:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>As the world becomes more pluralistic and globalized these behaviors are becoming more intermixed and generational as generations across cultures are dealing with changes in life styles, due to new technology, nearly simultaneously. These changes affect different culture groups differently, but as common themes emerge, will a more global culture result?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Teacher 512 (USA) answered: ‘We learn from each other … but in the end our legacy will be judged by the strength of our [global] community and the hope of a prosperous future.’ Teacher 301 (Ecuador) agreed, adding: ‘Globalization and the many ways of communication we have with people all over the world … is reshaping much more than what we think and much faster than we realize.’</p>
<p>Several teachers pointed out that the implications of these developments on teaching and learning are immense and not entirely measurable at this point, but teachers must become more responsible regarding their use of power. Teacher 408 (Paraguay) stated ‘I would say that the way that the students learn the most about the “host” American culture is through their interactions with the American teachers’, suggesting this could be a positive or a negative process. Teacher 103 (Brazil) responded by stating ‘I think it is impossible NOT to Americanize a Brazilian student when they come to an American school because schools naturally pass on culture. It’s embedded in the education process.’</p>

<title>Thread E: Some teachers use their position of power to instill various values and cultural expectations</title>
<p>Teachers transitioned into a discourse on their general use of power in instilling cultural expectations. Teacher 206 (Colombia) observed that culture is a ‘set of values, beliefs and ways of perceiving things in which every person is immersed. Culture affects learning styles that may be developed through learners’ early life experience’. Teacher 505 (USA) agreed, adding that teachers can and should ‘show our values and cultural beliefs through modeling in the schools, much like we model study skills, note-taking strategies, problem-solving methods’. As a result, according to several teachers, students’ behavior and learning is significantly impacted. Teacher 307 (Ecuador) specified:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A teacher can transmit their own culture through the way they run their classroom. If a teacher is more open and knowledgeable about other cultures then they are more likely to incorporate cultures into all areas of their classroom as compared to a more ethnocentric teacher.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To this, teacher 316 (Ecuador) cautioned:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>As teachers, it is critical that we first obtain awareness of the biases, values and presumptions that we carry from our personal culture. We need to recognize the tendency to label and place others in stereotypical boxes, even though we expect others not to label us and prejudge us. With this awareness, teachers need to focus upon opening doors for learning.</p>

<title>Question 2: How are teachers’ perspectives on power influenced by dominant cultures?</title>
<p>We identified two threads for Question 2: (a) teachers’ perceptions of the dominant culture can substantially and sharply affect classroom power dynamics in positive ways; and (b) teachers’ perceptions of the dominant culture can substantially and sharply affect classroom power dynamics in negative ways.</p>
<sec id="section11-1475240911435869">
<title>Thread A: Teachers’ perceptions of the dominant culture can substantially and sharply affect classroom power dynamics in positive ways</title>
<p>Several teachers asserted that classroom power dynamics are sharply affected by how teachers perceive the dominant culture. Teacher 319 (Ecuador) asserted that educators can and should lead by example and that they ‘have many opportunities to positively guide students to become citizens that develop actions, values, attitudes that can directly benefit others’. Teacher 108 (Brazil) agreed, adding: ‘At my school in Brazil, by having such a big international body of students and staff, exchange of ideas of culture happens all the time, even just by having students interacting with each other’. Teacher 303 (Ecuador) followed this by observing her school has:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>adopted a US curriculum that emphasizes the beliefs, values and traditions (not to mention language) of the U.S. In our school, culture is not only transmitted through said curriculum, but also through the culture represented by the teachers and staff who are also North American. Though the school is located in Ecuador, the policies of the school mostly represent those of the US, thus further transmitting aspects of US culture.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In reference to the Ecuadoran school, teacher 320 (Ecuador) also pointed out: ‘This is an Americentric curriculum which undoubtedly passes on ideas about dominant culture in the US, American cultural phenomena and the power of English.’ Teacher 205 (Colombia) compared this to her experience in Britain:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>British society has largely nurtured individual cultures … supporting individual religions with government funding for faiths not traditional to the UK. This has resulted in dynamically distinct cultural areas in a small geographical area. There are advantages and disadvantages, but overall, our culture is vibrant and very diverse.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Teacher 508 (USA) asserted that teachers everywhere should have power to make important decisions regarding the materials and resources they use in their classes and that many of these materials and resources demonstrate their understanding of the dominant culture, in this case American (US) culture, but also conceded that ‘some teachers do a wonderful job picking these resources and others do not’. Teacher 503 (USA) extended this assertion: ‘All public institutions in a country are based on the values, beliefs and culture of the predominant culture.’ Teacher 506 (USA) pointed out that not all American schools address the predominant culture the same way: ‘When I taught in Georgia, more of the curriculum was focused around becoming more culturally aware of differences and similarities between students, especially since it was extremely diverse.’ Teacher 510 (USA) explained that perceptions in private schools take the idea of a dominant culture even further:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>All teachers, aides and students in my school attend mass on Thursday morning. This process helps our school community come together as one. It allows the older children to be leaders for the younger children and it is a time of reflection. Every mass is prepared by a different classroom of students, so this teaches the students leadership skills and helps them develop their speaking ability.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Teacher 308 (Ecuador) resolved that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Schools and teachers are facilitators of the [predominant] culture. In American schools, students learn from texts about other cultures, different from their own. Kids then have the opportunity of learning about other points of view and getting to know how people of other countries live. As teachers we need to make it clear that not all that is in a book will always be the best for every individual.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, teacher 104 (Brazil) summed up the positive empowerment of students by stating that we should all promote an environment of ‘open-mindedness and tolerance that are common to many cultures … It’s not that I forget about the ME, but that now the WE is much more important’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1475240911435869">
<title>Thread B: Teachers’ perceptions of the dominant culture can substantially and sharply affect classroom power dynamics in negative ways</title>
<p>As this discourse continued, several teachers, particularly those from the USA, observed that there also may be negative implications of such perceptions of dominant culture. Teacher 508 (USA) identified an example of this negativity: ‘From my experience many textbooks display cultures other than that of the writers in a negative aspect.’ Teacher 503 (USA) also recalled:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Honestly, [attending school] in the United States, very little was taught about other cultures and other countries … The focus was primarily on the culture of the USA. The cultural imprinting that happened was the belief that the US was the only country that mattered. When I lived in Germany it was an entirely different experience, we not only learned about the German culture, we learned about other countries in Europe (and would take field trips to visit them). I do not remember learning anything about cultures outside of Europe save for one or two lessons where they combined Africa, Asia and South America. The cultural message was clear.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, teacher 504 (USA) reported:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I do not remember learning a lot about other nations outside of the US other than Africa during Black History Month. I also remember that one day out of the school year we celebrated other cultures by bringing in artifacts and food items that were indicative of those cultures. What a travesty. I do not remember an emphasis being placed on the importance of valuing the contributions of other nations.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Teacher 502 (USA) observed: ‘Many teachers may discuss the Hispanic culture by simply having a taco dinner with the students. While this is a cultural link, it really only gives our aspect into the Hispanic culture.’ Finally, teacher 306 (Ecuador) asserted:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We are hired to be ‘educational hitmen’ and teach American culture to whatever country we are in with little regard to local culture. That is the attraction of the school to its clients; that is the implied job we are given; and that is the boat that we don’t want to rock as foreign teachers if we try to be more multicultural.</p>

<title>Question 3: How do classroom power dynamics impact concepts of citizenship and other ideas?</title>
<p>We identified three threads for Question 3: (a) teachers recognize their power and responsibilities relating to the promotion of cultural and civic competence; (b) many teachers use their power to model and elicit behaviors conducive to good citizenship in the classroom and in society; and (c) students use their power, which is often determined by socioeconomics, to assert themselves and establish their identities.</p>
<sec id="section14-1475240911435869">
<title>Thread A: Teachers recognize their power and responsibilities relating to the promotion of cultural and civic competence</title>
<p>Teacher 504 (USA) opened the discourse by positing:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I believe that schools transmit culture and ideas of citizenship to students through modeling. We model behaviors that we want our students to emulate. We encourage them to become active participants in the community through activities to include voting and community service. We model behaviors that give credence to morality and social justice, as well as behaviors that will inspire them to become citizens that will make positive contributions to the local, state and national communities.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Teacher 106 (Brazil) then asked:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Are schools responsible for teaching our children our culture or other cultures? We can barely teach about our culture during their entire time at school. We need to remind parents that they should help their kids with their learning process. Parenting is a great link to culture to have our kids succeeding at school throughout their life time.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Teacher 304 (Ecuador) spoke to this question and responsibility for empowerment of students by stating:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[Teachers] teach children the ways in which they affect their surroundings, how they can be responsible students, responsible family members and responsible friends. Hopefully this value is well transferred into everyday living situations, which is why I feel strongly that kids should be encouraged to connect those views of responsibilities with citizenship.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Teacher 507 (USA) followed up by stating:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think an excellent place to look at how we pass on ideas of citizenship and culture is the student handbook. In many ways, what we are establishing through the rules that are set by each school is how we define ‘good’ citizens and how we define what is culturally acceptable within our communities.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1475240911435869">
<title>Thread B: Many teachers use their power to model and elicit behaviors conducive to good citizenship in the classroom and in society</title>
<p>Teacher 304 (Ecuador) opened by stating: ‘Teaching children to identify their role within the community, and promoting the ways in which they can practice responsible civic duties, is a powerful and enduring understanding that will hopefully be practiced once they reach adulthood.’ Teacher 106 (Brazil) concurred, pointing out: ‘We are facilitators trying to have our students develop and understand the definitions of culture, citizenship and schools.’ Teacher 504 (USA) also agreed, expanding the idea by saying:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I believe that teachers transmit culture and ideas of citizenship to students through modeling. We model behaviors that we want our students to emulate. We encourage them to become active participants in the community at large through activities to include voting and community service. We model behaviors that give credence to morality and social justice, as well as behaviors that will inspire them to become citizens that will make positive contributions to the local, state and national communities at large.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Teacher 501 (USA) then admitted: ‘I teach in a rural area in Alabama. It has been a mission of mine for several years to integrate a variety of experiences in other cultures.’ Teacher 510 (USA) observed:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Our school teaches about American culture and other cultures as well through literature and social studies, but religion plays an important role in our culture here at school. Religion helps to teach our students how to be conscious citizens, why they should be philanthropic and how to leave this world a better place then when they entered it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, teacher 404 (Paraguay) added:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Textbooks are the primary means to "pass on" ideas of culture and citizenship, but they are definitely complemented by the faculty and staff’s modeling and other activities that allow for the school’s community to ‘experience’ culture and citizenship in a certain way.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Teacher 502 (USA) shifted the conversation to another plane by stating: ‘I think, in general, that we pass on the cultures and citizenships WE desire our students to have.’ Teacher 105 (Brazil) responded: ‘Instead of trying to impose our cultures, we must learn how to work, the best way we can, with the culture we encounter. It makes us grow as human beings and consequently as world citizens too.’ Teacher 403 (Paraguay) agreed and opined: ‘While I, as a teacher, can pass on some elements of my culture, I believe that it is the interactions amongst students that transmit culture in the most effective and meaningful way.’ To this, teacher 306 (Ecuador) responded:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We, as teachers, must work to pass on more egalitarian cultural values to our students. We must try especially hard to pass on cultural values that are common to all people of our country and not just the privileged elite.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, teacher 107 (Brazil) summed up this discussion by resolving: ‘I believe that people can learn a great deal from each other’s perspectives, especially if they have an open mind. After all, as far as I understand none of us have a monopoly on the truth.’</p>

<title>Thread C: Students use their power, which is often determined by socioeconomics, to assert themselves and establish their identities</title>
<p>Teacher 301 (Ecuador) pointed out that: ‘Most international schools in Ecuador are like a microcosm of the Ecuadorian Society which reflects the existing social structure, perpetuating the social relationships and attitudes needed to sustain the existing dominant economic power.’ Teacher 310 (Ecuador) replied:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The privileged group defines itself as the one that has the ‘right’ culture, therefore the ones that are the most educated, have right to have the power and make decisions for everyone … Sadly, we humans tend to put cultures in a hierarchy of which has more importance and value, devaluing everything else.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Teacher 314 (Ecuador) continued: ‘Teachers in international schools are paid to come and teach ‘American’ culture so that the students of the wealthy and privileged can attend college in the U.S. Does the profession of International Education perpetuate the notion of cultural imperialism?’ Teacher 403 (Paraguay) concurred:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I work at the American School [in Asuncion], which is viewed as the most prestigious school in the country. Here, there is undoubtedly a more legitimate or preferred culture. People respect fair skin and features. Dark skin and indigenous features are regarded in a negative light.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Teacher 110 (Brazil) spoke on the socioeconomic implications of culture in Brazil: ‘If you are black and poor, even though education and health care are supposedly free, the majority of people get very little of either one. They are, therefore, very poorly prepared to exercise their rights as citizens.’ Teacher 313 (Ecuador) spoke of the implications for students: ‘These kids usually find themselves lacking. Their heritage says that they are the legitimate culture, but the schools are saying otherwise.’</p>
<p>Teacher 501 (USA) opined ‘Socioeconomic status is part of a person’s culture. Most people would prefer to be a part of the more affluent.’ To this, teacher 102 (Brazil) responded:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>And with such a gap in the socioeconomic status and repercussions and resentments of that, we can still manage to appreciate the cultural aspects of that non-preferred and lower economic status culture, as it may be. We just need to fill in that gap.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Teacher 507 (USA) responded by suggesting students learn from each other:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think this could be accomplished by establishing some sort of video conferencing session in schools’ distance learning lab. Students could prepare virtual tours of their communities and talk about the different concerns that they face each day within their particular environment. This type of activity would promote dialogue between diverse ethnic and socioeconomic groups and perhaps help disassociate different groups of people with certain stereotypes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The online dialogue design was conducive to both discussion and reflection, as participating teachers were encouraged to contribute at their own pace after careful consideration of perspectives. The results of this online discourse revealed teachers’ perspectives on power dynamics in learning environments, perspectives on the power of dominant cultures and how power seemed to affect participants’ notions of the concepts of citizenship and socially just education. The threaded dialogue revealed that participants from each location identified teachers’ need to understand students’ cultural backgrounds and their responsibilities for meeting students’ needs as two of the most significant influences on power dynamics in the learning environment.</p>
<p>Participants expanded upon others’ observations of learner empowerment through language and culture (particularly in relation to classroom dynamics, moral development and societal roles), and implied that students and teachers can develop meaningful relationships when language and culture are blended. These observations are supported by the works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475240911435869">Gunawardena et al.

Participants shared perspectives on the importance of demonstrating and modeling respect, understanding and appreciation for students’ ethnic, cultural, socioeconomic and backgrounds. The research literature supports the idea that respect and understanding, as demonstrated by the teacher, work to positively affect the in-class balance of power, reduce students’ resistance to subject matter and behavioral expectations and lead to a reduction in classroom oppression for students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475240911435869">Blase, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1475240911435869">Bogad, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1475240911435869">Briggs and Pailliotet, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1475240911435869">Haroldsen and Kirkham, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1475240911435869">Kapoor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475240911435869">Lee and Recchia, 2008</xref>; Shor, 2006).</p>
<p>Participants shared their ideas about the power influences of a dominant culture. Teachers from each location observed attempts made by school administrators, teachers and some parents to promote a dominant ‘American’ (meaning US) culture within the school. Each participating school in South America was recognized as an ‘American’ or ‘American model’ school. Participants observed that this dominant culture was indicative in their school’s devotion to instruction in English, Americanized academic curricula and observances of US holidays and customs. Participants in all locations generally agreed that the rationale for this promotion of the US model is a common, conventional belief that students educated within the US model will likely be socially, academically and economically empowered and advantaged over students educated in local or other models. A participant in Paraguay described her school thus:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I work at the American School, which is viewed as the most prestigious school in the country. Here … people respect fair skin and features. Dark skin and indigenous features are regarded in a negative light. What’s more, the indigenous language … is viewed as a language of the poor and uneducated.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These and similar observations are supported by the research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1475240911435869">Hawley (1999)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1475240911435869">Kumagai and Sato (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1475240911435869">Kupchik and Monahan (2006)</xref>.</p>
<p>In their dialogue on concepts of citizenship and other influences of power dynamics in the learning environment, participants initially disagreed on how best to define citizenship. Some participants assumed that people who most accurately embody good citizenship are those who possess knowledge of and actively participate in the promotion of laws, policies and culture of their country of residence. Others expanded on this idea to include an expectation for service and abiding by some pre-determined work ethic. Still others implied that citizenship has been redefined in recent decades to supersede ‘worker’ and/or ‘legal resident’ status and now incorporates all residents of a given area.</p>
<p>The evolution of these conceptualizations during the course of participants’ dialogue led to revealing exchanges regarding who holds power in schools and society. According to several participants, power should be in the hands of those who are inclined to affect society in a positive manner. Most participants eventually agreed that the promotion of positive power begins in K-12 classrooms, and teachers bear significant responsibility for students’ empowerment with regard to active and competent participation in social and civic processes. These and similar observations are supported by the research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1475240911435869">Lynch (1994)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1475240911435869">Saracho and Spodek (2007)</xref>, Sunal et al. (2010) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1475240911435869">Zeichner (1995)</xref>.</p>
<p>The design of this study was such that it connected teachers from several locations who likely would have remained at a considerable distance and disconnected. Using technology to bring participants together in a virtual classroom setting invited international and intercultural correspondence that was both thought-provoking and insightful. The resulting dialogue identified emerging perspectives related to power dynamics in a variety of learning environments.</p>
<p>It should be noted that researchers recognized several limitations of online discourse as a means to generate dialogue and collect data. Participants in this study appeared willing to share their opinions and perspectives, and even to respond to posts of others. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1475240911435869">Merryfield (2000)</xref> observed, however, this mode of communication is not ideal for sharing between diverse populations, particularly when participants do not know one another. Additionally, some participants took more active roles in leading discourse than others, which had the potential to tilt the conversation in various ways and, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1475240911435869">Merryfield also observed (2001)</xref>, Americans sometimes seemed aggressive or controlling in their posts. Finally, some of the comments could have invited contradictory responses, and without the ability to process facial expressions or tone of voice, some participants might have become alienated during the dialogue. Researchers recognized that the inability to bring participants together in a room to get to know one another and interpret face-to-face interactions limited the study in several key ways. Notably, participants were not able to see one another as peers in the conventional sense, and had to interact only via the Internet.</p>
<p>Researchers and teachers need opportunities to consider factors that influence or impact teachers’ perspectives of concepts of power and authority in learning environments. Educational relationships in the global community are becoming increasingly interconnected, leading to significant need for examination of these connections in international, intercultural settings. We suggest further research into power dynamics and perspectives of power in learning environments to determine if they have a significant impact on teaching and/or learning processes, to provide insights into the influence of dominant cultures and/or to provide insights into the impacts of teachers’ and students’ concepts of race, gender, culture and class. Further research in these areas could reveal far-reaching implications on ideas of social justice and equality; imperatives for critical pedagogy.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>These teachers shared strong and diverse perspectives throughout this study and collectively indicated they recognized their responsibilities and influence related to power and power dynamics in the classroom. Teachers discussed ethnic, national, familial, cultural, linguistic and socioeconomic background characteristics as significant influencers of power and power dynamics, as discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475240911435869">Blase (1991)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1475240911435869">Bogad (1998)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1475240911435869">Kapoor (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475240911435869">Lee and Recchia (2008)</xref> and Shor (2006).</p>
<p>This study contributes to the fields of teacher education and critical pedagogy by examining and reporting a group of teachers’ perspectives and strands of thought and reflection related to power dynamics. Discursive Internet postings revealed that these teachers, working in various nations, have basic understandings of how power dynamics can inform teaching and learning and how language can empower or disempower, serving as agency or oppression in interaction with students. Another transferable lesson is how increasing globalization continues to change the ways in which teachers and students communicate, how teachers’ perceptions of the dominant culture can positively and negatively affect the learning environment, and how they recognize and implement power or practice autonomy in teaching settings.</p>
<p>The findings revealed that the participating teachers recognized influential power factors. Teachers’ and students’ perceptions of the power they have in the learning environment/relationship likely shape the educational experiences for all stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475240911435869">Bennett, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1475240911435869">Joseph, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1475240911435869">Kapoor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475240911435869">Lee and Recchia, 2008</xref>; Shor, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1475240911435869">Stachowski and Mahan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1475240911435869">Zeichner and Hoeff, 1996</xref>). Effective empowerment, particularly of students, may require recognition of these and other factors. Further research on power and power dynamics in the classroom is needed to investigate reasons why certain cultures are perceived as dominant by school administrators, how administrators’ perceptions impact classroom power dynamics, and how and why some disempowered students succeed even in challenging learning settings.</p>
<p>Pedagogies that affirm all discursive interactions, disregarding the aforementioned usual power influences, offer students agency and autonomy, and can begin discussion about power dynamics that influence educative settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1475240911435869">Freire, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1475240911435869">McLaren and Kincheloe, 2007</xref>). Educating for freedom, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1475240911435869">Maxine Greene (1988)</xref> instructs, is kept alive in teaching environments where trust and dialogue exist to allow freedom to find a place to breathe. The maintenance of power structures is negated, and power indeed becomes empowerment, a condition of possibility in K-12 learning environments and ultimately in a more socially just education.</p>
