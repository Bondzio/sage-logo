<p>The contrast is striking: Almost every Dutch parent Amy Schalet interviewed for <italic>Not Under My Roof</italic> said they would consider permitting, or had already permitted, their teenage son or daughter to spend the night with a girlfriend or boyfriend, whereas few of their American counterparts could even imagine doing so. Both groups of parents were white, middle-class, and either secular or moderately Christian. Both had been raised with relatively conservative sexual values before experiencing the sexual “revolution” of the late 1960s. The United States and the Netherlands are both decentralized republics with highly advanced economies and Protestant majorities. Why, then, these dramatically different approaches to adolescent sexuality?</p>
<p>As Schalet argues in her engaging and informative monograph, much of the answer lies in the cultural context of the two societies. Sleepovers make perfect sense in one universe of cultural meanings, but are virtually unthinkable in the other. America’s more intense and conservative religiosity and the Dutch state’s economic safety net also play important roles. These differences carry enormous practical consequences. Although, on average, teens in both countries become (hetero)sexually active at about the same ages, sexually transmitted infections, unintended pregnancy, and abortion are far more common among U.S. teens. Dutch youth use more effective contraceptives more consistently, not least because subsidized health services and comprehensive, sex-positive sex education have made birth control (and abortion) “practically and conceptually” accessible.</p>
<p><italic>Not Under My Roof</italic> is illustrated with rich examples from Schalet’s interviews with 32 teenage boys, 40 teenage girls, and 58 parents or couples. They came from two medium-sized Dutch cities, a medium-sized Northern California city, a small Pacific Northwest town, and a New England suburb, all chosen to reflect the “moderate middle.”</p>
<p>According to Schalet, Dutch parents normalize adolescent sexuality, believing that teens can have real, if typically short-lived, love relationships that lead naturally to sexual activity. Viewing individuals and society as interdependent, they stress mutual accommodation and expect their children to self-regulate and “domesticate” their early experiences with sex and drinking—a “soft” form of control that tends to disguise power relations. Sons and daughters are treated similarly, although sleepover negotiations appear to be more fraught for girls than boys. Dutch parents are also fairly comfortable with the possibility that their children might choose same-sex partners.</p>
<p>In contrast, American parents dramatize adolescent sexuality, highlighting its perils and conflicts and describing teens as incapable of controlling their “raging hormones.” Seeing individuals and society as inherently opposed, American parents exercise external control over their still-dependent teens who, in turn, feel they must explore sexual activity and alcohol use behind their parents’ backs. In the parents’ eyes, adolescent sexuality is a battle between the genders, in which girls pursue love and boys sex. Only those who have achieved economic autonomy—adults—can legitimately fall in love or engage in sexual activity.</p>
<p>In the United States, adolescents of both genders used sexual activity to separate psychologically from their parents, but doing so took a harder toll on girls, who tended to feel that they couldn’t be “good” daughters <italic>and</italic> sexual beings. They worried intensely about being labeled “sluts.” For their part, boys often wanted to combine sex and love but believed that other boys just wanted sex. In contrast, Dutch youth believed that both genders wanted and enjoyed sex and saw sex and love, ideally, as linked, although some girls felt they were more interested in steady relationships than boys their age.</p>
<p>These approaches to adolescent sexuality serve as a window into Dutch and American culture more broadly, as Schalet shows in her concluding chapters. I particularly appreciated her incorporation of support, connection, and self-mastery into Foucault’s conceptualization of modern power. Her policy recommendations, focused primarily on the United States, are also very welcome.</p>
<p>My only reservation about <italic>Not Under My Roof</italic> is that it is based on interviews conducted between 1991 and 2000. Subsequent social developments, including the expansion of abstinence-only sex education in the United States and growing anxiety about morally conservative immigrants in the Netherlands, are likely to affect sexual coming-of-age in both countries, as Schalet acknowledges in her conclusion. Future scholars can fruitfully build on this strong foundation, investigating youth and parents from other racial/ethnic, social class, religious, and geographic locations.</p>
<p>Lucid and highly attuned to the complexities of human experience, <italic>Not Under My Roof</italic> should find a welcome place in advanced undergraduate and graduate courses on sexuality, gender, and culture and should be required reading for scholars in those areas, as well as for makers of public policy.</p>
