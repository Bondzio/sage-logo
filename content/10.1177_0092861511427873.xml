            <p>Pharmaceutical Medical Information (MI) departments have many different responsibilities within the organization. In addition to the traditional roles of Medical Information professionals, promotional review is a growing responsibility. Three benchmarking surveys explored the role and involvement of the Medical Information department in promotional review and were conducted within a similar timeframe (2009). The surveys were designed to provide insights into current practices within the pharmaceutical industry and to characterize the function and contribution of Medical Information departments in the promotional review process. The surveys focused on promotional review in terms of types of materials reviewed, procedures, and time commitment. Most pharmaceutical Medical Information professionals surveyed reported that they participated in the promotional review process. They have a number of responsibilities as part of the promotional review process that may include reviewing promotional materials, attending formal review meetings, and serving as final medical sign-off. It was reported that the time Medical Information professionals spent on promotional review made up a substantial portion of their workload. These findings provide insights into the similarities and differences in Medical Information departments’ role in promotional review across the pharmaceutical industry. Medical Information representatives and supervisors may use these results to benchmark their involvement in promotion review, consider new practices, or address challenges within their own departments.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>As part of business practice, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies disseminate advertising materials and engage in activities that are promotional in nature. Promotional materials target either consumers or health care professionals and are disseminated via different types of media and forms of communication. The Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising, and Communication (DDMAC), a department of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is responsible for the surveillance and enforcement of prescription drug advertising.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861511427873">1</xref>
            </sup> The prescription drug advertising and promotion regulations require promotional materials to be fair-balanced and not false or misleading in the presentation of benefit and risk information.</p>
         <p>To ensure that promotional materials and activities comply with industry guidance and regulations, pharmaceutical companies usually establish promotional review committees (PRCs), which are cross-functional groups that also take into account legal considerations and medical accuracy. Promotional review has become a relevant and timely topic, namely because of increasing scrutiny of pharmaceutical advertising by the media and FDA. The DDMAC responds to violative advertising by issuing enforcement letters to offending manufacturers. Consequences of enforcement may lead to monetary fines and/or damage to a company’s reputation. Untitled letters and warning letters both demand cessation of the promotional activity; however, warning letters usually require additional corrective action. The DDMAC issued 41 enforcement letters in 2009, compared with 21 letters sent out in 2008.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861511427873">2</xref>
            </sup> This upward trend in enforcement continued through 2010, with 52 enforcement letters issued. Materials may be cited for numerous violations, including omission/minimization of risk information, overstatement of efficacy, and broadening of indication. Scrutiny is likely to increase further as companies explore new venues of advertising, such as the Internet and social media. In an effort to educate and recruit health care professionals regarding truthful advertising, the FDA has also established an outreach program known as “Truthful Prescription Drug Advertising and Promotion” (the Bad Ad program). This program gives health care professionals a direct way to report violations to the FDA.</p>
         <p>It is common that at least one person on the promotional review committee reviews content from a clinical perspective; however, the position and role of the medical reviewer may vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. The medical reviewer may reside in the Medical Information department of the organization. The traditional responsibility of the Medical Information department has been to provide verbal or written responses to unsolicited drug information requests, including the development of standard medical response documents. Medical Information representatives are often health care professionals with strong scientific backgrounds and may therefore possess the skills necessary to serve as the medical reviewer.</p>
         <p>Results from 3 independently developed benchmarking surveys on the role of Medical Information departments in promotional review were presented at the Drug Information Association (DIA) Workshop for Medical Communications in March 2010.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861511427873">3</xref>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861511427873"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861511427873">5</xref>
            </sup> All surveys were created and disseminated by postdoctoral PharmD fellows. After the 3 surveys were independently presented, results were combined to provide a broad overview of Medical Information involvement in this area. These combined results will enable Medical Information professionals to benchmark their company practices and possibly enhance their role or processes related to medical review of promotional pieces.</p>

         <title>Methods/Study Design</title>
         <p>Three surveys on the topic of promotional review were distributed to Medical Information and Medical Communications personnel from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which was the only inclusion criterion. These representatives were referred from previous surveys, were members of a DIA Special Interest Area Community (SIAC), or were found via networking avenues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092861511427873">Table 1</xref>). The Internet-based surveys were distributed from the platforms Zoomerang<sup>®</sup> and Survey Monkey™, and the open response period ranged from approximately 3 weeks to a few months. As a gesture of appreciation, participants could submit contact information to receive a copy of the final results poster. In general, questions included topics related to department demographics, time allotted to complete promotional review tasks, level of participation, processes and procedures, and content reviewed. Although essentially similar, the 3 surveys had some differences in focus, which allowed for wider coverage of topics. Survey 1 centered on resource/personnel participation and time commitment involved in promotional review, as well as the impact on a Medical Information professional’s workload. Survey 2 focused on the types of promotional materials reviewed, the various roles of Medical Information on the promotional review committee, and the operational process. Survey 3 evaluated the overall promotional review process, the promotional review workload for a Medical Information professional, and the division of responsibility between Medical Information and clinicians in Medical Affairs.</p>

         <p>A variety of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies were represented to account for potential differences in practice based on company size and other variables. Certain questions in the surveys were designed to include “free text” boxes so that respondents were not forced to select a multiple-choice response that may not have corresponded with their company’s real-life practices. This was done to collect as much information as respondents were willing to share and to enhance data validity.</p>

         <title>Results: Demographics</title>
         <p>Demographic information regarding the 3 surveys is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0092861511427873">Table 2</xref>. The overall response rate was 43.4% (72/166), which was calculated by dividing the sum of respondents by the total number of people surveyed across all 3 surveys. Because the surveys were distributed separately, duplication of respondents is possible; therefore, the overall response rate is an estimate. Most respondents across all surveys stated that the reviewers of promotional materials had a pharmacy degree. Experience in Medical Information was also noted, with more than 50% of survey 1 respondents having &gt;7 years of experience and approximately 41% of survey 3 respondents &gt;5 years. Two surveys also looked at the size of the department or company and number of products covered. Survey 3 respondents were equally divided between small/midsized and large pharmaceutical companies, whereas most survey 2 respondents (71%) stated they worked in Medical Information departments with &lt;25 employees. Product support was also examined. According to survey 2, 37% of departments cover 16 products, and survey 3 noted that 87% of respondents supported 1 to 2 specific products.</p>

         <p>Medical Information participation in the promotional review process varied from survey to survey. Survey 1 only allowed Medical Information professionals who participated in the promotional review process to participate in the survey, whereas survey 3 could be completed by Medical Information professionals even if they were not individually involved in promotional review. Survey 2 included all respondents for the demographics questions but then limited questions regarding promotional review to those who participated in the process. Regarding questions about participation in promotional review, 68% to 81% of respondents from the 3 surveys indicated that they were involved in the process.</p>
         <p>Medical Information has a number of responsibilities as part of the promotional review process that can range from reviewing pieces to attending formal meetings and/or serving as final medical sign-off. As part of the promotional review process, Medical Information professionals responded that their top roles were ensuring scientific accuracy, relevance, and completeness of clinical data; ensuring that claims are adequately supported by data; ensuring that claims and materials are consistent with current approved labeling; and determining the acceptability of references used to support claims. In surveys 2 and 3, 73% (n = 26) and 71% (n = 14) of respondents, respectively, reported that Medical Information had a role in concept review prior to a promotional piece being developed and/or presented to the promotional review committee. In addition, in survey 2, 46% (n = 26) of respondents interacted with advertising agencies prior to promotional review committee meetings; however, the nature of the interaction was not assessed.</p>
         <p>In survey 2, the most common types of promotional material reviewed by Medical Information included slide presentations, Web sites, patient-focused materials, sales pieces, and convention booth materials. Certain novel materials such as social media and e-marketing are becoming more popular with the ever-growing adaption of new technology. The most commonly used types of references, or evidentiary support, for promotional materials were phase III clinical trials and data on file (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0092861511427873">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

            <p>The number of respondents who reported receiving training prior to participating in promotional review varied across the 3 surveys. Ninety-two percent (n = 13) of survey 1 respondents, 38% (n = 24) of survey 2 respondents, and 76% (n = 17) of survey 3 respondents indicated that completing training to participate as a promotional reviewer was a company requirement. Training techniques varied widely and did not necessarily involve instruction in a class setting. Participants reported that training consisted of shadowing colleagues and reviewing FDA regulations, sample promotional pieces, and/or internal standard operating procedures (SOPs). In survey 2, 96% (n = 26) of participants indicated that their companies have an SOP or charter covering promotional review.</p>

            <p>Formal, live meetings to review promotional materials were found to be common practice at most pharmaceutical companies. The majority of survey 1 and survey 3 respondents indicated that formal, live meetings were held (100% [n = 14] and 94% [n = 17], respectively). Of survey 2 respondents, 50% (n = 26) reported that live meetings were held, whereas 8% reported that they were not conducted. Forty-two percent of survey 2 respondents indicated that whether or not a meeting was held depended on the nature of the piece. It was reported that members of a designated promotional review committee attended live meetings, and the number of meetings held per week varied. At each meeting, most reported reviewing materials for 1 product, although some reviewed all products in a therapeutic area. In survey 3, most respondents indicated that if live meetings did not take place, promotional review was typically conducted electronically via a database or e-mail.</p>

            <title>Promotional Review Time Per Piece</title>
            <p>In survey 1, 50% (n = 12) of medical reviewers reported spending an average of 1 to 2 hours to review and comment on an assigned promotional piece. Other responses included either &lt;1 hour (33%) or 3 to 4 hours (17%) to review a piece. Half of medical reviewers spent more time reviewing each promotional piece compared to 1 year ago, and half reported spending the same amount of time.</p>

            <title>Types of Promotional Materials</title>
            <p>The medical representative is responsible for the review of many different types of promotional materials. Survey 1 provided a ranking of different types of materials based on most to least amount of time needed for review. Slide decks and Web sites were ranked the most time-consuming type of material to review, whereas direct-to-consumer print advertisements were ranked the least time-consuming. More than 50% (n = 12) of medical reviewers reported spending ≥7 hours per slide deck. Promotional materials targeted toward health care professionals were found to take more time to review than consumer-directed materials.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>Survey results suggest that the majority of pharmaceutical Medical Information departments participate in the promotional review process and fulfill a significant role as committee members. Medical Information’s involvement may indicate increasing cross-functionality within the industry. A number of Medical Information representatives reported working independently as medical reviewers at their companies, whereas many also reported sharing the responsibility with Medical Affairs. Medical Information departments are staffed by many types of health care professionals with various degrees, including PharmDs. Companies may be increasingly using the scientific background of these individuals, and there may be increasing recognition of Medical Information’s value.</p>
         <p>It was reported that the time Medical Information departments spent on promotional review made up a substantial portion of their workload and increased from 2008 to 2009. This is a growing responsibility for Medical Information professionals in addition to the traditional roles that Medical Information professionals had in the past. Reasons for the increase in time being spent on promotional review cannot be determined from the surveys; however, there may be multiple possibilities. The recent increase in enforcement actions by the FDA may contribute to more time being spent on promotional review. New trends in the surveillance of promotional activities include initiatives such as the Bad Ad program. Increased scrutiny is a factor to consider for companies that choose to use unpublished references, such as data on file, as opposed to published literature. Medical review of data on file should be performed with the same rigor as published data and may require additional review time. Another reason for more time spent may be a possible increase in market competition, leading to more promotional pieces being created. There are many new approaches to pharmaceutical marketing, including the Internet; social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Sermo; and applications for smartphones. Although these new strategies are becoming more popular, there is a lack of guidance from regulatory authorities regarding how to use them appropriately. This may lead to more time spent on review of these pieces and compliance discussions at promotional review meetings because the rules are not clear. Furthermore, because these media require up-to-date information at all times, frequent reviews are necessary.</p>
         <p>Promotional review is a significant time commitment for Medical Information departments. This may be because of the many steps in the process, including identifying and cross-checking references, ensuring accuracy of data and consistency with approved labeling, communicating comments to the committee, and attending meetings. As indicated by the results, materials directed toward health care professionals typically require more time than consumer pieces, perhaps because they contain more scientific content and references. This large time commitment may create new challenges for Medical Information departments. Appropriate training may enhance the quality of medical review and reduce the time requirement. In addition, the trend toward electronic information sharing may increase efficiency.</p>
         <p>Although most Medical Information professionals indicated participation in promotional review, 32% (n = 38) of survey 2 and 19% (n = 15) of survey 3 respondents indicated that the Medical Information department at their company has no involvement in the promotional review process. The reasons for this finding might be explored in future research. Because of variability in company processes, more research may be needed to help identify optimal resources such as electronic databases, organizational structure, and procedures to support Medical Information’s participation in promotional review. The trend of moving away from paper copies to electronic resources might likewise be assessed in terms of efficiency and environmental impact. Further evaluation could also assess the extent of training received prior to assuming the role of medical reviewer. Another potential area to explore would be the impact of Medical Information’s role in promotional review from the perspective of other departments.</p>
         <sec id="section19-0092861511427873">
            <title>Limitations</title>
            <p>One limitation of combining 3 surveys was that, although the 3 were similar, they were not identical. This led to gaps in data for certain topics, and there was some discrepancy in the collected results even when questions were structured similarly. For example, training requirements, final sign-off authority, time given to review promotional pieces, division of medical review responsibility, and Medical Information’s attendance at formal promotional review meetings differed among the 3 surveys. It was unclear from the results why these discrepancies may exist. Possible explanations for these discrepancies may be because of differences in therapeutic area or product, company processes, variations in the pool of respondents, and efficiency of reviewers due to differences in experience level. Some topics were covered in 1 or 2 surveys, whereas others were included in all 3. Because of the anonymity of the surveys, it was unclear if more than 1 person per company completed each survey. Because all 3 surveys were created and sent separately, there may also have been an overlap in the participants who completed surveys 1, 2, and 3.</p>
            <p>Even with all 3 surveys combined, the total number of participants (n = 72) may not have been sufficiently large to account for all companies and all perspectives in the industry. Response rates did not exceed 50% for any of the 3 surveys, and not all respondents completed all survey questions. In certain cases, the “Do not know” or “Unable to answer” multiple-choice options were selected more often than anticipated and limited interpretation of the data. In addition, misinterpretation of questions by survey respondents may have occurred because companies often have different names for the same concept, and online surveys do not permit clarifying discussions with participants. Finally, although respondents were asked to compare the amount of time spent on their current workload to the previous year’s workload, a 1-year recall period may not provide the most accurate assessment of these data.</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>Overall, the 3 surveys indicated that the Medical Information department is involved in the medical review of promotional materials and is a member of the promotional review committee at most companies surveyed. It was found that this responsibility is often shared with Medical Affairs. Medical Information representatives reported to have final sign-off authority on promotional review pieces in many cases. Promotional review requires a large time commitment from Medical Information representatives and was rated their most time-consuming job function. The amount of time spent on promotional review appears to have increased from 2008 to 2009 and may create new time management challenges for Medical Information departments going forward. These survey findings provide industry-wide insights into the Medical Information departments’ role and participation in promotional review. Medical Information representatives and supervisors may use these results to benchmark their involvement in promotional review, consider new practices, or address challenges within their departments.</p>
