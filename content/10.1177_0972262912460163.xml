<p>With cost-cutting being one of the key goals of most companies, it is becoming increasingly difficult for human resource (HR) departments to convince the chief finance officers (CFOs) that the new projects of HR need liberal funding. The CFOs have become used to asking the justification for any HR spending in more concrete terms. They seek efficaciousness of management development programmes, such as, training initiatives, employee empowerment initiatives and culture change interventions. Another area of concern related to people, especially for the CEOs, is employee engagement and people satisfaction index, for engaged or happy people can help in taking the organization from good to great status, and also in promoting the employer branding image of the organization. The real question is ‘value-creation’ by all HR activities and initiatives. This eventually contributes to attainment of business goals. Consequently, more and more academics and managers are keen on developing credible measures for the HR work as well as aligning all HR policies and activities to the vision and objectives of the organization. In the instrumentalism–empowerment dichotomy of HR strategies discourse, most measurement policies and prescriptions are labeled as instrumentalist (or hard) HR approach. But lately, the advocates of empowerment (soft) HR have come to believe that some degree of accountability and instrumentalism needs to be married to soft HR so as to make more realistic managerial decisions in the chaotically competitive and changeful business world. Thus, there is a talk of concepts like return on investment (ROI) of different types of HR measures. And even some indicators of soft HR too, like employee engagement index, are seen as important HR measurement devices.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the global crisis in traditional HR, which is discernible in the way HR has been looked at during the past two decades or so, is resulting in assigning new roles to HR managers. Metrics and ROI are seen as parts of these roles, in spite of the increased focus on much of the empowerment HR agenda. This is happening so even as most soft HR protagonists still believe that the adoption of such policies lead to unnecessary focus on bureaucratization and rule-centricity, and is often seen as antithetical to the essence of the soft HR model. Since the long academic debate on the debilitating impact of new/strategic HR is almost over by now, a more acceptable concept of ‘human capital’ (HC) is being talked about and researched upon, which has now become almost a catchword in human resource management (HRM).</p>
<p>The book under review deals with aspects of human capital and their measurement. It is divided into two parts: the first is titled HR &amp; Value Creation; and the second part is titled: HR Professionals in Partnership with the Business. Each part has four chapters. Chapters in part one address the issue of how value is created, what part is played by people in value-creation and how far an integrated framework of measures can be created so as to make them a part of performance management system of an organization. This part explores the types of measures that can be used in relation to human capital. The four chapters in part two deal with the role that HR professionals play in human capital management (HCM). Through the contents of this part the author argues or presupposes that too much talk of HR as a business partner is more of slogan and not quite put to practice in a true sense. He opines that this would require a framework of needed interventions that facilitate changing the mindsets and behaviours of people concerned. That would necessitate knowing HR professionals’ contribution to value-adding partnership with the line people, and how far effective people strategies can be created and their impact measured or monitored. In nutshell, part two deals with issue of HR professionals facilitating the realization of full potential of all people while adding value to organizational goals and as also to different stakeholders of the organization.</p>
<p>A quite unique part of the book is imaginative six to ten ‘challenges for action’ that are given at the end of each chapter in bullet points. Articulation of these challenges facilitates the reader to get a reflection of what s/he has read in the chapter concerned. But the hallmark of the book is expounding the softer aspects of HCM and dispelling the image that this concept concerns with mainly hard accountability issues only. It also helps simplify the measures that could facilitate legitimizing the intentions of these initiatives. It contains some extremely interesting case studies—large and small caselets—with the help of which the author has explained the measures adopted by the company concerned. The book also succeeds in simplifying the complexities involved in different models of measurement, and knowing their fuller dynamics as adopted by different organizations (e.g., pp. 164–152). Above all, the central message of the book is that it is risky to ignore HCM measures for organizations that wish to create their own future and to grow exponentially. Especially since the emergence of the ‘intangible theory’ in determination of market worth of a company, more firms want a higher degree of contribution from HR activities in terms of deliverables that help create measurable intangible value. So as to help attain such goals, the author has presented useful insights into different aspects of HCM and its measurement. The soul of the book is chapters 6 and 7 (pp. 207–308), which even by themselves could form a separate book. Chapter 6 examines how precisely HR department can contribute to strategic decisions as strategic partner. It is very interesting to see how the author has dwelled on the whole development of business strategy, and how vertical alignment of functional strategies is done. The tables and figures used (e.g., strategy statements, pp. 237–238) by the author are of great help to the reader in understanding the nuances. Chapter 7, titled A Scorecard for the HR Function, discusses the measures related to professional contribution of HR as a function; in other words, how can the HR function measure and monitor its effectiveness. The book concludes with how precisely competencies for HCM can be developed. I can imagine how much efforts must have gone in planning and collating the material and relating the same to the points being made.</p>
<p>On the flip side, the sentence construction by the author could have been more careful and rigorous; the reader finds at many places inchoate explanations and some missing links. For example, the concept of ‘human capital’ (HC) has not been comprehensively discussed (pp. 50–52). And, the one line difference between HC and HRM is not really convincing. Mayo has been an HR professional since long; the book does reflect the depth of his expertise in understanding the practicality of issues in managing HC. That perhaps explains his greater concern for relevance of the book for HR professionals and less focus on academic rigour in expounding HCM. It is well known that human capital decisions are guided by data and information-driven, results-oriented planning and accountability systems. The key to a successful HCM strategy is process efficiencies, efficacious use of information and devising and implementing appropriate business metrics. Mayo has dealt with these issues appropriately; but he could have added a detailed critical discussion on human capital concept, since the book is supposed to be a full-blown discussion on this concept, and its implementation, which definitely means different things to different people. That would have added a greater clarity to understanding the HCM concept that is becoming increasingly popular. Further, the author has appropriately stated the 12 academic models of human capital (pp. 140–152), which among others include the balanced score card (BSC) model. But a reader who is not fully conversant with BSC will not quite understand how BSC is a human capital model and what utility it offers for aligning people’s knowledge and competencies with the business strategy. Issues involved in the development of BSC in any organization needed to be explained more comprehensively. A corporate reader would have expected a bit more comprehensive treatment of some such collateral issues while developing some of the main contents of this otherwise useful book.</p>
<p>Overall, however, the book has considerably succeeded in addressing a significant area in strategic HRM. It has been written mainly for HR practitioners with substantial focus on how-to prescriptions. The book delineates a valuable roadmap for implementing the conception of HCM; and has devised appropriate HCM measures. It will be helpful for those involved in the designing and implementation of change management processes too. Students and academics concerned with HRM strategy or HR evaluation too will find this book a good resource as a supplementary reading. If, in its later edition, the book intertwines context of current research on different aspects of HR measures, it can well be used even as a textbook for a full course of HCM or human capital measurements.</p>
