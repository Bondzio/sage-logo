<title>Background:</title>
<p>Major depression (MD) is often marked by an unfavourable course. Education repeatedly was found to be associated with better mental health variables, but longitudinal data are scarce. This evaluation seeks to identify the predictive role of specific aspects of education on the course of depression in a socioculturally defined setting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0020764012437122">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A sample of 69 unipolar MD outpatients in university and primary health care in Antalya, Turkey were observed naturalistically for a mean 11-month period. The baseline examination included several psychosocial variables, among them the highest attained schooling degree (DEG), possible further but unfulfilled educational aspirations (UEA), and the participants’ parental educational level (PEL). The depressive symptomatology was assessed with the HAM-D-17 at baseline and at four-monthly follow-ups. A binary variable differentiated ‘non-remissive’ from ‘remissive’ courses, the latter displaying at least temporal partial remissions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0020764012437122">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Forty-two per cent of the sample displayed a non-remissive one-year course of MD. Half of the participants reported UEA. This was more prevalent among women, and qualitative information added causal gender-specific perceptions. In logistic regression, DEG proved prognostic impact, but was exceeded by the combination of UEA and PEL as the strongest predictor model (Cox &amp; Snell <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.217). This remained when controlled for place of examination, gender and initial severity of depression. As risk factors for low education, a pattern of female gender and large family size (itself predicted by rural descent) emerged.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0020764012437122">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Low education proved to be a risk factor for an unfavourable course of MD. Not only actual experienced schooling, but also unfulfilled academic aspirations and a low parental educational level appear to be of crucial impact.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Depressive disorders belong to the greatest health burdens worldwide and will have a leading position among them in 2020, being responsible for immense individual suffering as well as societal losses and expenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764012437122">Badamgarav et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020764012437122">Murray &amp; Lopez, 1997</xref>). One of the main complicating factors is the disease’s tendency to recur and persist. More than 20% of major depression (MD) episodes continue for at least one year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0020764012437122">Wittchen &amp; Jacobi, 2006</xref>). A non-remissive course has been associated with psychosocial impairment in multiple domains, including professional performance, coping and self-esteem, physical health status, social adjustment and greater health care costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764012437122">Berndt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764012437122">Gilmer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020764012437122">Pettit, Lewinsohn, Roberts, Seeley, &amp; Monteith, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Reasons for the unfavourable course of depression in a sizeable number of patients have previously been investigated in numerous studies, but remain to be only partially known. Most variables that have proven to be of some prognostic relevance can broadly be assigned to two broad categories: psychosocial parameters and aspects of psychopathology. Among the latter, early lifetime onset of depression, current severity and functional impairment, psychiatric comorbidity and certain personality traits appear to be influential predictors. Social parameters associated with the course of depression comprise current life context factors such as chronic stressors, employment and health insurance status, as well as biographic and developmental aspects, especially adverse childhood conditions and education-related experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764012437122">Gilmer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764012437122">Licht-Strunk, van der Windt, van Marwijk, de Haan, &amp; Beekman, 2007</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section6-0020764012437122">
<title>Education</title>
<p>The majority of studies that included parameters on education identified it as a predictor for depression chronicity. In the review of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020764012437122">Gilchrist and Gunn (2007)</xref>, comparing the results of 17 observational studies of depression in primary care, lower education level repeatedly emerged as a risk factor. Included were two large international projects: the LIDO study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764012437122">Fleck et al., 2005</xref>) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborative Project on Psychological Problems in General Health Care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764012437122">Barkow et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>While these studies report observation times not exceeding one year, education also proved to be a prognostic marker in the long-term course. So the retrospective data of the STAR*D study proved less education to be associated with duration of the current MD episode for at least 24 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764012437122">Gilmer et al., 2005</xref>). The prospective analysis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020764012437122">Swindle, Cronkite and Moos (1998)</xref> found that less education was associated with poorer outcomes at the two-year follow-up, and similar data have been obtained for a four-year prospective cohort study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764012437122">Bjerkeset, Nordahl, Larsson, Dahl, &amp; Linaker, 2008</xref>). In some other evaluations, however, education was not a definite predictor of depression course. This includes the analysis of 426 subjects with a lifetime history of MD by age 30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020764012437122">Pettit et al., 2009</xref>) and the meta-analysis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764012437122">Licht-Strunk et al. (2007)</xref> in which no prognostic factor could be clearly identified for the prognosis of late-life depression in primary care settings.</p>
<p>Less is known about the causal chain-of-relationships, which apparently links education with a prolonged course of depression. Existing theories that link education with psychological well-being mostly refer to the concept of resource, which, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020764012437122">Ross and Mirowsky (2006</xref>, p. 1402), can be defined as ‘something that helps one achieve goals’. As such, education has a pivotal influence on the professional career and income situation. Furthermore, the amount of formal education represents accumulated knowledge and abilities, including the acquisition of skills and attitudes such as analytic thinking, attention, flexibility and perseverance. Thus, problem-solving abilities are gained for increasingly complex tasks. This not only provides the ability but also shapes the motivation to tailor life. Thus, high levels of education increase the sense of personal control, while in the poorly educated, a ‘sense of powerlessness, fatalism, and helplessness’ (Wheaton, 1980, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020764012437122">Ross &amp; Mirowsky, 2006</xref>, p. 1402) may prevail.</p>
<p>This implies interactions between educational achievement and emotional well-being on several levels, including the material situation (potential freedom from poverty and economic hardship), aspects of status and respect connected with social positioning, gained abilities and competencies, and the perceived self-efficacy as being able to solve problematic life situations.</p>
<p>This evaluation seeks to prove several assumptions regarding the relationship of education with the course of MD as naturalistically observed in an outpatient sample over the course of one year. First (<italic>hypothesis 1</italic>), in line with most of the studies mentioned above, a beneficial effect of higher educational achievement on the course of depression has been expected. In addition, individuals who aspired, but were unable for a variety of reasons to attain higher educational achievement might be susceptible to a significant developmental gap of resources. Thus, the possible association of unfulfilled educational aspirations (UEA) with the course of MD is expected. The variable constructed for this measurement is based on the results of a previous study of the author with another sample in Turkey, which qualitatively assessed subjective reasons for the state of being depressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764012437122">Kraus &amp; Koch, 2006</xref>). Those affected by such an undesired lack of education-derived resources could be specifically prone to an unfavourable course of depression (<italic>hypothesis 2</italic>). Alternatively, only the benefits from actual school attainment could be influential on the course, with no difference between those reporting and not reporting UEA.</p>
<p>Another aspect added in this study is the trans-generational effect of education, recorded as the highest degree of schooling that one of the participant’s parents attained (parental educational level, PEL). This might contribute to the course of MD in the index patients in a direct or indirect manner (<italic>hypothesis 3 a/b</italic>). Finally, specific remark is given to the pattern in which educational variables are linked with other parameters particular to the given cultural context. In this, the socio-demographic data and naturalistic course variables of the 69 observed participants will be analysed for emerging risk or protective patterns, and set in reference to the information provided by TÜIK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0020764012437122">Turkish Statistical Institute, 2008</xref>) and OECD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020764012437122">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2007</xref>) reports. Added are selected results of qualitative research tools that help to illuminate the relationship between education and mental health course among Turkish MD patients.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The data presented here are part of a larger project focused on possible predictors impacting the course of MD within the sociocultural parameters particular to the Turkish context. The structure and approach of the study were presented and discussed at the VI Congress of the Turkish–German Psychiatric Association in Istanbul (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764012437122">Kraus, Metin, &amp; Karaman, 2007</xref>). In line with the project’s general purpose, participant selection was undertaken with the aim of forming a sample that represents important aspects of the variation within the present Turkish culture. To ensure this, participants were recruited and interviewed at two sites: the psychiatric outpatient policlinic of Akdeniz University in Antalya, and a state-run primary health care centre (<italic>sağlık ocağı</italic>) in a socioeconomically underprivileged part of the city. This approach was guided by the assumption that education levels of patients will differ between the sites. Thus, correction of the expected over-sampling of more highly educated patients at the university polyclinic was sought. The targeted sample size was 42 subjects per study site. This was computed utilizing a procedure for power estimation with qualitative parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764012437122">Bleymüller, Gehlert, &amp; Gülicher, 2004</xref>) based upon a desired accuracy level <italic>ϵ</italic> of 0.1 (margin of error ±10%) and an expected non-remission rate of 30%.</p>
<p>Patients of both institutions who presented at certain time slots during 2008–9 were invited to participate. Those who were between 18 and 65 years of age and exhibited a significant depressive symptom score (≥ 17 points in the self-rating BDI-21; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764012437122">Beck, 1988</xref>; validated Turkish version: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764012437122">Hıslı, 1988</xref>) entered into the second screening step, the diagnostic interview. Core <italic>inclusion criterion</italic> was the current presence of a unipolar major depressive disorder according to the criteria of the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4 edn</italic> (DSM-IV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764012437122">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>). Diagnoses were made by application of the Turkish version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020764012437122">Çorapçıoğlu, First, Spitzer, Gibbon, &amp; Williams, 1999</xref>). <italic>Exclusion criteria</italic> were less stringent than most clinical trials, in order to create a sample that resembles the clinical reality of the treatment institutions. Individuals with severe eating disorder or substance dependence (exception: nicotine) in the previous year, concurrent neuropsychological or psychiatric disorder due to a general medical condition, psychotic or bipolar disorders, or instable medical conditions were not eligible to participate in this study, while other psychiatric comorbidity (like personality, anxiety and dissociative disorders) deliberately did not result in exclusion.</p>
<p>Prior to initiation of the screening process, the Ethical Review Board of Akdeniz University approved the study. Written informed consent was obtained from the participants after providing a complete description of the study procedures. During the scheduled one-year follow-up period, a <italic>naturalistic paradigm</italic> was adopted. Participants were free to choose between all available therapy options (including no therapy), and to decide about initiation and termination of any prescribed treatment. Therapy was not provided by the research staff. For ethical reasons, those screened in the primary health care centre who were diagnosed with a significant psychopathology received a brief note concerning diagnostic and therapeutic considerations. With this, they were able to approach the physician staff working there or other therapists, who were entirely responsible for any subsequent treatment.</p>
<p>The baseline examination was usually undertaken in a subsequent meeting within at most two weeks after the diagnostic interview. An array of psychometric and qualitative tools was administered together with a semi-structured recording of sociobiographic data. In this and the subsequent examinations, the severity of depressive symptomatology was monitored by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764012437122">Hamilton, 1988</xref>), an interview-based assessment tool broadly considered as a reliable and change-sensitive measurement for depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020764012437122">Pedrelli, Feldman, Vorono, Fava, &amp; Petersen, 2008</xref>). In order to increase the chances of detecting courses with intermittent remissions and relapses, follow-up examinations were carried out every four months subsequently. In them, additional data on psychopathology, quality of life, health care utilization and intermittent life events were obtained (though not included in this evaluation).</p>
<p>For the classification of course, a dichotomous variable was created. One group comprises those who displayed either ‘full’ or ‘partial’ remission at any observation time (in short, <italic>remissive course</italic> group or <italic>RC</italic>). Here, ‘full’ remission has been defined as a total HAM-D-17 score of 7 or below, and ‘partial’ remission as a HAM-D-17 reduction of at least 50%, compared with the initial value. The corresponding group is characterized by a <italic>non-remissive</italic> course (abbreviated as <italic>NR</italic>). Since the last category can be regarded as representing a high risk group for chronicity of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020764012437122">Spijker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0020764012437122">Wittchen &amp; Jacobi, 2006</xref>), it was of particular interest in this evaluation.</p>
<sec id="section8-0020764012437122">
<title>Predictors</title>
<p>Possible indicators for a non-remissive course were assessed at baseline. They were rationally selected, in most cases based on prior research, with some parameters newly constructed in order to capture features of the particular sociocultural situation. A semi-structured interview form developed by the researchers was used to investigate the participants’ socio-demographic and clinical characteristics.</p>
<p>The variables included in this evaluation were obtained from the participants and were defined as follows. Context of origin (C/O) was the location where the participant spent all or most of his/her formative years (age 3–12 years), categorized according to the informant’s statement as: (a) village, fewer than 2,000 inhabitants; (b) town, fewer than 30,000 inhabitants; (c) city, between 30,000 and 2 million inhabitants; and (d) the metropolis Istanbul, Ankara or Izmir. This was subsequently transformed into the binary variable rural (a + b) versus urban origin (c + d). Education was assessed by the information reported by the participant on three dimensions: the highest attained educational degree (DEG); PEL; and UEA on behalf of the participant.</p>
<p>DEG ordinally represents the achieved level of education at five steps, corresponding to the Turkish schooling system: (a) without schooling degree; (b) completed primary school (five years, former <italic>ilkokul</italic>); (c) completed lower secondary or ‘middle’ school (eight years, for both the former <italic>ortaokul</italic> and the newer <italic>ilköğretim</italic>); (d) completed upper secondary school or <italic>lise</italic> (11 years,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0020764012437122">1</xref></sup> includes general and vocational high schools); and (e) completed university, including graduate and doctorate programmes. Subsequently, a dichotomous variable was created, contrasting not more than primary level (a + b: low educational degree; L-DEG) versus at least completed secondary education (c, d + e; H-DEG). Under PEL, the educational level of the participant’s parents has been recorded equivalent to the levels outlined above. If the educational level differed between mother and father, the higher one was noted.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0020764012437122">2</xref></sup> This was then transformed into the binary variable: no (a) versus any schooling degree (b + c + d + e). UEA displayed the participants’ (binary) response to the question whether they themselves wanted to continue with formal education but were not able to do so. In a subsequent step, reasons for uttered UAE were inquired about and qualitatively evaluated (in most cases as a verbatim transcript from the voice-recorded sociobiographic interview). Procedures of open and axial coding were applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020764012437122">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>) based upon the Weft QDA software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0020764012437122">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p>For comparisons between nominal parameters, chi-squared (<italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic>) tests were performed. Correlations of ordinal-scaled variables were analysed with the Kendall-Tau method, and group comparisons with the Mann-Whitney test (indicated by the displayed <italic>b</italic> and <italic>Z</italic> figures, respectively). For interval-scaled parameters, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests and two-tailed Pearson correlation were applied, with <italic>t</italic> and <italic>r</italic> values stated accordingly. The dependence of predictor on control variables was assessed with partial correlation. Binary logistic and linear regression analyses were applied according to the categorical or continuous nature of the dependent variable. In logistic regression, Cox &amp; Snell’s <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> was used as a measure for the model’s goodness of fit. Generally, with an error probability (<italic>p</italic>) of ≤ .05, significance was assumed. Due to the exploratory character of the evaluation, corrections for multiple testing were not undertaken. Computing was done based on the IMB SPSS 19.0 software.</p>

<title>Selection of sample for the current report</title>
<p>Of the eligible patients, 84.2% (85/101) were willing to participate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0020764012437122">3</xref></sup> In this evaluation, only those who took part in at least two of three subsequent assessments were included; thus, follow-up data regarded as sufficient were available for 69 patients (81.2% of those who initially agreed to participate). Differences between the sample evaluated and participants not included were small, with almost identical symptom severity at baseline, and no significant differences in age and gender distribution.</p>
<p>Due to participants who were not accessible for all follow-up examinations, the mean follow-up time (332 days) was slightly less than one year. Reasons for not taking part in follow-up assessments were in most cases participants being inaccessible due to un-notified cancellation of their telephone account or non-availability due to current high workload (five cases each). Four patients moved to other regions, and in two cases, further participation was objected to and inhibited by relatives (i.e. spouse or parents). Between those who took part at all follow-ups and those who missed one, no significant course difference was detectable (detailed data available on request).</p>
<p>The majority of the evaluated sample was female (84%), married, and had a mean age (± SD) of 40.6 (± 10.1) years. At inclusion, the average HAM-D-17 score was in the moderate range (<italic>M</italic> ± SD: 17.8 ± 4.2). This was on a comparable level between the university (18.6 ± 4.1) and the primary care group (17.2 ± 4.3: <italic>t</italic> = 1.4, <italic>p</italic> = .18). Comorbidity with DSM-IV Axis I disorders was identified in 62.3% of the participants. Of them, 37.7% were diagnosed with one, 21.7% with two, and 2.9% with more than two comorbid Axis I disorders. The most frequent concurrent condition was anxiety disorders (39.1%), followed by somatoform (14.5%) and obsessive-compulsive disorders (13.0%). Personality disorder traits were present in 40.6% of theparticipants (cluster A: 8.7%; cluster B: 17.4%; cluster C: 20.3%).</p>
<p>In the naturalistic setting, most participants (94.2%) received at least some pharmacological treatment. As the initial antidepressant, SSRIs (79.8%) and Venlafaxine (15.9%) were preferred. In most cases (68.7%), the minimal doses recommended for MD treatment were applied (according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764012437122">Benkert &amp; Hippius, 2005</xref>: Escitalopram 10 mg, Citalopram, Paroxetine and Fluoxetine 20 mg, Sertraline 50 mg, Venlafaxine 150 mg and Trazodon 200 mg). A lower dose was prescribed to 3.0%, and in 28.4% of the observed cases, a higher dose was chosen at any time during the treatment. A co-medication was prescribed for 37.3% of the participants, most frequently benzodiazepines (16.4%) and antipsychotics (9.0%). At the final follow-up, 58% of participants reported continued use of an antidepressant medication. Of these, 5.4% claimed occasional, 37.8% fairly regular and 56.8% regular intake. Of those who discontinued the medication, 84.0% did so without consulting with a specialist.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0020764012437122">
<title>Course of depression</title>
<p>The majority of the participants (58.0%) displayed at least a temporary partial remission during the follow-up period. The rate of those who experienced a non-remissive course during one year differed significantly between the study sites, with better course parameters for the university setting (proportion of 29% vs 53% in the primary care group; <italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic> = 3.9, <italic>p</italic> = .048). Overall, there was a reduction of the average HAM-D from an initial 17.8 ± 4.2 to a final score of 11.1 ± 6.0 (<italic>t</italic> = 8.6, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>None of the comorbidity and treatment parameters were linked with the course variable in univariate analysis. This was also the case for the recorded socioeconomic variables (employment, income and health insurance status; detailed data on request).</p>

<title>Education</title>
<p>The distribution of the highest DEG of the entire group of participants is displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020764012437122">Table 1</xref>. Compared with the state-provided Turkish data from 2008,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0020764012437122">4</xref></sup> the sample represents the nationwide educational distribution fairly well. While there is a very good fit for the lower and middle educational segments, a moderate over-sampling occurred for participants with tertiary education. The non-significant tendency for under-sampling in the group without a schooling degree results in part out of the difficulty to include illiterate participants. Responding to questionnaires read out by the researcher proved to be difficult, such that only two illiterate participants provided sufficient data to be included here.</p>

<p>DEG displayed associations with a variety of other variables. Gender had a strong impact on education, with lower levels among female participants (<italic>Z</italic> = -3.0, <italic>p</italic> = .003). Compared with the TUIK 2008 national data, the female sub-sample displays a fairly good fit, while a significant over-sampling of higher-educated male participants occurred. Level of education proved to be significantly higher among the university versus the primary care participants (<italic>Z</italic> = -3.8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Those with lower educational scores (L-DEG) were characterized by a higher number of siblings (5.9 ± 2.7) compared to those with a higher, at least secondary school degree (4.2 ± 2.0, <italic>p</italic> = .002).</p>
<p>Noteworthy is that PEL did not correlate with DEG (Kendall-Tau’s <italic>b</italic> = 0.067). The same is true for participants’ age (<italic>b</italic> = 0.034) and origin (rural vs urban; b = 0.056; all<italic>p</italic> &gt; .2). While the initial severity of depression did not correlate with education, those who displayed a non-remitting course had received significantly less education (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020764012437122">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>UEA was were negatively correlated with DEG (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020764012437122">Table 2</xref>). In total, half of the sample reported UEA, with the ratio being 18% among male and 56% among female participants (<italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic> = 5.31, <italic>p</italic> = .021). Those reporting UAE were further characterized by a higher number of siblings (<italic>p</italic> = .011) and a more-frequent non-remissive course (55.9% vs 26.5% of the participants; <italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic> = 6.07, <italic>p</italic> = .014). There was an almost significant tendency for those reporting UEA to be older (<italic>p</italic> = .054), while other parameters were not statistically linked with UEA in this sample (e.g. context of origin, parental education, marital status, site of examination).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0020764012437122">
<title>Reasons stated for unfulfilled educational aspirations: Qualitative results</title>
<p>In the qualitative part of the study, participants were asked for reasons why they were not able to realize their educational aspirations. Of the 34 participants who reported UEA, 27 gave a response.</p>
<p>Most frequently (20/27), respondents referred to a concept of ‘not being sent to school’ (<italic>gönder[il]medi[m]</italic>) or ‘not exposed to education’ (<italic>okut[ul]madı[m]</italic>). This implies that neither the personal interest of the student nor the legal requirements, but the will of the parents had been decisive for the individual’s schooling. In other cases, a more specific conflict over this issue was verbalized: namely, the father or stepfather not allowing further education (<italic>izin vermedi</italic>), or the perception of the parents hindering (<italic>engelledi</italic>) further educational pursuit.</p>
<p>Approximately one fourth of the respondents explained that the economic situation during their childhood did not allow any (one case) or further education (mainly more than primary, in one case university education). One participant reported that she was not able to go to school due to the illness of her mother; she had to care for the family.</p>
<p>Repeatedly, gender-specific reasons were given (6/27). In the most basic form, education for girls was generally denied (a girl does not / is not to receive education: <italic>kız çocuğu okumaz</italic> and similar formulations). In other cases, the available resources were directed to the brothers, who were allowed to reach higher levels of education, or early marriage, not schooling, was seen as the immediate aim.</p>
<p>Another topic referred to with some frequency (about 1/10) was the political instability at the time of the participant’s education, which led the parents to refrain from sending them to school. Twice, incidents of terror were mentioned here. Finally, other reasons given were early marriage or descent from an illiterate context.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0020764012437122">
<title>Variables of origin</title>
<p>The conditions under which the participants grew up are represented in this evaluation through three variables: urban versus rural character of residency during formative years; number of siblings; and PEL. Rural origin was associated with the non-remissive course (<italic>p</italic> = .030), but not with DEG, UEA or other parameters.</p>
<p>PEL was negatively correlated with age of participant (Kendall-Tau <italic>b</italic> = -0.287, <italic>p</italic> = .004), as well as with the size of the primary family (number of siblings; <italic>b</italic> = -0.294, <italic>p</italic> = .005). Among the urban group, PEL was found to be slightly higher (<italic>Z</italic> = -2.13, <italic>p</italic> = .033). Where both parents had achieved no schooling degree (L-PEL), 64.7% of the participants were marked by a non-remissive course, while this was the case for 30.4% with more parental education (<italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic> = 6.09, <italic>p</italic> = .014). PEL was not associated with gender, place of recruitment or – as mentioned above – the participant’s own educational parameters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0020764012437122">
<title>Predictors</title>
<p>In order to determine independent predictive effects of variables that proved to be linked significantly with the course in univariate analysis, a series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses was performed. Logistic regression was used because of the binary dependent variable (NR vs RC).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0020764012437122">
<title>Regression analysis</title>
<p>We examined the impact of 12 potential predictor variables on the dependent variable: NR (non-remissive course) versus RC (course marked by at least temporary partial remission). After applying the <italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic> test for categorical and <italic>t</italic>-test for continuous variables, we retained those five that had a significant univariate relationship with the course classification (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0020764012437122">Table 4</xref>). The initial HAM-D-17 score did not significantly differ between NR and RC. Nevertheless, this variable was retained in order to control for the baseline severity of depression in the subsequent regression analysis. All significant univariate associations were controlled for initial severity of depression and gender and proved to be robust, with the exception of place of examination (university polyclinic vs primary care; P/E). Therefore, this parameter was taken into the regression analysis as a facultative additional control variable.</p>

<p>Because of the significant gender disparity in the educational parameters, we evaluated the female sub-sample alone (<italic>n</italic> = 53 – the number of male participants was too small for a separate calculation). In this model (D, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0020764012437122">Table 5</xref>), again the same variables resulted as predictors, and although the number of cases decreased by 16%, the model’s <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> exceeded by 0.246 (<italic>p</italic> = .001) the value that resulted for the whole sample.

<p>Since the educational parameters proved to be strong predictors of the course of depression, factors that might influence or interact with them are of particular interest.</p>
<p>A number of parameters obtained in this evaluation exerted a significant role during the participant’s formative years. Among them, gender has a direct effect on DEG(<italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.101, model’s <italic>p</italic> = .007) and UEA (<italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.080, model’s <italic>p</italic> = .017) in logistic regression. One of the indicators of family structure, the number of siblings, has been found to be negatively correlated with and a predictor of DEG (<italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.168, <italic>p</italic> = .001) and UEA (<italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.141, <italic>p</italic> = .003), while PEL was not directly associated with participants’ education. The number of siblings itself was predicted by PEL (<italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.099, <italic>p</italic> = .018) and rural versus urban localization during childhood (<italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.076, <italic>p</italic> = .030). This context variable had a weaker predictive impact on the course of depression, while not being associated with parental or participant’s education itself. The only factor predicting PEL in this sample is age of the participant (<italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.172, <italic>p</italic> = .001), which means that with time, PEL appears to increase.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The data presented here reflect the naturalistic course of outpatients with MD, observed for a mean time of almost one year (11 months). The average baseline HAM-D-17 of around 18 characterizes this as a moderately depressed sample, being in the range of many other outpatient studies undertaken in Turkey and other countries (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020764012437122">Özşahin, Uzun, Cansever, &amp; Gulcat, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020764012437122">Pedrelli et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Remission rates in this sample have been low: 42% of the participants did not display either full or partial remission at any of the follow-up examinations at four, eight and 12 months, a proportion that is noticeably higher than in most clinical intervention samples. Some naturalistic studies also reported lower rates of unfavourable courses (in the range of 20%–30% in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020764012437122">Kühn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020764012437122">Spijker et al., 2002</xref>). Other previous studies, however, revealed comparable bleak results; the review of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020764012437122">Gilchrist and Gunn (2007)</xref> presents recovery rates from MD after 12 month in the range of 32%–67%.</p>
<p>In this evaluation, we focused on those participants who were characterized by the lack of any level of remission in the approximately one-year course. This group has previously been identified as being at high risk for depression chronicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764012437122">Licht-Strunk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020764012437122">Spijker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0020764012437122">Wittchen &amp; Jacobi, 2006</xref>). We sought to identify baseline factors that predict such an unfavourable course. In this sample, the initial severity of depression and the age of the participant were not univariately related to the course variable. While especially the depressive symptomatology at baseline was identified as a predictive variable in a number of former studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764012437122">Bjerkeset et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764012437122">Bracke, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020764012437122">Gilchrist &amp; Gunn, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020764012437122">Holma, Holma, Melartin, Rytsälä, &amp; Isometsä, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020764012437122">Rubenstein et al., 2007</xref>), others, however, did not confirm this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764012437122">Gater et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764012437122">Gilmer et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Gender proved to be a prognostic factor for depression chronicity in some (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764012437122">Bracke, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020764012437122">de Girolamo et al., 2006</xref>), but not in all studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020764012437122">Rubenstein et al., 2007</xref>). Here, it failed to prove univariate association with the course, which might be due to the insufficient number of male participants (<italic>n</italic> = 11) in this sample. Nevertheless, the striking, although non-significant lower remission rate of females indicates that a potential predictive role of gender deserves further attention.</p>
<p>Axis I comorbidity in general and concurrent anxiety disorders in particular have been frequent in this sample. Comparable levels have been reported by epidemiological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020764012437122">Gabilondo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020764012437122">Rhebergen, Beekman, Hoogendijk, &amp; Penninx, 2009</xref>) and the STAR*D project, which included a similar sampling in psychiatric and primary care settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0020764012437122">Trivedi et al., 2006</xref>). While a number of prospective studies have identified concurrent anxiety and personality disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764012437122">Cohen, Goh, &amp; Gustave et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020764012437122">Klein, Shankman, &amp; Rose, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0020764012437122">Szádóczky, Rózsa, Zámboria, &amp; Fqredi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0020764012437122">Trivedi et al., 2006</xref>) as negative predictors for the course of MD, this was not observed here. This might be due to the comparatively small size of our sample, although other previous research also reported ambiguous findings. Thus regarding Axis II comorbidity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020764012437122">Mulder (2002)</xref> reviewed conflicting results, and in the NEMESIS epidemiological study, comorbid anxiety disorder – one of the selected potentially explanatory variables – did not reveal prognostic impact on the MD 12-month course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020764012437122">Rhebergen et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Some form of antidepressant treatment was prescribed to almost all participants. A similar preference for SSRI agents was reported from another observational study undertaken in Turkey, in which 28.6% of the subjects discontinued the psychopharmacological treatment within a three-month period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020764012437122">Özyüksel &amp; Uluğ, 2007</xref>). Giving validity to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764012437122">McFarland and Klein’s (2005)</xref> comment on dropout rates varying essentially according to study length, the adherence to medication in our sample after a mean follow-up of 11 months appears low, but at an expected level. Based on the participants’ self-report, only about half of them maintained an at least fairly regular intake. Neither the type nor dosage of nor the adherence to antidepressant treatment was found to be associated with the course in this sample. This is congruent to a number of other observational studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020764012437122">Meyers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020764012437122">Özyüksel &amp; Uluğ, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020764012437122">Rhebergen et al., 2009</xref>). Some authors pointed to the difficulties of interpreting treatment parameters in naturalistic cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764012437122">Cohen et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the decision to seek and/or to continue medication itself may be dependent on the illness severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764012437122">McFarland &amp; Klein, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020764012437122">Pettit et al., 2009</xref>), potentially giving rise to spurious relationships between treatment and outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764012437122">Cui, Lyness, Tang, Tu, &amp; Conwell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020764012437122">Rhebergen et al., 2009</xref>). Here, a non-antidepressant co-medication was linked with the initial severity of depression (HAM-D-17 20.1 vs 16.3, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), indicating indeed a bias towards more therapy for the individuals with the most severe problems.</p>
<p>Education (measured as the highest attained degree) proved to be a univariate predictor for the course of depression. This is in line with the majority of previous results from a variety of cultures, noteworthy the LIDO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764012437122">Fleck et al., 2005</xref>) and the WHO Collaborative Project on Psychological Problems in General Health Care study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764012437122">Barkow et al., 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764012437122">Bjerkeset et al. (2008)</xref> discusses whether an apparent gender difference in the course of MD could partially be ascribed to education inequality. The data presented here confirm a disadvantaged schooling situation among female participants, which is in line with the nationwide Turkish data provided by TÜIK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0020764012437122">Turkish Statistical Institute, 2008</xref>). Education proved to be a strong predictor for the course of depression in the whole as well as in the female sub-sample. This together supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020764012437122">Ross and Mirowsky’s (2006)</xref> observation that, due to having fewer socioeconomic resources such as power, authority and earnings, women appear to be especially dependent on education for emotional well-being.</p>
<p>This study focuses on the sociocultural parameters particular to Turkey, a still rather low-income country seeing rapid and extensive changes over the last decades. Therefore, the data presented here address a situation marked by a broad variation, albeit comparatively low mean level of education, which differs from most previously published results. While, for example, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020764012437122">Pettit et al. (2009)</xref>, 86% of the participants had experienced at least ‘some college’, in this sample, 58% completed no more than lower secondary education. Kivelä and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020764012437122">Kivelä, Koengaes-Saviaro, Kesti, &amp; Pahkala 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020764012437122">Kivelä, Viramo, &amp; Pahkala, 2000</xref>) previously reported on groups with low educational achievement and found a poor depression outcome in men with no more than primary school education. Here too, participants with only a primary school degree or less were marked by a significantly worse course. In contrast, among those who had at least nine years of formal education, 28% had a non-remissive course, a proportion that lays in the range of some other studies undertaken in contexts with a higher mean education (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020764012437122">Kühn et al., 2002</xref> (Germany); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020764012437122">Spijker et al., 2002</xref> (the Netherlands)).</p>
<p>The prevalent inequality in educational prospects inevitably leads to the fact that some competent individuals do not have the opportunity to pursue and complete formal education as desired. Thus, inclusion of the self-report parameter UEA in this study was deemed of value. Half of the participants confirmed UEA, with a negative correlation to the level of education obtained. UEA was generally more prevalent in females. Surprisingly, when entered together with DEG in multivariate analysis, UEA proved to be of higher and independent prognostic value. This remained significant also while controlling for gender, place of examination (primary care vs university polyclinic) and initial severity of depression, and in the separate calculation of the female subgroup alone. This solidly confirms hypothesis 2.</p>
<p>Comparable data for the prevalence of UEA are provided by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020764012437122">OECD (2007)</xref> report’s section on educational expectations. The indicator reports the responses of 15-year-old students to a question in the PISA 2003 student background questionnaire: ‘What is the highest level of education you expect to complete?’ The figures for Turkey reveal an exceptionally high appreciation for education: for the vast majority of upper secondary school students (86.1%), the aim is a tertiary, university-level degree. This is the second-highest proportion among all participating countries, while the OECD average expectation was 63.2% for tertiary-level degrees. While the opportunity to obtain a higher degree has become gradually better, high educational aspirations in Turkey face the fact that still only a limited number of students will realize them. According to the national statistical data from TÜIK 2008, a mean of 42% of those who completed upper secondary education (age groups 30–64) also reached a tertiary-level degree. Assuming that academic aspirations have been in a comparable range over the last decades, roughly half of those who aimed at a university degree as upper secondary students were unable to fulfil their expectation. This corresponds fairly well with this study’s proportion of half of the participants having reported UEA.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, a variable representing the failed or fulfilled education-related expectations has not been investigated in the context of the course of affective disorders so far. This appears also to be the case for the educational level of the index patient’s parents. At first glance, PEL may be thought to determine the educational outcome of participants, their children,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0020764012437122">5</xref></sup> and thus influence the course of major depression. Here, a fairly strong effect of PEL on the course of disease in their children, the studies’ index patients, has been confirmed (univariately <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.091, <italic>p</italic> = .014; together with UEA <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.217; in the female sub-sample <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> 0.246, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001). This, however, could not be explained by a recognizable effect on the participants’ educational parameters.</p>
<p>Indeed, PEL was a fairly independent parameter, linked only with the age of the participant. The tendency for younger participants to have higher-educated parents (Kendall-Tau <italic>b</italic> = -0.331) may reflect that mean educational levels improve gradually with time. PEL has a predictive effect on size of family in two subsequent generations – on the number of their children (participants’ siblings) and grandchildren (participants’ children; data available on request). While such an indirect effect via the family structure can be assumed, PEL’s strong direct impact on the course of depression needs to be explained in additional ways.</p>
<p>Since in this sample, PEL was not correlated with the participants’ own education (or income level), some aspects connected with low parental education not severely hindering academic and professional careers might have negatively influenced the ability to overcome depression. These can be suspected to be within the realm of basic self-perceptions and recruitable resources related to level of education. If <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020764012437122">Ross and Mirowsky’s (2006</xref>, p. 1401) conclusion that ‘low education breeds learned helplessness’ is valid, our findings would suggest its validity not only for an individual’s life, but also trans-generationally. Low educational achievement among parents might lead to a lack of attainment of certain resources connected with ‘the ability and motivation to shape and control [one’s own] lives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020764012437122">Ross &amp; Mirowsky, 2006</xref>, p. 1401), which could only partially be substituted by formal education, but proved to be lacking in times of existential crisis, thus fostering the prolongation of depression. So ‘powerlessness, fatalism, and helplessness’ (Wheaton, 1980, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020764012437122">Ross &amp; Mirowsky, 2006</xref>, p. 1401) appear to be present not only in those with low education themselves, but to some degree also as a ‘cognitive remnant’ in their children, even when they perform better academically and professionally. Further work is needed to substantiate such a relationship between parental education and course of depression, and to specifically search for trans-generationally impacting resource patterns.</p>
<p>Contrasting it with urban settings, participants who grew up in a village or smaller town were marked by more unfavourable courses. In multivariate analysis, however, this variable of origin displayed limited predictive power, only being included in a model together with UEA when PEL was not entered. According to the Cox &amp; Snell <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> value, this model explained about 10% less of the variance than the combination of educational parameters and PEL (<italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.146, <italic>p</italic> = .001). In addition to the second-rank prognostic impact on the course of depression, the context of origin proved to be linked with aspects of the family structure that themselves have an effect on educational parameters. Rural descent (together with low PEL) predicted a higher number of siblings – a parameter that was a key predictor for participants’ low educational level (together with female gender <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.309, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). To some degree, the participants’ academic career appears to have been determined by factors independent of their individual competency, but rather by the family of origin’s psychosocial characteristics. There is a strong tendency towards smaller family sizes in Turkey in recent years (detectable also in this sample). This change facilitates one of the desired aims of many Turkish parents today, to provide a better education, and might thus also positively affect the prerequisite tools for recovery from depression in the subsequent generation.</p>
<p>Thus, aspects of the family structure, including gender roles and perceptions, are suspected to have a crucial impact on the educational opportunities that a child will receive. Some of these notions have been recorded in qualitative information gathered. Most of the reasons stated for UEA were connected with particular orientations on the individualism–collectivism axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764012437122">Hofstede, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020764012437122">Triandis, 2001</xref>) that confer most responsibility for education-related decisions to the family, especially the father. Further, sociopolitical and economic restrictions have been verbalized, as well as gender-related familial perceptions. These latter perceptions necessitate either a narrower or wider scope for formal education for female offspring. The orientation of these values in the family appears to be fairly independent of the parents’ own educational status and only to a limited degree correlated to the rural versus urban setting in which participants spent their formative years. More research is needed in this context since these familial structures and perceptions appear to either facilitate or restrict the educational opportunities available to offspring. This is important given the results of our data that suggest educational resources as a significant prognostic factor and potential mediator in the course of major depression.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The comparatively small sample (<italic>N</italic> = 69) and the gender imbalance limit the statistical power of this evaluation. Especially due to the under-representation of men, sound gender comparisons were not possible, and some probable gender effects may have gone undetected. Also, temporary remissions may have gone undetected between the four-monthly assessments. Therefore, some uncertainty remains whether the rating ‘non-remissive course’ indeed represents an uninterrupted episode of major depression, which has been assumed here.</p>
<p>The newly created variables PEL and UEA are based on the self-report of the participants and thus are dependent on their ability to sufficiently recollect them. In particular, UEA may only partially represent the perception at the actual time when the participant left school. An influence of present, depression-related variables, such as degree of contentment and reconciliation with the individual’s biography, cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, their distribution and attribution, as well as concordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020764012437122">OECD (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0020764012437122">Turkish Statistical Institute (2008)</xref> data, support that the perceived UEA are not essentially dependent on the depressive psychopathology.</p>
<p>Although the attrition quota was rather low, and the baseline differences between the follow-up subjects and non-participants were minimal, we cannot know how those who were not interviewed developed clinically over time. Finally, due to the exploratory character of the evaluation, we aimed at avoiding type 2 errors in the multiple comparisons, which increased the possibility of type 1 errors in the data analyses. Despite these limitations, to our knowledge this is the first study that provides information as to the role of both patients’ and their parents’ educational parameters in predicting the course of major depression.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<list id="list3-0020764012437122" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The naturalistic course of MD, observed for a mean of 11 months in primary care and university polyclinic settings in Turkey, is rather poor. A high-risk group for depression chronicity (consisting of 42% of the participants) was marked by lack of full or partial remission at any follow-up examination.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Low education and rural descent partially predict these unfavourable courses. However, more than the extent of formal schooling, unfulfilled educational aspirations, reported by half of the participants, and a low level of parental education have an independent and comparatively stronger impact on the course of depression. Together, they explain more than one fifth of the variance of remission in the (almost) one-year course in this sample.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Aspects of family structure linked to lower educational levels in this sample were a high number of siblings and female gender, with a negative effect of larger family size on attained education being particularly influential for girls.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>While progress in Turkey’s education system is discernable from numerous vantage points, more remains to be done to enable all capable students to attain their suitable level of achievement. In particular, improvements for those disadvantaged by particular familial structures and perceptions will have a positive impact on various aspects of life, including a preventive effect against depression incidence and chronicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020764012437122">Smits et al., 2008</xref>).</p></list-item>

In the sample analysed here, however, the structure of the educational system in Turkey, together with the high value generally ascribed to education, seems to have minimized the trans-generationally determining effect of low education.</p>
