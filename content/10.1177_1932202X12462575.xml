<abstract>
<p>Reliability and validity are integral concepts in assessment design. Test speededness, the influence of time constraints on test taker performance, is often an overlooked threat to reliability and validity, especially in classroom-based testing. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the degree of test speededness of classroom-based assessments that have been developed and tested for a curricular reading intervention study with third-grade gifted students. The degree of speededness for the assessments was calculated using a mixture Rasch model. The results indicate that a large proportion of students were influenced by test speededness for both posttests in both treatment groups. The implications of these results are discussed.</p>

<p>In education, there is an emphasis on examining student achievement through the use of academic assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1932202X12462575">No Child Left Behind Act, 2002</xref>). The goal of most classroom tests is to assess students’ ability by measuring their knowledge and skills in a given content area; however, many of the tests administered in classrooms have time limits imposed on them, mainly as a result of practicality due to class time restrictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1932202X12462575">Thorndike &amp; Thorndike-Christ, 2009</xref>). When time limits are imposed on a test intentionally or unintentionally, the concern about whether the time limit interferes with the measurement of the students’ achievement emerges. That is, students’ scores may not be representative of students’ achievement when a test has time constraints. In measurement, this concern is referred to as test <italic>speededness</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1932202X12462575">Evans &amp; Reilly, 1972</xref>). Test speededness refers to “the situation where the time limits on tests do not allow substantial numbers of examinees to fully consider all test items” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1932202X12462575">Lu &amp; Sireci, 2007</xref>, p. 29).</p>

<title>The Challenge Leading to Engagement, Achievement, and Results (CLEAR) Curriculum</title>
<p>This study used data from an ongoing study investigating the effectiveness of the CLEAR curriculum for third-grade gifted students. The CLEAR curriculum is an integration of the strengths of three well-known models in gifted education: Tomlinson’s Differentiation of Instruction Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1932202X12462575">Tomlinson, 2001</xref>), Kaplan’s Depth and Complexity Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1932202X12462575">Kaplan, 2001</xref>), and Renzulli and Reis’ Schoolwide Enrichment Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1932202X12462575">Renzulli &amp; Reis, 1985</xref>). The curriculum focuses on developing conceptual understanding through the use of continual formative assessment, clear learning goals, data-driven learning experiences, and authentic products. To assess the CLEAR curriculum, researchers created two units—one poetry and one research. A pretest assessment, formative assessments, performance assessments, and a posttest assessment are included in each unit. These posttests are used as outcome measures for determining the effectiveness of the curriculum. Data collected on the end of unit posttest assessments were used to assess speededness in this study.</p>

<title>The Source of Speededness: Power Test Versus Speed Test</title>
<p>To understand the concept of test speededness, one must first understand the distinction between speed tests and power tests. Theoretically, a speed test is a test composed of an infinite number of easy items, and performance is judged by how many items are answered, usually in a given amount of time. With a speed test, one is interested only in measuring cognitive processing speed. A power test is a test where an examinee answers all the items, and performance is judged by the correctness of the answers. With a power test, one is interested only in measuring the knowledge of a test taker regardless of how long it takes the test taker to complete the test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1932202X12462575">Gulliksen, 1950</xref>). Research has shown that a power and a speed test are not equivalent measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1932202X12462575">Baxter, 1941</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1932202X12462575">Davidson &amp; Carroll, 1945</xref>). When time limits are imposed on power tests, the yield is a combination of power and speed tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1932202X12462575">Gulliksen, 1950</xref>).</p>
<p>A power test with a time limit introduces a speed construct to the testing situation. The speed construct introduced when time limits are imposed may influence the measurement of students’ knowledge, understanding, and ability to apply knowledge and understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1932202X12462575">Gulliksen, 1950</xref>). The extent to which the time limit influences the measurement of students’ achievement is referred to as the <italic>degree of speededness</italic>. If a time limit severely influences students’ scores, then there is a high degree of speededness for that test. If a time limit does not influence students’ scores, then there is a low degree of speededness for the test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1932202X12462575">Lu &amp; Sireci, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Speededness, Reliability, and Validity</title>
<p>Any time a new assessment is created or an existing test is administered, both the validity and reliability of the scores need to be assessed. There are many factors that influence the psychometric properties of test scores. Test speededness is one such factor. The amount of speededness for a test can lead to a misinterpretation of validity and reliability of test scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1932202X12462575">Lu &amp; Sireci, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Test speededness can influence validity. Validity is defined as “the degree to which evidence and theory support the interpretations of test scores entailed by proposed uses of test scores” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1932202X12462575">American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, and National Council on Measurement in Education, 1999</xref>, p. 9). When inferences from test scores are valid, the scores are assumed to accurately reflect the trait being measured. The presence of test speededness can result in construct-irrelevant variance, misspecified factor structure, and construct underrepresentation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1932202X12462575">Lu and Sireci (2007)</xref> stated that “when speededness is unintended, it introduces construct-irrelevant variance into the test scores and thus changes the construct the test intends to measure” (p. 31). As a result of construct-irrelevant variance, scores no longer accurately reflect the trait being measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1932202X12462575">Lord &amp; Novick, 1968</xref>). Test speededness can also influence the factor structure of a test. Items that are not reached may form a secondary unmeasured dimension, known as the speededness factor. That is, instead of a student’s score just representing the primary factor, such as reading ability, it may also be influenced by speed. This could result in bias, systematic errors that lead to measurement issues for a particular group of test takers, or differential item functioning, when students of the same ability or achievement level have different chances of getting the item correct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1932202X12462575">Camilli &amp; Shepard, 1994</xref>). Test speededness may also influence content validity. All items in the test are important for content validity as they represent required specifications or standards. The completion of content specifications is hindered when examinees have to rush through the test or if they do not reach some items on the test. This may result in construct underrepresentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1932202X12462575">Lu &amp; Sireci, 2007</xref>). In addition, speededness has a direct impact on the parameter estimates when utilizing an item response model. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1932202X12462575">Hambleton and Swaminathan (1985)</xref> stated that a unidimensional item response theory (IRT) model is assumed to be unspeeded. When test speededness is present, the parameter estimates are adversely affected. That is, item difficulties tend to be overestimated for items at the end of test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1932202X12462575">Bolt, Cohen, &amp; Wollack, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1932202X12462575">Douglas, Kim, Habing, &amp; Gao, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1932202X12462575">Oshima, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1932202X12462575">Schnipke, 1996</xref>) and ability estimates tend to be underestimated for examinees who experience speededness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1932202X12462575">van der Linden, Scrams, &amp; Schnipke, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Test speededness also influences the accuracy of reliability estimates. For purpose of this study, reliability can be thought of as the relationships among items on the test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1932202X12462575">Meyer, 2010</xref>). If the items measuring the same underlying construct, such as a student’s reading ability on a reading test, are highly related, then test scores can be thought of as reliable. Early work on test speededness found that when test speededness is present, reliability estimates tend to be overestimated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1932202X12462575">Gulliksen, 1950</xref>). The reason for this overestimation is that if a student took the timed test, he or she may not have time to answer the items at the end of the test and all these items would be scored as incorrect. As a result, these unreached items would be more highly correlated than earlier items on the test, which inflates the estimate of reliability. However, if the student was able to answer the items at the end of the test, then that high interrelatedness would most likely decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1932202X12462575">Crocker &amp; Algina, 1986</xref>). However, recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1932202X12462575">Green and Hershberger (2000)</xref> showed that reliability may be underestimated if the correlated errors are due to an unspecified factor. As mentioned previously, speededness can be thought of as a secondary factor. Therefore, in the presence of speededness, reliability may actually be underestimated. In addition, it should be noted that reliability is a necessary but not sufficient condition for validity. Therefore, if the presence of speededness influences the reliability of test scores, it also influences the validity of the scores.</p>
<p>All these influences on reliability and validity may lead to misinterpretations of test scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1932202X12462575">Lu &amp; Sireci, 2007</xref>). With a body of evidence supporting the influence of test speededness on the reliability and validity of test scores, the degree of speededness for any test with a time constraint should be examined.</p>

<title>Test Speededness in the Classroom</title>
<p>The concept of test speededness has been relegated to large-scale testing situations, such as the SAT, Law School Admission Test, Medical College Admission Test, and Test of English As a Foreign Language, at the exclusion of classroom-based tests in general and gifted classrooms in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1932202X12462575">Bejar, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1932202X12462575">Evans &amp; Reilly, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1932202X12462575">Henderson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1932202X12462575">Lawrence, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1932202X12462575">Zenisky, Hambleton, &amp; Sireci, 2002</xref>). In these studies, test speededness was present, and in some cases, measures were taken to take speededness into account when estimating parameters in the model. The concept of accurately measuring students’ knowledge is just as important in classroom tests as it is in high-stakes testing situations. Therefore, test speededness should also be assessed for classroom tests. By evaluating the degree of test speededness for the classroom posttest assessments in this study, the concept can be brought to the attention of researchers and practitioners.</p>

<title>Research Question</title>
<p>This study seeks to fill in the gap in the literature on test speededness in classroom assessments in the context of gifted classrooms. The research question to be examined is as follows: What proportion of students experienced the effects of test speededness on a classroom assessment designed specifically for gifted students?</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>Data were collected as part of a larger study investigating the effectiveness of the CLEAR curriculum. Third-grade teachers and their students were recruited at the national and district level to participate in an experiment examining the effectiveness of a new gifted education curriculum. Each participant was informed that assignment to experimental or control classroom would be random and that agreement to participate was agreement to comply with assignment. After recruitment, researchers randomly assigned classrooms to experimental or comparison conditions with students nested within classrooms. A total of 1,215 students from 76 classrooms in 11 states across the nation participated in the 1st year of implementation. Students were identified as gifted based on their schools’ identification process. These students were from either self-contained or pull-out gifted classrooms. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1932202X12462575">Table 1</xref> provides a breakdown of the participants by treatment condition. Multiple sources of data were collected for the larger study. For the purpose of this study, the focus is on student posttest assessment data from the 1st year of data collection.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>To assess student outcomes, two posttests (one poetry and one research) with 35 multiple-choice items each were administered. A six-person multidisciplinary research team designed the posttest assessments. A small group of students participated in the piloting of the assessments. From the data collected from the pilot study, and based on classical test theory, the questions underwent a thorough review process that examined appropriate level of difficulty, the proportion of students who answered the item correctly, and discrimination, the correlation between the item and the total test score, for each item (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1932202X12462575">Furr &amp; Bacharach, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1932202X12462575">Kurpius &amp; Stafford, 2006</xref>). The teachers who participated in the pilot study provided the time it took for each student to finish the assessment. From these test times, it was determined that students would have 40 min to complete a posttest. After data collection, item difficulties and discrimination were computed using jMetrik software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1932202X12462575">Meyer, 2011</xref>). For both the posttest assessments, the difficulty values varied throughout the test (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1932202X12462575">Table 2</xref>). That is, high difficulty items were spread throughout the test.</p>

<p>Test speededness generally affects end of test items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1932202X12462575">Oshima, 1994</xref>). As mentioned earlier, the end of test items tends to be correlated when speededness is present. Therefore, the major focus of this study is on the last 11 items for both posttest assessments.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The posttest assessments were analyzed using mixture Rasch modeling techniques to determine whether there were distinct nonspeeded groups, examinees whose responses are not affected by the time limit, and speeded groups, examinees whose responses are affected by the time limit. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1932202X12462575">Bolt et al. (2002)</xref> showed that a mixture Rasch model can be used to distinguish between speeded (Class 1) and nonspeeded (Class 2) classes.</p>

<p>As shown, the Rasch model holds for each latent class; however, the difficulty and ability estimates are allowed to differ for each class.</p>

Therefore, the differences between the class-specific examinee abilities account for the relationship between classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1932202X12462575">Bolt et al., 2002</xref>). Another constraint is that the item difficulties for the first 24 items (the nonspeeded items) are constrained to be equal for the two classes. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1932202X12462575">Table 3</xref> provides the constrained difficulty values. This constraint is put in place because it is only the end of test items that are affected by the presence of speededness, and as such, the two classes should not experience differences in difficulty for these items. Items 25 to 35 (the speeded items) are constrained such that the item difficulties for the nonspeeded class are lower than for the speeded class. This constraint implies that the speeded class will find the end of test items more challenging than the nonspeeded class. In contrast to classical test theory item difficulty, IRT item difficulty corresponds to the point on the ability scale where the probability of getting the item correct is equal to .5. Therefore, values can theoretically range from negative infinity to positive infinity, but they generally range from negative three to positive three with a higher value representing a harder item (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1932202X12462575">Embretson &amp; Reise, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Estimation of MRM</title>
<p>To estimate a MRM model, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation algorithm was implemented using Openbugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1932202X12462575">Spiegelhalter, Thomas, Best, &amp; Lunn, 2007</xref>). This method of MCMC utilizes adaptive rejection sampling (ARS). The process of MCMC for mixture models is a multistep iterative process. In the first step, values are specified for each parameter in the model that will be estimated. Then, for each chain run, a class membership parameter (speeded or nonspeeded) is sampled for each examinee, <italic>c<sub>i</sub></italic>. Based on those class memberships, all the other parameters are sampled for each distribution in the model. This process is repeated for a prespecified number of iterations in the hope that the model converges to the correct estimate.</p>
<p>Three chains of 40,000 iterations were run for each posttest. A set number of iterations at the beginning of each chain were discarded to avoid autocorrelation. Autocorrelation is the situation where the current estimated value is dependent on the previous estimated value, and therefore, may not produce an accurate parameter estimate. These discarded iterations are referred to as <italic>burn-in stages</italic>. For this study, 5,000 iterations were discarded as burn-in.</p>
<p>To start the MCMC estimation of the MRM, initial values are set for each parameter in the model. The initial value for the mixing proportions is set at (π<sub>1</sub>, π<sub>2</sub>) = (0.5, 0.5). All other parameter start values were randomly generated using Openbugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1932202X12462575">Spiegelhalter et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>To estimate the parameters, prior distributions first need to be specified. Based on previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1932202X12462575">Bolt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1932202X12462575">Mroch, Bolt, &amp; Wollack, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1932202X12462575">Wollack, Cohen, &amp; Wells, 2003</xref>), the following distributions were specified:</p>
<list id="list2-1932202X12462575" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>b<sub>gj</sub></italic> ~ Normal(0, 1), <italic>j</italic> = 1,…, <italic>I, g</italic> = 1,2;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>θ<sub><italic>gi</italic></sub> ~ Normal(µ<sub><italic>g</italic></sub>, 1), <italic>i</italic> = 1,…, <italic>N</italic>;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>c<sub>i</sub></italic> ~ Bernoulli(π<sub>1</sub>, π<sub>2</sub>), <italic>i</italic> = 1,…, <italic>N</italic>;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>µ<sub><italic>g</italic></sub> ~ Normal(0, 1), <italic>g</italic> = 1, 2; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(π<sub>1</sub>, π<sub>2</sub>) ~ Dirichlet(0.5, 0.5).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Parameter estimates were assessed for convergence using multiple measures. These measures are autocorrelation, time-series plots, and Brooks–Gelman multivariate potential scale reduction factor. Autocorrelation tells us how much an estimate is dependent on the previous estimate. Therefore, one wants to see values close to zero to assume convergence. Time-series plots map the sample values on the <italic>y</italic>-axis and the number of iterations on the <italic>x</italic>-axis; one wants to see a plot that is relatively stable with no upward or downward trends to assume convergence. The Brooks–Gelman multivariate potential reduction factor is a ratio of within-chain variability to between-chain variability. To assume convergence, one would like to see a ratio that is close to one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1932202X12462575">Spiegelhalter et al., 2007</xref>). All estimates meet the convergence criteria.</p>

<p>From the mixing proportions, it is clear that approximately 50% of the examinees belong to the speeded class, whereas 50% of examines belong to the nonspeeded class. This solution holds for the poetry and research posttests. For the research posttest, the mean achievement level for the speeded class was lower than the mean for the nonspeeded class. However, for the poetry posttest, the opposite was true. The mean achievement level for the nonspeeded class was lower than the mean ability for the speeded class.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Tests with time constraints imposed are susceptible to test-speededness effects. The presence of test speededness can impact the validity and reliability of a test. For a majority of the models run, the speeded class had slightly higher achievement levels than the nonspeeded class; however, the difference is so small that it is practically negligible. This suggests that there may not be a relationship between achievement level and influence of test speededness. As the mean achievement levels are so similar for the two classes, we cannot say that examinees with a higher achievement level are more prone to test speededness. The results also showed that a large proportion of examinees were influenced by test speededness for both the posttests. This was also true for the control and the treatment groups. These results suggest that the presence of speededness for the posttests may be a consequence of the time constraints imposed on the test rather than examinee’s knowledge level. That is, one might expect the proportion of speededness to vary when examinees are broken down into treatment subgroups; however, as this was not the case, it seems reasonable to assume that examinee’s knowledge level is not influencing the effect of test speededness. Therefore, the impact of speededness is relegated to the test itself, more specifically to the time constraint imposed on the test.</p>
<p>These results have implications for validity and reliability of the posttest scores. In terms of validity, the presence of test speededness suggests that there is a portion of the examinees’ scores that is not solely a result of their achievement. However, as there seems to be a relatively equal proportion of examinees experiencing speededness in the treatment and control groups, the scores are not providing a differential advantage to one group or the other. That is, both treatment and control groups experience similar test-speededness effects, and therefore, although the scores may not be fully representative of their achievement, they represent similar constructs (i.e., achievement plus speeded effects in both groups). As for reliability estimates, the presence of test speededness may result in an underestimation of posttest scores reliability.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, when speededness is present, the examinees’ scores can no longer be interpreted simply as achievement level. The scores now represent some combination of achievement level and speededness effects. To minimize the effects of speededness on the interpretation of scores and to ensure appropriate validity and reliability estimates, test-speededness effects should be decreased, and therefore, the time limit for the tests should be increased. An untimed test would ensure that speededness has no influence on score interpretation; however, this may not be feasible in most situations. Finding the appropriate time limit for a test can be an iterative process. When test and item response times are not available, the effect of changing the time limit on speededness cannot be assessed until data are collected using the new time limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1932202X12462575">van der Linden, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Future Directions</title>
<p>As this is one of the first studies to examine test speededness on classroom assessments in the context of gifted classrooms, these speededness results open the door to many avenues for future research pursuits. First, test speededness has implications for future studies regarding classroom assessment. Test speededness should be examined for other classroom assessments to determine the range of its influence. Second, this study raises questions about speededness in the gifted population. One question regards whether increasing the time limit will decrease the speededness effects for the gifted students? As such a large proportion of students experienced the influence of speededness regardless of treatment group, one may wonder are there characteristics specific to gifted students that lead to a higher probability of experiencing speededness effects? In addition, future studies may want to examine whether there is a difference in the influence of speededness for gifted students and regular education students. This study serves as a starting point for investigating the influence of speededness in gifted students.</p>
