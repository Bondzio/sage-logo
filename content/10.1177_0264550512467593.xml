<p>The Howard League for Penal Reform recently published a study entitled <italic>Out of Place: The Policing and Criminalisation of Sexually Exploited Girls and Young Women</italic>. The main aims of this research were: to ascertain whether sexually exploited girls and young women were becoming criminalized for behaviour linked to their sexual exploitation and how this was happening; to explore the links between sexual exploitation and offending; to describe the links between specialist services working with girls and youth justice agencies; and to examine processes that may help explain the criminalization of sexually exploited girls and young women. </p>
<p>To address the aims, datasets were collected from two areas. The first was a national survey of individuals and organizations, who are part of the National Working Group for Sexual Exploited Children and Young People. The second set was obtained through a series of in-depth interviews with specialist services and police constabularies in three areas of England and Wales. </p>
<p>In exploring the approach taken by agencies in working with girls who are involved in prostitution (soliciting and loitering), the study reviewed current safeguarding policies that are directed towards the vulnerability of children. The policies refer to sexual exploitation being a form of sexual abuse and intervention should be based on individual needs that support a victim and child-orientated approach. Yet, the criminal justice approach still holds the ability to criminalize children.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the study identifies that the legal and policy frameworks available provide little guidance on interventions for local authorities and criminal justice agencies. While commercial sexual exploitation falls within the legal framework, research highlights that there are a lack of services to help with the vast range of issues that sexual abuse and sexual exploitation brings to the victims. Evidence of multi-agency partnerships between police, social services and non-statutory agencies is recognized and noted in the study. Yet little evidence is available of strong partnership working , particularly involving youth justice services; both community and custody. </p>
<p>In understanding the criminalization of those young people subject to sexual exploitation, official statistics identify that offences tend not to be prostitution-related. Their crime can be linked to offences such as shoplifting in front of security guards to remove themselves from their abusive situation. The research suggests the offences are related to their vulnerabilities underpinned by sexual exploitation. It highlights that these individuals are exposed to policing through their lifestyles where they are economically and socially marginalized; education and employment may be non-existent and their time is spent in public places. This conduct raises governmental concerns with the working class and the links to crime, thus resulting in an increase in the surveillance and criminalization of young people. The young females who are engaging in this lifestyle face greater risk of criminalization than their socially included counterparts who conduct themselves away from police scrutiny. The links between criminalization and sexual exploitation is therefore far more complex.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the study identifies three key findings. Its critical finding refers to policy, law and practice failing to recognize the issues linked to sexual exploitation, crime and criminalization. The study argues that there are differences, within policies, between the definition of sexual exploitation and young girls’ involvement in prostitution, which, for many, is because of economic reasons. The second finding is the limited links between specialist services and youth justice agencies, which provide little in understanding sexually exploited girls and their offending. Finally, the current means of dealing with sexual exploitation creates a disproportionate rate of criminalization.  Increased police surveillance on young females’ public activities means that their behaviour is witnessed resulting in repeated criminalization. For practitioners this study offers a different perspective of the complexities of young women’s offending and its potential link to sexual exploitation.  </p>
