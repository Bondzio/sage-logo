<abstract>
<p>Scholars of social networks often rely on summary statistics to measure and compare the structures of their networks of interest. However, measuring the uncertainty inherent in these summaries can be challenging, thus making hypothesis testing for network summaries difficult. Computational and nonparametric procedures can overcome these difficulties by allowing researchers to generate reference distributions for comparison directly from their data. In this research, I demonstrate the use of nonparametric hypothesis testing in networks using the popular network summary statistic <italic>network modularity</italic>. I provide a method based on permutation testing for assessing whether a particular network modularity score is larger than a researcher might expect due to random chance. I then create a simulation study of network modularity and its simulated reference distribution that I propose. Finally, I provide an empirical example of this technique using cosponsorship networks from U.S. state legislatures.</p>

<p>The quantitative analysis of social networks has experienced a large increase in popularity over the last 10 to 15 years. As the tools for such analysis have become easier to access and more efficient to use, more social scientists have adopted a social networks perspective as a potentially useful lens through which to examine human behavior. With this advance in a networks perspective have come a number of new tools for analyzing and measuring constructs of interest in networks. Unfortunately, many of these new measures lack clear ways to assess the uncertainty inherent in any single sample of a network. This lack of clear measurements for uncertainty in network summary statistics is due at least in part to a lack of understanding regarding the distributional properties of networks and their summaries.</p>
<p>Fortunately, as computational power increases, and nonparametric techniques like bootstrapping and permutation testing become more popular, the need for researchers to rely on established probability distributions as references for their statistics is diminishing. This holds particular promise for scholars of social networks who wish to engage in hypothesis testing on their network summaries. In this article, I demonstrate how a researcher might use permutation testing to assert whether a popular network summary statistic like network modularity is different than might be expected at random. The permutation test proves to be a useful way to assert when the observed statistic is unusually large given the variance in a single measurement of a social network and when an observed statistic might be due to random chance.</p>
<p>I begin by introducing and providing simulation-based analyses of the permutation test. The results of this analysis indicate that the number of connections and the size of subgroups relative to one another in a network influence the size of the reference distributions that emerge from my permutation test. Next, I provide a demonstration of this test using real-world data on the network of cosponsorships in U.S. state legislatures. The study of state cosponsorship networks has increased in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532440012473842">Bratton and Rouse 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532440012473842">Kirkland 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532440012473842">2012</xref>), and more accessible methods of comparison and hypothesis testing for these networks will certainly help studies of state legislatures moving forward. This practical demonstration provides a quick and understandable measure of how the major political parties of the United States structure the collaborative activities of state legislators, and when that structuring is unusually powerful.</p>
<p>While my practical application focuses on state cosponsorship networks, the opportunities for the study of social networks in state politics are particularly important and plentiful. The comparative study of networks is an underdeveloped area of research, and the increasing accessibility of political networks data at the U.S. state level makes the area ripe for real theoretical development and testing. For example, networks need not be only constructed from cosponsorship data. Roll call votes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1532440012473842">Shor and McCarty 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1532440012473842">Wright and Schaffner 2002</xref>), common committee assignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1532440012473842">Porter et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532440012473842">2007</xref>), seat locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532440012473842">Masket 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532440012473842">Peoples 2008</xref>), and interest group donations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532440012473842">Bonica 2012</xref>) represent a variety of ways to construct a social network for state legislatures that would allow for testing of hypotheses across legislative settings. In addition, any statistical construct that can be built into a similarity matrix would be amenable to a host of network analyses. Since network statistics are built from square matrices where edges represent less distance between the actors, this technique could be fruitfully applied in areas like policy diffusion across states, migration patterns across the country, and the similarity of state party platforms to name only a few. In short, the opportunities for important social network analysis in state politics are many, and having proper measures of uncertainty for those networks is critical.</p>

<title>Measuring Partition Quality with Network Modularity</title>
<p>Community detection is the act of partitioning or dividing a social network into distinct subgroups. Community detection algorithms attempt to partition networks so that there are dense connections between all the actors in a subgroup (or <italic>community</italic>) and sparse connections between actors of different subgroups. A community is then the set of actors within a single group in an optimal partition of the network with the implied assumption that something unique about that group of actors caused their within-group cohesion and has set them apart from the other groups. Scholars have developed a variety of approaches to discovering communities in an observed network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532440012473842">Newman 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532440012473842">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1532440012473842">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532440012473842">Newman and Girvan 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532440012473842">Pons and Latapy 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532440012473842">Raghavan, Albert, and Kumara 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532440012473842">Reichardt and Bornholdt 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1532440012473842">1</xref></sup> Most, if not all, community detection routines rely on quality statistics to assert which potential network partition is the best and thus represents the “true” community structure.</p>
<p>To measure the quality of network partitions, scholars of social networks typically use the popular quality statistic modularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1532440012473842">Newman 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532440012473842">Newman and Girvan 2004</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1532440012473842">2</xref></sup> Modularity is usually defined as the number of ties within a group compared with the number of ties that might be expected at random.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1532440012473842">3</xref></sup> With the most common definition of “at random” in place, this simplifies to a measure of the number of ties within a group relative to the number of ties between any two other actors in the network. The mathematical formula for network modularity using the industry standard definition is as follows:</p>

<p>where <italic>m</italic> is the total number of connections in the network, <italic>A<sub>ij</sub></italic> is the connection between actors <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j, k<sub>i</sub></italic> is the total number of connections actor <italic>i</italic> has (the degree of actor <italic>i</italic>), and δ(<italic>c<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>j</sub></italic>) is the Kroneker delta for communities of actors <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1532440012473842">4</xref></sup> Thus, modularity examines all the actors in the same community δ(<italic>c<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>j</sub></italic>), adds up their connections with one another (<italic>A<sub>ij</sub></italic>), and subtracts the connections we might expect those actors to have in the network generally (<italic>k<sub>i</sub>k<sub>j</sub></italic>/2<italic>m</italic>). Finally, the sum of all these components is normalized by the total number of connections in the network (1/2<italic>m</italic>). In networks with edge weights, where connections between actors take on more than a zero or a one, the calculation is very similar. In these weighted networks, <italic>A<sub>ij</sub></italic> becomes the connection strength between <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j, m</italic> becomes the sum of all the edge weights in the network, and <italic>k<sub>i</sub></italic> becomes the total weighted connections of actor <italic>i</italic>. Because the modularity score can work in both unweighted and weighted networks, it is a useful tool for examining partitions of any square matrix (i.e., similarity matrices for roll calls, funding flows, policy scores, migration patterns, etc.).</p>
<p>Modularity values range between −1 and 1. A value of 1 occurs when no ties cross community lines and all the ties within a community are realized. A value of −1 occurs when no ties within a community are realized and all the possible ties across communities occur. It is possible for modularity to take on a value of precisely zero, which occurs when all the ties in a network are realized.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1532440012473842">5</xref></sup> However, as I will demonstrate in the next section, finite samples and stochastic social behaviors can generate nonzero modularity values even in networks where no real community structure exists.</p>

<title>Simulating a Reference Distribution for Comparison</title>
<p>While the point estimate of modularity is derived relative to some null model, the modularity score itself communicates nothing about the distribution of modularity under that null model. To provide a sense of the degree to which an observed modularity score reflects something unusual for a given network, analysts require some sense of the baseline level of modularity that might be observed at random in that network. By generating a reference distribution for modularity in a given network, scholars can develop a better sense of the degree to which a division partitions the network unusually well. A useful avenue for generating reference distributions for modularity is permutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532440012473842">Edgington and Onghena 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532440012473842">Erikson, Pinto, and Rader 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532440012473842">O’Gorman 2005</xref>). Using permutations of actors’ attributes that could potentially divide a network, an analyst can simulate a random distribution of modularity for a particular social network and a particular attribute.</p>
<p>The permutation test works as follows: First, an analyst measures a network and either through theoretical insight or community discovery develops a partition of interest for the network. That partition of interest provides a modularity score, but the analyst would like to know whether that modularity score is better than one might expect at random (implying that the partition is better than one might expect at random). The analyst then takes the community memberships defined by the partition and rearranges them among the actors, maintaining the size of groups, but randomly assigning each actor to a community. This new partition with randomly assigned community memberships also produces a modularity score. This random assignment to communities is done hundreds (or perhaps thousands) of times, and a distribution of modularity scores emerges.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1532440012473842">6</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532440012473842">Table 1</xref> provides an example of a partition and its implied membership permutations.</p>

<p>The permutation approach to generating reference distributions scrambles the comemberships while maintaining observed group sizes and all the measured connections in the network.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1532440012473842">7</xref></sup> Thus, the permutation approach is operating on the δ(<italic>c<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>j</sub></italic>) of the initial modularity equation. This means the summation is including randomly chosen actors but maintaining the size of the groups the summation adds up. None of the other elements in the modularity equation are disturbed. The range of modularity values generated by the permuted membership vectors allows an analyst to observe the nonzero modularity values that a random membership vector might generate and compare the observed modularity to this range.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1532440012473842">8</xref></sup></p>

<title>A Simulation for Modularity and the Permutation Reference Distribution</title>
<p>A simple test of the approach I outline might ask the following: (1) “Does modularity increase as connections within groups strengthens?” and (2) “Can the permutation reference distribution identify when nonzero modularity is due to chance?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1532440012473842">9</xref></sup> To answer these questions, I simulate networks with varying in-group connection strengths, and assess modularity and its reference distribution. First, some <italic>n</italic> set of actors are randomly assigned to <italic>g</italic> groups. Then, I generate a network of connections between the actors. Actors not in the same group have some baseline rate of connection, α, and actors in the same group have some increased rate of connection, α, plus a bonus value, β. I then draw a single observation from a Poisson distribution using the rate of connection between two actors as the λ parameter for the dyad. This generates a network of count connections between actors where actors in the same group are likely to have higher connection levels compared with actors not in the same group. This mimics the probabilistic nature of network formation in networks with some true community structure and some random noise.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1532440012473842">10</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1532440012473842">Figure 1</xref> provides a graphical representation of this process in a network of six actors in two groups of three.</p>

<p>Once I have simulated a network based on group membership, I measure the group modularity of the count network for the initial group assignments and the reference distribution of group modularity using 1,000 permutations of the group assignments. This represents one iteration of the simulation. I perform 500 iterations of this procedure for some fixed bonus value. Next, I increase the bonus value providing actors in the same groups with a higher rate parameter and thus an increased likelihood of a large connection. I have two expectations for these simulations. First, as the bonus value for within-group connection strength increases, the group modularity score should also increase. This would indicate that modularity is doing its job well measuring higher quality partitions when group membership is a stronger determinant of network behavior. Second, when the bonus value of within-group membership is zero, the observed modularity score will be contained within the reference distribution of modularity generated through the permutation of group membership. When the within-group bonus value is zero, the probabilistic translation of group membership into network behavior may produce nonzero modularity scores. The reference distribution of modularity that I generate will indicate when the observed modularity score is a result of effective network divisions and when the modularity score is a result of the stochastic nature of social behaviors. Throughout the simulations of the permutation region, I will use 95% of the permutation region as the reference against which to compare an observed modularity score. This can easily be adapted to 99% or 90% reference regions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1532440012473842">Figure 2</xref> presents results from a simulation using 50 actors randomly assigned to three groups. The baseline rate of connection α is 1, and the bonus value for two actors being in the same group varies from 0.5 to 3.0. Thus, the λ parameter passed to the Poisson distribution varies between 1 and 4. To give these numbers some magnitude, the average connection strength between actors not of the same group across all the simulations is 0.98. The average strength of connection for actors in the same group when the bonus value is 0.5 is 1.475. The average connection strength for members of the same group when the bonus value is 3.0 is 4.005. An α of 1 was selected to minimize the odds of the simulated networks containing actors completely unconnected from the remainder of the network. These isolated actors present unique challenges in community detection since there is no way to evaluate whether they belong to <italic>any</italic> potential community. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1532440012473842">Figure 2</xref> nicely reflects the expectation that as within-group connections become more distinct from out-of-group connections, modularity indicates a higher quality partition of the network. Thus, modularity is performing its designated task well. In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1532440012473842">Figure 2</xref> also indicates that for all the positive bonus values of within-group connections, modularity never overlaps with the reference distributions I generate. When an attribute is a true division of a network, modularity will reveal its quality and the reference distribution will not cause scholars to question it. In traditional hypothesis testing language, this implies that the test is extremely powerful and that the probability of Type II errors is low.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1532440012473842">Figure 3</xref> presents the same results at a much closer level and includes the results for modularity scores and the reference distribution of modularity when the within-group bonus value equals zero. When this value equals zero, the rate of connection within groups is the same as the rate of connection between groups. In this circumstance, I expect that modularity will generate nonzero values due to the stochastic generation of the network (although they should remain close to zero). These nonzero modularity scores should frequently overlap with the reference distribution of modularity, indicating that while modularity may be nonzero, it is no different from a modularity score expected at random. This would indicate that the size of the test is small and the probability of Type I errors (false positives) is low.</p>

</fig>
<p>This is precisely what I observe in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1532440012473842">Figure 3</xref>. When the within-group bonus value is zero, the reference distribution of modularity covers 95.1% of the nonzero modularity scores that the probabilistic networks generated. As the in-group bonus value increases from zero, the distance between the reference distribution of modularity and the observed modularity score increases. Modularity will appear less like a draw from a random distribution the more an attribute divides the relevant network well. Thus, this permutation approach to assessing uncertainty in modularity scores is valuable in discovering when modularity might not just be large or small, but when modularity might be larger or smaller than expected at random.</p>

<p>The first term of the equation is 1/2<italic>m</italic>, where m represents the number of connections of the social network of interest. As <italic>m</italic> approaches its maximum, this normalizing fraction becomes an increasingly smaller number. Regardless of what is added together by the summation, it will be multiplied by an increasingly small quantity as the network becomes denser. Thus, as network density increases, the resultant modularity reference distribution should collapse toward zero.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1532440012473842">Figure 4</xref> provides the results from a simulation testing this hypothesis. In the simulations, there are 50 actors assigned to two groups with equal probability. The connections between the actors are governed by a Poisson distribution with a baseline rate of connection, α, and some group bonus value, β. In these simulations β = 0, but α varies from −.5 to 1.0 in increments of .5 with 500 simulations for each value of α. When α is low, the network is extremely sparse. When α is higher, the network has a greater number of connections. Therefore, in these simulations, there is no real community structure, and I fix the probability of comembership at .5. The number of connections in the network is all that is changing. The gray dots in the figure represent the upper and lower 95% reference distribution limits from each simulation. The gray area represents a smoothed polygon among these dots. The figure confirms the expectation that as the density of the network increases, the modularity reference distribution shrinks. Thus, modularity values in sparse networks face a more difficult test to be distinguished from randomly drawn partitions of the network than do modularity values in networks with more connections.</p>

</inline-formula> the third term of the equation. Summed across all potential <italic>ij</italic> combinations, this value is equivalent to the probability that any two actors from the network chosen at random will be in the same category or community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1532440012473842">11</xref></sup> This value can vary from a minimum of 1/number of hypothesized groups to 1. As this value increases and the probability of two actors being in the same community increases, the possible permutations of the membership vector contain less new information being added to the reference distribution. In other words, there is less possible variance in the permutations of the membership vector as the probability of comembership goes up. Because there is less variance in the possible permutations of the membership vector, there should also be less variance in the resultant reference distribution.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesized relationship, I have again constructed simulated networks of 50 actors in two groups. There is no in-group bonus in the network, so connections between actors in the same community are equally as strong as relationships between actors in different communities. However, rather than leaving the probability of assignment to Group 1 and Group 2 equal, I vary that probability. I change the probability of actor assignment to Group 1 from .5 up to .8 in increments of .1 with 500 simulations for each probability value. Thus, the size of Group 1 relative to Group 2 is increasing across the simulations, and the probability of comembership in the same community is also increasing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1532440012473842">12</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1532440012473842">Figure 5</xref> plots the results of this simulation. The simulation reveals that as the probability of Group 1 assignment increases (increasing the size of Group 1 relative to Group 2), the reference distribution for modularity shrinks. This is in spite of the fact that there is no difference in the strength of relationship within groups versus across groups. I also hold network density constant across the simulations. Thus, the relative sizes of the hypothesized communities in the community structure of a network influence the variance of the reference distribution for network modularity. A highly modular network with one large community and other smaller communities is more unexpected than a highly modular network in which the community sizes are relatively equal.</p>

</inline-formula> This is the element of the equation that balances the strength of connections between actors against the randomly expected strength of connection. The discounting term, <italic>k<sub>i</sub>k<sub>j</sub></italic>/2<italic>m</italic>, is the standard way of expressing the expected level of connection between the two considered actors and any randomly chosen partners in the network, but other discounts could be used also. As an example, an alternative might be the sum of connections over the total number of actors in the network. The choice of the proper discount/expected connection strength is generally considered a theoretical choice based on the network under study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1532440012473842">Porter, Onnela, and Mucha 2009</xref>). Thus, the first and third terms of the modularity equation influence the variance of the subsequent permutation distribution for modularity, while the middle term structures the actual point estimate of a modularity score itself.</p>
<p>The size of the reference distribution is influenced by the probability of comembership for two actors and the number of connections in the network. The location of the reference distribution, which is also the null hypothesis against which the modularity score is being tested, is not structured by a single element in the modularity equation. Specifying the null hypothesis against which the observed modularity score is tested is the same as asking what modularity score might be expected at random from a given network. This treats the network as fixed and asks what the expected value of modularity from that fixed network might be. As such, I can take the expected values of each part of the equation and simplify the modularity calculation to arrive at an answer. To begin, I simplify the modularity equation to reflect the terms of the equation as they would be expected to be across all possible membership vectors.</p>

<title>An Example from State Legislatures</title>
<p>To provide a practical example from applied research, I use modularity and its reference distribution to determine the degree to which party structures the collaborative activities between legislators in U.S. lower state legislative chambers. Political parties have long been noted to structure the individual behavior of legislators in office, and research on the patterns of legislative interaction has also demonstrated that the relationships between legislators can largely be predicted by political party affiliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532440012473842">Caldeira and Patterson 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532440012473842">1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532440012473842">Clark, Caldeira, and Patterson 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1532440012473842">Sarbaugh-Thompson et al. 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1532440012473842">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>To determine the power of party in structuring collaborative activity, I use a unique data set of cosponsorship networks between state legislators in lower chambers for the year 2007. An edge exists between two legislators <italic>ij</italic> if legislator <italic>i</italic> has cosponsored a bill sponsored by legislator <italic>j</italic>. I measure cosponsor–sponsor connections for every bill introduced in the calendar year of 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532440012473842">Fowler 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532440012473842">2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532440012473842">Kirkland 2011</xref>). No resolutions are considered. This results in 48 social networks comprising counts of cosponsorship between legislators.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1532440012473842">15</xref></sup> I then record the political party affiliation of each legislator in the chamber. Using the modularity function from the <italic>igraph</italic> package in the R statistical language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532440012473842">Csardi and Nepusz 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1532440012473842">R Core Development Team 2008</xref>), I assess the quality of political party as a division of the cosponsorship network along with the null distribution of modularity that results from permutations of the party affiliation vector.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1532440012473842">Figure 7</xref> presents the results of measuring party modularity for the lower state legislative chambers. Each point represents the actual modularity measurement for party in a particular state’s lower legislative chamber cosponsorship network. The gray bar represents the 95% and 99% reference distribution of modularity for the state’s cosponsorship network generated by 1,000 permutations of the party membership vector. Notice Hawaii’s and Oklahoma’s measurements in the left-hand area of the plot. Ignoring the null distributions momentarily, an analyst encountering these two results would be reasonable in assuming two things: (1) Oklahoma’s legislative network appears to have a larger party modularity score and therefore (2) Oklahoma’s legislative network is <italic>more</italic> structured by party than the Hawaii’s legislative network is.</p>

<p>The empirical evidence warrants the first of those two statements. The party modularity score for the Oklahoma legislative network is larger than the party modularity score for the Hawaii legislative network. However, the second of those two statements represents an incorrect inference. Using the reference distributions of modularity for each state’s cosponsorship network, this analysis indicates that party structures the Hawaii cosponsorship network. The party modularity score for the Hawaii legislative network falls just outside the range of modularity scores for randomly drawn divisions of the network of the same size. The Oklahoma cosponsorship network is no more structured by party than it would be by a random division of the social network.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Summary statistics are critical ways for researchers to measure and express the structure of a social network, but the complexities of network analysis make hypothesis tests for such statistics difficult. Computational, nonparametric approaches provide a powerful way to measure the uncertainty surrounding any given summary statistic from a social network and to test that statistic against a reference distribution generated directly from the data. I have demonstrated one such test for a popular network summary statistic—network modularity. Nonparametric hypothesis testing provides an easily interpretable test for the hypothesis that a particular network behavior is more structured than might be expected at random with the added benefit of a freedom from many statistical assumptions that come with using known probability distributions as references for comparison. Thus, the permutation tests I advocate, and nonparametric approaches more generally, represent important tools for network scholars seeking to explore and compare social networks.</p>
<p>I have also provided an example of network modularity and its attendant reference distribution from cosponsorship networks in the lower chambers of U.S. legislatures. Network modularity provides an intuitive way to capture how partisan the collaborative networks of legislatures are. The least partisan legislature seems to be North Carolina, although many other chambers are no more structured by party than they would be by random chance. The most partisan chamber seems to be Iowa’s lower chamber. Iowa’s and Virginia’s lower chambers appear to be quite a bit more partisan than the other legislative chambers. The avenues for the use of network techniques, and in particular, the comparison and analysis of network summaries are plentiful in state politics research. Modularity is just one interesting feature of social networks. Concepts like reciprocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532440012473842">Martorano 2004</xref>) and popularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532440012473842">Caldeira and Patterson 1988</xref>) in state legislatures, hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1532440012473842">Mintrom and Vergari 1998</xref>) and diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532440012473842">Balla 2001</xref>) in state policy networks, and homophily in migration patterns between U.S. states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532440012473842">McDonald 2011</xref>) are all concepts of interest to state politics research as well as concepts that can be tapped and evaluated using network summary statistics. Questions about economic or policy interactions between states, lobbying and campaign networks within and across states, and institutional effects on social capital and the structure of political discussion networks are all at the heart of state politics research and would be amenable to analyses like those conducted in this article. Shedding light on the networks within and across states, and understanding how institutions and cultures shape those networks would represent an important step forward both theoretically and empirically for state politics scholars.</p>

<p>The <italic>igraph</italic> package for social network analysis has six different algorithms for community detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532440012473842">Csardi and Nepusz 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>The initial article debuting modularity by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532440012473842">Newman and Girvan (2004)</xref> has more than 2,100 citations as of 2011.</p>

<p>The precise definition of what “at random” means can vary a bit depending on the questions in which an analyst is interested. It is generally considered to be the number of connections (called edges) within groups if a network with the same communities had the same number of edges placed between dyads randomly.</p>

<p>Kroneker’s delta is a mathematical operation that returns a value of 1 if the two numbers within the operation are equal to one another and zero otherwise.</p>

<p>Thus, all the ties within communities and across communities occur. This means that modularity is <italic>not</italic> a true probability distribution. Technically, it is a discrete measure that can only take on a finite number of values because there are only a finite number of possible community structures in any particular network.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-1532440012473842">
<label>6.</label>
<p>Technically, the permutation approach does not develop a continuous reference distribution. Because there are only a fixed number of permutations for any vector, there are also only a fixed number of possible modularity reference values. However, for any network of at least 40 actors, there are more than 100,000,000 possible permutations of two different communities with 20 actors in each.</p>
</fn>

<p>In my discussions, I work with a community structure of two groups, but community structures can contain many more than two groups. Permutations scramble the comemberships by relabeling the memberships of the actors.</p>

<p>Thus, the null hypothesis against which a modularity estimate is being tested is <inline-formula id="inline-formula4-1532440012473842">

<p>The question of whether modularity does the task it is designed for has been answered before but is a useful verification step and helpful for introducing modularity to those unfamiliar with the statistic.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn10-1532440012473842">
<label>10.</label>
<p>This is the same process used to test the “fast greedy” algorithm by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532440012473842">Newman and Girvan (2004)</xref>, but with count edges instead of binary edges.</p>

<p>For example, the probability that two legislators are of the same party is equivalent to asking what is the probability that <italic>i</italic> = <italic>Democrat</italic> and <italic>j</italic> = <italic>Democrat</italic> or <italic>i</italic> = <italic>Republican</italic> and <italic>j</italic> = <italic>Republican</italic>. The probability that any actor selected at random is a Democrat or Republican is simply the size of these groups divided by the network’s size. The joint probability that both <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> are Democrats is the product of the individual probabilities, or (number of Democrats/network size)<sup>2</sup>. Thus, the probability of any two actors randomly chosen from the cosponsorship network being of the same party is given by (number of Democrats/network size)<sup>2</sup> + (number of Republicans/network size)<sup>2</sup>.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn12-1532440012473842">

<p>The probability of two randomly chosen actors being in the same group when the probability of being assigned to Group 1 is .5 is also .5. The probability of comembership when the probability of Group 1 assignment is .6 is .52. When the probability of assignment to Group 1 is .7, comembership has a probability of .58, and finally, when the probability of assignment to Group 1 is .8, comembership has a probability of .68.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn13-1532440012473842">
<label>13.</label>
<p>It is twice the number of total number of connections because each connection in the network adds a connection for two actors, the sender and the receiver. Thus, each connection in the network increases the degree of two actors by one.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn14-1532440012473842">

<p>While clearly an impressive and important study, one criticism of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1532440012473842">Shor and McCarty’s (2011)</xref> ideological scaling project involving state legislatures is an inability to engage in hypothesis testing with the scaled results. Without standard errors, understanding when chambers are more distant than one another than might be expected due to chance, or simply more partisan than might be expected due to random chance, is difficult. Using modularity and my permutation test can overcome some of these shortcomings.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn15-1532440012473842">

<p>Nebraska is unicameral. Scholars typically treat its lone chamber as a Senate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1532440012473842">Wright and Schaffner 2002</xref>). It is also nonpartisan, meaning it can have no party modularity score. In addition, the Idaho legislature did not actually record cosponsorships until 2009. Although I have obtained that data to complete the data set, for comparability reasons, I do not present them here.</p>
