<p>The intersection of neuroscience and the study of language has produced the interdisciplinary field of neurolinguistics, which examines the language system as a biological system. <italic>Talking Heads: The Neuroscience of Language</italic> by Gianfranco Denes, Universities of Padua and Venice, seeks to summarize recent scholarship in this area. This book is best suited for linguists, experimental psychologists, neuropsychologists, and neuroscientists; but scholars of any discipline who are interested in language production and comprehension will find this book interesting.</p>
<p>Advocating a biolinguistic approach, Denes asks two central questions. Does the human language system represent the end point of a complex adaptation that evolved through natural selection present in other animal species? Or, is the human language system a species-specific ability distinct from other forms of animal communication?</p>
<p>To answer these questions, Denes summarizes scholarship designed to examine aphasic symptoms, which he describes as “window that permits the nature of the deficit to be revealed, as well as the functional and anatomical organization of language processes” (p. xii). Later, he describes aphasic patients as experiments of nature. Denes claims that the emergence of neuroimaging methods moved the study of these questions from anatomo-clinical observations to observations of living subjects. These technological advancements has made it “possible to identify, sometimes with surprising accuracy, the specific neural circuits dedicated to the elaboration of the lexical, semantic morphosyntactic and phonological aspects of language, which unite to constitute a sentence” (p. xii). As a migraineur, I experience aphasia at the onset of the migraine, which is a signal that severe pain will follow. So, I am curious about aphasia in my personal life and about the production of language in my professional life as a communication scholar.</p>
<p>In the first chapter, Denes reviews the variety of positions and differences that would allow us to answer the two primary questions raised above, admitting that these questions cannot be currently resolved. In Chapter 2, Denes reviews the scholarly history (and scholarly interest) in the evolution of language. He draws this short chapter to conclusion by arguing that there is (now more) “certainty regarding results of genetic analysis that places the emergence of [articulated] language between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago, a period that coincides with the genetic mutation that distinguished man [sic] from chimpanzee.”</p>
<p>Chapter 3, “The Anatomy of Language,” provides a useful summary of the material before it. In this chapter, Denes explores the anatomo-clinical method and the presence of lesions and the work of Wernicke and others who studied language production as a result of different types of aphasia. This history serves to set up what Denes describes as a “new anatomy of language” that has resulted from sophisticated bioimaging instruments used both in clinical practice and research. Denes provides good summaries of the different technologies and what they reveal about the language producing functions of our brains. This chapter concludes with explorations of cognitive neuropsychology, cognitive models of language processing, and connectionist modeling of language processing. It then turns abruptly to humans’ cerebral functional asymmetry. This chapter tries to do too much, and the less sophisticated reader will likely have trouble making the links between its various sections.</p>
<p>The next seven chapters, or the majority of the book, focus on aphasia, its types, and the remaining mysteries. Like most people who suffer a medical malady, I underestimated these differences and their resulting influences on language production. Although interesting, these chapters provided me (a communication scholar) more detail than I needed. I expect, however, that the review of the clinical and experimental research in these chapters would be useful to those with more sophisticated understanding of aphasia and its influence on language production. Denes’s last short chapter reviews developmental language disorders.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the book ends abruptly here without a chapter to pull together the previous ones and without Denes addressing the two questions he posed in the beginning. Admittedly, Denes indicates in the beginning of the book that the questions cannot be answered, but to not come back to these questions in any form left the impression that the chapters could stand alone. I felt cheated not to have the conversation come full circle. The back matter of the book is devoted to an appendix of neuroanatomy (helpful to me), a very limited glossary, and an index. This book may be a useful reference for those situated more directly in the field of neurolinguistics but will not likely satisfy a general reader’s curiosity about the field.</p>

<p><bold>Joann Keyton</bold> (PhD, The Ohio State University, 1987) is Professor of Communication at North Carolina State University. Her current research examines the collaborative processes and relational aspects of interdisciplinary teams, participants’ use of language in team meetings, the multiplicity of cultures in organizations, and how messages are manipulated in sexual harassment. She was recently honored with the 2011 Gerald Phillips Award for Distinguished Applied Communication Scholarship by the National Communication Association.</p>
