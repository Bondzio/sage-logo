<abstract>
<p>Pen-based oral fluid sampling has proven to be an efficient method for surveillance of infectious diseases in swine populations. To better interpret diagnostic results, the performance of oral fluid assays (antibody- and nucleic acid-based) must be established for pen-based oral fluid samples. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to determine the probability of detecting <italic>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus</italic> (PRRSV) infection in pen-based oral fluid samples from pens of known PRRSV prevalence. In 1 commercial swine barn, 25 pens were assigned to 1 of 5 levels of PRRSV prevalence (0%, 4%, 12%, 20%, or 36%) by placing a fixed number (0, 1, 3, 5, or 9) of PRRSV-positive pigs (14 days post PRRSV modified live virus vaccination) in each pen. Prior to placement of the vaccinated pigs, 1 oral fluid sample was collected from each pen. Thereafter, 5 oral fluid samples were collected from each pen, for a total of 150 samples. To confirm individual pig PRRSV status, serum samples from the PRRSV-negative pigs (<italic>n</italic> = 535) and the PRRSV vaccinated pigs (<italic>n</italic> = 90) were tested for PRRSV antibodies and PRRSV RNA. The 150 pen-based oral fluid samples were assayed for PRRSV antibody and PRRSV RNA at 6 laboratories. Among the 100 samples from pens containing ≥1 positive pig (≥4% prevalence) and tested at the 6 laboratories, the mean positivity was 62% for PRRSV RNA and 61% for PRRSV antibody. These results support the use of pen-based oral fluid sampling for PRRSV surveillance in commercial pig populations.</p>

<p>Surveillance for infectious diseases in swine populations is a key component in the prevention and/or control of clinical losses, but is often limited by the cost and inconvenience of collecting individual pig samples. Under both experimental and field conditions, oral fluid samples have proven to be effective for the detection of a variety of pathogens (e.g., <italic>Influenza A virus, Porcine circovirus-2</italic>, and <italic>Porcine reproductive and respiratory virus</italic> [PRRSV]).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1040638713481471">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1040638713481471">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1040638713481471">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1040638713481471"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1040638713481471"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1040638713481471">12</xref></sup> Oral fluid sampling is possible because it is well matched with inherent pig behavior. Exploration is part of porcine normal behavior, and pigs instinctively test new objects by chewing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1040638713481471">8</xref></sup> Animal behaviorists report that pigs prefer flexible, destructible, chewable objects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1040638713481471">2</xref></sup> (i.e., adjectives that aptly describe rope; Zonderland J, Vermeer M, Ter Avest A, et al.: 2001, Measuring a pig’s preference for suspended toys by using an automated recording technique. <italic>In</italic>: Proceedings of the International Symposium of the C.I.G.R. Animal Welfare Considerations in Livestock Housing Systems, 2nd Technical Section, pp. 147–156. Szlarska Poreba, Poland, October 23–25). These behavioral imperatives operate even during acute infection, hence sample collection success rates remain unchanged during acute infection with PRRSV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1040638713481471">5</xref></sup> and <italic>Influenza A virus</italic> (Millman S, Brooks R Jr, Zimmerman J, et al.: 2009, Role of behavior in non-invasive disease surveillance of swine influenza virus. J Anim Sci 87:E-Suppl:ii).</p>
<p>Options for PRRSV surveillance using oral fluid specimens include real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) for the detection of nucleic acids and antibody detection assays.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1040638713481471">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1040638713481471"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1040638713481471">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1040638713481471">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1040638713481471"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1040638713481471"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1040638713481471">12</xref></sup> While PCR-based assays are useful for detecting the immediate circulation of pathogens, antibody-based assays are informative regarding herd immunity and the history of an infection in the population. Because both assays reflect different phases of infection, the best test can be selected to serve the need. Although both approaches are considered diagnostically sensitive and specific, to the authors’ knowledge, test performance using oral fluid samples collected at the pen level has not been reported. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to determine the probability of detecting PRRSV or anti-PRRSV antibody in pen-based oral fluid samples from pens of known PRRSV prevalence.</p>

<p>On January 3, a separate group of PRRSV-negative nursery age pigs (<italic>n</italic> = 535) from Oklahoma was transported to the Iowa site and placed in the study barn. On January 4, these pigs were sorted into the 25 study pens, after which 1 oral fluid sample was collected from each pen (negative control samples). On the morning of January 5, serum samples were collected from the 535 Oklahoma pigs in the 25 pens for the purpose of authenticating their individual PRRSV status.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of January 5, the 90 PRRSV-vaccinated Missouri pigs were moved to the study barn and placed in each pen. The number of pigs sorted into each pen was determined by the PRRSV prevalence randomly assigned<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1040638713481471">a</xref></sup> to the pen (i.e., 0%, 4%, 12%, 20%, or 36%). That is, PRRSV prevalence was established by placing a fixed number (0, 1, 3, 5, or 9) of viremic and/or antibody-positive pigs in pens such that the combination of negatives and positives in each pen totaled 25 pigs.</p>
<p>On the morning of January 6 (i.e., 14 days postvaccination), 5 successive pen-based oral fluid samples (30-min sampling) were collected from each pen. After the fifth oral fluid sampling, serum samples were collected from each of the 90 PRRSV-vaccinated<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1040638713481471">c</xref></sup> pigs to establish the PRRSV status of all vaccinated pigs.</p>

The ANOVA model was a mixed model using both pen and pig as random effects. All laboratories used the same PRRSV antibody ELISA protocol and cutoff (S/P value ≥ 0.40). The ELISA S/P values were log-transformed to meet the criterion of normal distribution prior to quantitative analyses. The PRRSV real-time RT-PCR protocols varied among laboratories, as did threshold cycle cutoffs. Qualitative analyses were based on cutoffs established by each laboratory.

<p>The PRRSV ELISA testing of serum samples (<italic>n</italic> = 535) from the expected PRRSV-negative Oklahoma pigs produced 1 positive specimen at each of the 2 laboratories testing these samples. This sample was ELISA positive on retest. All ELISA results from this pen were omitted from the ELISA analyses because the response in the unexpected PRRSV-positive pig could not be accounted for. The PRRSV real-time RT-PCR of pooled serum (<italic>n</italic> = 107) from these animals was negative at the 2 laboratories performing the assays.</p>

Analyses of vaccinated pig serum testing results showed statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05) variation in qualitative PRRSV real-time RT-PCR results among laboratories, but not qualitative ELISA results. Quantitative results from both assays showed significant differences (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05) among laboratories. Three vaccinated pigs were PRRSV antibody ELISA negative at the 6 laboratories testing these samples; 1 of these 3 pigs also tested PRRSV real-time RT-PCR negative at 6 laboratories.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A continuous flow of accurate, real-time disease information is needed to support animal health decisions in commercial swine populations, improve the quality of field research, and provide timely information on endemic and foreign animal diseases in the national swine herd. Historically, the primary roadblock to this goal has been the expense of collecting and testing statistically appropriate numbers of blood, feces, or nasal swab specimens from individual pigs. In contrast, collecting oral fluid specimens requires less labor, is stress free for both animals and human beings, and is a sensitive method for detecting infections in populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1040638713481471">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1040638713481471">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1040638713481471"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1040638713481471"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1040638713481471">12</xref></sup> For these reasons, oral fluid sampling has been rapidly adopted by producers and veterinarians and has become routine on many farms. At the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (Ames, IA), the specimen type “swine oral fluid” was entered into the laboratory information management system in February 2010. Thereafter, 10,329 oral fluid specimens were received for testing in 2010 and 32,517 in 2011, and &gt;58,000 are expected in 2012.</p>
<p>The first oral fluid–based antibody ELISA for swine, the PRRSV oral fluid Ig ELISA, was described in 2012.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1040638713481471">6</xref></sup> Prior to this, the majority of swine oral fluid specimens were tested by PCR because antibody assays for pathogens of swine had not been adapted to the oral fluid matrix. The use of oral fluid PCRs was supported by research demonstrating their application to the oral fluid matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638713481471">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1040638713481471">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1040638713481471">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1040638713481471"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1040638713481471"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1040638713481471">12</xref></sup> Routine implementation of the PRRSV oral fluid Ig ELISA test in diagnostic laboratories was supported by extensive assessment of assay performance. Specifically, an interlaboratory study of the ELISA using 276 oral fluid samples found 97.5% agreement among 12 participating laboratories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1040638713481471">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Regardless of the analytical methodology, analyte detection using pen-based oral fluid differs most significantly from individual animal sampling in that pen-based oral fluid specimens are composed of the “voluntary” contributions of individual pigs. Logically, diagnostic results are affected both by the infection status of the individuals in the pen and their interaction with the sampling device. The intent of the present study was to begin to explore the dynamics of PRRSV detection using pen-based oral fluid samples as a function of within-pen prevalence. It was not the intent of this study to compare interlaboratory performance or testing protocols; rather, testing at multiple laboratories assured realistic and robust estimates.</p>
<p>While the results showed that testing pen-based oral fluid samples greatly improved detection over single-animal testing, it should be recognized that the estimates were more conservative than would be expected under typical field conditions for the following reasons: 1) PRRSV modified live vaccine produces a lower level of viremia and lower antibody response than infection with wild-type PRRSV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1040638713481471">3</xref></sup>; 2) recent mixing of vaccinated and unvaccinated pigs, while necessary to precisely establish within-pen prevalence in the current study, is known to disrupt social order and normal pig behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1040638713481471">13</xref></sup> (e.g., interaction with the rope sampling device); and 3) although testing results varied considerably among laboratories, all results were included in the analyses.</p>
<p>Cumulatively, the research indicates that oral fluids are an effective method to surveil for PRRSV and other swine pathogens in swine populations. Like any infant technology, the full implementation of oral fluid diagnostics faces challenges. The most obvious of these is the lack of a full complement of assays designed to function with oral fluids. In particular, validated assays for oral fluids would be welcome because of the promise of cheaper, but more effective, surveillance for diseases of major significance (e.g., <italic>Classical swine fever virus, African swine fever virus</italic>, and others). In addition, as surveillance moves away from individual animal testing, pen-based sample size and sample frequency algorithms will be needed to effectively and efficiently implement surveillance for endemic and exotic infectious agents. Seen in this context, the present study represents the beginning of establishing a statistically sound rationale for using and interpreting pen-based oral fluid diagnostic results.</p>
