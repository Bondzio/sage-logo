<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between the team and unit size and level of nursing teamwork. The sample for the study was 2,265 direct care nursing providers from 53 units in four hospitals. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to determine if five variables to measure unit size (average daily census, number of registered nurses, number of nursing assistants [NAs], and number of total staff) correlated with teamwork overall and with five teamwork subscales (trust, team orientation, backup, shared mental model, and leadership). A significant negative correlation was found between nursing teamwork overall and the number of NAs, and average daily census. To optimize nursing unit teamwork, consideration needs to be given to strategies to reduce the size of nursing teams.</p>

<p>Higher levels of teamwork in nursing result in a higher quality of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945912439107">Liedtka &amp; Whitten, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945912439107">Young et al., 1998</xref>), higher productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945912439107">Rondeau &amp; Wagar, 1998</xref>), greater job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193945912439107">Gifford, Zammuto, &amp; Goodman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945912439107">Kalisch, Lee, &amp; Rochman, 2010</xref>), fewer patient errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945912439107">Morey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193945912439107">Silen-Lipponen, Tossavainen, Turunen, &amp; Smith, 2005</xref>), and happier patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945912439107">Meterko, Mohr, &amp; Young, 2004</xref>). It is evident that efforts to improve nursing teamwork need to be a priority within the profession. As one of the important environmental factors, team size has been addressed. This study was designed to determine if the size of a nursing team influences nursing teamwork.</p>
<p>Teamwork is defined as two or more interdependent individuals with explicit role assignments who perform specific tasks, make decisions, and coordinate to achieve a common goal or outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945912439107">Kalisch, Weaver, &amp; Salas, 2009</xref>). There are several critical and essential behaviors: effective leadership, a team orientation, closed-looped communication, adaptability, trust, shared mental models, mutual performance monitoring, and back up of one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945912439107">Salas, Sims, &amp; Burke, 2005</xref>). The circumstances that cultivate these behaviors in teams need to be studied and understood if effective strategies to improve nursing teamwork are to be developed and implemented. Studies conducted in the fields of organizational engineering, business, and psychology all concur that there is an entwined network of factors that can either positively or negatively influence team behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945912439107">Guzzo &amp; Dickson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193945912439107">Sundstrom, DeMeuse, &amp; Futrell, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Team size is one of the more obvious environmental factors that may or may not foster teamwork. The average number of individuals in a team across industries and countries is 5 to 12 people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945912439107">Kalisch, Begeny, &amp; Anderson, 2008</xref>). For example, Professional Communications, Inc. has collected data on more than 2,000 teams from oil drilling to developing new medical devices over the past decade and has found that the most frequent size of teams is 9 people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945912439107">Kalisch et al., 2008</xref>). According to President Clinton’s National Performance Review, an average federal group size was 8 people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945912439107">Friel, 2001</xref>); the <italic>National Guard</italic> manual reported an average group size of about 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945912439107">U.S. Army Field Artillery Center, 2003</xref>). Yet nursing teams in acute care hospitals range from 20 to more than 150 nursing staff members.</p>
<p>Research to date on team size has been limited. Of the previous studies on teamwork and team size, there are conflicting conclusions. One study found a negligible correlation between size and team citizenship behavior, defined as selflessness, conscientiousness, and team mindedness among members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945912439107">Pearce &amp; Herbik, 2004</xref>). They investigated 71 change management teams at an automotive-industry firm and found that team leader behavior, team commitment, and perceived team support all had large effects on team citizenship behavior, whereas team size was insignificant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945912439107">Pearce &amp; Herbik, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>A scant number of studies have shown that a smaller team can negatively affect teamwork, making a case for larger teams. This was found to be due to smaller teams having higher perceptions of intergroup conflict and not feeling comfortable to constructively criticize one another given the intimacy of the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945912439107">Cox, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945912439107">Sharma &amp; Ghosh, 2007</xref>). In other words, in a small team, members feel as though the professional relationship blurs with the personal one given their close proximity.</p>
<p>Last, the majority of the research supports the conclusion that the smaller the team, the better the teamwork. This is due to the fact that larger teams have more linkages among members and, therefore, face greater coordination and communication challenges, are prone to motivation losses, and have greater difficulty developing and maintaining role structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945912439107">Hoegl, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193945912439107">LePine, Piccolo, Jackson, Mathieu, &amp; Saul, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193945912439107">Sundstrom et al., 1990</xref>). Members of larger teams were also found to be less satisfied and involved, increasing the potential for “social loafers” or nonparticipatory cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945912439107">Alexander, Lichtenstein, Jinnet, D’Aunno, &amp; Ullman, 1996</xref>; Guzzo, Salas, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945912439107">Associates, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945912439107">Hoegl, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945912439107">Keyton &amp; Beck, 2008</xref>). Specifically, it was found from reports of interdisciplinary teamwork at Veterans Affairs hospitals that components of team cooperation and team functioning were negatively affected when size increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945912439107">Guzzo et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945912439107">Stahelski &amp; Tsukuda, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, the majority of the literature favors the notion that a smaller team improves teamwork. However, the conflicting reports, although few in number, demonstrate the importance of studying the effects of team size further.</p>
<p>The conceptual framework for this study is based on a modification of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945912439107">Salas and colleagues’ (2005)</xref> conceptual framework explaining core components and coordinating functions of teamwork. The basis for this revision of Salas’ theory is on a study of nursing staff teamwork that yielded five of his eight elements, namely, (a) team orientation (cohesiveness and the group’s awareness of itself as a team), (b) team leadership (structure, direction, and support provided by the formal leader and on the part of team members), (c) backup (team members helping one another with their tasks and responsibilities), (d) shared mental models (collective mind-set), and (e) mutual trust (belief that team members will act in ways that promote the aims of the team; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945912439107">Kalisch, Lee, &amp; Salas, 2010</xref>; Salas et al).</p>
<sec id="section1-0193945912439107">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>By using the previously described variables to quantify nursing teamwork from the Nursing Teamwork Survey (NTS) scores, the following research questions were developed relative to the team and unit size variables:</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section2-0193945912439107" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This is a secondary analysis derived from a study of nursing teamwork in 2008 and 2009. The study used a descriptive, correlational design.</p>
<sec id="section3-0193945912439107">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The sample for this study was 2,265 nursing staff on 53 medical-surgical, intermediate, intensive care and rehabilitation units in four hospitals located in the Midwestern region of the United States. Nursing staff members included RNs, licensed practical nurses (LPNs), and NAs/unlicensed personnel. However, LPNs only represented 1.8% of the units’ direct nursing team studied and, therefore, were combined with the RN participants for this analysis. The inclusion criteria for the participating units were (a) an average patient length of stay ≥2 days and (b) a patient population greater than 18 years of age. The NTS and a cover letter were distributed to the nursing staff, and the nursing staff were asked to place the completed survey in a sealed envelope and then into a locked box placed on the unit. The response rate ranged from 53% to 67%. The sample was made up of 89% female; 56.9% were older than 35 years, and 34.5% reported greater than 10 years experience. The 53 units ranged in size from 20 to 183 total staff members, with a mean average daily census of 31 patients. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945912439107">Table 1</xref> displays the descriptive characteristics of the unit size measures.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section5-0193945912439107">
<title>Dependent variable: Nursing teamwork</title>
<p>The measure of nursing teamwork was the <italic>Nursing Teamwork Survey.</italic> The <italic>NTS</italic> is a 33-item survey, using a 5-point Likert-type scale with anchors 1 = <italic>rarely</italic> and 5 = <italic>always</italic>. The questions were generated with expert panels and focus groups with nursing staff members. The analyses of acceptability, reliability, and validity demonstrated strong psychometric properties and were reported in the original work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945912439107">Kalisch, Lee, and Salas (2010)</xref>. Five factors emerged from the exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses: trust (seven questions), team orientation (nine), backup (six), shared mental model (seven), and team leadership (four). The intraclass correlation (ICC) results verified that it is appropriate for the <italic>NTS</italic> to be used as a unit-level variable, making it possible to compare nursing teams by unit size variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945912439107">Kalisch, Lee, &amp; Salas, 2010</xref>). To generate unit-level teamwork variables, the individual <italic>NTS</italic> subscale scores were averaged for each unit. An overall teamwork score was also calculated and averaged for each participating patient care unit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0193945912439107">
<title>Independent variables: Unit size</title>
<p>The unit size variables were collected from each patient care unit at the time of the survey administration. They were verified with each hospital’s administrative data. The variables used to describe unit size were the following:</p>
<list id="list2-0193945912439107" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Number of RNs—those licensed nurses providing direct care including charge nurses and travel nurses if necessary but excluding unit managers and administrators.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Number of NAs—those unlicensed personnel assisting the nurse in direct care.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Number of total staff—the total number of nurses, unlicensed personnel, managers, and unit clerks/secretaries on the unit.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Average daily census—gathered from the most recent budget report.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0193945912439107">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Analyses were completed using the PASW Statistics software (version 17.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). The ICC1 value was .12 and the ICC2 value was .87. It is appropriate to use the unit-level analyses based on the fact that staff working on the same unit (i.e., on the same team) are expected to be similar to each other, whereas those working on different units/teams are predicted to be different. First, a preliminary investigation was performed to ensure that there were no violations of the assumptions of correlational analyses. In addition to descriptive statistics, scatterplots of the variables’ values showed no influence of outliers and confirmed linearity and homoscedasticity. Normality was demonstrated by histograms and the nonsignificant results of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic for all dependant variables. Using the unit-level database, the correlation between the five unit size measures and the six nursing teamwork factors was investigated using Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 level. In addition, subanalysis was used to examine teamwork difference by unit size (i.e., average daily census) using one-way analysis of variance. Cases were excluded pairwise in the correlational analysis. Further multivariate regression analysis was not used due to multicollinearity.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193945912439107">Table 2</xref> presents the results of the Pearson product–moment correlations. There was a significant, negative correlation between number of NAs (<italic>r</italic> = −.389, <italic>n</italic> = 53, <italic>p</italic> = .004) and average daily census (<italic>r</italic> = −.410, <italic>n</italic> = 53, <italic>p</italic> = .002) with the nursing unit teamwork overall mean score. In other words, as the number of NAs and average daily census increased on a unit, the nursing unit teamwork decreased. Also, the coefficient of determination (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>) indicates that the number of NAs explains nearly 15% of the variance in the unit’s overall teamwork mean scores and the average daily census explains about 17% of the variance. The number of RNs and total unit staff had no significant correlation with any of the nursing unit teamwork factors.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Given the significant findings of this study, it is clear that the science of nursing teamwork should be used in planning and designing the size of patient care units in acute care hospitals. Unit size affects not only the team size but also the physical distance, communication, and diversity of the nursing team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945912439107">Kalisch &amp; Begeny, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945912439107">Pearce &amp; Herbik, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of this study show that the average daily census is significantly correlated to nursing unit teamwork (<italic>r</italic> = .986, <italic>n</italic> = 53, <italic>p</italic> = .000). These unit size measures also correspond to the physical space on the unit. A larger physical space between coworkers compromises face-to-face interactions, proximity of workstations, and gathering places for the team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945912439107">Pearce &amp; Herbik, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193945912439107">Sundstrom et al., 1990</xref>). As a result, the study has shown backup behaviors, leadership capabilities, and trust decrease as the number of beds and average daily census get larger. Therefore, unit managers and hospital administrators need to consider the negative impacts that large, spacious units have on nursing teamwork.</p>
<p>As for what is the best team size, the literature yields a consistent guideline: the smallest possible number of people who can do the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945912439107">Hackman &amp; Walton, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945912439107">Keyton &amp; Beck, 2008</xref>). However, as noted above, the typical inpatient unit in an acute care hospital employs extremely large numbers. For example, in this study, the total staff on the units analyzed reached as high as 183 people with a mean of 87. Compared with teams in a variety of industries, nursing teams are an extreme outlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945912439107">Kalisch &amp; Begeny, 2005b</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of this analysis also showed that number of NAs and nursing unit teamwork were negatively correlated. Therefore, although the actual number of nursing staff members as a whole was not significant, the amount of unlicensed personnel was. These results suggest that increasing more NAs into the care team negatively affects the teams’ willingness to help, trust, and receive feedback from one another. This is consistent with other research findings that showed that team performance is negatively affected by increased team diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945912439107">Alexander et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945912439107">Guzzo &amp; Dickson, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>To counteract this negative impact on nursing teamwork, it is vital to assess how nursing unit design and organization may promote opportunistic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945912439107">Becker, 2007</xref>). Certain acute care units and other industries alike have broken large-scale teams into separate subteams or pods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193945912439107">Cusumano, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945912439107">Kalisch &amp; Begeny, 2005b</xref>). This may be accomplished in two different ways: new construction (reconstruction) or new organization. In Norway, the “holy grail” of unit design has been the sengetun ward, with between 6 and 10 private rooms arranged around a decentralized nursing station (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193945912439107">“Pods,” 2010</xref>). By reorganizing a 40-bed medical unit into four 10-bed pods, the number of different people that staff had to work with decreased by 75%, and patient and staff satisfaction increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945912439107">Kalisch &amp; Begeny, 2005a</xref>). The results of this research further support engineering and structuring nursing units in a manner that fosters teamwork and simplifies coordination among staff.</p>
<p>It is important to note that whereas the significant correlation results indicate a relationship between the variables studied, it does not indicate causality. In addition, multivariate analysis was not employed due to high correlation between independent variables. There is no measure of team effectiveness in this study. Other factors could influence the relationship of these variables, and therefore, further research is recommended to explore all aspects of nursing teamwork in the acute care setting. Last, independence of measurements may be violated in this study because the surveys, although administered independently, were collected in a group setting. To minimize the effect of this potential violation on the results, a stringent alpha value was used in determining the significant correlations (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p>It is understandable that most often we find larger than ideal teams on acute care patient units because they provide faster results, supposed cost saving benefits, and a larger pool of expertise in a complex and unpredictable environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945912439107">Kozlowski &amp; Bell, 2003</xref>). While these are all important factors to consider by health care administrators, the findings of this study encourage fundamental opportunities for improving nursing unit teamwork. Although the actual team size (number of total staff) did not show significant correlation with nursing unit teamwork, aspects of unit size (average daily census) were shown to be greatly influential. These results suggest that to optimize nursing unit teamwork, improvement initiatives should focus on the design and organization of nursing units in addition to team building among the roles of the nursing team. Also, this article strives to further the understand specifically of the interworking of nursing teamwork on acute care units by the permanent members of the team (as opposed to visitors such as physicians, physical therapists, etc.), not to undermine the importance of interdisciplinary teamwork across health care, but to provide knowledge that may be built on to positively influence both (enhancing teamwork among nursing staff should promote a higher level of interdisciplinary teamwork as well).</p>
