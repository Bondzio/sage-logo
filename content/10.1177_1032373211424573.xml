<abstract>
<p>The Australian Football League (AFL) is the largest professional sports competition in Australia. Most AFL clubs began as amateur bodies in the nineteenth century, but to survive they have had to adapt to changes in demand and production costs by adopting a commercial management approach. Because financial management is seen by most club members as secondary to the core business of winning games, accounting data is generally invisible in football histories. We use a range of accounting information from annual reports, committee Minute Books and media commentaries from 1910 to 1917 to demonstrate how financial data can be used to enhance our understanding of the history of one AFL club – Carlton. In particular, we show how previously overlooked accounting records can enrich the history of this sporting club as well as challenge long held “myths”, thus creating new understandings of Australian football history.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Australian Football League (AFL) is the largest and most popular professional sports competition in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1032373211424573">Stewart, 2007</xref>). In addition to its place as an iconic Australian sport, Australian football is economically significant. In 2000, AFL revenue was approximately $110 million; this increased to $215 million in 2005, $303.5 million in 2009, and was $335.8 million in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1032373211424573">Clarke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1032373211424573">Sheahan, 2011</xref>). Each of the 16<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1032373211424573">1</xref></sup> football clubs affiliated with the AFL raised revenue of between $26 million and $62 million in 2009, with profits varying between $0.6 million and $9 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1032373211424573">Butler, 2010</xref>). Club revenue is derived mainly from club memberships, marketing, sponsorship and dividends from the AFL, while AFL revenue comes principally from broadcasting rights, corporate sponsorships, pre-season gate receipts, AFL memberships and the AFL finals series. In 2011 the AFL announced a new five year (2012–2016) broadcast agreement for $1.25 billion – significantly higher than the previous $780 million broadcast rights deal.</p>
<p>It is widely acknowledged that finances play a very important role in today’s AFL football. Finances have always been essential to football clubs in order to fund the grounds and players that are the core elements of the game. From the very early days of Australian football in the 1860s and 1870s, club treasurers and administrators assumed central roles that required sound financial management skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1032373211424573">Grow, 1998</xref>). Since their inception, all football clubs in the major leagues reported their financial performance to members through annual reports.</p>
<p>While financial data has always been important to football clubs, it has been almost invisible in the literature on football history. This is largely because accounting and financial management has been seen by most club members and officials as being of secondary interest to the core business of winning games. It was only in the 1980s that Australian sport began to be examined by scholars from a business or management perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1032373211424573">Hogan &amp; Warren, 2005</xref>). In recent years a small number of articles have started to redress the dearth of research linking football clubs with accounting and financial matters (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1032373211424573">Pinnuck &amp; Potter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1032373211424573">Halabi, 2007</xref>), but there have been no studies of the historical accounting and reporting practices of Australian football clubs. This lacunae is not unique to football but rather may be common to sporting and other entertainment organisations. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1032373211424573">Cummings and St Leon (2009</xref>, p.13) note that while historical research has explored “the personal lives and experiences of circus people” in Australia, little consideration had been given to circus financing and management. There is thus a need to examine financial practices in previously unexplored locations.</p>
<p>In this article we use a range of accounting information from annual reports, committee Minute Books and media commentaries to demonstrate how historical accounting data can be used to enhance our understanding of one AFL club. We use a case study of the Carlton Football Club to demonstrate how archived accounting information can make the history of a sporting club clearer and more comprehensive. Carlton won more premierships than any other club in the first hundred years of the Victorian Football League (VFL/)AFL competition, and issues about its financial management have bolstered popular perceptions that the Club’s on-field success “was predicated upon money and swaggering self-esteem” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1032373211424573">Niall, 2009</xref>). Specifically, we consider two popular “myths” about Carlton’s early financial practices that have been well documented in club histories: that the Club paid its players in 1910 without disclosing the fact, and that the Club continued playing during World War 1 in order to service or pay-down its substantial debts. The evidence presented by the existing club histories to support these stories is based on secondary sources, primarily newspaper reports of Member meetings, rather than the financial reports themselves. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1032373211424573">Carnegie and Napier (1996</xref>, p.20) argue that “when historians draw conclusions from secondary sources about accounting practices, it is open to accounting historians to challenge these conclusions by reference to primary archival material”. We aim to make a significant contribution to the literature by showing that accounting data can be used to “challenge” long held “myths” about the financial practices of football clubs and thus provide us with new understandings of historical issues.</p>
<p>The remainder of this article is structured as follows. A literature review provides an overview of the history of Australian football and highlights the lack of historical studies into the accounting practices of clubs. We then provide information about the history of the Carlton Football Club. To demonstrate how accounting records may contribute to expanding our knowledge of the Club’s history, we identify the two prominent financial “myths” which originated in the early twentieth century. These myths are critically re-examined using available financial records. The conclusion will highlight the important role of the primary accounting archival material in challenging these financial myths and increasing our understanding of the off-field history of Australian football.</p>

<title>Literature review</title>
<p>Australia’s indigenous code of football – commonly known as Australian football or “Aussie rules” – was born on the parklands of Melbourne shortly after the gold rush of the 1850s. When groups of young immigrant and Australian-born men gathered to kick a ball, no single variety of football had been codified or become well established anywhere in the world. The members of the Melbourne Cricket Club, who drew up a set of rules in 1859, sought to combine the best features of the various forms of football that were played at that time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1032373211424573">Blainey, 2003</xref>). The omission of an offside rule established kicking the ball forward, to where players would contest for it, as the feature that differentiates Australian football from other codes. Played on large arenas that are used in the summer for cricket, between teams of 18 players using an oval-shaped ball, Australian football is a fast-moving sport, with physical contact and high scoring. One overseas observer described it as “a wonderful game of athleticism and action” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1032373211424573">Andrews, 1998</xref>, p.5). It became a mass spectator sport, appealing to all classes of Melbourne society by the early 1870s, more than a decade before a Football League was organised in Britain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1032373211424573">Briggs, 1963</xref>, pp.302–3).</p>
<p>The first controlling body of the game in Victoria, the Victorian Football Association (VFA), was formed in 1877. In 1896, the VFA’s strongest clubs broke away and formed the Victorian Football League (VFL). The VFL cornered Australia’s biggest market for football fans – the inner suburbs of Melbourne – and became the code’s most powerful competition. However, throughout the twentieth century the VFA competition continued to operate in its own right and the game also prospered in Victoria’s suburban and country leagues. Australian football also thrived in leagues throughout South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Riverina region of New South Wales. In nearly all of these leagues, clubs played once each week – usually on Saturday afternoons – over a five-month winter season, with a month of post-season play culminating in a “grand final” that determined the premier team. In the 1980s, the VFL expanded its 12-team competition beyond Victoria, creating a national league that was re-named the Australian Football League (AFL) in 1990.</p>
<p>As was the case with other team sports that were founded by amateurs, Australian football clubs were established to allow their members to take some exercise and enjoy the company of others, with “strenuous participation” being seen as “more important than the outcome of any given contest” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1032373211424573">Holt, 2006</xref>, p.355). After Australian football clubs began collecting gate money from spectators, surpluses were usually re-invested through spending on recruitment, player payments and the provision of improved ground facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1032373211424573">Frost &amp; Halabi, 2008</xref>, pp.83–6). Clubs sought to maximise utility by winning as many matches and premierships as they could, subject to budget constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1032373211424573">Sloane, 1971</xref>). They raised revenue and managed their finances carefully, not to maximise surpluses, but to build up a wages fund that could be used to attract and retain the best playing talent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1032373211424573">Dabscheck, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1032373211424573">Vamplew, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>While clubs needed to be financially sound in order to pay players and attract supporters, in the “language” of Australian football, financial matters are often portrayed as distasteful. For proponents of the amateur ideal, “the money element … stands for underhand tricks, and dirty play, for winning by fair means or foul” (quoted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1032373211424573">Cordner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, p.65). Clubs that “bought premierships” by recruiting players who changed clubs in search of higher wages were often seen as disreputable by fans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1032373211424573">Sandercock &amp; Turner, 1981</xref>, p.196). The dichotomy between on-field performance and off-field financial matters manifests in a dearth of research into the accounting systems and financial reporting of Australian football clubs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1032373211424573">Halabi, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>While many football club histories exist, most have been written by journalists and amateur historians to meet a demand from people who wish to recall or who seek a record of the club’s on-field performance. Such histories give little consideration to how financial matters affected their club’s stability and on-field performance. Even the most scholarly club histories (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1032373211424573">Stremski, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1032373211424573">Lack <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373211424573">Frost, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1032373211424573">Carroll, 1999</xref>) refer to the financial circumstances of clubs only anecdotally. In focusing on on-field activities, many club histories exhibit the characteristics of narrow business histories. At their worst, such business histories are “unreadable” and “are all narrative and without any analysis of issues” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1032373211424573">Coleman, 1987</xref>, p.154) – descriptions that can apply to the consideration of financial matters in many Australian football club histories.</p>
<p>There is great potential for introducing a financial dimension to an historical analysis of Australian football clubs. Studies of club and team finances are rare in sports of any kind, with prior research tending to focus at the level of leagues, codes or particular sports generally (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1032373211424573">Vrooman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1032373211424573">Hess &amp; Stewart, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1032373211424573">Hoehn &amp; Szymanski, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1032373211424573">Szymanski &amp; Kuypers, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1032373211424573">Banks, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1032373211424573">Zimbalist, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1032373211424573">Dobson &amp; Goddard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1032373211424573">Fort &amp; Quirk, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1032373211424573">Oriard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1032373211424573">Stewart, 2007</xref>). There have been five book-length histories of the Carlton Football Club to date. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1032373211424573">de Bolfo (2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1032373211424573">Hutchinson (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1032373211424573">Hansen (2002)</xref> are “coffee table books’ written by journalists. They are largely descriptive, and focus on on-field performances, and the personalities of players and coaches. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1032373211424573">Buggy and Bell (1958)</xref> is a more substantial history – Harry Bell was Club Secretary from 1940 to 1951 – although the presentation of information in a year-by-year format makes it virtually impossible for the authors to consider, and the reader to follow, trends that unfolded over several years. Lionel Frost is an economic historian and his is the most scholarly of these histories, but like Buggy and Bell he discusses financial issues only briefly and to support general statements about the Club’s financial security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373211424573">Frost, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1032373211424573">Frost’s (2006)</xref> study of the Club’s recent history focuses on recruiting and other strategies that were in response to exogenous policy changes made by the AFL.</p>
<p>Coleman argues that it is possible to write business histories that analyse “how and why businessmen reacted to, or helped to create, changes in market demand; and how and why they managed and shaped their units of production in order to meet the demands generated in those markets” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1032373211424573">Coleman, 1987</xref>, p.147). Because financial statements and reports offer evidence of the nature of that response, accounting history may “widen the notion of the ‘archive’” for football clubs by making new sources accessible and informing analysis of business behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1032373211424573">Carnegie &amp; Napier, 1996</xref>, p.16). Identifying and demonstrating the contribution of accounting history to an organisation such as the Carlton Football Club will allow the construction of more complete narratives that not only “capture the events and myths on which the organization was founded” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1032373211424573">Richardson, 2008</xref>, p.255; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1032373211424573">Funnell, 1998</xref>, p.143), but also critically challenge such myths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1032373211424573">Carnegie &amp; Napier, 1996</xref>). In this way, the incorporation of accounting history into more traditional sporting history will not only enhance our knowledge of the business history of the Carlton Football Club, but may allow us to act as “myth-busters” by utilising new sources of evidence to re-evaluate some long-cited Club stories. While this article will focus on the history of one football club, it is careful to locate “our narratives within an understanding of the specific context in which the object of our research emerges and operates” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1032373211424573">Carnegie &amp; Napier, 1996</xref>, p.8). Such analytical business history may be of use to other clubs within and without the industry, as “it can present itself as a microcosm of a wider universe rather than a microscopic entity trapped within its own universe” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1032373211424573">Gourvish, 1995</xref>, p.14; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1032373211424573">Gomes, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>The Carlton Football Club</title>
<p>The Carlton Football Club, formed in 1864, is one of the oldest football clubs in the world. There are some English football clubs of similar vintage, but most were founded closer to the end of the nineteenth century. Manchester United originated in 1878 and Liverpool in 1892. Spain’s two great clubs, Barcelona and Real Madrid, were not established until 1899 and 1902 respectively. Juventus is known as “<italic>La Vecchia Signoria</italic>” (“the Old Lady”) because by Italian standards it was founded long ago – in 1897 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373211424573">Frost, 1998</xref>, p.15).</p>
<p>Traditionally, the income of Australian football clubs came primarily from membership subscriptions and a share of the gate takings from weekly football games. In the early years of the game, the members of football clubs were predominantly local residents. Adjoining the north of Melbourne’s central business district, nineteenth-century Carlton was a thriving suburb that was popular with building tradesmen, artisans and working people with jobs in local factories. By the 1940s, Carlton “was a comfortably affluent club” that represented “a working-class suburb full of Jews, Lebanese, Italians and other immigrants” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1032373211424573">Pascoe, 1995</xref>, p.124). From the mid-1960s, Carlton augmented its “significant immigrant and university following” when it “also became a bastion of the newly rich” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1032373211424573">Pascoe, 1995</xref>, p.21). The Football Club was able to attract a relatively large number of members who could afford the annual subscription.</p>
<p>Carlton Football Club (in conjunction with the Carlton Cricket Club) was also fortunate to secure permission from the Melbourne City Council to occupy and develop a large ground just north of the city in the northern part of Princes Park. Under the control and oversight of the Carlton Recreation Grounds Committee (hereafter referred to as the Grounds Committee), made up of representatives from the football and cricket clubs, Carlton was able to utilise much of it’s gate receipts to develop the ground, investing in new viewing areas and amenities. This allowed the Football Club to capitalise financially on its supporter base, as it could accommodate a larger number of paying spectators at its games than was the case at many other grounds. For six of the seven VFL seasons from 1926 to 1932, Carlton claimed to have taken more money from gate receipts than any other League club (Carlton Football Club, <italic>Annual Reports</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1032373211424573">1926–1932</xref>). Even during the worst years of the Great Depression, crowds of over 40,000 were being attracted to big games at Princes Park.</p>
<p>It should be noted that while Carlton Football Club invested enormous amounts of money into the facilities at the Carlton ground, it was unable to formally recognize this investment as an asset on its balance sheet, as the ground was not owned by the Club. Rather, Carlton’s interest in the facilities was controlled through its ability to appoint half of the members of the Grounds Committee. The other half were appointed by the Carlton Cricket Club. The grounds themselves were owned by the Melbourne City Council, and were rented to the Grounds Committee.</p>
<p>By 1930, Carlton was one of the most financially sound clubs in the VFL. Evidence for this became clear when the VFL attempted to regulate player payments in 1930. As clubs competed to recruit new players who lived outside the recruiting zones in metropolitan Melbourne, clubs that did not have a strong local supporter base found it difficult to raise sufficient revenue to keep up with those that did. The gap between the League’s haves and have-nots widened further during the Great Depression as unemployment and wage cuts reduced peoples’ spending power. Average attendances at home and away games fell from 17,300 in 1928 to 14,800 in 1931 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1032373211424573">Vamplew, 1987</xref>, p.383). In 1930, many VFL clubs were struggling to pay their players. For example, South Melbourne was running an overdraft of £780 and could not pay its players until the end of the season. Essendon paid its players £2 for a win and 30 shillings for a loss, while Melbourne and Hawthorn did not pay their players at all. North Melbourne was able to pay only 30 shillings per match in 1931 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1032373211424573">Sandercock &amp; Turner, 1981</xref>, pp.105–7). By contrast, Carlton was paying players £5 15/- per match in 1929 (Carlton Football Club <italic>Annual Report</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1032373211424573">1929</xref>). In an attempt to stabilise the financial position of its clubs, the VFL appointed a finance sub-committee to develop a series of regulations governing player payments that the League adopted before the start of the 1930 season. The resultant regulation, called the Coulter Law, stated that no match payment, except to a captain or coach, was to exceed £3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1032373211424573">Sharland, 1930</xref>). Players who were unemployed or unable to work due to injury could be paid up to £3 extra, and bonuses of up to £2 per game could also be paid by clubs. The Basic Wage, Australia’s centrally determined minimum wage for full-time workers, was £4 per week at the time, and so the Coulter Law dictated that all players would need jobs or other sources of income outside of football to be able to support a family. As spectator demand fell during the Depression, the Coulter Law’s “cap” on player wages was set at a level higher than most clubs could afford to pay. Not only was Carlton one of the few clubs that could afford to pay the maximum player payment, but they could also afford to pay players an additional bonus of 10 shillings per match (Carlton Football Club, <italic>Annual Report</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1032373211424573">1930</xref>).</p>
<p>While Carlton enjoyed both on-field and off-field success, there were periods when it was under financial stress. The borrowings made by the Club to fund and maintain capital developments of the football ground during the early to mid-1910s meant that Carlton was regularly in debt in this decade.</p>

<title>Historical myths</title>
<p>To demonstrate how a consideration of the Club’s accounting reports may contribute to expanding our knowledge of the Club’s history, we identify two prominent “myths” about Carlton’s early twentieth-century financial management and disclosure practices as the basis of two research questions. Each of these research questions, or “myths”, will be re-examined using available financial records.</p>
<p>In the early years of the VFL, player payments were illegal. The League’s Rule 29 stated that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Any player receiving payment directly or indirectly for his service as a footballer shall be disqualified for any period the league may think fit, and any club paying a player either directly or indirectly for his services as a footballer shall be dealt with as the league may think fit.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Carlton membership and the general public were shocked in 1911 when the Club President, Mr J.T. McInerney, announced at the annual meeting that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>there was one blot on the [1910] balance-sheet<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1032373211424573">2</xref></sup> … The new officers, whose duty it was to prepare the [1910] balance-sheet had no other alternative than to adopt the course carried out by their predecessors – that was, to present to members a balance-sheet which was not true. For instance, the sum of £984 had been paid to players as salaries for their services during last football season. The item for players’ salaries for that amount did not appear on the balance-sheet, and the club had no receipts for this expenditure, or for other items that that amount was spread over. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1032373211424573">Anon., 1911a</xref>, p.9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This perception that “a large share of gate money and donations from wealthy supporters would find its way into players’ pockets” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373211424573">Frost, 1998</xref>, p.25) rather than being disclosed in the financial reports, has persisted throughout Carlton’s history. As there was evidence from many sources that Carlton, like many other clubs, was indeed paying players illegally during this period (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1032373211424573">Anon., 1911b</xref>, p.9), the claims of the Carlton President do not seem to have been questioned in any published history. Thus the first myth or research question that will be examined in this paper is as follows:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Were the publically acknowledged payments to players and the associated receipts from which such payments were made omitted from the 1910 financial reports?</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although the VFL legalised the payment of players in 1911, the “professionalism” of football continued to receive much critical commentary and negative press over the next two decades. Such criticism reached a height at the outbreak of World War I, when the League came under considerable public pressure to cease games for the duration of the War. While the majority of clubs wished to play on, there was considerable debate about how the allocation of proceeds from games should be used. Eventually, the League agreed that season 1916 would go ahead, but ruled “That no payments be made to players, excepting payment of actual out-of-pocket expenses, and that the net profits for the season of all clubs be paid over to some patriotic fund” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1032373211424573">Anon., 1916</xref>, p.18). Each club was also free to decide for itself whether it would participate in the 1916 season.</p>
<p>Despite the considerable public pressure not to play, Carlton, amongst a handful of other clubs, continued to play during the War years. The reasons given for this by football historians were financial:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Club finances seem to have been the key factor in the clubs’ decisions to play or not to play. At Carlton, the principal officers of the football and cricket clubs were guarantors for a bank debt of £1650, and the club’s opposition to cancelling the season was probably influenced by the fact that the bank was demanding that the debt be reduced. In contrast, South Melbourne, which had a healthy credit balance of £1750, voted against playing. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1032373211424573">Hess &amp; Stewart, 1998</xref>, p.125)</p>
<p>Carlton kept going because it was strapped for cash … They had debts to pay and could not afford to give up a season, or possibly several seasons of revenue. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373211424573">Frost, 1998</xref>, p.65)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The need to pay for recent improvements to Princes Park may have been a publicly acceptable reason for Carlton to continue to play. However, football historians are critical of Carlton for not just continuing to play, but for the way in which it used the monies generated from games played during this period:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The four clubs [that continued to play] gave an undertaking that they would not pay players, only compensate them for out-of-pocket expenses, and that any profits would be donated to a patriotic funds appeal … Carlton used its revenue to pay off some of its debts, and gave nothing to the fund. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373211424573">Frost, 1998</xref>, p.65–6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In commenting on the failure of the League and its clubs to donate the anticipated amounts to patriotic funds in 1917, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1032373211424573">Hess and Stewart (1998</xref>, p.129) claim that “The chief offender was the Carlton club. From a total revenue of £884 [in 1916], the largest of the four clubs, they contributed nothing to patriotic funds, choosing instead to reduce their outstanding debt”.</p>
<p>Thus the second myth or research question that will be examined in this paper is:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Carlton gained a financial benefit<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1032373211424573">3</xref></sup> from continuing to play football in 1916 and 1917 and used these proceeds to reduce its outstanding debts.</italic></p>

<title>An accounting perspective on Carlton’s history</title>
<p>Carlton Football Club has retained its Annual Reports for nearly all years since 1887. For a long time, it appeared that the Club held reports only back to 1906, but in 2008 copies of the 1887–1893, 1895 and 1900–1905 reports were found in a storeroom before a grandstand was demolished. The Annual Reports were public reports<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1032373211424573">4</xref></sup> distributed to the Members of the Club and typically included short comments on a range of matters such as the on-field performance of the Club, social functions, Club trips, the financial position of the Club and ground management. They also contained the audited financial statements. The early accounting reports were simple statements that outlined receipts and payments<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1032373211424573">5</xref></sup> and, occasionally, also included a balance sheet<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1032373211424573">6</xref></sup> and/or separate accounting information from committees (such as a Grounds or Social committee). A recent addition to the Carlton archive was the discovery in 2010, in a storeroom at the rear of a pie stall in a grandstand that was built in the early 1970s, of the Committee Minute Books for the period from 1917 to 1950. The Minute Books contain detailed information about the administration of the Club, including discussion of financial matters. The inclusion of the Annual Report narratives and the Minute Books in our study has enabled us to “widen the scope of the ‘archive’ … to find … some idea of how those who prepared and used the accounts regarded (or perhaps ignored) them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1032373211424573">Carnegie &amp; Napier, 1996</xref>, p.18).</p>
<sec id="section6-1032373211424573">
<title>Research question or myth 1: Failure to disclose illegal player payments in 1910</title>
<p>If the President’s claim was correct that <italic>payments to players were omitted from the 1910 financial reports</italic>, then it would be expected that when the player payments were disclosed in the balance sheet in 1911, expenditures <italic>and</italic> receipts should have gone up by the amount of player payments and additional, previously undisclosed, sources of receipts should become apparent. These receipts would be expected to be seen in the form of increased gate receipts and/or other sources of receipts such as donations, if the claims of historians such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373211424573">Frost (1998)</xref> are correct. Thus if the claim by the Carlton president at the 1911 annual meeting was confirmed, we would expect to see an increase in the expenditures in the 1911 accounts of around £900, and a corresponding increase in receipts.</p>
<p>An examination of the Statement of Receipts and Expenditures for Carlton Football Club for the periods 1908 to 1912 reveals the following. While initial examination shows that the 1911 accounts included a new item of “player expenses” of £949, total expenditure had only increased from 1910 to 1911 by £342. Total receipts increased by £103 from 1910 to 1911, the bank balance was drawn against by £72 (as compared to a £167 increase in 1910) and gate receipts increased by only £13. The largest increase in the receipt items was in the proceeds from social events (£45), which was included in the statement for the first time. The lack of significant increase in either the 1911 total expenditures or receipts compared to 1910 suggests that the majority of the amounts being paid to players in 1910 were in fact included in the financial statements, as were the sources of receipts for such payments.</p>
<p>If the player payments were included in the 1910 accounts, then the question becomes where were they “hidden” within the statements? An analysis of the 1910 accounts enables the Chairman’s reported figure of player payments of £984 in 1910 to be determined as being the total of the various player-related expenditure items included in the accounts. These are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1032373211424573">Table 1</xref> (column 2). The comparative amounts of each item for 1909 and 1911 enables the reader to see that rather than a new source of expenditure being introduced into the 1911 accounts, the disclosure of player payments primarily took place via a reclassification of the amounts shown in the individual expenditure items in the accounts.</p>

<p>While there may have been a degree of political manipulation of the 1911 accounts by the new committee, the details of the individual payment items shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1032373211424573">Table 1</xref> suggest that prior to 1911, the payments to players were being shown as various categories of player expenses, rather than as “payment directly or indirectly for his services as a footballer” (VFL rule 29). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1032373211424573">Table 1</xref> also shows the considerable decrease in many player related expenses between 1910 and 1911, and indicates that the majority of player payments were placed under the headings of “travelling expenses”, “training”, “refreshments”, “insurance and allowance to injured players”, and “entertainments”. To a smaller degree, it appears that some costs were placed under “testimonials” and “medical and hot baths”.</p>
<p>The source of receipts for such payments was also disclosed. As noted, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373211424573">Frost (1998)</xref> claimed that player payments were being funded out of gate receipts. An examination of the Statements of Receipts and Expenditure indicates that gate receipts remained relatively constant over the 1909 to 1911 period, being £746 in 1909, £759 in 1910 and £794 in 1911. For the period under consideration, the Annual Report included a Statement of Receipts and Expenditures for the Grounds Committee (the body responsible for the management of the grounds where Carlton played football). The Grounds Committee collected all gate receipts from Carlton’s home games and, after deducting “expenses”, passed on a “dividend” from each match to the two clubs involved. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1032373211424573">Table 2</xref>, the amount of gate receipts from home games disclosed by Carlton was consistently half (or around 49 per cent) of the amount shown by the Grounds Committee as the gate receipts distributed to clubs. Assuming that the Grounds Committee accurately disclosed all amounts received and was not itself making a contribution to player payments from the amount recorded as “expenses” for matches,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1032373211424573">7</xref></sup> then it appears that Carlton was not failing to disclose gate receipts received by it from its own Grounds Committee.</p>

<p>The other significant receipt items in the Statement of Receipts and Payments are membership tickets and the distribution from the VFL finals games. It is unlikely that these items were being understated in order to free up cash receipts to secretly pay players as: (i) the annual reports boasted of membership numbers, so it would be unlikely that the Club would knowingly under-report them; and (ii) the accounts were made public, so the VFL would be aware if the amount shown as a receipt from finals was different to the amount it had actually paid to the Club.</p>
<p>The only new item of receipts that appears in the statements at the time the player payments were officially disclosed was the proceeds (or profits) from social events. While this was only £45 in 1911 and £30 in 1912, it is worth noting that it was at least £131 in 1913 and £160 in 1914. While no receipts for “social events” were shown in the accounts for 1909 and 1910, the narrative that accompanied the accounts within the Annual Report described the same types of events that were also mentioned in the narratives for the latter years, when the amounts appeared in the financial accounts. It thus appears likely that the proceeds from social activities were being used to directly pay players in 1910, or at least to fund or subsidise trips or other benefits for the players. As such amounts were miniscule compared to the amount claimed to be paid to players, receipts from social events were clearly not a primary source of such payments.</p>
<p>Our analysis indicates that the so-called “hidden” payments to players were in fact included in the 1910 financial statements, but were disclosed as various forms of player expenses, rather than direct payments to players. Suspicions that Carlton failed to disclose the sources of receipts from which the “hidden” payments were being made is also refuted. We thus conclude that the myth that Carlton omitted £984 in player payments from its 1910 annual financial accounts is unsupported.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1032373211424573">
<title>Research question or myth 2: Carlton used proceeds earned from playing during World War I to pay off some of its debts</title>
<p>To examine claims that Carlton benefited financially from playing during the War and used the proceeds to pay off some of its own debts, rather than comply with the League requirement to pay profits into “patriotic funds”, we examined the financial accounts for 1912 to 1919 and the Minutes from 1917 to 1920. While we only have Carlton’s Annual Reports, and thus financial accounts, for 1912–1915, 1917 and 1919 (the Club has no record of the 1916 and 1918 reports), we have the Minutes for 1917 onwards. The Minutes provide insights into the financial issues that the Club faced and how it dealt with them. A significant advantage that emerged from using both the Minutes and the published financial reports is that financial information that was omitted from the financial reports (such as lists of outstanding accounts not paid) was recorded in the Minutes, thus giving a more comprehensive picture of the Club’s financial situation than would have been revealed by the Annual Reports alone.</p>
<p>In order to examine the second research question, we will break our analysis down into two sub-questions:</p>
<list id="list1-1032373211424573" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Was there a financial benefit to Carlton from continuing to play during World War I?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Did Carlton pay off any of its debts during the War period?</p></list-item>
</list>
<sec id="section8-1032373211424573">
<title>What was Carlton’s financial position at the start of the War?</title>
<p>Carlton certainly held some debt at the start of the War period. While some of this resulted from earlier borrowings to fund a specific capital development, Carlton had added to this immediately prior to the War. In 1912, the Club had borrowed £600 to purchase debentures issued by the Grounds Committee to fund a new grandstand.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1032373211424573">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the end of 1912, Carlton’s bank overdraft was £463. In the narratives of the 1912 <italic>Annual Report</italic>, the president wrote:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Your Club was compelled to borrow £600 for this important work, but your Committee feels confident that this amount will be wiped off within the next two years. In connection with the £600 borrowed by the Football Club, the members of your Committee guaranteed this amount by jointly and severally entering into a bond for its redemption. (Carlton Football Club, <italic>Annual Report</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1032373211424573">1912</xref>, p.7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Carlton appeared to be making the predicted progress in paying off this overdraft. At the end of 1913, the accounts showed an overdraft of only £80, with a further £35 owing to the Grounds Committee for light and water. This reported overdraft appears to have been an understatement of the extent of the Club’s liabilities, as the 1914 accounts reported that there was a “debit balance at beginning of season” of £250, suggesting that there were considerable outstanding accounts unpaid at the end of 1913. However, only the £35 owing to the Grounds Committee was shown in the 1913 balance sheet.</p>
<p>Regardless of the actual outstanding amounts at the beginning of 1914, by the end of season 1914 the amounts shown as owing were £848. This was made up of an overdraft at the bank of £578, plus a further £270 of overdue accounts (of this, most related to the grounds – £50 for the remaining balance on the upgrade of sewerage at the ground, £69 to the Grounds Committee for electricity and water, and £100 to Melbourne Council Parks and Gardens Committee for the levy on the Carlton ground). The <italic>Annual Report</italic> blamed the overdraft on “extra amounts of expenditure” of £1125 in 1914.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1032373211424573">9</xref></sup> Thus Carlton had not “wiped off” their borrowings from 1912 by the end of 1914, but rather had increased their outstanding debt. Carlton was thus continuing to extend its borrowings, both from the bank and from creditors, to fund, in particular, the costs of maintaining and developing the Carlton ground.</p>
<p>Thus Carlton commenced the 1915 season with debts shown in the accounts of £848. Given that in previous years there were often other outstanding accounts at year end that were paid in subsequent years, there may have been more amounts outstanding that were not disclosed in the balance sheet. Offsetting the debt were the assets that were owned by the Club. The main asset of the Club was debentures issued by the Grounds Committee of £600, plus £20 in interest owing to the Club. The Club had also loaned a further £20 to the Grounds Committee. While Carlton invested large amounts of funds into the development of the facilities at Princes Park (for example, in addition to the £600 debentures, the Club had also directly donated a further £900 in the years 1908 to 1910), this expenditure did not give rise to an asset in their balance sheet as they had no ownership rights over the Princes Park developments. A further £26 in account receivables meant that at the beginning of the 1915 season, Carlton’s overall balance sheet position was shown as “Balance of Liabilities over Assets” of £182.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1032373211424573">
<title>What was the financial position at the end of the War?</title>
<p>In season 1918, almost all clubs had resumed playing in the VFL.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1032373211424573">10</xref></sup> At the end of season 1918, Carlton had an overdraft balance of £453 and the 1919 financial reports show the payment of outstanding accounts of £253 from 1916/17, indicating a total debt of at least £706. This amount does not include any outstanding amounts from 1918 that were not shown in the <italic>Annual Report</italic>. As there were amounts unpaid at the end of the seasons for which we have accounts, it is likely that there were amounts unpaid at the close of season 1918. As the debentures had not been repaid, this asset remained in the accounts.</p>
<p>Given that Carlton commenced the war period (the 1915 season) with reported debts of £848 and completed the War period (the 1918 season) with reported debts of at least £706, it does not appear, prima facie, that Carlton gained substantial financial benefit from continuing to play during the War. There may have been a benefit if the Club had considerable fixed expenses to which a contribution would be made by any revenue the Club could obtain during the period.</p>
<p>To identify the expenses that were likely to be incurred by Carlton, even if they did not play in a particular season, we examined the 1916 accounts of the South Melbourne Football Club as an example of a club that was in a sound financial position prior to the War and elected not to play during the 1916 and 1917 seasons. South Melbourne’s Statement of Receipts and Expenditure for 1916 showed expenses for the following items: the annual meeting, VFL levy and delegates’ fees, ground rent, insurance, postage telegrams and stationery, gas and light, and audit fees, totalling £136 (South Melbourne Football Club, <italic>Annual Report</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1032373211424573">1916</xref>). While their bank balance fell by £144 during the season, £73 of this was voluntary donations to various War funds, giving an operating deficit of £71. While we did not have access to the 1916 accounts for Carlton, the 1917 accounts could be used to estimate the cost to Carlton of the “fixed” costs identified above. Where Carlton’s accounts showed an equivalent item of expenditure to the South Melbourne 1916 accounts, we assumed that Carlton’s 1917 amount would be the cost incurred if Carlton had not played in 1916.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1032373211424573">11</xref></sup> Where an equivalent item could not be determined from Carlton’s 1917 accounts, we assumed Carlton would incur similar costs to South Melbourne. With the exception of interest on debentures (Carlton was earning £30 interest while South Melbourne did not have this income item), we also assumed that Carlton could have raised similar revenue from social activities and fund raising as South Melbourne. Taking the above differences in revenue and expenditures into account, it was estimated that Carlton’s likely annual deficit if they had not played in season 1916 would have been around £73 per annum (being South’s net deficit of £71, plus Carlton’s additional income of £30, less Carlton’s additional expenditures of £32).</p>
<p>It can thus be concluded that there was some financial benefit to Carlton in continuing to play in 1916 and 1917. Instead of the actual debts of £706 reported at the end of season 1918, the debts would have been £146 higher if Carlton had not played for two seasons (assuming Carlton incurred the annual deficit of £73 calculated above for each season). While this would indicate that Carlton was able to slightly improve its financial position by playing through the War, it does not indicate that there was a substantial financial benefit to Carlton. It also ignores any fundraising that the Club may have been able to undertake to finance such a deficit.</p>
<p>Of course, such analysis focuses only on the financial position of Carlton Football Club as an independent legal entity. It does not take into account the financial benefits received by many individuals associated with the Club, such as players, coaches, doctors and committee members. In 1917 alone, these benefits amounted to £338. It also does not take into account the share of gate receipts that were received by the Grounds Committee as a result of the games played by Carlton on their home ground. A separate analysis of the Grounds Committee’s financial position is provided in a later section of this article.</p>

<sec id="section10-1032373211424573">
<title>The financial management practices of the Club during the War period</title>
<p>Merely examining the financial statements in the Annual Reports also overlooks the effort and processes that were taking place within the Club to maintain its financial position during the War period. The recent discovery of Carlton Football Club’s Minute Books for the period 1917 to 1918 enables us to gain insight into the day-to-day financial management practices of the Club during the latter part of the War.</p>
<p>The financial statements show a picture of a Club that was reimbursing players and was able to pay trainers and doorkeepers, the secretary and treasurer, doctors, and other individuals associated with the playing of football. On the other hand, the weekly Minutes show the Committee juggling accounts presented for payment, deliberately not paying some accounts, and regularly needing “to wait upon” various creditors to persuade them to delay their demands for payment. Such creditors included the Melbourne Parks and Gardens Committee (regarding the levy for Carlton’s grounds that had amounted to £200), the Club’s players’ insurance company (the 1917 premium of £48 was outstanding from early 1917 until June 1919), the bootmaker, the Club doctor, a widow (whose husband had died while waiting for Carlton to pay him the £27 that was outstanding from at least early 1917 until late 1918) and even, at one point, the Club’s auditors (who offered to discount their bill in order to get it paid (Carlton Football Club Minutes, 25 June <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1032373211424573">1917</xref>)). Almost every meeting saw the receipt of correspondence from at least one solicitor on behalf of creditors to whom Carlton owed money.</p>
<p>The approval of accounts for payment was also clearly a troublesome item for the Committee. Each meeting was given a detailed list of individual, and often very small, amounts to approve for payment. Such accounts were often discussed and approved or deferred one at a time during the meeting. It thus appeared from the Minutes that the day-to-day management of Club finances was indeed a very time-consuming and challenging activity in at least 1917, and presumably also in 1916, as many of the debts considered in the 1917 Minutes related to the 1916 season.</p>
<p>In addition to the financial management practices of careful control of expenditures (as claimed in the Annual Reports) and delaying payment of accounts, the Minutes also show that the Club took action at a number of points to generate additional funds through increasing the bank overdraft limit to £600 in March 1919, the issuance of £250 worth of debentures in 1918,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1032373211424573">12</xref></sup> and a loan of £46 from the VFL in late 1918 (repaid in 1919).</p>
<p>Again, the evidence from the Minute Books indicates that while Carlton was not at a financial disadvantage by playing on during the War period, it required considerable effort and skill by people such as the Club’s President, Secretary and Treasurer to ensure that the Club was able to manage its cash flow during this period in such a way as to avoid sinking further into debt. At the same time, it is apparent that there was sufficient cash flow to continue to pay players at least expenses and lost wages, if not more, and to pay £150 per annum in combined honorariums to the Secretary and Treasurer.</p>

<sec id="section11-1032373211424573">
<title>Grounds Committee</title>
<p>In addition to reviewing the Football Club accounts, the accounts of the Grounds Committee should also be perused, as whilst the Grounds Committee was a separate legal entity from the Carlton Football Club, in practice their financial interests were interdependent. The major source of revenue for the Grounds Committee was their share of the gate takings from football games. It is thus of interest to examine whether the Grounds Committee may have gained a financial benefit from Carlton Football Club’s continued participation in the VFL during the War period.</p>
<p>In 1912, the Grounds Committee went from an opening balance in the bank of £112 to an overdraft/loan of £940. By the end of 1912, it also owed £1200 on debentures purchased by the Football Club and Cricket Club. At the end of 1913, it had a debit balance at the bank of £1084, plus the debentures, and at the end of 1914, it owed £996, plus the debentures. In addition to building a grandstand, the Grounds Committee continued to invest in ground improvements during this time, paying £108 for the instalment of electric lights in 1913 and £929 for sewers, fencing and asphalting in 1914. As the Grounds Committee accounts were not included in the Carlton Football Club Annual Report after 1914, the continuing financial position of the Grounds Committee could not be easily determined. However, as the Grounds Committee did not repay the debentures during World War I and appeared unable to pay even the interest on the debentures during this time, it is likely that it had a poor cash flow and prioritised any surplus cash to the payment of interest, and possibly some of the debt, to the bank rather than to its member clubs. Given that the number of people attending football matches declined significantly in 1916 and 1917 – to cut costs the Football Club played one match in 1916 on one of the minor ovals at Princes Park, which was attended by only a few hundred non-paying spectators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373211424573">Frost, 1998</xref>, p.66) – the income of the Grounds Committee would have been significantly reduced. This suggests that the Grounds Committee may well have run a deficit for these years, placing it in a worse financial position by the end of 1917 than in 1914.</p>
<p>An estimate of the income for the Grounds Committee during the war years can be derived from considering the gate receipts shown in Carlton Football Club’s accounts. In the five years leading up to World War I, the accounts showed that gate receipts reported as receipts by the Carlton Football Club (calculated as one-third of net gate receipts after expenses directly associated with the game) were around 26–28 per cent of the Grounds Committee’s actual game receipts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1032373211424573">13</xref></sup> Thus, for example, in the financial statement for season 1916, Carlton showed £204 in gate receipts. This suggests that the Grounds Committee would have had maximum net receipts of around £700 from games, of which £200 would have been paid to Carlton and a further £200 to the opposing clubs, leaving approximately £300 to contribute to the general costs of the grounds. Given that interest on the £1000 overdraft and the £1200 debentures would have been at least £130 per year (given the reported rate of 5 per cent per annum on the debentures and payments of overdraft interest of £68 on the approximately £1000 owing in 1914) (Carlton Football Club, <italic>Annual Report</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1032373211424573">1914</xref>), this leaves little available to pay for ongoing expenses, let alone to repay any outstanding loans.</p>
<p>While the Grounds Committee may not have been able to reduce its outstanding debts, playing on during the War period appears to have generated sufficient cash flow for the Committee to make interest payments to the bank and to enable it to continue to hold the tenancy on the grounds.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1032373211424573">
<title>Did Carlton pay off any of its debts during the War?</title>
<p>As shown in the analysis above, neither Carlton Football Club nor the Grounds Committee generated material surplus funds during the war years. Given that Carlton started the War period with reported debts of £848 and concluded with debts of at least £706, it paid off only a limited amount of its 1915 debt. There was also no evidence that the Grounds Committee was able to pay material amounts off its debts during this period. We thus conclude that the second research question is given limited support by our financial analysis – that Carlton used most of the proceeds earned from playing on during World War I to meet its day-to-day expenditures and had very little available to reduce any of its debts. What little apparent “surplus” they did have, if surplus can be measured as the difference between the net financial position at the start and end of the war period, was not paid into a patriotic fund, but rather was used to slightly reduce their debt, and so the second myth may have a small degree of merit.</p>
<p>Given the extremely negative publicity that the Club received as a result of its actions during the War and the enormous amounts of what must have been “anxious” (Carlton Football Club, <italic>Annual Report</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1032373211424573">1915</xref>, p.7), time-consuming, and, at times, very professionally embarrassing work for the President, Treasurer and Secretary, there appears on the surface to be very little short-term financial benefit to the Club in continuing to play during the War. Given Carlton’s strong connections with the business community, and given the experiences of clubs such as South Melbourne that did not play on, it is likely that Carlton could have attracted donations or availed itself of further debt to fund any short-term financial demands, even if they had not continued to play in the early war years. However, there may well have been longer-term benefits from their decision to play on. While Carlton did not appear to have “used its revenue to pay off some of its debts” in the manner implied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373211424573">Frost (1998</xref>, pp.65–6), playing on may have enabled them to retain their longer-term “assets”, such as their players and their grounds. Given that Carlton continued to not only reimburse its players for out-of-pocket expenses and lost wages, but also to pay trainers, the Secretary, and the Treasurer, amongst others, in apparent preference to paying off debts, it may be argued that there were longer-term financial benefits to continuing to play during the War, such as the ability to retain good players and coaches and thus field strong teams in the post-War years. While the revenue generated by the football games for the Grounds Committee may also have enabled them to satisfy at least some of the interest owing on the bank debt and to pay a portion of the grounds levies, their physical presence on the Princes Park grounds may have helped them to retain their tenancy at the home ground in which they had invested so much money. It should also be noted that the war effort did receive some financial benefit from Carlton’s war games, as gate receipts at football games, like other entertainment, were subject to “a wartime amusement tax of a penny in the shilling … levied on all tickets sold” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1032373211424573">Cummings &amp; St Leon, 2009</xref>, p.20).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article we have used an archive of financial data consisting of annual reports, financial statements, and Minute Books to enhance our understanding of one football club’s history. We identified two major “myths” about the financial management and disclosure practices of Carlton Football Club that have been prominent in histories of the Club in the early twentieth century, and posed two research questions. These contentions were re-examined using the available accounting information from the archive and shown to be largely inaccurate. We demonstrate that using a previously unexplored archive of accounting information has greatly informed the analysis of two significant financial matters within the history of the Carlton Football Club, enabling us to rectify the deficiencies of histories that have relied solely on sensationalist media reports of the period without reference to the actual financial reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1032373211424573">Carnegie &amp; Napier, 1996</xref>). A further useful finding from this study is that Minute Books can provide much detailed information on the day-to-day managing of accounts and financial decision making and thus enhance the accounting archive.</p>
<p>The use of accounting information as a “mythbusting” tool in the context of Carlton Football Club also highlights the potential of a number of hitherto unexplored areas for further study. Football historians have long lamented their inability to confirm the existence or extent of early illegal payments to players. If Carlton Football Club was including the majority of its illegal player payments in its financial reports, then it is likely that other clubs were doing the same. Much may be learned about the history of player payments in Australian football by examining the historical financial reports of a cross-section of clubs using the critical comparative methods applied in this paper. The fact that Carlton was not using its proceeds from playing on during World War I to significantly reduce its debts, but rather was paying players and officials during a time when all Australians were being asked to direct every spare pound to the war effort, raises further research questions. Carlton’s use of funds was publicly disclosed. One wonders why historians have persisted with the myth of “paying off debt”, rather than challenging the social and cultural implications of Carlton’s actual expenditures at this time.</p>
<p>Financial records and other evidence of day-to-day financial management have largely been ignored in any analysis of the history of sporting clubs. Traditionally, club histories have concentrated on on-field performances and the personalities of players and coaches. This article has shown how the accounting archive of a football club can provide historians with new information and challenge long held myths that are often repeated uncritically in historical studies. For historians who seek to understand how Australian football evolved into the game and the industry we know today, and how an individual club’s fortunes have been shaped by decisions that have been made in the past, there is clearly considerable knowledge to be gained by an analysis of financial accounts, Annual Reports and related financial information.</p>

<p>The “balance sheet” referred to was in fact a financial report entitled “Statement of Receipts and Expenditure” in the Annual Report. This statement contained details of the opening and closing bank balances, cash receipts, and cash payments. Despite the title, the report did not show “expenditures”. However, it was quite common for organisations of this period to incorrectly label cash reports as “receipts and expenditure” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1032373211424573">Pixley, 1908</xref>, p.152).</p>

<p>The term “profit” was likely intended by the VFL to refer to a surplus of receipts over expenditures (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1032373211424573">Pixley, 1908</xref>).

<p>This is unlikely as the Carlton Cricket Club held equal positions on the Committee and there is considerable evidence in the Football Club’s Annual Report and Minutes that there was a long history of disagreements between the Football Club and Cricket Club over any expenditures by the Grounds Committee on items that were perceived to not directly benefit the Cricket Club.</p>

<p>A further £600 of debentures was funded by the Cricket Club and the remaining £1200 was “provided” by the Grounds Committee.

<p>It should be noted that there was a change of president during the 1914 season, so these claims may have been a case of “blame the past president”. This “extra expenditure” also included items that may not normally be considered “expenditure”. Of this increase, £250 was attributed to a “debit balance at beginning of season”, £350 to “deficit in anticipated League finals dividends” (i.e. to a lower than expected income item), £375 to advances for fencing and sewerage on the grounds, and £200 to other expenses.</p>

<p>While the issuance of debentures was discussed extensively at many points in the Minutes, we were unable to find any evidence of how much, if anything, was raised and no evidence of repayments of the debentures could be found in subsequent years’ accounts.
