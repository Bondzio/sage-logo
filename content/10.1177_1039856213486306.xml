<title>Objective:</title>
<p>To describe the intent and process of reviews undertaken following the death by suicide of an inpatient and suggest possible improvements.</p>

<title>Results:</title>
<p>Review processes seeking to elucidate a cause or to find errors in the system that may have contributed to an incident are not always suitable nor sufficient in cases of inpatient suicide, where the patient’s actions (as opposed to the actions or inactions of clinicians) led to patient death; therefore, the cause of death is not independent of the patient’s condition and the treatment provided.</p>

<sec id="section4-1039856213486306">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>While Root Cause Analysis remains a useful methodology, review of inpatient suicides should go beyond examination of systems issues only, and include consideration of the care and treatment provided: whether it met accepted clinical standards and was delivered by staff with adequate skills to consider the inherent risks of mental illness. Review of aggregate data has a useful role in identifying significant common features associated with inpatient deaths.</p>

<body>
<p>The unexpected, unnatural or violent death, including death by suicide, of a mental health inpatient is a tragic event. It is also a relatively rare event.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213486306">1</xref></sup> Increased risk of suicide, suicidal ideation and self-harming behaviour is common in the major mental illnesses that most often lead to hospitalisation. There is extensive literature that endeavours to identify predictive factors or preventive interventions, but there has been less discussion regarding the most effective processes to be followed by health services when reviewing inpatient suicide.</p>
<p>During the 1990s, there was growing recognition that the extent of unintended harm or injury as a result of medical error or adverse events experienced by patients in health settings had been underestimated. This resulted in major policy shifts, as illustrated by reports such as <italic>To err is human</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213486306">2</xref></sup> and <italic>Building a safer NHS for patients</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213486306">3</xref></sup> An important premise of this shift was the recognition that most errors are committed by hardworking people trying to do the right thing. In this context, it was more appropriate to focus on situations, settings and systems than to identify who was at fault. The shift to a ‘no-blame’ and system-improvement focus brought with it many initiatives and problem-solving techniques, such as the Root Cause Analysis (RCA), which was originally developed in other areas of endeavour such as industry and business management. The RCA seeks to identify possible causes of iatrogenic harm through an analytical technique.</p>
<p>RCA is not a method for determining ‘cause of death’;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213486306">4</xref></sup> however, there is concern among some mental health clinicians that the systems that are currently used fail to adequately consider the central aspect of suicide: that the self-inflicted and intentional action of the person is the ultimate ‘cause’ of death. Death by suicide is intrinsically connected to the current mental state and underlying mental illness of the patient.</p>
<p>The aims and expectation of incident review warrant further examination, given the complexity and inherent tension between internal and external factors that influence the likelihood of suicide. In an environment where resources are finite and the focus is on a rights-based, recovery-oriented service model, the appropriateness of imposing limitations on a person’s freedom of movement or privacy (because of the risk of a rare event that we cannot reliably predict) raises a number of questions about the most appropriate review process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213486306">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 2011, in the context of adverse media commentary about inpatient deaths, the Chief Psychiatrist of Victoria undertook an investigation into the unnatural, unexpected or violent death of an inpatient during the period January 2008 – December 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213486306">6</xref></sup> Of the 41 deaths considered, an estimated 29 were believed to be suicide, although not all had been subjected to coronial inquiry at the time of the investigation. Eight of the suicide deaths occurred on the inpatient unit, all as a result of hanging. Thirteen deaths occurred while the patient was absent without leave and a further eight when the patient was on approved leave. The investigation considered the review processes undertaken by the health service following the death, and noted a number of issues regarding the appropriateness and utility of current review processes in the case of inpatient suicide.</p>
<p>This paper describes the processes currently undertaken in Victoria following the death of an inpatient and some of the themes or recommendations that typically follow. It proposes changes in the review process that would lead to better outcomes for patient care and staff proficiency.</p>
<sec id="section5-1039856213486306">
<title>Current review processes</title>
<p>Health services undertake a review process following a critical adverse event such as an unexpected patient death. Victorian health services are obliged to comply with departmental requirements in relation to sentinel events, which include inpatient suicide. Mental health services must also report the death of an inpatient to the Chief Psychiatrist and to the Coroner, who will determine whether or not to hold an inquest.</p>
<sec id="section6-1039856213486306">
<title>Health service</title>
<p>All unexpected mental health inpatient deaths are reviewed by Health Services under internal critical incident review mechanisms. This is usually done using a RCA. The RCA is a process analysis method that ‘enables answers to be found to the questions posed by high-risk, high impact events – notably what happened, why it occurred and what can be done to prevent it happening again’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213486306">7</xref></sup> The root cause is the earliest point in a given healthcare episode at which action could have been taken to prevent or reduce the chance of the incident happening. The RCA investigations focus on systems and processes, not individual performance or the treatment and care provided, and emphasise problem solving, rather than assignment of blame. The RCA report includes a Risk Reduction Action Plan (RRAP), which contains recommendations that are rated using a scale of effectiveness regarding an action’s ability to eliminate or minimise risk. The facilitator of the group/panel undertaking the RCA should be trained in its methodology.</p>
<p>Of the 41 inpatient deaths considered in the Chief Psychiatrist’s investigation, all but one had been reviewed using the RCA methodology. The recommendations made in the RCAs are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1039856213486306">Table 1</xref>. Many recommendations relate to the review of policies and procedures, which reflect review and/or changes in practice. As expected, a number of recommendations relate to the detection and removal of means of suicide, particularly ligature points, and other recommendations relate to systems and processes. Relatively few relate to professional skills and clinical practice, areas which are more likely to be assessed via clinical audits. It was not clear whether other review processes considering issues such as patient engagement with treatment staff were analysed by Health Services.</p>

<title>Department of Health</title>
<p>The Quality, Safety and Patient Experience branch of the Victoria Department of Health is responsible for policy development, planning, resource allocation and monitoring of performance in relation to the systematic improvement of safety and quality in healthcare. It manages the Sentinel Event Program (SEP).</p>
<sec id="section8-1039856213486306">
<title>Sentinel Event Program</title>
<p>The Victoria SEP commenced during 2001 – 2002, as part of the department’s clinical risk management strategy. The aim of the SEP is to implement strategies to reduce the possibility of human error or organisational failings, rather than clinical decision-making, to improve patient safety and quality of care. The department produces an annual report of aggregated data and case examples.</p>
<p>The definition of a sentinel event is ‘a relatively infrequent, clear-cut event that occurs independently of a patient’s condition; it commonly reflects hospital system and process deficiencies, and results in an adverse or unintended outcome for the patient’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213486306">8</xref></sup> The definition of an adverse event is ‘an unintended injury or complication that results in disability, death or prolongation of hospital stay, and is caused by health care management rather than the patient’s disease’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213486306">8</xref></sup> There are eight nationally-agreed sentinel events, one of which is the suicide of an inpatient.</p>
<p>While it is important to analyse inpatient deaths in order to identify potential systemic failures and opportunities for improvements in service provision, it should be noted that inpatient suicides differ from other sentinel events in that these events do not occur independently of the patient’s condition and are not ‘caused’ by health care management.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section9-1039856213486306">
<title>Chief Psychiatrist</title>
<p>The Chief Psychiatrist is established under the Victorian <italic>Mental Health Act</italic> (1986) and has responsibility for the medical care and welfare of those receiving treatment. The monitoring of reportable deaths, and related clinical audits and investigations, is among the statutory duties of the Chief Psychiatrist.</p>
<sec id="section10-1039856213486306">
<title>Reportable deaths</title>
<p>Public mental health services are required to report all deaths that are unexpected, unnatural or violent, including suspected suicides, of people whom were receiving treatment from mental health services at the time of their death or in the previous 6 months prior to their death. While death notifications are reviewed and consideration is given to whether the treatment and care appeared appropriate under the circumstances, it is only in exceptional cases that a more in-depth review is carried out by the Chief Psychiatrist.</p>
<p>Although the reporting of deaths serves mainly a monitoring function, the Chief Psychiatrist provides an overview of these in an annual report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213486306">9</xref></sup> While the Chief Psychiatrist has the authority to seek information in relation to any death, it is difficult to know the proportion of reported deaths to actual deaths. Resource limitations are also a factor. The Chief Psychiatrist registers interest with the Coroner regarding findings in deaths involving mental health consumers. Coroners’ reports are reviewed by the Chief Psychiatrist and a thematic summary of coronial recommendations is periodically published on the Chief Psychiatrist’s website and sent to Health Services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1039856213486306">
<title>Sentinel Event Review Committee</title>
<p>The Chief Psychiatrist convenes the Chief Psychiatrist’s Sentinel Event Review Committee (CPSERC), which meets quarterly and includes nominated senior psychiatrists and mental health clinicians, to review all RCAs and RRAPs involving mental health-related events submitted to the department’s SEP. These RCA reports and action plans are received in de-identified form. The role of the CPSERC is to review the circumstances of the sentinel event and to provide written commentary on the appropriateness and quality of the RCAs and RRAPs to the SEP, which in turn provides this feedback to the submitting service.</p>
<p>As noted above, the extent of de-identification and the methodology used limits the utility of this review. The committee is able to comment on whether the RCA considered relevant aspects and whether the recommendations appear reasonable, but as the service context is not available and there is no information on the diagnosis, treatment or care provided, the utility from a quality improvement perspective is limited.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1039856213486306">
<title>Chief Psychiatrist investigations</title>
<p>The Chief Psychiatrist can investigate inpatient deaths in circumstances that warrant this. In the Chief Psychiatrist’s investigation of inpatient deaths, aggregate data were useful in identifying common factors or opportunities in these deaths, such as the location, time and mode of suicide in inpatient units. Most of these deaths on units involved hangings in bedrooms and ensuites at times when staff capacity to observe patients was reduced, such as during the night shift, handover times, or during incidents or times of high acuity on the ward.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1039856213486306">
<title>Coroner’s inquest</title>
<p>All unexpected, unnatural or violent deaths must be reported to the state Coroner, who will investigate the death. Not all investigations will result in an inquest. An inquest is a court hearing into a death that is generally open to the public. Coronial findings and recommendations are published in Victoria, as are the responses to these from Health Services and government departments.</p>
<p>The Coroner makes a written finding about the identity of the deceased, what caused the person’s death and in certain cases, the circumstances in which the death occurred. The Coroner may also make recommendations aimed at preventing similar deaths from occurring in the future. The Coroner, in the course of an investigation, is often provided with information about improvements undertaken as a result of a service review of the death.</p>
<p>Coronial investigations are thorough and sometimes protracted, and on occasion an inquest may become adversarial and legalistic. As an investigation generally relates to a single incident, it is difficult to extrapolate to more general service delivery. An added problem is that the inquiry and findings are made a considerable time after the death, sometimes years later. Of the 41 deaths considered in the Chief Psychiatrist’s investigation, the coronial process had concluded in just 13 of these.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1039856213486306">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There is a general consensus that systematic review of some kind, following an inpatient suicide, is an appropriate and worthy endeavour. While the expressed intent of different review processes varies, there is an expectation that they will lead to service improvements, greater attention to safety resulting in reduced likelihood of recurrence, and that they will bring comfort and reassurance to family and friends that some action has been taken to address the ‘cause’. The extent to which such outcomes can be realised has been subject to critical investigation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213486306">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213486306">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The RCA methodology has been used in mental health services for some time and has the advantages of a robust and standardised methodology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213486306">11</xref></sup> It is important that incidents in mental health services fall within the overall Health Service responsibility. There are, however, fundamental differences between adverse events in general health settings and suicide in a mental health setting. In the former, the outcome is not intended or contributed to by the patient, and there is a clear link between an error, for example a medication error, and the outcome. It is acknowledged in the literature that there are challenges in distinguishing between ‘system’ root causes and the impact of the underlying illness. The person who completes suicide takes the action that resulted in death, although the ultimate trigger or precipitant to this action may not be able to be elucidated. Thus, the expectation of finding a ‘root cause’ is misleading and potentially unhelpful. Furthermore, despite considerable literature on predictive risk factors, actually linking of risk assessment to prevention of suicide is not supported by the current evidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213486306">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486306">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The benefits of the RCA approach are that it is relatively consistent and does not require a legalistic, blame-laying approach. RCA recommendations can lead to reduction of opportunity of suicide in inpatient units; however, the RCA explicitly excludes a review of patient and treatment factors, which are critical in mental health care, where the risk of an adverse event like suicide may be directly impacted by the rigour of assessment and diagnosis, and the effectiveness of the treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213486306">13</xref></sup> An examination of systems issues only may result in recommendations that are increasingly restrictive (such as locking the unit continually, to reduce the risk of absconsion). Rather than improving the safety of patients, this could reduce the therapeutic and rehabilitative value of the care provided. Review of inpatient suicides would be enhanced by a process that includes a review of patient factors, the assessment made, the care provided and the patient’s engagement with treatment. At present, it is unclear how often this occurs. Learning from such reviews remains within individual services; there is not a ready means by which the recommendations made in one service following a critical event are shared with other services nor implemented more widely…</p>
<p>A number of authors have suggested ways to build on current systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486306">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213486306">14</xref></sup> Little describes an audit process that incorporates education and staff support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213486306">15</xref></sup> The shift in focus and purpose supported by a more formalised approach is further illustrated by Rose, who describes a rolling system of incident review, which seeks to not only contribute to understanding of the incidents under review, but also to detect patterns over time and to stimulate debate on how to provide the best care in the safest way.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213486306">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Current policy emphasises patient choice and care given in the least restrictive environment, in line with a recovery orientation and attention to human rights. The systems approach should be revised to better incorporate consideration of those areas where clinicians and services can properly take responsibility and ownership of the treatment they provided, without losing the benefits of the RCA approach. Services should be supported to review incidents such as inpatient suicide, in a way that allows clarity regarding what can and cannot be realistically influenced. It is appropriate that relevant staff are trained in how to undertake such a review and are supported to do this through a recovery-oriented lens that accepts that inpatient units must balance personal dignity and choice with appropriate levels of observation and restriction on movement.</p>
<p>There are two main approaches available to mental health services, to reduce the risk of inpatient suicide. Services can do as much as possible to reduce the opportunity for patients whom are at high risk of harming themselves: for example, by reducing the availability of ligature points within the unit or by considering how best to conduct nursing observations of patients. The other, less quantifiable method is through providing effective treatments in accordance with accepted best practice, engaging with patients and providing them with hope.</p>
<p>While we note the utility and standardised approach of RCA, review of inpatient suicides should go beyond consideration of systems issues and include consideration of whether the care and treatment met accepted clinical standards, and was delivered by staff with adequate skills to consider the inherent risks of mental illness. There should be clear processes in place to guide how such additional reviews are carried out and by whom, how they are documented and audited. The challenge is to resolve the contradictions between the practical reality of recovery-oriented care and our <italic>duty of care</italic> to those at increased risk of suicide. Our review processes and health service responses must acknowledge this tension and explicitly recognise that suicide is ultimately a decision made by the individual, and that we may never be privy to the ‘root cause’ of that decision.</p>
