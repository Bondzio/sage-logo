<abstract>
<p>Building an Indigenous mental health workforce is a strategy used to develop culturally responsive and effective mental health services in New Zealand. However, researchers know little about Indigenous (Māori) mental health nursing. We undertook a Māori-centered methodology and grounded theory using focus groups to collect data from 10 Māori mental health nurses. We then analyzed the data using constant comparative analysis and theoretical sampling until saturation of the core category and subcategories emerged. “Bridging two worlds,” together with two subcategories, “going beyond” and “practicing differently,” explains the process Māori mental health nurses used to resolve the tensions they encountered working in the worlds of mainstream and Māori health services. This research provides insight into the tensions Indigenous and minority nurses experience when attempting to integrate cultural perspectives and practices to meet the needs of their patients.</p>

<p>Mental health problems for Māori (Indigenous people of New Zealand) have increased since the 1970s, and they continue to persist as major health issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312450213">Baxter, Kingi, Tapsell, Durie, &amp; McGee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312450213">Kokiri, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312450213">Mason &amp; Ryan, 1988</xref>), similar to other Indigenous and minority populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312450213">Andrade et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312450213">Hunter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312450213">Isaacs, Pyett, Oakley-Browne, Gruis, &amp; Waples-Crowe, 2010</xref>). A national mental health survey of more than 12,000 households in New Zealand revealed that more than 50% of Māori people experienced illnesses affecting their mental health. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders were the predominant causes of hospitalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312450213">Baxter, 2007</xref>). Strategies used to promote Māori culture in service delivery have, over time, contributed to building the Māori mental health workforce. The New Zealand government’s commitment to developing the mental health workforce over the last decade has resulted in strengthening Māori mental health (psychiatric) nursing practice. In fact, Māori registered nurses now tend to choose mental health nursing over other specialty areas of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312450213">Nursing Council of New Zealand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312450213">Ratima et al., 2007</xref>). Emerging evidence suggests that Māori health professionals have dual accountabilities in both Māori cultural and clinical contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312450213">Elder, 2008</xref>; Ratima et al.). Nonetheless, to our knowledge, no published research on Māori mental health nurses (referred to hereafter as “Māori nurses”) currently exists, particularly with regard to their practice. In this article, we use grounded theory to explain the current situation of Māori mental health nurses and their practice.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732312450213">
<title>Background</title>
<p>The prevalence of mental health disorders for Māori exceeds that of others living in New Zealand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312450213">Baxter, Kingi, et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312450213">Baxter, Kokaua, Wells, McGee, &amp; Oakley Browne, 2006</xref>). Māori suffer common disorders that include anxiety, mood, and substance-abuse disorders, with some experiencing more than two comorbid disorders. Whereas Māori women are more likely to live with anxiety and mood disorders, Māori men are more likely to live with psychotic and substance-abuse disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312450213">Bushnell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312450213">Ministry of Health, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312450213">Durie (2003)</xref> linked poor mental health to the long-term impacts of colonization. Colonization resulted in the loss of land, language, cultural practices, and identity, together with changes in the role and structure of <italic>whānau</italic> (extended family) and socioeconomic well-being. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312450213">Stone (2002)</xref> concurred, and indicated that postcolonial stress contributed to high levels of unremitting anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder, which are evident among Indigenous peoples who have experiences of postcolonial trauma and ongoing stress.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312450213">Kirmayer, Simpson, and Cargo (2003)</xref> advocated community-based strategies immersed in Indigenous cultural customs to address mental health problems, which is contrary to approaches that focus on individuals. Furthermore, they stressed that identity and self-esteem were central to Indigenous well-being, which are both located in a cultural context. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312450213">Durie (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312450213">2001)</xref> also highlighted the importance of culture in the well-being of Māori, something previously identified at a meeting held in 1984 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312450213">Dyall &amp; Wauchop, 1994</xref>). Since the 1990s, there has been a rise in culturally based mental health services. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312450213">O’Brien, Boddy, Hardy, and O’Brien (2004)</xref> stressed the need for health professionals to be conversant with and sensitive to the cultural needs of Māori for the provision of optimal mental health care. This was despite the fact that nursing in New Zealand had already established cultural safety (arising from concerns that Māori received a different level of care than others using health services) as a core requirement for registered nurses’ practice in the early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312450213">Papps &amp; Ramsden, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Māori comprise 15% of the New Zealand population, yet they comprise only 6% of the practicing registered nursing workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312450213">Nursing Council, 2010</xref>). Despite the Ministry of Health’s priority to increase the capacity of the Māori health workforce, the proportion of Māori nurses in the nursing workforce has remained static (i.e., between 6% and 7% of all practicing nurses) for more than a decade. The recruitment and retention of registered nurses has been an ongoing challenge, particularly for Māori nursing students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732312450213">Wilson, McKinney, &amp; Rapata-Hanning, 2011</xref>). In New Zealand, registered nurses must complete an approved 3-year bachelor’s degree in nursing, carry out at least 1,100 hours of clinical practice in designated areas (including mental health), and demonstrate that they meet the Nursing Council’s competencies for registered nurses. Nevertheless, complex and ongoing barriers affect Māori success and retention in nursing programs. Factors promoting success and retention include affirmation of Māori cultural identity, access to academic support and Indigenous role models and mentors, and the inclusion of Indigenous content and clinical experiences (Wilson et al.). This is similar to the contexts of other Indigenous and minority nursing students who have comparable experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312450213">Anonson, Desjarlais, Nixon, Whiteman, &amp; Bird, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312450213">Gilchrist &amp; Rector, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312450213">Gregory, Hart-Wasekeesikaw, Macrae, Wood, &amp; Amaral, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Anecdotally, Māori mental health nurses practice in a manner that differs from that of other mental health nurses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312450213">Lowe and Struthers (2001)</xref> highlighted that Indigenous nursing practice is based in a culturally determined, eco-spiritual, and holistic worldview. At the time of our research, Māori mental health nurses (unlike other nurses working in mental health) were required to meet dual competencies (i.e., the Nursing Council’s clinical competencies, as well as a set of culturally based competencies for working with Māori mental health patients). Minimal research has captured the nature of Māori mental health nursing. Thus, we aim to explain the current situation of Māori mental health nurses in the present article.</p>

<sec id="section2-1049732312450213">
<title>Research Design</title>
<p>We used a qualitative research design informed by a Māori-centered methodology and grounded theory. Māori-centered research methodology arose out of Māori concerns about their history of being researched in ways that transgressed cultural traditions, interpretations of findings that ignored culturally based perspectives, and the generation of unhelpful outcomes. Three key concepts informed this methodology to keep the interests of Māori central throughout the research process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312450213">Durie, 1996</xref>): control, enablement, and integration. This approach enabled Māori nurses to contribute to the research agenda, and ensured that the researchers adhered to cultural ethics, protocols, and processes throughout the research process. Although we employed this culturally based approach to ensure that it was culturally safe for participants, it also supported the use of mainstream tools and research methods. For example, we used cultural processes for the focus groups; therefore, the focus groups began with prayer, a formal greeting, and the sharing of food to make it culturally appropriate. Moreover, prior to commencing data collection, we undertook a process of making connections and building relationships, and discussed the purpose of the research.</p>
<p>The inductive nature of Glaserian grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312450213">Glaser, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312450213">1998</xref>), informed by Māori-centered methodology, made the development of a theoretical explanation of Māori nurses and their practice possible. Because the focus was on Indigenous nurses, using this approach ensured that their worldview and cultural processes remained central to the research process. The Massey University Human Ethics Committee approved the research.</p>
<sec id="section3-1049732312450213">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Prior to planning the research, we consulted with the Māori caucus of the <italic>Te Ao Maramatanga</italic> (New Zealand College of Mental Health Nurses, referred to as “the College of Mental Health Nurses”) and Māori mental health professionals. We discussed and negotiated the process of participant recruitment, ongoing advice, and dissemination of the findings. We used purposive sampling to select registered nurses who identified ethnically as Māori and currently worked with patients in mental health services. The College of Mental Health Nurses used their membership database to send posters via email to recruit potential participants. Interested nurses then contacted us for additional details on the study. We gave an information sheet to each potential participant, outlining the nature of the study, what was required if they participated, and the rights they would have as participants (e.g., the right to anonymity and confidentiality, and the right to withdraw without prejudice). We gave potential participants the opportunity to ask questions prior to them signing a consent form. We negotiated the time and venue for each of the focus groups with each participant.</p>
<p>Ten registered nurses aged between 43 and 55 years who identified ethnically as Māori participated in three focus groups. They came from a range of North Island <italic>iwi</italic> (tribes). All nurses had more than 10 years’ experience: 8 had more than 10 years’ adult mental health experience, whereas 2 had previously worked in medical, surgical, and primary care settings in addition to mental health settings. These nurses worked in inpatient mental health units, Māori mental health services, and community mental health services, and they all had patient loads and case-managed those with serious mental illnesses and substance-abuse problems. Nine participants underwent their registered nurse preparation in a polytechnic college or university, and 1 in a hospital setting. Nine had bachelor’s degrees in nursing, 2 had master’s degrees in nursing, and 1 was completing a doctoral degree.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732312450213">
<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>We selected focus groups (two groups with three participants each and one with four participants) as an effective and culturally appropriate method to collect data about the situation of Māori mental health nurses. The work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312450213">Krueger and Casey (2000)</xref> informed the focus group processes, and the focus group sessions were digitally audio-recorded and transcribed. We established rules for the focus groups at the beginning, primarily to respect each participant’s contribution and to allow for the identification of individuals when we transcribed the recordings. In addition to the audio recordings, we also took field notes during the discussions.</p>
<p>We employed constant comparative analysis of the transcripts, and used theoretical sampling from one focus group to the next until we achieved saturation of the core category and subcategories. We coded transcripts line by line, and we grouped, labeled, and recoded emerging codes until we achieved saturation of the emerging concepts and categories. Constant comparison enabled us to tease out the dimensions of each code until the emergent concepts and categories achieved the criteria of “grab and fit” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312450213">Glaser, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312450213">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312450213">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>). Memos captured our thoughts and reflections during the analysis and conceptualization phases. We then generated a middle-range substantive grounded theory.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>We expected Māori mental health nurses to be knowledgeable about Indigenous Māori cultural values, beliefs, and practices, which ideologically should be congruent with those in the world of nursing. “Bridging two worlds” provided an explanation of how Māori mental health nurses resolved the tension (in the form of stress, pressure, and conflict) that arose from negotiating and working within two opposing worldviews with different, and at times conflicting, cultural beliefs and practices (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732312450213">Figure 1</xref>). The world of the New Zealand public health care system, where most mental health services are delivered, is biomedical in nature, as evident in a predominant illness focus that centers on assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of an individual’s illness or disease. In contrast, eco-spiritual and holistic perspectives drive the world of Māori, and relationships, genealogy, and the collective (i.e., not only individuals but also their extended families) are highly valued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312450213">Barlow, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312450213">Mead, 2003</xref>). Tension arose when there were conflicting beliefs and values, and expectations that Māori nurses would be both culturally and clinically competent. Minimal understanding or tolerance of Māori and their cultural needs in mental health services created situations that required interpretation and mediation. In these situations, Māori nurses were forced to put aside their personal cultural protocols and practices, and those of their patients and their families:
<disp-quote><p>In the past, it [has] always been the clinical, and our <italic>tikanga</italic> [cultural practices] [have] always [been] left on the side. When we [have tried] to bring or incorporate tikanga into clinical practice, we have been challenged. I remember the day when a non-Māori nurse challenged me. She said that I crossed the [professional] boundaries when I <italic>hongied</italic> [the pressing of foreheads and noses as a cultural form of greeting] one of the <italic>tangata whaiora</italic> [person seeking wellness/patient]. I said to her that it is our way of greeting; it is not about boundaries. In fact, it [would be] more ignorant of me if I didn’t do it.</p></disp-quote>

</fig>
<p>Functioning effectively in two worlds became a source of tension when Māori nurses cared for Māori, because not only did Māori patients and their families experience discomfort when they accessed mainstream health services, they also had expectations of culturally appropriate care. Non-Māori colleagues also placed added expectations on Māori nurses to meet the cultural needs of their colleagues’ patients, which demanded dual competency in both Māori culture and nursing. Tension manifested as experiences of stress, pressure, feelings of being pulled or stretched, and conflict. Subsequently, conflicting and divergent cultural beliefs, values, and practices compelled them to resolve this tension. Māori nurses used knowledge, skills, and experiences from both worlds to resolve the tensions competently by “bridging two worlds,” “going beyond” what was expected of registered nurses in their routine practice, and “practicing differently.”</p>
<sec id="section6-1049732312450213">
<title>Bridging Two Worlds</title>
<p>Bridging two worlds refers to the basic social process Māori nurses used to grapple with working in two culturally different worlds, and the associated tension when doing so. They achieved this by advocating for Māori, defending Māori customary practices, and interpreting the movement between the two worlds for their patients and their families (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1049732312450213">Figure 2</xref>). One participant summed this up very simply: “It is the ability to function in both worlds.” Nevertheless, when nurses’ personal and professional cultural identities were at odds, this also contributed to the tension. Undoubtedly, Māori nurses’ personal cultural identities and worldviews influenced how they worked as professional mental health nurses. The contexts and practices that dictated how nurses planned and delivered services constrained their abilities to manage and resolve the tension.</p>

<sec id="section7-1049732312450213">
<title>Going Beyond</title>
<p>The subcategory “going beyond” refers to Māori nurses extending their practice beyond that expected of other registered nurses, with the aim of overcoming challenges and achieving positive outcomes. It was about “going the extra mile” to meet the needs of patients and their families. Going beyond comprised the concepts of “being Māori” and “enduring constant challenge.” “Being Māori” was grounded in Māori nurses’ genealogy, and their upbringing and cultural heritage informed this concept. Cultural identity was a source of these nurses’ commitment to improving Māori health outcomes, and it enabled them to connect and relate to patients and their families:
<disp-quote><p>I’m a Māori who happens to be a nurse—not a nurse who happens to be Māori. And for me, that’s what it is all about, the way that I was brought up, the way that I see the world. I’m a Māori who happens to be a nurse.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Māori nurses’ cultural identification was a source of pride, and they aligned it to engrained cultural imperatives such as caring, sharing, reciprocity, support, and collective responsibility and accountability.</p>
<p>“Enduring constant challenge” is a concept that explains how the cultural attributes Māori nurses brought to their practice helped them to endure the struggles and challenges of living and working in two worlds. Māori nurses became aware of the need to practice in two worlds as early as when they were students, despite the professional nursing rhetoric of caring and holism. They encountered different value bases and ways of practicing to become a registered nurse. Without a sense of choice, they were compelled to rise above and cope with the challenges they encountered by surviving and conforming. Nevertheless, the challenges were ongoing, and they evoked feelings of conflict, tension, and fear when experiences and observations highlighted a practice world that differed in the extreme from Māori nurses’ cultural worlds. The following participant comment illustrates this: “There were a few things I didn’t like. I tried to say something, but who cares? You just see things you know are not culturally appropriate. How do you cope with that? You just cope with it.” Māori nurses were motivated to manage and adapt to situations of conflict and tension by the need to provide improved health services for Māori patients in mental health facilities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049732312450213">
<title>Practicing Differently</title>
<p>This subcategory involved blending the world of Māori with the world of nursing to enable the bridging of two worlds. Practicing differently comprised the concepts of “guardians of spiritual well-being,” “it’s about whānau,” and “connecting” to explain how Māori nurses blended the concepts of their cultural world into practice. Spirituality is a fundamental cornerstone of being Māori. Given the cultural importance of spirituality, Māori nurses became “guardians of spiritual well-being” to protect and maintain the integrity of the spiritual well-being of the tangata whaiora and whānau. This focal point of Māori nurses’ practice contrasted with the illness focus of mainstream mental health services. Participants noted the following: “It’s [spirituality] definitely about considering those things that are unseen and unspoken,” and “<italic>Wairua</italic> [spirituality] is a significant part of that person, not just the psychological and biopsychological kind of aspects of the person, which are predominately part of [a] mental health [nursing] kind of focus.”</p>
<p>Guardians of spiritual well-being was underpinned by a sense of responsibility that ensured the spiritual safety of patients, their families, and colleagues for healing, well-being, and strength. Consequently, Māori nurses recognized their obligation to ensure that rituals associated with customary practice occurred, because to do otherwise spiritually risked misfortune. Māori families involve more than a nuclear family. They are an integral component of Māori society, bound by kinship and cultural traditions that link members by genealogy or a common purpose. Whānau supports its members’ cultural identities, and where kinship (i.e., family and friends) is not available, they come together with a common purpose to form a network of support. In addition to relationships and connections with other family members, collective responsibility, caring, sharing, respect, and support are valued attributes and activities: “We become whānau [family]. We are the whānau to the ones [patients] that haven’t got whānau.” “What I’ve found is if you support the whānau, you don’t have to do a hell of a lot, because the whānau will do it all for you.” Family experiences could also be pivotal in choosing nursing as a career. “It’s about whānau” highlighted the focus on family for Māori nurses’ practice, and it reinforced the need for cultural caring and support, something that was learned and experienced in Māori nurses’ upbringing. Nurses recognized family as an important resource when caring for patients, and a model to employ to create support for Māori nurses within their work units.</p>
<p>Connecting was about the deliberate connection of people to places (i.e., their tribal connections) to uphold the <italic>mana</italic> (status, spiritual power) of patients. It involved nurses facilitating processes for culturally appropriate engagement, including the use of Māori language and rituals. It demonstrated to patients and their families a respect for their cultural traditions:
<disp-quote><p>You can connect in other ways, like hongi to greet and meet. Those are normally the first signs of being able to make contact within someone else’s world. Whichever way you meet and greet them, I think it is very important, being a Māori nurse.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Connecting promoted the sharing of information, and it involved a process of purposeful exploration to enable connections between nurses, patients, and their whānau. This process required an investment of time to meet, greet, and make the necessary connections before therapeutic interventions could proceed. Failing to undertake this process could contribute to a communication breakdown, which disrupted the sharing of crucial information necessary for working toward the well-being and healing of Māori patients. Connecting also required Māori nurses to be flexible and regularly take opportunities to meet and talk face to face, repeating rituals of encounter.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Health is a sociocultural construct grounded in cultural worldviews and traditions, making individuals’ views of health, wellness, and illness an important consideration. This makes patients’ access to culturally appropriate health services dependent on the inclusion of their cultural beliefs and practices in their mental health care. Providing appropriate and effective nursing care requires mental health nurses generally to be confident and competent in identifying Indigenous and minority group patients’ key cultural beliefs and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312450213">Wilson, 2008</xref>). Still, evidence points to a mismatch between Indigenous (and minority group) and mainstream worldviews present in nursing care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312450213">Dobalian &amp; Rivers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312450213">Dodgson &amp; Struthers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312450213">Elder, 2008</xref>). Having diverse health and nursing workforces culturally matched to the populations they serve could optimize our ability to meet the cultural needs of patients and families, and contribute to improving health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312450213">Anonson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312450213">Durie, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312450213">Noone, 2008</xref>). A nursing workforce whose ethnicity reflects the health service’s population is advantageous, because it increases the likelihood of delivering culturally appropriate and acceptable services. Nevertheless, the apparent reality for Māori nurses in this research was a lack of appreciation for the strengths they brought to mental health settings as Māori. Instead, they had to negotiate the tension between two seemingly incongruent worlds.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312450213">Sumner (2010)</xref> maintained, “The identities of patients and nurses are defined in part by the roles they play; and these roles are delimited by the particular lifeworld of the healthcare delivery system” (p.162). Patient advocacy has been at the center of nursing for more than three decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312450213">Bu &amp; Jezewski, 2007</xref>). Inherent in the concept of advocacy is the nurses’ imperative to support patients’ autonomy and to champion their needs, particularly when they are unable to do so for themselves. Advocacy was evident when Māori nurses promoted and defended Māori patients’ cultural practices, which was an apparent component of their practice facilitated by their ability to move between two worlds (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1049732312450213">Figure 2</xref>). Nevertheless, the ability to act as an effective advocate was dependent on factors within the practice environment. Colleagues constantly challenged the nurses in this study, so they needed to advocate for their patients. Bu and Jezewski claimed that even though nurses laid claim to being patient advocates, their attempts at advocacy were not always successful, and at times had negative outcomes.</p>
<p>Nurses generally are familiar with negotiating and resolving tensions in their practice, particularly when their philosophical perspective is inconsistent with medically driven health services. Additionally, contemporary nurses face external tensions (e.g., decreasing resources and changing technologies) that compromise their abilities to implement professionally prescribed attributes, such as caring, holism, and advocacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312450213">Clukey, Hayes, Merrill, &amp; Curtis, 2009</xref>). These attributes enable them to connect with and attend to patients and their families, and provide a sense of job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312450213">Christmas, 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, nurses need to integrate these professionally prescribed attributes into practice to make a difference (Clukey et al.). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312450213">Cortis (2004)</xref> maintained that holistic care has become rhetoric, driven by mainstream ethnocentrism despite expectations of culturally competent care. Many of these taken-for-granted attributes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312450213">Sumner (2010)</xref> suggested, are ideologically based, and they can be difficult to implement. Furthermore, the nature of health service delivery influences the roles nurses and patients undertake, affecting to some extent their identity (Sumner). The imperative to “treat all people the same,” evident in some health services, denies the equitable care necessary to meet the needs of diverse individuals (Blackford &amp; Street, 2000), and in part, this might explain why tenets like caring and holism are not routinely implemented into nurses’ practice.</p>
<p>Ideally, Indigenous Māori cultural values, beliefs, and practices should be congruent with the basic tenets of nursing. Inevitably, it seems there are no guarantees that the philosophical tenets of caring, holism, and advocacy will be evident in the settings in which nurses practice. The integration of these tenets into their practice can be difficult, particularly when they are working in health services driven by a medical ideology that is not only illness-focused and reductionist in nature, but constrained by dwindling resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312450213">Sumner, 2010</xref>). Ironically, on the surface, the holistic, eco-spiritual, collective, and relational nature of Māori culture is not dissimilar to the tenets espoused by the nursing profession internationally. Māori nurses, and similarly other nurses belonging to Indigenous and minority groups, find it difficult to enact the attributes of caring, holism, and advocacy in both professional and cultural contexts.</p>
<p>The motivation for Māori to become nurses is often a desire to improve the experiences of Māori patients and their families when they engage with health services, and contribute to improving their health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732312450213">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>). Similar to other Indigenous nurses, they bring to their nursing practice backgrounds premised on Indigenous worldviews dictating culturally determined responsibilities and obligations. They also possess unique histories of colonization and contemporary experiences of significant social and health inequalities, which drive a sense of commitment to improve outcomes for their people. This can be advantageous when working with patients with similar experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312450213">Durie, 2001</xref>), because their backgrounds position them well with what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312450213">Sumner (2010)</xref> referred to as a level of moral maturity and competence necessary to deliver holistic nursing care.</p>
<p>An undeniable source of tension was the expectation placed on Māori nurses by colleagues to address cultural aspects relating to their patients. This is where Indigenous and nursing concepts of caring, holism, and advocacy appear to deviate. Indeed, contrary to nursing, culturally bound notions of caring, holism, and advocacy are tied to cultural processes and practices. To breach these notions risks the spiritual well-being of both patients and their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312450213">Mead, 2003</xref>). Although many Māori nurses have the cultural resources to facilitate culturally based processes and practices, they often encounter barriers to carrying these out as part of their nursing practice. Additionally, colleagues of Māori nurses expected they had the requisite cultural knowledge, and did not recognize the diversity in contemporary Indigenous cultural identities. A consequence of colonization, this diversity means loss of cultural connections and therefore cultural knowledge for some, who might be on a learning journey themselves.</p>
<p>The nature of the practice setting has an integral influence on Māori nurses’ abilities to be both Māori and nurses. When they entered the world of mainstream mental health services, Māori nurses were expected to behave according to service and professional expectations, whereas Māori patients also expected culturally cognizant behaviors. Hence, there was a need to be dually competent in nursing and in cultural aspects that influenced the health and well-being of their Indigenous patients. This resulted in tension and anxiety when these nurses attempted to reconcile two different worlds in their quest to achieve better outcomes for their patients. Māori nurses were acutely aware that Māori patients’ experiences (i.e., of differential access to determinants of health, differential access to and use of health services, and differences in the quality of care they received) were something recognized as institutional racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312450213">Harris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312450213">Jones, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312450213">Reid, Robson, &amp; Jones, 2000</xref>). These enduring, constant challenges and mainstream health-service demands compromise and erode Māori nurses’ cultural backgrounds when they are unable to carry them out in a culturally acceptable manner, which forces them to conform to dominant cultural demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312450213">Baker, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312450213">Nursing Council of New Zealand (2011)</xref> is committed to all registered nurses demonstrating competency in cultural safety. It is noteworthy that in this research, cultural safety did not appear to extend to collegial relationships. The origins of cultural safety are in the area of social justice and Indigenous rights, influenced by the unsafe cultural experiences reported by Māori patients and nurses accessing mainstream health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312450213">Ramsden, 2002</xref>). Cultural safety requires nurses to critically examine their own cultural location and how this affects the nurse–patient power balance and their relationships when working with others from a different cultural orientation. The expectation placed on Indigenous nurses to be the “cultural experts” ignores the diverse realities of contemporary Indigenous peoples. Despite the notion that dual competency offers potential benefits to Indigenous patients, it does place an additional burden on Māori nurses, a burden their colleagues do not necessarily have.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Māori nurses are a valuable resource within mental health services. This research provides an explanation of their practice and the important role they play in providing culturally attuned care. Even though many Māori nurses appeared resilient when navigating the two worlds, we must consider the ongoing stress they experienced. The nonrecognition of ongoing stress associated with navigating the two worlds might contribute to retention issues, risking the attrition of Indigenous nurses from an already underresourced sector. To minimize such stress, professional development should include cultural supervision along with targeted development that assists in the negotiation of the two worlds, evident in central and local workforce policy.</p>
<p>Even though this study was relatively small, saturation of the data occurred relatively quickly. Thus, it provides insight into an area of practice with which nurses from minority groups grapple. We must take caution when applying the findings to other settings. Having said this, we recommend additional research in this area. There was also a deliberate decision to keep contextual descriptions broad, because the Māori mental health nursing workforce is relatively small. Hence, we made every attempt to ensure the removal of identifying features that risked revealing the identity of individual nurses.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We cannot overstate the significance of minority-group patients’ worldviews in nursing practice and delivery of mental health services. Understanding the cultural impact of their health values, beliefs, and practices highlights the added dimensions and value of Indigenous and minority nurses, like Māori in mental health nursing practice settings. Indigenous or minority health workforces play an important role in addressing the burden of mental illness suffered by their respective patients. “Bridging two worlds” explains how Indigenous nurses resolved the tensions they experienced when working in the worlds of the nursing profession and their culture of origin. They did this by “going beyond” and “practicing differently.” Educators, health service managers, and policymakers need to be aware of the tensions experienced by nurses, like Māori nurses who need to bridge and navigate two worlds.</p>
