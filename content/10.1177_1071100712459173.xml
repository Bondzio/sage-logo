<sec id="section1-1071100712459173">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to determine whether tightness of the posterior muscles of the lower extremity was associated with plantar fasciitis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1071100712459173">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A total of 100 lower limbs of 100 subjects, 50 with plantar fasciitis and 50 matching controls were recruited. Hamstring and calf muscles were evaluated through the straight leg elevation test, popliteal angle test, and ankle dorsiflexion (knee extended and with the knee flexed). All variables were compared between the 2 groups. In addition, ROC curves, sensitivity, and specificity of the muscle contraction tests were also calculated to determine their potential predictive powers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1071100712459173">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Differences between the 2 groups for the tests used to assess muscular shortening were significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) in all cases. The straight leg elevation test and ankle dorsiflexion with the knee extended presented respective sensitivities of 94% and 100% and specificities of 82% and 96% as diagnostic tests for the participants in this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1071100712459173">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Tightness of the posterior muscles of the lower limb was present in the plantar fasciitis patients, but not in the unaffected participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1071100712459173">
<title>Clinical Relevance:</title>
<p>The results of this study suggest that therapists who are going to employ a stretching protocol for treatment of plantar fasciitis should look for both hamstring as well as triceps surae tightness. Stretching exercise programs could be recommended for treatment of plantar fasciitis, focusing on stretching the triceps surae and hamstrings, apart from an adequate tissue-specific plantar fascia-stretching protocol.</p>

<body>
<p>Plantar fasciitis (PF) is a pathological condition whose etiology is multifactorial. Some of the risk factors involved are sport or physical exercise,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712459173">13</xref></sup> being overweight,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1071100712459173">22</xref></sup> age,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712459173">14</xref></sup> gender,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1071100712459173">27</xref></sup> prolonged standing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712459173">19</xref></sup> increased subtalar pronation accompanying pes cavus or flat feet,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712459173">15</xref></sup> and limited ankle dorsiflexion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1071100712459173">30</xref></sup> There have been few studies about the relationship between tightness of the posterior lower limb muscles and PF, and most of them can be interpreted in terms of some contracture of the posterior muscles of the leg or thigh being present in cases of PF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712459173">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712459173">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The posture that the individual adopts during sleep could also influence the contracture of these muscles, as has been demonstrated in studies of patients who have spent a prolonged period bedridden.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712459173">10</xref></sup> A supine position fosters permanent plantarflexion of the ankle due to the weight of the bedding, and this tends to tighten the triceps surae. Similarly, a prone position requires plantarflexion of the ankle, thus contracting the posterior leg muscles.</p>
<p>A great variety of therapeutic regimens have been described and are widely used as valid treatments for PF, which include dietetic measures in overweight subjects, pharmacologic treatment such as oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory or steroid injections; orthotics including foot orthoses or night splints; physical therapy including cryotherapy, ultrasound, laser, and tapes; and surgical procedures such as partial or total release of the plantar fascia. In addition, stretching programs remain an important conservative treatment for PF since they might be acting directly on causative factors such as shortness of posterior musculature of the lower limb.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1071100712459173">33</xref></sup> The results of various studies suggest that tightness of the posterior muscles of the lower limb could be involved in PF etiology, and that stretching programs have beneficial effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712459173">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712459173">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712459173">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712459173">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712459173">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1071100712459173">32</xref></sup> The main objective of this study was to determine whether tightness of the posterior lower limb muscles existed in PF participants compared to matched controls without this condition. The null hypothesis was that there was no difference between the PF group and the control group in tightness of the posterior muscular chain of the lower extremity.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section8-1071100712459173">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>A total of 100 subjects, 34 men and 66 women, aged 48.4 ± 15.2 years, and with BMI 28.9 ± 4.5, took part in this study. Tightness of hamstrings and calf muscles was measured. The participants were patients who satisfied the inclusion criteria and gave their written informed consent to voluntarily participate in the study.</p>
<p>The required sample size was calculated using the software G*Power 3.1.3, assuming an alpha error of 5% and a beta error of 5% to estimate the difference between 2 independent samples using one-tailed tests and with a large effect size (<italic>d</italic> &gt; 0.8). The result was that a minimum of 35 cases per group was necessary. The work was carried out between October 2009 and March 2011 and was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Seville.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1071100712459173">
<title>Selection Criteria</title>
<p>The study participants were assigned to 2 groups: one of individuals with PF (study group) and the other of individuals without PF (control group). The inclusion criterion for the study group was a diagnosis of PF according to the following clinical manifestations: pain in the plantar medial region of the plantar surface of the heel, with possible radiation toward the medial edge and to the rest of the sole of the foot; pain increase when the patients took their first steps in the morning and after prolonged standing; pain increase with direct pressure on the plantar medial region of the heel; and pain increase with repeated pressure on the same area with the toes dorsiflexed passively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712459173">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712459173">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1071100712459173">29</xref></sup> Patients who served as the control group presented for elimination of hyperkeratosis or treatment of nail disorders. Those in the control group were matched in age, sex, lower limb side, and BMI with the study group subjects. Exclusion criteria for both groups were osteoarticular pathology in the hip, knee, or ankle that caused pain or restricted movement; neuromuscular disease; disorders related to heel pain, such as subcalcaneal bursitis, Achilles tendon bursitis, Haglund’s exostosis, or fracture of the calcaneus; or a history of recent trauma to the lower limbs or elective surgery. Specifically, subjects were excluded from the study group if they had been treated for PF with muscle stretching exercises or night splints, or who reported some direct trauma as being the origin of the plantar pain. Data were finally collected for 50 patients with PF and 50 controls.</p>
<p>In cases where PF was unilateral, the affected limb was the one measured. In cases where PF was bilateral, only the more affected limb was included, or, if both were affected equally, a coin toss was used to select the limb to measure at random.</p>
<p>Bilateral PF was present in 22 participants and unilateral PF was present in 28 participants in the study group. Individuals were assigned to the control group by pair matching. Nevertheless, it was verified that there were no differences between groups regarding age and BMI (BMI in control group 28.2 ± 4.2, BMI in PF group 29.6 ± 4.8, <italic>P</italic> = .12; age in control group 48.6 ± 15.4, age in PF group 48.2 ± 15.1, <italic>P</italic> = .89).</p>

<sec id="section10-1071100712459173">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The straight leg elevation test (SLET), popliteal angle (PA), ankle dorsiflexion with the knee extended (ADFKE), and ankle dorsiflexion with the knee flexed (ADFKF) were measured in the participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100712459173">Figures 1a</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100712459173">1d</xref>). The SLET determines specifically the stiffness of the elastic component of the hamstring muscle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712459173">25</xref></sup> It was performed with the patient laying supine on the examination table with the hip and knee in neutral position. The leg was elevated gradually, with the knee extended, until feeling discomfort due to tension in the posterior aspect of the thigh, or until the examiner observed the contralateral limb beginning to rise. At that time, a 2-arm goniometer was used to measure the angle formed between the lower limb and the examination table. The center of the goniometer was placed on the greater trochanter, one arm parallel to the lateral aspect of the thigh and the other arm parallel to the examination table. An angle of 80 degrees was considered normal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712459173">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712459173">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1071100712459173">24</xref></sup></p>

<p>The PA provided another test of the elasticity of the hamstrings muscles. The participant was lying supine on the examination table with hip and knee flexed at 90 degrees. The knee was extended gradually until the participant complained of discomfort, due to firm resistance, in the posterior aspect of the thigh. At that time the angle formed by the lateral bisection of the thigh and leg was measured. The center of the goniometer was placed on the lateral aspect of the knee, coinciding with the axis of rotation. One arm was positioned parallel to the lateral bisection of the thigh, and the other was directed toward the lateral malleolus. The residual knee flexion angle was measured as the degrees lacking from full extension, which is 180 degrees. The normal range was considered to be 0–15 degrees,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712459173">25</xref></sup> while values of 16 to 34 degrees corresponded to moderate hamstring contracture, and values greater than or equal to 35 degrees corresponded to severe contracture.</p>
<p>Ankle dorsiflexion was measured with the knee extended and with the knee flexed at 90 degrees. The participant was laying in supine on the examination table and the subtalar joint in neutral position. The goniometer was placed with the fixed arm parallel to the lateral bisection of the leg and the mobile arm parallel to the fifth metatarsal. At least 10 degrees had to be obtained to consider ADFKE as normal, and 15 degrees with the knee flexed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712459173">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1071100712459173">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>The final value of each variable measured with the goniometer was obtained by the mean of 3 repeated measurements. Measurements were always made by the same researcher (YAB).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1071100712459173">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed using the SPSS software package (SPSS Science, Chicago, Illinois). To analyze the intraobserver reliability of the quantitative variables, the intraclass correlation coefficient (3,1) was calculated. Twelve participants were selected at random (6 from each group), and 3 measurements were made of these variables, with a 1-week period between each measurement.</p>
<p>The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test applied to the data from the quantitative variables showed the distribution to be non-normal, so comparisons and correlations were made using the nonparametric Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test and Spearman’s rho, respectively. The effect size for comparisons was calculated by means of Cohen’s d using the formula (Mean 1 − Mean 2)/([SD1 + SD2]/2), where the value of d is positive if the difference between the means is in the predicted sense. This parameter classifies the effect size as small if d = 0.20, medium if d = 0.50, and large if d is greater than or equal to 0.80.</p>
<p>Correlations between the quantitative variables using Spearman’s rho were also calculated, with a two-tailed test of significance. The effect size for correlations was considered small if ρ = 0.10, medium if ρ = 0.30, and large if ρ ≥ 0.50.</p>
<p>The method of ROC curves was used to evaluate the diagnostic power of the ADFKE and SLET variables, determining the area under the curve and the cutoff points. From these curves, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive powers were calculated, together with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Differences were considered statistically significant when <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1071100712459173" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The results for the intraclass correlation coefficient showed good intraobserver reliability in the quantitative variable measurement procedure. In particular, for SLET, the correlation coefficient was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.834, 0.990); for PA, 0.99 (95% CI: 0.990, 0.999); for ADFKE, 0.99 (95% CI: 0.972, 0.999); and for ADFKF, 0.95 (95% CI: 0.795, 0.997).</p>
<p>The comparison of the values of SLET, PA, ADFKE, and ADFKF between the two groups showed statistically significant differences in all cases. Mean, standard deviations, 95% confidence intervals (CIs), medians, and interquartile ranges for the 2 groups are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712459173">Table 1</xref>, together with Cohen’s d and the <italic>P</italic> value for comparisons.</p>

As it can be observed, the 2 variables that measure the contracture of the hamstring musculature are strongly correlated, as are the 2 variables that measure the contracture of the posterior muscles of the leg. Therefore, in the study of ROC curves and predictive powers, sensitivity, and specificity, only one of each of these 2 pairs of variables was used. SLET was chosen because it was found to be referred more often in the literature, and ADFKF because it involves the assessment of all of the triceps surae muscular bellies (ADFKF evaluates only the soleus).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Before discussing the results, the authors would like to clarify that this study design does not allow establishing any cause–effect relationship since it does not provide data on temporal relationships between PF and the variables measured, by means of comparing cohorts. It is therefore important to stress that, while the factors studied in the present seem to be associated with the development of this pathology, they are not the only ones involved.</p>
<p>The relationship between PF and contracture of the posterior muscles of the lower extremity has previously been studied. Rome et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1071100712459173">28</xref></sup> found no statistically significant differences (<italic>P</italic> = .39) between a control group and a group with PF with respect to limited ankle dorsiflexion. Taunton et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1071100712459173">30</xref></sup> retrospectively reviewed 267 cases of PF, of which only 43 (16%) had excessive contracture of the gastrocnemius–soleus complex. Irving et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712459173">14</xref></sup> reported a case-control study that included ankle dorsiflexion as a variable. The results showed the PF group to present greater values of this angle than the control group.</p>
<p>On the other hand, most current evidence suggests that tight gastrocnemius is an etiologic factor for PF. Kibler et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712459173">16</xref></sup> studied 43 athletes’ feet with PF; they observed that 37 of them showed a decreased range of ankle dorsiflexion in the affected limb compared with the nonaffected one. Riddle et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1071100712459173">26</xref></sup> observed significant differences (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) in the limitation of ankle dorsiflexion in a PF group compared with a control group. Patel and Digiovanni<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1071100712459173">23</xref></sup> examined 254 patients with PF and found that 83% had limited ankle dorsiflexion, 57% had an isolated contracture of the gastrocnemius, 26% had a contracture of the gastrocnemius-soleus complex, and 17% did not have a dorsiflexion limitation. These authors observed an equinus contracture in 83% of acute cases and 82% of chronic cases. An isolated contracture of the gastrocnemius was found in 60% of acute cases and 52% of chronic cases. A gastrocnemius-soleus complex contracture was noted in 23% of acute cases and 30% of chronic cases. Digiovanni et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712459173">6</xref></sup> carried out a clinical trial in which the patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: One group received instructions for a plantar fascia tissue-stretching program, and the other group for an Achilles tendon–stretching program for 8 weeks. Both groups reported an overall reduction in pain, although a greater improvement was noted in those patients who followed the plantar fascia tissue stretching. However, these authors reported long-term benefits of both stretching protocols,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712459173">7</xref></sup> and they found no significant differences between the groups at 2-year followup. These results suggest that shortness of the posterior muscles of the leg plays an important role in the development of PF, although this is not the only etiologic factor.</p>
<p>Harty et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712459173">12</xref></sup> observed a significant contracture of the hamstrings muscles in a group of subjects with PF compared with a control group. Domínguez et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712459173">8</xref></sup> observed a limited ankle dorsiflexion and knee extension in most of the PF subjects, which would confirm contracture of triceps surae and hamstrings. Labovitz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712459173">14</xref></sup> found that patients with hamstring tightness were about 8.7 times as likely to experience PF in the corresponding foot compared with patients without hamstring tightness. The results of the above-mentioned studies support the functional deficit of the plantar fascia caused by hamstring shortening. That is, tight hamstrings could increase knee flexion, which in turn would induce prolonged forefoot loading and would engage the windlass mechanism. Also, when tight posterior leg muscle group exists, ankle range of motion is limited, and it may be compensated by excessive pronation of the subtalar joint, causing tension on the plantar fascia.</p>
<p>The ROC curves for the SLET and ADFKE showed high specificity and sensitivity, that is, subjects with contracture of the posterior leg muscles are more likely to develop PF. Despite this close relationship, these tests cannot be used for the diagnosis of PF. This would have required a cohort study with prospective followup of subjects with shortening of these muscles to verify whether or not they eventually develop PF. Nonetheless, in the authors’ opinion, the present results could serve as a basis for future investigations.</p>
<p>Regarding the fact that the sleeping posture could also influence the contracture of these muscles, some references on the impact that sleeping posture might have on the musculature of the calf were found.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712459173">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712459173">10</xref></sup> Bowers et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712459173">5</xref></sup> suggested that during the hours of sleep in a prone or supine position, the foot assumes a plantarflexed posture, which could lead to contracture of the gastrocnemius muscle. The prolonged stays in bed in a supine position of ICU patients caused equinus feet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712459173">10</xref></sup> The authors believe that a prone/supine sleep posture may also contribute to contracture of the calf muscles and plantar fascia by maintaining the foot in a plantarflexed posture, and thus be a factor influencing the development of PF, but this subject requires further research.</p>
<p>A practical application of the present results could be for the therapist to include examination of the posterior muscles of the lower extremity, that is, the triceps surae and hamstrings, in the examination protocol of PF patients. Also, stretching exercises could be recommended for the treatment of PF, focusing on stretching the triceps surae and hamstrings along with other measures such as rest or use of physiological footwear and foot orthoses.</p>
