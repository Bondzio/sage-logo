<abstract>
<p><italic>Background</italic>: In Canada, there are an estimated 400 home parenteral nutrition (HPN) patients. In 2006, a registry was created to gather patient outcome information. The aim of this study was to validate the registry and report on HPN patient outcomes. <italic>Methods</italic>: Several demographic, clinical parameters were collected. For the validation, paired <italic>t</italic> test and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used to assess agreement between repeat entries. For the outcome report, paired <italic>t</italic> test was used to assess changes, and survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. <italic>Results</italic>: On validation, there was high correlation/agreement (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) for most parameters except vascular access/line sepsis, liver disease (ultrasound, biopsy, diagnoses), and hospitalizations. For the outcome report, 96 patients had their data entered at 2.24 ± 0.11 years after baseline. Over the period, there was a significant reduction in PN calories (<italic>P</italic> = .001) and proteins (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). There were no significant changes in nutrition parameters and laboratory results except for lower platelet counts (<italic>P</italic> = .028), lower plasma potassium (<italic>P</italic> = .030), and a trend toward an increase in bilirubin from 19.29 ± 4.65 to 29.06 ± 8.73 µmol/L (<italic>P</italic> = .071). The QOL decreased significantly over time (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and the survival on HPN was 17.67 ± 1.89 years. <italic>Conclusions</italic>: The registry is a valid tool to assess several clinical parameters. On follow-up, HPN patients maintain good nutrition status while PN is reduced but do have a reduced quality of life.</p>

<title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title>
<p>The findings from this outcome report on the Canadian home parenteral nutrition (HPN) patient population help us better assess the nutrition and clinical needs of our patients, particularly with PN manganese, intravenous (IV) pamidronate supplementation, and PN-related liver disease. In addition, it has helped identify gaps in clinical care, particularly with respect to the poor consistent documentation of line sepsis and hospitalizations. Although we are addressing the outcomes within a subset of the Canadian HPN population, we highlight the need for research that focuses on transforming the patient experience. This includes health services research to inform and facilitate changes to models of care delivery and clinical trials to improve patient outcomes and survival.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In a population of 30 million, it is estimated that approximately 400 patients receive home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in Canada, based on data from current health services providers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607111434599">1</xref></sup> This prevalence of HPN patients is higher than that reported in Europe, where there are approximately 2–3 patients/y per million inhabitants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607111434599">2</xref></sup>. However, Canadian figures remain smaller than the reported yearly prevalence in the United States of 140 patients per million persons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607111434599">3</xref></sup> However, these reported rates are from old sources, and there is paucity of reports in the literature on more recent prevalence data for HPN in the United States or Europe. Since its inception, HPN has improved long-term survival in patients with intestinal failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607111434599">4</xref></sup> mostly due to short bowel syndrome and motility disorders. However, HPN is also associated with numerous complications such as PN-related liver disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607111434599">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607111434599"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607111434599">7</xref></sup> metabolic bone disease (MBD),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607111434599">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607111434599"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607111434599">10</xref></sup> trace metal or vitamin deficits,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607111434599">11</xref></sup> catheter sepsis and occlusions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607111434599">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607111434599"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607111434599">14</xref></sup> and psychosocial issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607111434599">15</xref></sup> Patients’ outcome is mainly influenced by underlying disease, but complications related to HPN also contribute to morbidity and mortality. Other factors may also play a role such as access to healthcare services and professionals as well as patient education, family, and social support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607111434599">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607111434599">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Canadian HPN registry was created in 2006 to assess HPN patient demography in Canada as well as to determine the factors affecting survival, complications, and PN dependency. The first results were reported by Raman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607111434599">1</xref></sup> in 2007, who showed that HPN was associated with numerous complications (catheter sepsis, 28.6%; catheter change, 50%; abnormal liver enzymes, 27%; metabolic bone disease, 60%; PN-related hospitalizations, 44%).</p>
<p>The objective of the present study was to (1) validate the reporting of data into the registry and (2) provide follow-up results on this cohort of patients, assessing complication and survival rates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0148607111434599" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Since 2006, HPN programs across Canada are invited to participate in the HPN registry. The HPN team members are asked to sign a participating agreement and obtain institutional research ethics board approval. After approval, HPN programs receive instructions and passwords that allow them to access the registry.</p>
<p>The Canadian HPN registry is a Web-based registry designed to collect information on demography (age, gender) and gastrointestinal (GI) anatomy, indications for HPN, nutrition assessment (weight, height, body mass index [BMI], estimated energy and protein requirements) and HPN regimen, vascular access, quality of life (Karnofsky performance scale), laboratory investigations, medication, liver investigations, metabolic bone density, hospitalizations, and survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607111434599">1</xref></sup> All HPN patients are required to consent before their clinical data are entered in the registry. Patients may be excluded from the registry because they receive IV hydration only, their PN is discontinued shortly after initiation, or patients died before being approached for consent.</p>
<p>First, we performed a study to validate the data entry into the registry. Chart review was conducted a second time by blinded individuals who were asked to reenter baseline (2006) clinical data into the registry. No access to original forms or online registry was permitted during the validation process, which was performed at 2 of the 6 participating centers: University Health Network (UHN) and St Michael’s Hospital (SMH). Because the findings are very similar between these 2 centers, and because of space issues, we will report on 1 center only.</p>
<p>Second, we conducted the follow-up study between 2008 and 2009. Four of the 6 participating centers entered their follow-up data at that time: Alberta Health Services, Edmonton (AHS-Edmonton), SMH, UHN, and Hamilton Health Sciences (HHS). Only charts of patients entered at baseline were considered for this study. For this, the second set of data was entered between 2 and 4 years after baseline, following the same protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607111434599">1</xref></sup> Demography, GI anatomy, indication for HPN, nutrition assessment, HPN regimen, vascular access, quality of life, laboratory results, bone density, hospitalizations, medications, and mortality were recorded. For laboratory results, patients had to be clinically stable (ie, without being in the hospital or without presenting with line sepsis) and with stable blood work for at least 3–4 months. Quality of life was assessed by the Karnofsky performance scale (KS), which is a graded scale, from 0–100 with intervals of 10, used to evaluate a patient’s autonomy to work and to self-care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607111434599">18</xref></sup> These abilities are assessed by using a standard questionnaire filled in by the PN nurse or clinician. A KS score ≤40 indicates patients requiring constant assistance and medical care.</p>
<sec id="section4-0148607111434599">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data were collected by the registry and extracted using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA) and subsequently imported into the statistical software program SPSS version 16 (SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, IL) for analysis.</p>
<p>For the validation study, a paired <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare the entries, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess correlation and agreement between 2 entries. For the 2-year follow-up, descriptive statistics were used to explore data; χ<sup>2</sup> test was used to assess outcomes, and paired <italic>t</italic> test was used to assess changes between baseline and follow-up. Survival graphs were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Factors affecting survival such as the length of short bowel, presence of hyperbilirubinemia, and tumor/cancer were evaluated using Breslow (generalized Wilcoxon) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 = significant difference). Results are expressed as mean ± SEM.</p>

<title>Validation of HPN Registry</title>
<p>Baseline data were entered twice by different healthcare professionals and then compared (data not shown). Nutrition assessment parameters, including body weight, height, estimated energy requirements, and PN prescription, showed no statistical difference between the 2 entries, and there was significant correlation and agreement between entries except for the amount of chromium in the PN prescription. There was also a significant correlation and agreement between the 2 entries for most blood work parameters except sodium and chloride. Because of the small number of patients with data regarding folate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and vitamin D blood work, comparative analysis could not be done for these parameters. For data collected regarding type of vascular access, number of lumens, method of line insertion, and number of line sepsis events, only the number of lumens revealed a statistically significant ICC. Karnofsky performance scale ratings performed by the same person at baseline and at the time of the repeat entry revealed significant agreement (ICC = 0.730, <italic>P</italic> = .001). However, there was a very low ICC for data collected on the PN-related liver disease, ultrasound, and biopsy results. On the other hand, for bone mineral density (BMD), the ICC showed a highly significant (<italic>P</italic> = .0001) correlation and agreement between the 2 entries for the spine <italic>T</italic> score (ICC = 0.932), femoral neck <italic>T</italic> score (ICC = 0.992), and hip <italic>T</italic> score (ICC = 0.971). Hospitalization data were found to have very low ICC (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05) values, indicating that the reporting of hospitalizations was not in agreement.</p>

<title>Follow-Up Cohort Study</title>
<sec id="section8-0148607111434599">
<title>Demography and GI Anatomy</title>
<p>For the follow-up study, a total of 96 patients had their second set of data entered in 2009, at 2.24 ± 0.11 years from baseline: 36.5% male and 63.5% female. Of these patients, PN duration was 88.1 ± 8.2 months, and the most common indication for HPN was short bowel syndrome (SBS; 60.4%). Other indications for HPN included mucosal defects (11.5%) such as celiac disease, radiation enteritis, and microvillus inclusion; motility disorders (12.5%) such as pseudo-obstruction and Hirschsprung disease; oncology (7.3%); surgical complications (3.1%); pancreatic disease (1.0%); and others (4.2%). The primary cause of SBS was Crohn disease at 48.3%. The mean length of small bowel was 96.9 ± 15.0 cm with 49.5% of patients having GI anastomosis. The most common type of ostomy was ileostomy (58.3%) followed by jejunostomy (20.8%) and colostomy (16.7%).</p>

<sec id="section9-0148607111434599">
<title>Nutrition Assessment and HPN Regimen</title>
<p>Over the 2-year study period, body weight remained stable and PN was cycled for an average of 12 hours/d; however, PN prescription decreased for fat emulsions, dextrose, amino acids, calories, and PN d/wk (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607111434599">Table 1</xref>). Of the 96 patients entered at baseline, 19 (19.8%) had discontinued HPN, 43 (44.8%) were still on HPN, and 34 (35.4%) were deceased.</p>

<title>Vascular Access</title>
<p>In 2006, the most common type of line used for infusion was tunneled catheter (42.1%), with the majority of catheters being single lumen (65.5%). This frequency remained fairly constant in 2009, with 56.1% of patients having tunneled catheters and 62.2% of them being single lumen. In 2006, line sepsis events were reported at a rate of 0.55 ± 0.12 per year, and there was no information entered regarding changes in vascular access. By 2009, the number of events had decreased to 0.30 ± 0.08 per year. Regarding changes in vascular access, 56% of changes were due to line sepsis, 24% were due to line breakage, and 20% were for line occlusion. However, based on our validation study, results related to line sepsis should be discussed with caution because of the poor reporting.</p>

These changes are likely not clinically relevant but may reflect PN weaning and progressive liver disease, respectively. The other blood work results remained stable over time.</p>

<title>Liver Investigations</title>
<p>From 2006–2009, there were no significant changes in liver enzymes; however, there was a nonsignificant trend (<italic>P</italic> = .071) toward an increase in bilirubin between the baseline and 2-year follow-up data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148607111434599">Table 2</xref>). This increase was significantly greater in patients who were on HPN for more than 5 years. The change in bilirubin for patients with less than 5 years on HPN was −5.47 ± 5.62 µmol/L vs 27.21 ± 12.85 µmol/L for those over 5 years (<italic>P</italic> = .023). There was a trend toward an increase in bilirubin over 2 years from 19.29 ± 4.65 to 29.06 ± 8.73 µmol/L (<italic>P</italic> = .071). Of the 96 patients, 81.3% (78/96) had no liver disease diagnosed at baseline. Five patients had liver biopsies reported at baseline. At follow-up, 16.7% (n = 13) of the 78 patients reported for these data had liver disease diagnosed by their physicians. Of these, 92.3% were reported to have PN-related liver disease, but only 3 patients had liver biopsies reported. The presence of liver disease and PN-related liver disease was diagnosed by the physician based on standard clinical practice, which includes deterioration of liver function tests, abdominal ultrasound findings suggestive of liver cirrhosis, assessments regarding other causes of liver diseases, clinical judgment, and, with some patients, liver biopsies.</p>

<p>Baseline and follow-up bone mineral density was done in 34 of 96 patients using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in lumbar spine, femoral neck, and hip.

<title>Hospitalization</title>
<p>In 2006, each patient experienced an average 1.10 ± 0.18 complications per year that resulted in hospitalization. Of these, 0.74 ± 0.25 per year were due to PN-related complications (line or liver related). By 2009, this had reduced nonsignificantly to 0.92 ± 0.14 hospitalizations with 0.34 ± 0.08 PN-related hospitalizations. Again, hospitalization data should be discussed with caution because of the poor validation of registry data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0148607111434599">
<title>Survival</title>
<p>Of the 96 patients with a follow-up, 53 patients were no longer on HPN. Of these, 19 discontinued PN, including 1 patient who had intestinal transplantation. Of the 34 deaths, 10 were PN-related deaths (1 due to line sepsis, 9 due to PN-related liver disease). Of the other 24 deaths, 8 were from unknown causes as patients were hospitalized or deceased in the periphery, 7 were from cancer, and the others were from pneumonia, cardiac failure, posttransplant complications, and non-PN-related liver disease. No other information on causes of death was available in the registry data.</p>
<p>The combined mean survival was 17.67 ± 1.89 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.96–21.38; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607111434599">Figure 1</xref>). The probability of survival at 5 and 10 years on HPN was 82% and 60%, respectively. When the combined survival for both centers was stratified for small bowel (SB) &lt;50 cm vs SB ≥50 cm, there was no difference in survival (mean survival years [95% CI] SB &lt;50 cm in length: 20.12 ± 3.91 [12.45–27.77]; SB ≥50 cm in length: 16.78 ± 2.51 [11.86–21.70]; <italic>P</italic> = .756). There was a trend for patients with a bilirubin level greater than 22 µmol/L to have a lower survival when compared with patients with normal levels: 11.08 ± 2.55 years (95% CI, 6.09–16.07) vs 18.30 ± 2.10 (95% CI, 14.18–22.42) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0148607111434599">Figure 2</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study is the first to report on outcomes of the Canadian HPN population. First, a validation of the registry was performed. Results show that most of the nutrition parameters, with the exception of chromium, and most of the blood work, with the exception of sodium and chloride, were in agreement, with high correlation and ICC score, indicating that this Web-based registry is valid for most of these parameters. However, other parameters such as vascular access, line infections, liver disease, and hospitalization need better documentation.</p>
<p>Second, we show that the outcomes of the Canadian HPN patient population are similar to other countries, although the patient demography is somewhat different.</p>
<p>The demographic differences relate to the proportion of oncology patients receiving HPN. Oncology cases represent the largest percentage of HPN patients in some countries such as the Netherlands (60%),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607111434599">2</xref></sup> Italy (57%),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607111434599">19</xref></sup> the United States (42%),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607111434599">20</xref></sup> and Japan (40%),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607111434599">21</xref></sup> whereas it is only 7.3% of the Canadian HPN patients. This number is very similar to the HPN patients in the United Kingdom and Ireland, as reported by Mughal and Irving.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607111434599">22</xref></sup> The smaller proportion of oncology patients receiving HPN based on our registry is probably due to a combination of factors such as a very well-developed provincial palliative care system across Canada and philosophy of care. Because our healthcare system is a universal access system, reimbursement should not be a significant factor.</p>
<p>In terms of nutrition, there was a decrease in PN calories with no changes in body weight and BMI. This is suggestive of patients being weaned from PN, although data regarding oral intake and GI reassessments such as fecal fat content are missing from the registry. Prescriptions of PN were adequate for the most part. However, when reviewing trace elements, PN manganese (Mn) levels reported in the registry were higher than what is recommended by American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) guidelines, with a mean daily Mn supplementation of 8.28 ± 0.46 µmol/d in 2006 and 5.87 ± 0.43 µmol/d in 2009, which exceeds the A.S.P.E.N. 2002 recommendations of 1.09–1.82 µmol/d (60–100 µg/d).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607111434599">23</xref></sup> However, these values are within the American Medical Association (AMA) guidelines of 2.73–14.56 µmol/d (150–800 µg/d) for adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148607111434599">24</xref></sup> Manganese has affinity for the extrapyramidal system and in excess can be neurotoxic, with patients presenting Parkinsonian-like symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607111434599">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148607111434599"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148607111434599"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148607111434599"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0148607111434599"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0148607111434599"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0148607111434599"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0148607111434599">32</xref></sup> In Canada, there are a very limited number of commercial preparations for trace elements, and therefore, the most available commercial preparation used by most programs contains a higher amount of manganese. Although no plasma manganese levels were reported in the registry, we recently performed a cross-sectional study showing high plasma manganese levels and manganese deposition in a large proportion of HPN patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0148607111434599">33</xref></sup> Therefore, Canadian HPN programs are currently reconsidering the present commercial preparation, and the aim is to lower the amount of manganese in all PN prescriptions.</p>
<p>Based on the validation study, there was poor agreement for data related to changes in vascular access or line sepsis. This is likely because many patients are being diagnosed and treated at peripheral sites, and line infection incidents are not necessarily reported or underreported in the charts of HPN programs. Many of these incidents are often reported verbally by the patient or by the peripheral physician. As a result of the poor chart documentation, we have undertaken to develop a patient diary booklet where patients will document specific incidents such as line infection and hospitalization. This will likely increase the accuracy of reporting.</p>
<p>Data related to quality of life measured by the KS showed very strong agreement and correlation between observers; there was significant decline in the KS score for patients over the 2.24 ± 0.11 years. However, despite the validation of the KS score, it is not a complete assessment of quality of life (QOL) as the score could be a result of the underlying disease or the HPN. Also, it looks at one aspect of physical parameters, whereas true QOL assessments need to include emotional, social, and occupational parameters. A review by Baxter et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0148607111434599">34</xref></sup> concluded that because both HPN and underlying disease may affect QOL, an evaluation of QOL would require the separation of these 2 issues. Studies showed that QOL scores with HPN worsened in persons older than 45 years,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0148607111434599">35</xref></sup> in female patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0148607111434599">36</xref></sup> and in narcotic-addicted individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0148607111434599">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Documentation of PN-related liver disease was based on the physician’s clinical judgment and investigations as well as response to changes in PN regimen or pharmacotherapy. Although the liver enzymes, bilirubin, and total protein were found to be in agreement, tests such as liver biopsies and ultrasounds were infrequently documented in the registry. Mildly abnormal liver function tests (elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, transaminase levels &gt;1.5 times normal upper limits) were common in HPN patients and may reflect hepatic dysfunction associated with either preexisting illnesses, such as Crohn disease and intra-abdominal infection, or PN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607111434599">6</xref></sup> Although over time there was no significant change in liver enzymes, we did find a trend toward an increase in bilirubin, especially in patients with more than 5 years of HPN. This is in keeping with findings by Cavicchi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607111434599">5</xref></sup> that showed an increased prevalence of complicated PN-related liver disease associated with longer duration of PN. In this report, the prevalence of severe histological lesions clearly increased during the course of HPN, reaching 56% after 8 years. In our population, 16.7% of the 78 patients were diagnosed with liver disease during the 2-year follow-up, and 92.3% of the 13 cases of liver disease were reported to be PN-related liver disease. This is similar to findings by Bowyer et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0148607111434599">37</xref></sup> who reported that 15% of their 60 patients developed chronic liver disease. A study on liver dysfunction in long-term PN patients showed a higher prevalence in patients with massive SB resection, suggesting a possible association between the risk of liver disease and length of SB remnant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607111434599">7</xref></sup> Furthermore, there is a possible interaction between inflammatory disorders (Crohn disease, cancer, pancreatitis, reduced serum albumin level concentration) and the SBS that leads to the development of end-stage liver disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607111434599">6</xref></sup> Because most of our patient population includes SBS patients with a primary diagnosis of Crohn disease, these factors might contribute to the liver disease occurrence rate, despite PN prescription changes such as decreases in dextrose content and fat emulsion content to less than 1 g/kg.</p>
<p>Not all patients underwent BMD testing, but results did show a trend toward a decline in BMD results. Also, without considering various other aspects (such as amino acids; months on HPN; vitamin K, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate content; frequency or time on IV pamidronate), it was observed that patients who were on IV pamidronate had higher BMD results. Other factors such as usage of steroid and length of time on IV pamidronate were not well documented in the registry. Higher BMD results on IV pamidronate found in our patient population are in keeping with the results of another study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0148607111434599">38</xref></sup> that showed an improvement in lumbar sacral <italic>T</italic> score following pamidronate therapy in 10 of 11 HPN patients receiving IV pamidronate for 2.34 ± 1.5 years.</p>
<p>Hospitalization data showed poor agreement in the validation study. The most probable reason for this disagreement is similar to the line changes and sepsis data. Patients are hospitalized in peripheral hospitals, and this is communicated verbally but is poorly documented in the patient’s chart at the HPN center. However, when comparing the rate of hospitalization from 2006–2009, there was a small, nonsignificant decrease in hospitalizations from 1.10 ± 0.18 to 0.92 ± 0.14 per year as well as PN-related hospitalizations from 0.74 ± 0.25 to 0.32 ± 0.08 per year. The rates in our registry were lower than what was reported in the North American Oley-A.S.P.E.N. Information System (OASIS) registry,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0148607111434599">39</xref></sup> where 2.8 complications per year in their HPN population with Crohn disease resulted in hospitalization, with 1.1 due to PN complications, 54% of which were suspected or confirmed sepsis; however, these data were reported in 1991. Although the rate decreased based on the follow-up data, it may be higher than reported.</p>
<p>The mean survival reported from our registry was similar to the survival probability noted in a French population of patients with SBS (SB length ≤150 cm) in which the probability of survival was 75% and 60% at 5 and 10 years after bowel resection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0148607111434599">40</xref></sup> Howard et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0148607111434599">39</xref></sup> also reported very similar survival rates from the North American OASIS registry, noting that primary disease strongly influenced survival and rehabilitation. Although Messing et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0148607111434599">40</xref></sup> reported shorter survival in patients with mesenteric infarction, end-enterostomy, and SB length of &lt;50 cm, we found no significant difference in survival between those with SB &lt;50 cm and SB ≥50 cm. This could be due to the small number of patients (39 of 96 patients) in the registry with a reported length of SB. In a review by Scolapio et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0148607111434599">41</xref></sup> 57% of their U.S. Mayo Clinic population were alive at 5 years, with 45% of these patients having resumed oral nutrition, and 9% of patients died of a direct complication of HPN, most from sepsis. Other deaths were secondary to liver failure, venous thrombosis, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis. In our population, 10.4% died at 2 years from HPN complications, most from PN-related liver disease. This is similar to the PN-related deaths (9.3%) reported in the U.K. population; however in this population, septicemia was the overwhelming reason for death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607111434599">22</xref></sup> In our registry, not all causes of death were documented by the team, and therefore causes of death such as line sepsis may have been underreported.</p>
<p>Our oncology patients have a lower survival rate compared with the rest of our HPN population. The registry does not record specific information on type, stage, or status of the oncology patients, which can affect survival. Still, our findings from the Canadian HPN registry are in keeping with findings from North American Home Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition Patient Registry (9288 patients from 1985–1992), which reported that patients with Crohn disease (96%), ischemic bowel disease (87%), and motility disorders (87%) had a much better 1-year survival than did patients with AIDS (10%) and cancer (20%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607111434599">3</xref></sup> However, we do have a higher than reported survival in oncology patients compared with other national registries. From the OASIS registry, 50% of their cancer patients were deceased in 6 months, with 25% living beyond a year. The 459 deaths were caused primarily by cancer and not HPN, and those patients who had a longer-than-average survival included a high proportion of those with leukemia and lymphoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0148607111434599">39</xref></sup> In our population, 50% of patients survived beyond a year. This could be a result of HPN being selectively given to patients with slow-growing tumors and better prognosis. Work by Brard et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0148607111434599">42</xref></sup> demonstrated that there was a small yet significant survival advantage in patients with ovarian cancer receiving concurrent PN and chemotherapy. A Canadian study found a 5-month increase in survival in oncology patients receiving PN when the KS score was &gt;50.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0148607111434599">43</xref></sup></p>

<p>The HPN registry relies on chart reviews and data entry by healthcare professionals from HPN teams. Although the present study demonstrates the validity of the registry based on data from 2 participating centers, it is possible that data from other centers are not as reliable, although PN team structure is similar. Although Raman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607111434599">1</xref></sup> mentioned some inconsistencies between centers in the way data were entered, we have made every effort since then to standardize the data entry process in all centers, with training, reassessment of the data entry forms, and better communication.</p>
<p>In addition, the data presented in this publication are from a subset of patients (4 tertiary care academic centers), which represents ≤25% of the estimated Canadian HPN population and therefore may not necessarily be generalized to the entire population, especially nonacademic centers.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The Canadian HPN registry is a valid clinical tool to report and follow several clinical parameters as well as monitor long-term outcomes and impact of therapy. For some parameters such as vascular access, line sepsis, liver disease, and hospitalizations, there was a lack of agreement likely due to poor documentation as patients may have been diagnosed and treated at other centers in the periphery. To correct for this, a patient diary was created for better reporting. In addition, poor tracking of line sepsis, liver biopsies, and hospitalizations, which have strong clinical significance, suggests the need for broader access to the electronic medical records across the provinces. This prospective cohort study shows that overall, patient outcomes are similar to what is being reported in the literature and that PN is being reduced while HPN patients still maintain good nutrition status. However, HPN patients still experience progressive liver dysfunction and reduction in quality of life. Future plans include using the registry to collect data on reassessment of GI tract function, patient readiness to transition to oral intake, and transitional feeding regimens within the HPN population.</p>
