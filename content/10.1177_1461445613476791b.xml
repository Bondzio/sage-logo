<p>Conceptualizations of <italic>language as representation</italic> have lived a long life under the auspices of modernist thought, positing a ‘real’ world out (or in) there that can be discovered, named, predicted and controlled. Postmodern sensibilities now embrace the notion that rather than representing realities, our language is actively constructing them. The implications of such differences in our theorizing about language are myriad, but for those who find themselves in positions of vulnerability brought on by poverty and addiction, the ‘theoretical’ use of language can literally be a matter of life and death.</p>
<p>Carr’s <italic>Scripting Addiction</italic> is the ethnographic yield of over three years of fieldwork around a social service organization serving women in addiction. The book argues that a view of language as representation has led to addiction therapy that has as its goal ‘ways of speaking’ that are then defined as sobriety. From Carr’s local context, and in American culture writ large, compelling evidence is offered that treatment for addiction has become metalinguistic labor that posits denial as the hidden root of much trouble, and ‘honest’ talk about one’s underlying inner state as the goal. For if it is presumed that language is representational, then many forces compel those offering and receiving therapy to correct the language, and then to conclude that the ‘inner state’ that language represents is also corrected.</p>
<p>The beauty of this book is the talent Carr exhibits at weaving seamlessly between theory, ethnographic discourse and deft analysis of that discourse. In doing so, Carr escapes what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445613476791">Cheney (2000)</xref> describes as the pitfall of interpretive work – missing the forest for a parochial obsession with the trees. This book makes equally moving arguments about the lives and identities of those involved with Carr as it does about American culture and its view of language and addiction.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 begins to unpack how ways of speaking have monumental consequences, both materially and symbolically, for those in therapy. The chapter explicates how discursive constructions like ‘dependency’ are inherently political, and thus are part of a ‘motivated’ process that weaves and serves preferred identities and roles for providers and clients alike. The chapter focuses on organizational discourses that served to build ‘icons’ of clients who are well suited to be treated by the organization.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 follows three clients through the assessment process at Carr’s participating women’s shelter. The chapter revolves around the co-construction of assessments, or the clients’ ‘stories’, that stuck and travelled with clients through a maze of agencies and service providers who used the assessments to grant or deny valuable resources. Carr offers good insights from narrative theory as applied to such narrow assessments as a binary between Truth and Denial. Having worked for over 20 years as both a scholar and activist among those in generational poverty, I particularly appreciate the insight that Carr offers into the many ‘lives’ of a story as it travels through various contexts of time and space and the incredible sensitivity that such stories should be granted, but are often denied (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445613476791">Leeman, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Chapter 3 is loaded with theory from Derrida and others, used to get at the meaning creation and management of <italic>denial</italic>, and ‘the will’ as it plays into denial (and its treatment). Ideas of an unhelpful ‘strong will’ became salient toward a goal ‘not to encourage clients to willfully act but instead to see their inner states’ (p. 91). Denial is considered death here, and the process of bringing clients to the healing of proper language entails uncovering and even legitimizing what was denied.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 is a critical ethnographic treatise aimed at the reigning ‘disease model’ of addiction treatment. Propagated by Alcoholics Anonymous, this view champions a reference model of language that denotes ‘facts’. Carr does a masterful job examining the assumptions of such a view, and arguing how the treatment she observed is aimed at ‘distilling’ cultural ideas (such as addiction as a disease of insight, and recovery as ‘honesty, openness, and willingness’) for clients.</p>
<p>Chapters 5 and 6 are the backbone of the book. Chapter 5 is focused on professional discourses ‘managing ideas of who can faithfully represent what’ (p. 152). The chapter follows how ways of speaking ‘travel’ from institutional and professional contexts into the therapy and lives of clients and care providers, and deals with foundational constructs of framing, identity, truth telling, empowering, and enabling – all suggesting ‘that speakers . . . are always already products of semiotic ideologies and that effective politics must take this into account’ (p. 189). Chapter 6 is sure to be a favorite of readers, as it details how clients with addictions used and manipulated politics and language to ‘flip the scripts’ on providers and the system. It is a good argument for how humans are adroit poets and managers of language and meaning, no matter how dire the circumstances may be.</p>
<p>The book’s conclusion sums up succinctly six ‘points of theory’ the author hopes have been well argued in the text, and also cites the only ideas toward better practice that Carr puts forth.</p>
<p><italic>Scripting Addiction</italic> screams with many voices that <italic>there is no neutral language</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445613476791">Bakhtin, 1984</xref>). Therefore, it is a powerful call to better realize what is happening in and through language at sites all around us that carry huge potential to either serve humankind, or cause suffering. It is an important and well-articulated call.</p>
