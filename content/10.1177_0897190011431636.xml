<abstract>
<p>With a substantial number of women using herbal products to augment their milk production, this article will review available literature illustrating efficacy and adverse effects of using these products. Embase, PubMed, and EBSCO (all databases) were searched from inception to June 2011 using terms such as “galactagogue,” “galactogogue,” “herbal,” and “botanical” and the search was subsequently narrowed to specific herbals by name. Additional articles were obtained from article reference lists. Supplemental information was obtained with Natural Standard. All abstracts retrieved were evaluated for relevance and germane articles were included. Numerous lactation-stimulating herbals have been identified in the literature with varying degrees of evidence, mostly anecdotal. Use of torbangun, milk thistle, and fenugreek may correlate with increased milk supply. Evidence regarding adverse effects, pharmacodynamic properties, and pharmacokinetic effects remains scarce. Despite the fact that postpartum women may turn to herbal galactagogues, scant clinical evidence exists to justify their effectiveness. Further clinical trials are needed in order to substantiate these findings.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mammary glands begin their development during pregnancy, usually between gestational week 16 and 22.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011431636">1</xref>
</sup> This stage of development is referred to as the initiation phase or lactogenesis I. Milk secretion during this stage is inhibited by high serum progesterone levels. Immediately following childbirth, colostrum is released from the breast. This first milk is easily digestible, full of nutrients and antibodies. This production will last about 2 days.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011431636">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190011431636">2</xref>
</sup> Approximately 40 hours after a full-term birth, lactogenesis II begins. Upon placental expulsion, progesterone levels drop dramatically allowing prolactin, a peptide hormone released from the pituitary gland, to increase. Prolactin plus stimulation from suckling trigger milk secretion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011431636">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190011431636"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190011431636">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>By the fifth postpartum day, women may produce 500 to 750 mL of milk daily, with production reaching a volume between 700 and 1000 mL after the second week postpartum.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190011431636">2</xref>
</sup> Throughout the lactation process, milk volume fluctuates based on physiological factors such as direct suckling and a child’s daily milk requirements. Infant suckling also stimulates the release of oxytocin, enabling milk let down from the breasts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190011431636">3</xref>
</sup> Feedback inhibitor of lactation (FIL), a low-molecular-weight hormone, accounts for the milk stimulatory effect of the milk removal process. During milk synthesis, FIL accumulates in the breast alveoli, progressively blocking prolactin secretion. As a result, milk production is inhibited. When the breast is emptied, the blockade is removed and uninhibited milk production resumes. It seems that frequent removal of breast milk is critical to maintaining milk supply by minimizing FIL.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190011431636">2</xref>
</sup> This physical emptying in the breast and refilling due to demand is also known as lactogenesis III.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011431636">1</xref>
</sup> Other hormones involved in the lactogenesis process include insulin and thyroid hormone, providing nutrients for the lactation process to occur and for mammary responsiveness to growth hormones, respectively.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011431636">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190011431636">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Besides lactation physiology, psychological and social factors play an important role in the production of a mother’s milk; perceptions of inadequacy and subsequent anxiety have been proven to inhibit milk production. Additionally, endocrine conditions such as hypothyroidism, diabetes, and polycystic ovarian syndrome may all impact lactation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190011431636">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Galactagogues are pharmaceutical agents, foods, or herbal supplements used to support the initiation, continuation, or augmentation of breast milk production. Indications for galactagogue use may include separation of the mother and infant for a time period, illness in mother or child, following adoption (to induce lactation), immaturity of child, or restoration of milk supply after weaning.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190011431636">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011431636">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The use of herbs is commonly recommended by midwives for a variety of pregnancy-related indications, including lactation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190011431636">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190011431636"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190011431636">8</xref>
</sup> In one survey, 48% (67 of 139) of California midwife respondents reported recommending herbs to support lactation and increase milk supply.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190011431636">7</xref>
</sup> With information readily available through Internet resources, social media, support systems, and their health care professionals, women may choose to use herbal galactagogues prophylactically or in response to a perceived low supply of milk.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190011431636">9</xref>
</sup> Estimates suggest that at least 15% of breast-feeding women will try herbal galactagogues.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190011431636">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In the United States, herbs are considered nutritional supplements and are regulated under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA). Under this act, they do not need to receive FDA approval or demonstrate evidence of efficacy or safety, including the extent of drug interactions, adverse effects, and pharmacokinetic properties, prior to marketing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190011431636">10</xref>
</sup> Additionally, without the assurance of safety that legend and over-the-counter medications are subject to, health care professionals may be hesitant to systematically use them. Even though nutritional supplements are subject to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190011431636">11</xref>
</sup> some fear that they may contain other ingredients that are not listed on the label or have variations in their potency. Regardless, women wanting readily available galactagogues may turn to herbs as a solution.</p>
<p>With the public’s increasing interest in herbal remedies, especially among females,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190011431636">12</xref>
</sup> it is prudent that health care providers caring for nursing women be familiar with commonly used herbal galactagogues. The following is a review of common herbal galactagogues along with corresponding literature regarding their use.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0897190011431636">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A search was conducted for literature through Embase, PubMed, and EBSCO (all databases) from inception to June 2011 using search terms such as “breast-feed,” “galactagogue,” “galactogogue,” “lactation,” “herbal,” and “botanical.” Using the same databases, the search was then narrowed to specific herbs by name, such as “fenugreek + galactagogue,” “blessed thistle + galactagogue,” and so on. All abstracts retrieved were screened for inclusion. All types of articles, including case series and case reports, were included due to the lack of herbal galactagogue clinical trials. Exclusion criteria consisted of non-English and nonhuman articles. All herbs identified in this search with relevant data were reviewed. Additional articles were obtained from article reference lists. Herbal galactagogues were evaluated for historical use, proposed mechanisms of action, effects, usual dosage, and safety and tolerability data. Natural Standard was used to obtain supplemental information on the identified herbal galactagogues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0897190011431636">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Clinical studies were scarce and only 5 were found representing 4 herbs; 2 parallel randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials for shatavari, a parallel randomized clinical study for torbangun and fenugreek, a placebo-controlled clinical trial for milk thistle, and a parallel randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial for an herbal tea containing fenugreek. An additional study in abstract format, one case report, and one anecdotal report were also found for fenugreek. Another case report of an herbal tea containing several ingredients including goat’s rue, fennel, and anise was also included. The remaining articles were considered reviews.</p>
<p>The following herbs have been hypothesized to help stimulate milk production and release (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190011431636">Table 1</xref>). Few studies exist to prove or disprove the use of certain herbs as galactagogues with benefits mostly passed down from traditions of use or word of mouth.</p>

<title>Shatavari (<italic>Asparagus racemosus</italic>)</title>
<p>Over 300 species of asparagus can be found around the world, though originating in the Eastern Mediterranean, with species <italic>Asparagus officinalis</italic> being the common vegetable consumed. In ayurvedic medicine, the roots and leaves of <italic>Asparagus racemosus</italic>, also known as shatavari, are used as hepatoprotectant, immunodulators, and galactagogues. There is currently no proposed mechanism of action for shatavari’s use as a galactagogue.<sup>

<p>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study evaluated shatavari in 64 lactation-deficient women 14 to 90 days postpartum. Lactation deficiency was defined as the inability of the newborn to recover original birth weight by the 15th day of life, &lt;15 g of newborn weight gain per day, or with the provision of &gt;250 mL/d exogenous milk after the fourth week postpartum. Each mother was given of shatavari 2 times a day (n = 32) or placebo (n = 32) for 4 weeks duration. An actual dose was not provided, but <italic>Asparagus racemosus</italic> constituted 15% by weight of the intervention. The primary outcome measure in this study was change in serum prolactin level. Secondary outcomes included weight gain experienced by the newborns, and volume and frequency of exogenous milk used to supplement feedings. Baseline mean prolactin levels in the experimental and control groups were similar. In both groups, prolactin levels comparably decreased following treatment. The amount of exogenous milk use and the rate of newborn weight gain before and after treatment were also similar between the groups. No adverse reactions were noted in the participants. Ultimately, the study did not find a significant effect on milk production, but since the dose received is unclear, the lack of outcomes may be contributed to shatavari being only 15% by weight of the intervention.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190011431636">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A second double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study was conducted in 60 lactating women in India. Women were between 20 and 40 years of age with infants up to 6 months old. Additionally, at least one symptom had to be present such as deficient or painful lactation, loss of appetite, anxiety, or infant crying following feedings. <italic>Asparagus racemosus</italic> root was dried, powdered, and prepared as capsules. Subjects were randomized to receive the study herb, dose based on mother’s weight (60 mg/kg per day), or placebo 3 times daily for 30 days. The primary outcome measure was reported as mean change in prolactin levels. Various secondary outcomes were measured, including mean change in infant weight. Mean prolactin levels increased by 33% and 10% in the study and placebo groups, respectively, the difference being statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Mean infant weights increased by 16% in the study group and 6% in the placebo group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). The authors failed to report any adverse effects in the participants and noted safety in animal models. They concluded that shatavari demonstrated galactagogue activity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190011431636">16</xref>

</p>
<p>The safety profile of shatavari is not clearly defined, though. Adverse effects of <italic>Asparagus</italic> spp are reported to include runny nose, itchy conjunctivitis, contact dermatitis, and throat tightness and coughing during preparation. Additionally, asparagus may have diuretic-like effects.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190011431636">14</xref>

<p>A parallel randomized intervention study was conducted on Bataknese women in Indonesia to examine the effects of torbangun, fenugreek, and Moloco + B12<sup>™</sup> (20 mcg vitamin B12 and 15 mg placenta extract supplement) on both the quantity and nutritional quality of breast milk. Seventy-five healthy, pregnant women, 20 to 40 years of age in their third trimester were recruited on the basis that they would be breast-feeding their infants exclusively for at least 4 months. Additional inclusion requirements included term delivery, healthy infants, and &gt;2.5 kg newborn weight. Participants were randomized to receive either 150 g of torbangun leaves as a soup for 6 consecutive days a week (n = 25), fenugreek capsules 3 times a day (n = 25), or Moloco + B12 3 times a day (n = 25) for 30 days starting postpartum day 2, followed by an additional 30-day follow-up period. Twenty-four hour milk volumes, assessed by the difference in the infant’s weight before and after feeding, were recorded every 2 weeks for the 2-month study. From the 75 eligible subjects who participated, 67 successfully completed the study (torbangun arm n = 23, fenugreek arm n = 22, and Moloco + B12 arm n = 22). The mean 24-hour milk volume for torbangun (361 mL) at baseline (day 14) was less than that of Moloco + B12 (454 mL) and fenugreek (467 mL); however, this difference was not found to be statistically significant. At day 28, 24-hour milk volume increased by 33% in the torbangun group from 361 to 479 mL (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). In the Moloco + B12 arm and fenugreek arm, the 24-hour milk volume intake during the same time period decreased by 15% (454 to 385 mL) and 14% (467 to 400 mL), respectively. Torbangun residual effects were noted a month after supplementation. While breast milk protein content decreased in the torbangun arm, the authors stated the nutritional quality of the milk was not impacted during the course of the study. The authors failed to mention any concern regarding adverse events and they concluded that the results supported the Bataknese practice of using torbangun for its lactogenic effects.<sup>

Though the safety profile of torbangun is unknown, <italic>Coleus</italic> spp may cause hypoglycemia and stimulate the thyroid gland. Additionally, it is theoretically capable of increasing the risk of bleeding, especially if used concurrently with other blood thinning agents such as anticoagulants or antiplatelets. Most importantly, torbangun should not be used in pregnant women due to its potential abortifacient effects. It is unknown whether torbangun crosses over into breast milk.<sup>

</sup> Despite the lack of scientific data on fenugreek, it is widely used and believed to possess lactogenic activity which may be explained by one proposed mechanism of enhancing sweat production. Since the mammary glands are modified sweat glands, an increased production of milk is thought to be expected.<sup>

<p>In the Bataknese study previously discussed in this review, fenugreek capsules containing 600 mg powder given 3 times daily increased milk volume by 20%, although not statistically different from the reference group.

<p>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in a hospital maternity unit in Turkey to assess the effect of a galactagogue herbal tea containing fenugreek on breast milk production and weight gain recovery of infants within the first postpartum week. Sixty-six women were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups to receive herbal tea with fenugreek (Still tea, Humana; n = 22), herbal tea with apple as placebo (n = 22), or no tea as a control (n = 22) for the duration of birth weight recovery. The other components of the herbal teas were not discussed, as the product contains fennel, raspberry leaf, and goat’s rue, traditionally used as galactagogues.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0897190011431636">24</xref>
</sup> Women assigned to the fenugreek or apple tea groups were directed to consume at least 3 cups of tea each day, and all participants received similar education and support from a lactation consultant. Maternal milk volume was measured on the third postpartum day following 15 minutes of electrical pumping. Infants were weighed daily to assess maximum weight loss and time to recovery of birth weight. Each group was similar in regard to maternal age, gestational age, and gender. The herbal tea with fenugreek group had almost double the mean volume of pumped milk (73 mL) as compared to the placebo (39 mL) and control group (31 mL). The galactagogue group also had a lower maximum weight loss and shorter time to recovery of birth weight compared to both the placebo and control groups. No adverse events for both mothers and neonates were observed. The authors concluded that the galactagogue herbal tea positively supported lactation in the early postnatal period.<sup>

<p>A brief report summarized the anecdotal account of approximately 1200 women over 6 years, who were supplemented with commercially available fenugreek under the direction of a nurse. The report suggests dosing 2 to 3 capsules (580 or 610 mg) 3 times a day. It was reported that most women experienced an increase in milk supply within 24 to 72 hours of use and use was discontinued once the milk supply was considered sufficient.<sup>

<p>In a qualitative study, Westfall et al interviewed lactating Western Canadian women to determine galactagogue usage during a 4-month postpartum period.

<title>Milk Thistle <italic>(Silybum marianum)</italic>
</title>
<p>With over 2000 years of experience and mostly known for its hepatoprotective mechanisms, milk thistle is reemerging in popularity as a lactogenic aid. This lactogenic mechanism of action is unknown. It is a native plant of Europe, however it is now found throughout the Eastern part of the United States, California, and South America. The commercially available form of milk thistle is typically silymarin, which consists of 3 flavonolignans.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0897190011431636">29</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A placebo-controlled trial conducted in Peru evaluated the effect of milk thistle in the form of BIO-C<sup>®</sup> (micronized silymarin, 420 mg/d). Fifty healthy women of similar age, number of sons, age of the last born, and diet were included for 63 treatment days, in which levels of milk were checked on day 0, 30, and 63. Quantity of milk production was similar at baseline (day 0), but by day 30, silymarin increased milk production by 64% as compared to a 22% increase in the placebo group. By day 63, milk production almost doubled for silymarin with an 86% increase in production as compared to a 32% increase in the placebo group from day 0. The study found no levels of silymarin in the expressed milk or a change in the chemical composition of the milk (ie, water, fat, carbohydrate, and protein levels). Bio-C<sup>®</sup> was reported to be well tolerated and there were no dropouts in either study group. The preliminary findings of this study are promising, indicating a need for more large-scale studies validating the efficacy and safety of silymarin as a galactagogue.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0897190011431636">28</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Evidence from historical use and clinical studies indicate silymarin is well tolerated at usual doses and side effects, which are low in occurrence, may include gastrointestinal upset such as, nausea, flatulence, and diarrhea. Several cases of allergic reactions including anaphylactic shock have been reported in patients with allergies to milk thistle and related plants (Asteraceae/Compositae family). Possibly stemming from its hepatic effects, silymarin has potential metabolic interactions including inhibition of cytochrome P450, β-glucuronidase, and P-glycoprotein. When used for intrahepatic cholestasis, silymarin has been found to be safe in pregnancy for up to 3 weeks.<sup>

</sup> Adverse effects include atopic dermatitis and photosensitivity. Persons who are allergic to celery or carrot may have a cross sensitivity to fennel. Fennel seed can increase gastrointestinal motility. Since fennel is a good source of calcium, magnesium, and iron, it can bind ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones and decrease the bioavailability; therefore caution should be taken with concurrent use.

</sup> The chemical constituent of blessed thistle, cnicin, stimulates digestive enzymes and bile secretions. The herb is also theorized to stimulate blood flow to the mammary glands, thus enriching milk flow; however there are no studies documenting this.

<p>As seen with chasteberry, some herbal products may be counterproductive and actually suppress milk production. Thus, these agents should be avoided in women wishing to augment milk production. Jasmine petals have been found to decrease prolactin levels, breast engorgement, and milk production significantly when applied to the breasts. These findings may theoretically be extrapolated to jasmine essential oils and possibly fragrances, depending on potency. Excessive intake of vitamin B6, pyridoxine, may be implicated in milk suppression as well. Additionally, bilberry, camphor, and sage may have been used as milk suppressants.<sup>

</sup> These estimates may not take into consideration the women that do so without the knowledge of their health care providers. Like most herbs, those used as galactagogues have limited data regarding their safety and efficacy. The scant information presented in the scientific literature mainly stems from case reports and descriptions of historical use. Clinical studies have generally been very small, with study populations ranging from 10 to 75 participants. Frequently, the women are not representative of all lactating women, as the studies occur at single centers and are generally conducted in homogeneous populations.</p>
<p>Information on doses and supplemental breast-feeding support are not standardized across studies, making it difficult to compare and combine available data. Another significant limitation is that most of the commonly reported doses do not match the doses assessed in the studies in this review (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190011431636">Table 1</xref>). This restricts the usability of these evaluations.

<p>Bearing in mind the limitations of the published literature, both torbangun and silymarin through this review have suggested positive lactogenic results in clinical studies.<sup>

</sup> Shatavari was evaluated in 2 studies, though results were conflicting, especially in regard to effects on prolactin levels.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190011431636">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190011431636">16</xref>
</sup> The shatavari dose may have played a role in these inconsistent outcomes. In one clinical trial, a tea containing multiple herbs showed positive results in women breast-feeding 1-week-old infants.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0897190011431636">23</xref>
</sup> In one qualitative report evaluating blessed thistle, women using it were unsure of its benefit.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190011431636">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>For the most part, safety and tolerability data were not discussed in the clinical studies identified for lactation. Information on safety and adverse effects is generated from historic use or evaluations of herbal agents for other indications. Considering the potential widespread use of these agents for lactation and nonlactation indications, and the relatively few reports of adverse events in the literature, it is likely that the incidence is low. Fenugreek and chasteberry can cause uterine contractions<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190011431636">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190011431636">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0897190011431636">36</xref>
</sup> and are not recommended to be used in pregnancy. Torbangun and blessed thistle’s abortifacient potential and shatavari’s teratogenic potential also make them unsuitable for use during pregnancy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190011431636">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190011431636">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0897190011431636">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0897190011431636">34</xref>
</sup> This is especially important among women looking to begin breast milk stimulation prior to birth or to maintain lactation during a subsequent pregnancy. Torbangun, fenugreek, and blessed thistle all have the potential to increase the risk of bleeding and should be used cautiously in those taking medications that may thin the blood. Fenugreek may decrease blood glucose levels leading to hypoglycemia and has been suggested to worsen asthma symptoms. Other possible adverse events to be aware of include the diuretic effects of asparagus; the risk of anaphylactic shock in those with an allergy to silymarin; the chance of decreased medication efficacy with the use of fennel, since it has the ability to bind medications; and the risk of gastric irritation with high doses of blessed thistle.</p>
<p>Only 2 studies reviewed breast milk composition,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190011431636">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0897190011431636">28</xref>
</sup> whereas Di Pierro and colleagues also evaluated herb excretion into breast milk.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0897190011431636">28</xref>
</sup> Rosti et al did report lethargy, hyponia, and emesis in 2 neonates of breast-feeding mothers drinking a combination herbal tea,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0897190011431636">32</xref>
</sup> but literature describing the effects on infants is scarce. Therefore, the pharmacokinetic effects of herbal galactagogues on breast milk remain undefined.</p>
<p>Since there is limited scientific data available on herbal galactagogues, a clinical decision cannot be solely based on the findings contained within this report as to which herb may be recommended for use as a galactagogue. Additional clinical trials are necessary to solidify the place in therapy for herbal galactagogues.</p>
<p>The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine (ABM) has published a clinical protocol regarding the use of pharmaceutical and herbal galactagogues, especially recognizing the significant lack of scientific evidence supporting the use of herbal agents. Primary recommendations to manage insufficient milk production include proper evaluation and education, nonpharmacological techniques, and treatment of underlying causes. At this time, ABM does not recommend the use of any specific galactagogue, however it does offer some guidelines for health care providers wishing to use such agents. Information on the efficacy and adverse effects should be reviewed with women and the potential for allergy, contraindications, and drug interactions should be carefully examined by the health care professional. If used, galactagogues, in general, should be given at the lowest effective doses for the shortest duration. Interestingly, ABM suggests that written documentation of informed consent be obtained.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0897190011431636">39</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>However, the pharmacist’s role is not as clear-cut. When a breast-feeding mother is seeking advice regarding herbal galactagogues, pharmacists should approach the consultation similarly to any other herb. In order to best direct women, it is helpful to know why they are pursuing supplementation, what information they have already gathered, where they obtained this information, and what other prescriptions, over-the-counter medications, and herbs they are taking. In the setting of breast-feeding, it is extremely important to assess the mother’s lactation knowledge. Nonpharmacologic interventions need to be maximized prior to herbal supplementation, including on demand feedings, proper technique, pumping, and others,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0897190011431636">39</xref>
</sup> which may necessitate involvement by lactation professionals. Pharmacists should be aware of resources available to women for breast-feeding support, including the La Leche League; International Lactation Consultant Association (ILCA); Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); and local hospital-based lactation services. Capitalizing on resources available provides the best opportunity for successful lactation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Few randomized clinical trials are available to make conclusions of herbal use as galactagogues. Based on the literature reported in this review, milk thistle (Bio-C<sup>®</sup>, micronized silymarin) dosed at 420 mg/d and torbangun 150 g of leaves per day as soup have demonstrated potential as galactagogues. Fenugreek’s popular use as a galactagogue seems to be due to various reports without one specific dose studied. Although historically recommended, there is mixed evidence regarding the efficacy of shatavari in promoting lactation. However, more clinical studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the use of herbs as galactagogues. It is practical for health care professionals to be cognizant of the potential herbs that may be used by lactating women and to provide guidance to aid in the decision for or against their use.</p>
