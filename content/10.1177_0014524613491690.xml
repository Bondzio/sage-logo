<p>(Preached at the Sung Eucharist on the Fourth Sunday of Easter, 21<sup>st</sup> April, 2013)
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>There was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, robed in white, with palm branches in their hands. They cried out in a loud voice, saying, ‘Salvation belongs to our God who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb!</italic>’ (Rev. 7.9 f.)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>I think I know what that means. Indeed I would argue that it lies at the heart of what a Cathedral is about. But read that passage to many people in Lincoln High Street today and they would have no idea what you were talking about: a large international group, all dressed in white, holding palm branches and shouting about salvation, thrones and lambs! It is hard to understand if you are unfamiliar with such language and imagery.</p>
<p>There is nothing new in this, of course, as I was reminded when I realised that this year is the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of a book that many of you may remember called <italic>Honest to God.</italic> It caused a sensation when it was published. Indeed the copy I have is an early edition – yet in the front it reads:
<disp-quote>
<p>First published March 1963</p>
<p>Second Impression March 1963</p>
<p>Third Impression March 1963</p>
<p>Fourth Impression March 1963</p>
<p>Fifth Impression April 1963</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The publishers as well as the public were taken by surprise. Eventually it sold well over a million copies and was translated in seventeen languages – unusual for a book on complex theology then or even now.</p>
<p>It caused a sensation. It was condemned by Michael Ramsey, the Archbishop of Canterbury (an action he later publicly regretted), it was dismissed by many (often with great vehemence), yet it opened up the discussion of theology – the meaning of God – to ordinary men and women of the laity both inside and outside the church. Before the end of that first year more than 350,000 copies had been sold, and a book about the debate it had caused was itself both published and reprinted.</p>
<p>Part of the drama centred around the fact that its author was a bishop in the Church of England yet seemed to be saying that one did not need to believe in God in the traditional understanding. The <italic>Daily Herald</italic> wrote:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>It is an agonizing and unusual spectacle – a bishop groping for truth, and admitting he does not know all the answers</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0014524613491690">1</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the press was the famous headline
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Our Image of God Must Go</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0014524613491690">2</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>John Robinson was an academic who had left the cloisters of Cambridge to become suffragan Bishop of Woolwich in South London. He had seen the need to earth his theological thinking in the harsh realities of the lives of men and women in their contemporary world. Taking on the one hand his experience as a pastor in a secular setting which seemed to have little room for the pictures of faith from of old, and reflecting upon the writings of theologians from Europe and America – people such as Paul Tillich, Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Rudolph Bultmann – he mused how modern Christians might speak of faith.</p>
<p>With Tillich he explored the way in which talking about God had become meaningless to many, and found more meaning in the concept of One who is <italic>the ground of our being</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0014524613491690">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>With Bonhoeffer he responded to the challenge to see humanity as <italic>come of age</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0014524613491690">4</xref></sup> - observing that it had grown out of a certain sort of dependence upon God. Modern knowledge enriched by the discoveries of science and psychology had changed the picture forever. The church needed to recognise this and engage with the world in a new way.</p>
<p>With Bultmann<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0014524613491690">5</xref></sup> he sought to draw out the <italic>kerygma</italic> – the essential kernel of the Christian Gospel – hence the much misunderstood exercise of <italic>demythologizing</italic>.</p>
<p>So with a mixture of courage and naïveté, yet undoubtedly as a person of deep faith himself, Robinson set out on an exploration and invited the church to journey with him. It is hardly an exaggeration to say ‘all hell broke loose’.</p>
<p>Once people began to debate the question of God in this more open way, the monopoly of understanding hitherto held by clergy and theologians gave way. Undoubtedly the shape of the Church in this land altered in the 1960s and in large part it was due to this one book. In hindsight we can see its limitations, and we can reflect upon the journey that faith has travelled since then. But the experience of fifty years ago, and the example of a person of deep faith who dared to set out, like Abraham, from safety towards exploration, are things we do well to acknowledge and consider in our own time.</p>
<p>I have never forgotten the man of ninety to whom I was taking communion almost ten years after the publication of <italic>Honest to God</italic>. He admitted to me that his life had been changed by that book. He had been a sincere churchgoer all his life, but for much of it had begun to doubt the literal imagery which was still by many portrayed as essential to belief. He had felt disloyal, even a hypocrite, yet just could not reconcile his faith with his understanding. <italic>Honest to God</italic> had opened a window and let in fresh air that had completely altered his life – and he was telling me that it enabled him now to face his death in faith and in hope.</p>
<p>There is a great deal more that I could say about this book and indeed about Bishop John Robinson – whom I came to know very well and with whom I worked closely for many years. He was pilloried in the press, demonized in debates, yet here was a person of profound faith. He was confident in the sincerity of the search for truth that led him and others to dare to journey into land unknown or hostile, to seek after truth – where may be found the presence of God – and to proclaim it for others to see.</p>
<p><italic>Our image of God must go</italic> – indeed that is true for every age, since to hold fast to any one image of the Almighty is to be in danger of idolatry, of confining God to our imagination. But we are made in the image of God, and as we grow in understanding of ourselves, so it requires us to develop and change our understanding of God. And as we grow in understanding of God, so we develop and change our understanding not only of ourselves but of all around us.</p>
<p>Today is different from 50 years ago. We no longer have a commonly accepted pattern of belief against which to rebel. Many have no idea of what faith, Christian or otherwise, is about. Yet we cannot just yearn for some mythical past age of belief. Instead we too must be adventurous in exploring what faith in the Risen Christ means to us and what it might mean to our world.</p>
<p>But one final word of caution: today’s world is full of words and inundated with images. We must be careful not just to add to the confusion. Before we embark on the next stage of our journey of faith, let us remember where the life of faith begins – in the very presence of God who calls us to leave aside our words, and listen to his Word made flesh in Jesus Christ our Lord. Remember how the Psalmist wrote:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Be still, and know that I am God (Psalm 46.10)</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It is in silence and stillness that the journey of exploration in faith begins.</p>

<title>Politics of Pessimism in Ecclesiastes</title>
<p>Mark R. Sneed, <italic>The Politics of Pessimism in Ecclesiastes: A Social-Science Perspective</italic> (Atlanta: SBL, 2012. $41.95. pp. xvi + 341, ISBN: 978-1-58983-610-5).</p>
<p>Mark Sneed’s revised doctoral dissertation, which he completed at Drew University in 1990, is a significant work in interdisciplinary studies. Sneed brings a rigorous social-science methodology to bear on the book of Ecclesiastes in an insightful and interesting way. He locates the book of Ecclesiastes in Ptolemaic Judah and interprets it through a Weberian lens that examines the role of pessimism, class, and economics in the book. What results is a fresh perspective on an ancient work that defies classification at every turn.</p>
<p>In a work of many insights, one of the most important contributions that Sneed makes to the field of Ecclesiastes research is his reading of Qoheleth’s <italic>carpe diem</italic> ethic. Sneed argues that it ‘is essentially a rejection of this process [over-rationalization] in Judaism and, especially, in the wisdom tradition. It is a rejection of all the strategic calculation of traditional wisdom and its attempts as cosmic mastery’ (p. 281). In essence, Sneed demonstrates that Qoheleth seeks to lower the expectations of his audience in order to cause them to enjoy those aspects of life that can be enjoyed, however fleeting they may be.</p>
<p>Another valuable aspect of <italic>The Politics of Pessimism in Ecclesiastes</italic> is its extensive literature review. For those scholars and students who are not familiar with social-science hermeneutics, Sneed’s work will serve as a healthy introduction and analysis of this method of reading biblical texts. For Qoheleth scholars, the first two chapters will quickly bring them up to speed on the state of social-scientific readings of the book. Furthermore, Sneed’s reading represents a highly sophisticated application of Weber’s theories to a biblical text.</p>
<p>A significant problem for some readers will be Sneed’s location of the book in the Ptolemaic period. Sneed makes a valiant attempt to place Qoheleth in this particular milieu, but not all readers, including this one, will be convinced. This has the potential to weaken Sneed’s analysis because much of it depends heavily on what Sneed sees as Qoheleth’s response to Ptolemaic rule in Judah. Also disappointing is Sneed’s treatment of <italic>hebel</italic>, the keyword of Ecclesiastes. A wealth of research exists on this enigmatic term, yet Sneed interacts primarily with Klaus Seybold’s work in the <italic>Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament</italic>. In a monograph of this caliber, one would expect a more robust interaction with the various scholarly theories regarding the meaning of <italic>hebel</italic> in Ecclesiastes. This reviewer would also have liked to see Sneed further develop his thesis regarding the relationship between the terms <italic>elohim</italic> and <italic>hebel</italic>. Hopefully this will be done in future work.</p>
<p>Despite these deficiencies, Mark Sneed has given the community of Qoheleth scholars an excellent overview of social-scientific approaches to Qoheleth as well as an important Weberian approach to the book. This volume is a welcome addition to SBL’s Ancient Israel and Its Literature Series.</p>
