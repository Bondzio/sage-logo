<abstract>
<p>Despite the tremendous growth in theory and research on emerging adulthood over the past decade, relatively little attention has been paid to the experiences of emerging adults from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds. The purpose of this article is to fill this gap by conducting a conceptual review of the literature on race, ethnicity, and emerging adulthood. We begin with a discussion of conceptual issues, clarifying terms such as <italic>emerging adults</italic>, <italic>emerging adulthood</italic>, and <italic>race and ethnicity</italic>. We then review the existing literature pertaining to the five pillars of emerging adulthood: the age of instability, possibilities, self-focus, in-betweenness, and identity explorations. Finally, we close with a discussion of major challenges to conducting research on race, ethnicity, and emerging adulthood. Taken together, this review is intended to provide a broad overview of the state of knowledge and inspire future research.</p>

<p>Emerging adulthood: the age of instability, possibilities, self-focus, feeling in-between, and identity exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813480503">Arnett, 2004</xref>). But for whom? Whose experiences fall under the rubric of “emerging adulthood”? This is a question that has been debated for the past decade and a half, ever since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2167696813480503">Arnett (2000)</xref> articulated his theory of emerging adulthood<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2167696813480503">1</xref></sup> (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2167696813480503">Arnett, Kloep, Hendry, &amp; Tanner, 2011</xref>). Indeed, the question of who “gets to be” an emerging adult has been one of the central points of contention about the theory. Critics have suggested that emerging adulthood describes only the experiences of the White middle class in industrialized societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2167696813480503">Bynner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2167696813480503">Hendry &amp; Kloep, 2007</xref>). This criticism stems, in part, from the fact that the majority of research on emerging adulthood has been conducted with college students who represent only half of the U.S. emerging adult population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-2167696813480503">Rosenbaum, 2001</xref>). Although there have been detailed analyses of how the experience of emerging adulthood varies by markers of social class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2167696813480503">Cohen, Kasen, Chen, Hartmark, &amp; Gordon, 2003</xref>, in the United States; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2167696813480503">Bynner, 2005</xref>, in the United Kingdom; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2167696813480503">Côté &amp; Bynner, 2008</xref>, in Canada and the United Kingdom), there have been very few analyses of emerging adulthood and race/ethnicity. Thus, despite assertions that emerging adulthood may only be applicable to White Americans, there is little direct evidence available to support or refute these criticisms (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2167696813480503">Arnett &amp; Tanner, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to provide a review of what is known, and what remains to be known, about the role of race and ethnicity for emerging adulthood. The review is organized into three broad sections: (1) conceptual background and rationale, (2) review of research on race and ethnicity in relation to the “five pillars” of emerging adulthood, and (3) an outline for future research on race, ethnicity, and emerging adulthood. In lieu of a systematic and comprehensive review of the research base, our approach was to provide a conceptual review of the big picture ideas and findings related to race, ethnicity, and emerging adulthood. The primary goals of this review are to highlight the major issues on the topic and to inspire much needed additional research. Due to the lack of research directly examining race, ethnicity, and emerging adulthood, we selected theory and research that, in our mind, was most relevant to the topic of whether or not emerging adulthood can be generalized across racial and ethnic lines.</p>
<sec id="section1-2167696813480503">
<title>Conceptual Background</title>
<p>An important distinction that has not received sufficient consideration in the literature is the difference between emerging<italic> adulthood </italic>and emerging<italic> adults</italic>. <italic>Emerging adulthood</italic> is a term that applies to a developmental period of the life span, roughly of age 18–29. Central to the theory of emerging adulthood, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2167696813480503">Arnett (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813480503">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2167696813480503">2007</xref>) argues that this is a new developmental phase of the life span situated between adolescence and adulthood. Thus, <italic>emerging adulthood</italic> is a term akin to infancy, childhood, and adolescence, all of which are labels to describe a portion of the life span that are defined by some shared social and psychological experiences. In contrast, <italic>emerging adults</italic> is a label that applies to the individuals themselves; those who are actively immersed in the social and psychological experiences of emerging adulthood. Thus, emerging adults inhabit emerging adulthood. This distinction parallels, for example, the difference between <italic>adolescence</italic> (the period) and <italic>adolescents</italic> (the people). <italic>Emerging adulthood</italic> can be thought of as a sociological phenomenon; historical changes associated with social structures and economic development have permitted a delay in the assumption of adult roles, thereby creating space for a new developmental phase of the life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813480503">Arnett, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2167696813480503">Bynner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2167696813480503">Côté, 2006</xref>). <italic>Emerging adults</italic> corresponds to the psychological aspect of the phenomenon, as it gets to the heart of the meaning and experiences of the individuals themselves.</p>
<p>Thinking of these two distinct levels of emerging adulthood can clarify the criticisms that have been levied against the idea of emerging adulthood. Scholars across the social sciences generally agree that the nature of adulthood, both in meaning and timing, has changed over the last half century in many parts of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2167696813480503">Arnett, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2167696813480503">Côté, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-2167696813480503">Waters, Carr, Kefalas, &amp; Holdaway, 2011</xref>). There are, however, disagreements over whether these changes represent <italic>a new phase in the life span</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2167696813480503">Arnett, 2000</xref>), whether the changes are generally positive or negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2167696813480503">Côté &amp; Bynner, 2008</xref>), and who gets to experience this changing nature of adulthood. Thus, the criticisms are most accurately directed at the definition and inclusiveness of emerging adults, as opposed to the idea of emerging adulthood itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2167696813480503">Kloep &amp; Hendry, 2011</xref>). However, the gist of some criticisms is that, if some people (who should be) are not emerging adults, then that means there is no emerging adulthood, or at least that the pillars of emerging adulthood are not relevant for those youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2167696813480503">Hendry &amp; Kloep, 2007</xref>). From a sociological perspective, this belief is misguided. Because of the societal changes marked by emerging adulthood, all youth must develop within the context of emerging adulthood, whether or not they themselves take part in it.</p>
<p>Consider a married 19-year-old woman who has a full-time job, financial independence from her family, and has personal responsibility for all major life decisions. When asked directly, she states that she feels like an adult. In contrast, many of her siblings and friends do not feel like adults and look very much like the kinds of portraits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813480503">Arnett (2004)</xref> paints in his accounts of emerging adults. Although she may not be an emerging adult, she no doubt has to wrestle and negotiate the phenomenon of emerging adulthood, and she is surrounded by the changing notions of adulthood in her close relationships and within society at large. How individuals negotiate this process has been scarcely examined, in part because the distinction between emerging adults and emerging adulthood has not been adequately recognized in the literature. In the context of the current review, however, the important point is that what is most relevant vis-à-vis race and ethnicity is the degree of inclusiveness—who “gets to be” an emerging adult—along racial and ethnic lines. As we describe below, there are legitimate reasons to explore this question.</p>
<sec id="section2-2167696813480503">
<title>Why Might Race and Ethnicity Matter for Emerging Adulthood?</title>
<p>There is growing consensus among social scientists about how to define and use the terms <italic>race</italic> and <italic>ethnicity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-2167696813480503">Markus, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-2167696813480503">Phinney, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-2167696813480503">Syed, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-2167696813480503">Quintana, 2007</xref>). Race is considered a socially constructed system of power that confers dominance upon the majority and marginalization upon the minority. In contrast, ethnicity corresponds to the cultural history, beliefs, and practices of a relatively well-defined group. Thus, race pertains to social groups formed within a system of power, whereas ethnicity pertains to social groups who share a cultural background. However, race and ethnicity can be particularly difficult to separate in the context of actual research practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2167696813480503">Cokley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-2167696813480503">Quintana, 2007</xref>). For this reason, in this article we mostly use the hybrid term <italic>race/ethnicity</italic> to acknowledge that the terms are distinct and that it is not really possible to separate the findings by race and ethnicity.</p>
<p>The expectation of variations in the psychological experiences of different racial/ethnic groups should always be justified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2167696813480503">Cauce, Coronado, &amp; Watson, 1998</xref>). Absent a strong theoretical or empirical rationale, the search for differences can yield findings that are difficult to understand, spurring post hoc and ad hoc interpretations that may not be helpful to the field. In this review, we take the perspective of ethnic minority psychology, which focuses on the <italic>minority</italic> aspect of youth’s experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2167696813480503">García Coll et al., 1996</xref>). Minorities, by definition, have restricted access to power and resources that give rise to a unique psychological experience and perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-2167696813480503">Tajfel, 1981</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2167696813480503">Harding, 2004</xref> on feminist standpoint theory). Thus, our primary interest is in how the experience of emerging adulthood may differ for racial/ethnic minority versus majority youth. This perspective does not indicate that we view either group as homogenous; there are important within-group variations by ethnicity, gender, social class, immigrant status, and so on. In the context of the ongoing debates within emerging adulthood, however, we view the minority/majority distinction as the most relevant. In the following paragraphs, we offer a few examples providing rationale for examining emerging adulthood through the lens of race/ethnicity.</p>
<p>First, young people in industrialized societies today cite <italic>independence</italic> as the number one criterion for becoming an adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2167696813480503">Arnett, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813480503">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-2167696813480503">Swartz, Hartmann, &amp; Mortimer, 2011</xref>). Financial independence, personal independence, and independence from the family are all highly valued by emerging adults. Independence is considered to be a decidedly American—or “Western”—value, and thus emerging adulthood would appear to be a culture-bound phenomenon. Such a conclusion originates from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-2167696813480503">Triandis’ (1989)</xref> work on <italic>individualistic</italic> and <italic>collectivistic</italic> cultures, receiving a kick in the pants from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-2167696813480503">Markus and Kitayama’s (1991)</xref> articulation of the <italic>independent</italic> and <italic>interdependent</italic> self-construals. To summarize a lot of theory and research in a quick sentence, individualistic cultures value independent selves through the promotion of autonomy, whereas collectivistic cultures value interdependent selves through the promotion of relatedness (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2167696813480503">Juang, Syed, Cookston, Wang, &amp; Kim, 2012</xref>). Because of the high degree of immigration to the United States from purportedly collectivistic cultures, these dichotomous ways of thinking about culture and selfhood have been applied to the experiences of many American ethnic minority groups (Asian Americans and Latinos, in particular). Thus, the centrality of independence for emerging adulthood may limit the generalizability of the experience to ethnic minority groups. As will be discussed later, however, this issue is much more complex than the way it is often conceptualized (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-2167696813480503">Matsumoto, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2167696813480503">Oyserman, Coon, &amp; Kemmelmeier, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-2167696813480503">Tamis-LeMonda et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, research on how adolescents and emerging adults contribute to family functioning and maintenance may raise questions about how well emerging adulthood applies to ethnic minorities. The body of research on family obligation has demonstrated the greater frequency of obligatory behaviors among ethnic minorities compared to Whites (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2167696813480503">Fuligni, 2007</xref>). These differences in family obligation could be related to differential conceptualizations of adulthood, as stability may be required for the benefit of the family.</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, in many industrialized countries social class is confounded with race, such that all races in a given country are not equally distributed at different social class levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2167696813480503">DeNavas-Walt, Proctor, &amp; Smith, 2010</xref>). Emerging adulthood has been referred to as a <italic>luxury</italic> and only available to those with sufficient means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2167696813480503">Bynner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2167696813480503">Hendry &amp; Kloep, 2007</xref>). Although the thresholds for luxury and sufficient means have not been identified, the implication is that emerging adulthood is not experienced by those within the poor and working class. The fact that racial minorities are overrepresented among the poor and working class suggests that they may make up a smaller share of emerging adults, and therefore their experiences of emerging adulthood may differ from the majority.</p>
<p>The aforementioned are just some examples to provide justification for why an analysis of emerging adulthood along racial and ethnic lines is warranted. In other words, there is sufficient rationale to believe that emerging adulthood <italic>might</italic> be different for racial/ethnic minorities compared with Whites. Whether or not the empirical findings are consistent with the rationales is another story and is the subject of the following section.</p>

<title>Race, Ethnicity, and the Five Pillars of Emerging Adulthood</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2167696813480503">Arnett’s (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813480503">2004</xref>) theory of emerging adulthood has five primary components, or <italic>pillars</italic>: the age of instability, the age of possibilities, the age of self-focus, the age of feeling in-between, and the age of identity exploration. Each pillar is referred to as an <italic>age</italic> to highlight that these are developmental issues that take primacy during the emerging adulthood phase of the life span. Despite the centrality of the five pillars to the theory of emerging adulthood, there is a dearth of research focused on the direct assessment of their frequency and correlates. The Inventory of Dimensions of Emerging Adulthood (IDEA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-2167696813480503">Reifman, Arnett, &amp; Colwell, 2007</xref>) was created to assess the five pillars, but the measure has been seldom used. Much of the research on race/ethnicity and the five pillars is based on two studies conducted by Arnett himself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2167696813480503">Arnett, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2167696813480503">Arnett &amp; Schwab, 2012</xref>). In the review below, we have included studies that directly assessed one or more of the five pillars but also used our judgment to place topics that seemed to fit with the tenor of the pillar, even if Arnett never discussed the topics in that way. An important point to note at the outset is that the five pillars are not mutually exclusive and that many of them seem to address identity development—the largest of the pillars in terms of both research volume and importance to the theory.</p>
<sec id="section4-2167696813480503">
<title>Age of Instability</title>
<p>Unlike adolescents and adults, whose lives are relatively stable and predictable from month to month, emerging adults frequently change their situations and plans. They move around a lot, go from job to job, and test out love and intimacy in a variety of ways. All these changes create a sense of instability. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813480503">Arnett (2004)</xref> describes the age of instability in three clearly observable domains: work, residential mobility, and romantic relationships. For example, in the domain of work, many emerging adults experiment with several different jobs in search of one that fits their identity. On average, an individual will change jobs 11 times between the ages of 18 and 44; 7 to 8 of those switches happen between ages 18 and 27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-2167696813480503">U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2012</xref>). Although the majority of emerging adults report being satisfied with their present work, those in their late 20s were more likely to see their current job as a long-term, stable career choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813480503">Arnett, 2004</xref>). Similarly, many emerging adults change their residences frequently, moving through several temporary living situations before settling down. Many leave their parents’ homes for the first time after high school, when they go to college or start a job. From there, they may change roommates, move in with a romantic partner, or move back in with their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813480503">Arnett, 2004</xref>). Because these domains are central to emerging adults’ livelihoods, experiencing frequent change in them simultaneously gives the period of emerging adulthood a general feeling of flux, capriciousness, and instability—again, largely in relation to the periods preceding and following it. Thus, instability can be thought of in the context of specific life domains (e.g., work, love) or as a general feeling that pervades emerging adulthood.</p>
<p>The degree to which instability is similarly experienced across racial and ethnic lines is not clear. Individuals in different racial/ethnic groups do demonstrate similar patterns of instability in work, with White, Black, and Latino individuals all holding an average of seven to eight jobs between ages 18 and 27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-2167696813480503">U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2012</xref>). Residential mobility patterns tell a slightly different story. Over one year, 26% of 18- to 29-year-old Asian Americans moved at least once, compared to only 15% of 30- to 39-year-olds, following much the same pattern as White emerging adults. In contrast, Black and Latino emerging adults moved with almost the same frequency as their older counterparts: 21% of Black emerging adults, 18% of Black 30- to 39-year-olds, 22% of Latino emerging adults, and 17% of Latino 30- to 39-year-olds changed residences in 1 year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-2167696813480503">U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2012</xref>). It seems that residential instability does not decline as steeply after emerging adulthood for all racial/ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>One domain of instability that has been recently studied specifically among racial/ethnic minority emerging adults is family conflict. Family conflict among racial/ethnic minorities has primarily been studied with immigrant families, highlighting intergenerational conflict around values that occur in the context of acculturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2167696813480503">Lee, Choe, Kim, &amp; Ngo, 2000</xref>). This type of value-based conflict is distinct from the “everyday” conflicts (e.g., chores, schoolwork) that have been studied for decades within adolescent psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2167696813480503">Juang, Syed, &amp; Cookston, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2167696813480503">Laursen, Coy, &amp; Collins, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-2167696813480503">Smetana, 2002</xref>). Studies with ethnic minority college students indicate that higher value-based family conflict is associated with greater psychological distress and lower academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2167696813480503">Bahrassa, Syed, Su, &amp; Lee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-2167696813480503">Lee &amp; Liu, 2001</xref>), and comparative studies in adolescence indicate that these links are stronger for Chinese Americans than for Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2167696813480503">Chen, Greenberger, Lester, Dong, &amp; Guo, 1998</xref>). The few comparative studies in emerging adulthood suggest that this type of family conflict is more prevalent among Asian Americans than among Whites and Latinos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2167696813480503">Bahrassa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-2167696813480503">Lee &amp; Liu, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Almost all of the available research on family conflict has been conducted with adolescents, and it is not clear how family conflict changes from adolescence to emerging adulthood. To our knowledge, there is only one longitudinal study of family conflict among emerging adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2167696813480503">Bahrassa, 2012</xref>). The study, consisting of ethnically diverse college students (mostly Asian American and White) followed over an 18-month period, found that, on average, conflict decreased over time. However, group-based trajectory analyses that disaggregated the sample indicated most participants reported stable low levels of conflict, with smaller groups starting high and decreasing over time (25%) and increasing over time (12%). Furthermore, White participants were more likely to be represented by the stable low trajectory, whereas ethnic minority participants were more likely to be represented by the increasing and decreasing trajectories.</p>
<p>Taken together, the existing research on family conflict suggests greater prevalence, variability, and links to negative outcomes for ethnic minorities compared to Whites. Taken as a marker of instability, these findings would suggest that ethnic minority emerging adults experience greater instability than White emerging adults. However, the lack of research on family conflict and other domains of instability in emerging adulthood makes it difficult to draw any firm conclusions.</p>

<title>Age of Possibilities</title>
<p>Emerging adulthood often marks an individual’s first opportunity to make their own life-shaping decisions, characterizing this as the age of possibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813480503">Arnett, 2004</xref>). Because emerging adults are beginning to enjoy levels of independence not experienced in adolescence, but are yet to take on the heavy responsibilities of adulthood, they are optimistic about their futures, feeling confident that they will one day realize their dreams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813480503">Arnett, 2004</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-2167696813480503">Waters, Carr, &amp; Kefalas, 2011</xref>). The overwhelming majority of emerging adults believe they will get what they want from life, and most expect that their lives will be better than those of their parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2167696813480503">Arnett &amp; Schwab, 2012</xref>). Emerging adults from low socioeconomic status backgrounds are even more likely than their more advantaged counterparts to feel that they will be better off than their parents, suggesting that this sense of optimism is not only felt by the most privileged. Interviews with emerging adults revealed that for some disadvantaged individuals, such as children of divorced, mentally ill, alcoholic, or abusive parents, emerging adulthood can provide unprecedented possibilities to leave troubled homes and build a new life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813480503">Arnett, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>However, Arnett has been criticized by many scholars for painting much too rosy a picture of emerging adulthood (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2167696813480503">Côté, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2167696813480503">Hendry &amp; Kloep, 2007</xref>). There is reason to be skeptical that these feelings of unbridled optimism are shared among racial and ethnic minorities. On account of their minority position within society, racial/ethnic minorities experience a greater number of societal barriers to realizing their dreams. Youth from African American, Native American, Latino, and Southeast Asian American backgrounds are increasingly underrepresented at each successive level of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2167696813480503">Cooper, Chavira, &amp; Mena, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2167696813480503">Gandara &amp; Maxwell Jolley, 1999</xref>). Consistent with these data, racial/ethnic minority youth report more barriers to succeeding in school, such as negative teacher interactions and experiences of institutional racism (e.g., “gatekeeping,” see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-2167696813480503">Syed, Azmitia, &amp; Cooper, 2011</xref>). Racial/ethnic minorities perceive more frequent and severe racism and discrimination than do Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-2167696813480503">Romero &amp; Roberts, 1998</xref>), and perceiving greater discrimination has been consistently linked to lower well-being, greater psychological distress, and poorer physical health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-2167696813480503">Okazaki, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-2167696813480503">Paradies, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2167696813480503">Pascoe &amp; Smart Richman, 2009</xref>). Although rates of psychological distress and mental health diagnoses seem to be similar for all emerging adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-2167696813480503">Rosenthal &amp; Schreiner, 2000</xref>), mental health service utilization is lower among racial/ethnic minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2167696813480503">Cauce et al., 2002</xref>). This is just a sampling of the research that suggests that racial/ethnic minorities may not be as positive about their futures as the theory of emerging adulthood suggests.</p>
<p>But it is really so grim? Although there is a large body of research documenting the barriers faced by racial/ethnic minorities, there is also evidence to suggest that many of them take on these challenges and turn them into opportunities for growth and development. For example, it is now well documented that racial/ethnic minority youth and their families hold high aspirations for their futures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2167696813480503">Azmitia, Cooper, Garcia, &amp; Dunbar, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2167696813480503">Chang, Chen, Greenberger, Dooley, &amp; Heckhausen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2167696813480503">Cooper, Domínguez, &amp; Rosas, 2005</xref>). African American and Latino emerging adults are more likely to agree that “One of the most important keys to success in life is a college education” (81% and 84%, respectively) than do Whites (76%). However, while 32% of Whites have trouble financing their education, 37% of Latinos and 50% of African American emerging adults have not been able to financially support their goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2167696813480503">Arnett &amp; Schwab, 2012</xref>). This contrast reveals an important disjunction: Although aspirations for the future are high, an increased awareness of structural barriers to achievement and advancement leads some youth to become doubtful that they will be able to realize their dreams. This experience creates a mismatch between aspirations and expectations that complicates the age of possibilities for racial/ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>Importantly, even though minority youth come to realize that they may not achieve their dreams, their aspirations remain high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2167696813480503">Arnett &amp; Tanner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2167696813480503">Cooper, Domínguez, &amp; Rosas, 2005</xref>). Research suggests that this paradox is managed through a variety of behaviors and beliefs that serve to maintain a sense of optimism and continuity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2167696813480503">Cooper (2011)</xref> has described how low-income immigrant youth with high aspirations for the future may alter their dreams to be both realistic and fulfilling. For example, a Mexican-heritage boy who aspired to become a lawyer may see law school as unlikely as he approaches college. However, his interest and commitment to law and his community may lead him to become a police officer. While clearly different occupational outcomes, his career trajectory contains thematic coherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2167696813480503">Habermas &amp; Bluck, 2000</xref>), providing continuity between his dreams and his realties. Alternatively, some youth may engage in some form of collective action motivated by the perceived structural barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2167696813480503">Diemer &amp; Hsieh, 2008</xref>). Gaining an understanding of how the sociopolitical context may affect their future leads minority youth to participate in efforts to reduce the impact of the barriers, both for others and for themselves. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2167696813480503">Cooper, Domínguez, and Rosas (2005)</xref> discussed the phenomenon of “looking up and giving back,” in which immigrant youth aspire to career success so that they can work to improve their communities and contribute to the development of the next generation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-2167696813480503">Syed (2010a)</xref> found that minority college students who had a sophisticated awareness of race and ethnicity upon entering college were likely to select majors that they felt were compatible with their goals of improving the social standing of their ethnic groups and communities. Their career goals of social activism or becoming a teacher were expressly connected to their awareness of social barriers and feeling that it was their duty to work for the betterment of the next generation.</p>
<p>In sum, emerging adults from racial/ethnic backgrounds experience significant barriers to realizing their dreams and enjoying the optimism that characterizes emerging adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-2167696813480503">Syed et al., 2011</xref>). However, rather than accepting these barriers and taking a dim view of the future, many emerging adults use the challenges they face as motivation to succeed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2167696813480503">Cooper, Cooper, Azmitia, Chavira, &amp; Gullatt, 2002</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-2167696813480503">McAdams (2006)</xref> has demonstrated a robust link between generativity and the appropriation of a redemption life narrative, in which individuals use their past struggles as a foundation for personal growth. Despite the positive outcomes that sometimes result from negative experiences, it is important to be mindful that racial/ethnic minorities do face more challenges to advancement than their White peers. Thus, even though racial/ethnic minorities may have high hopes for the future, such high hopes are in the context of social barriers that lower expectations, and the nature of what is possible for them may be qualitatively distinct from what is possible for White Americans.</p>

<sec id="section6-2167696813480503">
<title>Age of Self-Focus</title>
<p>The age of self-focus encompasses emerging adults’ newfound sense of freedom, responsibility, and independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813480503">Arnett, 2004</xref>). Unlike adolescents, they are primarily in charge of making their own decisions. Unlike adults, they do not have to take others into account (e.g., partner, children) when making decisions. This freedom of consequential ties from others affords emerging adults the ability to focus on themselves during this developmental phase.</p>
<p>In interviews, emerging adults repeatedly identify ages 18 and 30 as boundaries for the age of self-focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813480503">Arnett, 2004</xref>). Age 18 marks the end of high school, when many emerging adults leave home and are separated from their parents. Many remain in close contact, with 55% of emerging adults talking, texting, e-mailing, or visiting their parents on a daily basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2167696813480503">Arnett &amp; Schwab, 2012</xref>). Nonetheless, separation often improves relationships between parents and their emerging adult children, as day-to-day tensions of living under the same roof are eased, and children become less dependent on their parents for support.</p>
<p>The independence of emerging adulthood comes to an end with marriage and childbearing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813480503">Arnett (2004)</xref> identifies an “age 30 deadline,” when many emerging adults hope to be married. They hope to take advantage of their 20s as a time for exploration and independence, but prefer to start having children before their mid-30s. With a new family come new responsibilities and obligations—these commitments to others bring the age of self-focus to a close.</p>
<p>For many readers, the word <italic>independence</italic> will likely trigger thoughts about the cultural generalizability of the age of self-focus. It is widely believed that independence is one of the hallmarks of “the West,” standing in contrast to the interdependence that characterizes the people inhabiting the East and South (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-2167696813480503">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>). This binary way of thinking about culture and the self is widespread throughout cultural, cross-cultural, social, and developmental psychology (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-2167696813480503">Matsumoto, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2167696813480503">Oyserman et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>As indicated previously, research on family obligation is a good example of how interdependence may be relatively more salient for racial/ethnic minorities. Family obligation is a broad construct pertaining to the beliefs, values, and behaviors associated with providing assistance, support, and respect to the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2167696813480503">Fuligni, 2007</xref>). Family obligation is believed to be based in cultural traditions that emphasize the filial bond and authority of the family, which are more often found in Asia and Latin America. In terms of the United States, research has consistently demonstrated greater family obligation beliefs and behaviors among ethnic minorities relative to Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2167696813480503">Fuligni &amp; Flook, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2167696813480503">Fuligni, Tseng, &amp; Lam, 1999</xref>). Going beyond self-report, one innovative functional magnetic resonance imaging study found that giving money to the family was associated with greater activity in the reward system among Latinos, whereas for Whites the reward activity was associated with gaining money for themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-2167696813480503">Telzer, Masten, Berkman, Lieberman, &amp; Fuligni, 2010</xref>). Thus, the ethnic differences in family obligation are rather robust.</p>
<p>So is the age of self-focus out of bounds for ethnic minorities? As with most topics, the answer is complex. First, the close ties formed through family obligation may go too far for some emerging adults: A recent study found that 39% of African American and 41% of Latino emerging adults see their parents as more involved in their lives than they would like. Only 24% of Whites share this sentiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2167696813480503">Arnett &amp; Schwab, 2012</xref>). This finding raises the important distinction between behaviors and attitudes toward those behaviors; just because ethnic/racial minorities report higher family obligation does not mean they are happy about it. Second, even if there are mean differences in self-focus and other focus by race/ethnicity, the psychological correlates may be the same. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-2167696813480503">Schwartz, Côté, and Arnett (2005)</xref> found that agentic personality was related to identity process similarly for White, Black, and Latino emerging adults. Third, seemingly contrary to the age of self-focus, a short-term longitudinal study demonstrated increases in family obligation from age 19 to 21 for youth from ethnic minority <italic>and</italic> ethnic majority backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2167696813480503">Fuligni &amp; Pedersen, 2002</xref>). This finding raises an important point that is so simple that it often gets missed: independence and interdependence are not mutually exclusive. Taking up this point in depth, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-2167696813480503">Tamis-LeMonda et al. (2008)</xref> outlined a dynamic cultural framework for understanding the interrelations of the dichotomies of individualism/collectivism, independence/interdependence, and autonomy/relatedness. They specified three ways in which the cultural orientations may be related: conflicting, additive, and functionally dependent.</p>
<p>
<italic>Conflicting</italic> relations are consistent with the common, dichotomous view, that expressing independence, for example, may interfere with the maintenance of interdependence. In contrast, <italic>additive</italic> relations emphasize both independence and interdependence. That is, just because ethnic minorities report greater family obligation, a marker of interdependence, that does not necessitate low levels of independence. Indeed, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2167696813480503">Arnett (2003)</xref> found no significant differences in the ratings of independence among Black, Latino, Asian American, and White emerging adults, with all groups ranking independence as the most important criterion for adulthood. However, there were significant differences in the ratings of interdependence (Whites lower than Asian Americans) and family capacities, which is similar to family obligation (Whites lower than the other three groups). Moreover, in developing the IDEA scale, the only available survey measure for assessing the five pillars of emerging adulthood, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-2167696813480503">Reifman, Arnett, and Colwell (2007)</xref> created both a self-focus and an other focus scale, as they found that they are distinct constructs rather than different poles of a single construct. Thus, higher levels of interdependent attitudes do not diminish the salience of independence for emerging adults.</p>
<p>Finally, <italic>functionally dependent</italic> relations are sequences in one direction or the other: independence leading to interdependence or interdependence leading to independence. In reviewing his body of research on family obligation and college success, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2167696813480503">Fuligni (2007)</xref> discovered an ironic case of functional dependence. For many ethnic minority (and majority) youth, attending and doing well in college is considered an aspect of family obligation. Greater education and upward mobility, however, are associated with lower levels of family obligation. Thus, the interdependent-oriented behavior is one of the causal factors associated with greater independence.</p>
<p>The simple take-home message regarding self-focus is that too many view independence and interdependence as the two poles of a single continuum. Future researchers should consider adopting the more dynamic view advanced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-2167696813480503">Tamis-LeMonda et al. (2008)</xref>, which not only examines the interrelations of independence and interdependence, but encourages analyses that consider the role of local, developmental, and political/historical context. Analyses of this kind would bring greater clarity on how widespread the age of self-focus is.</p>

<title>Age of Feeling In-Between</title>
<p>“… an age in-between, neither adolescent nor adult, on the way to adulthood but not there yet” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813480503">Arnett, 2004</xref>, p. 14). In many ways, the age of feeling in-between is the least complex of the five pillars and is largely fueled by the ages of instability, self-focus, and identity exploration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813480503">Arnett’s (2004)</xref> primary data pertaining to the age of feeling in-between are responses to the question, “Do you feel that you have reached adulthood?” In a recent survey, the majority of 18- to 21-year-olds responded <italic>In some ways yes, in some ways no</italic>, whereas most 26- to 29-year-olds responded with a solid <italic>yes</italic>, they have reached adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2167696813480503">Arnett &amp; Schwab, 2012</xref>). Using a different data set, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2167696813480503">Arnett (2003)</xref> found that emerging adults from White and Asian American backgrounds provided <italic>yes and no</italic> as their most common response, but Blacks and Latinos were more likely to just say <italic>yes</italic>. Further analyses revealed that these differences could be accounted for by the fact that the Black and Latino emerging adults came from lower social class backgrounds and were more likely to have become parents.</p>
<p>Beyond that, not much is known about the age of feeling in-between. Arnett’s conceptual description of the pillar is limited, and there is very little empirical data on the topic. The limited available evidence suggests that lower social class and early parenthood are associated with earlier feelings of adulthood. The rather simplistic conclusion is that these young people are not taking part in the experience of emerging adulthood; they are adults living in the era of emerging adulthood. But research has highlighted how these feelings are complex. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2167696813480503">Arnett and Tanner (2011)</xref> introduced the case of Monique, a 27-year-old Black mother of two, who dropped out of high school at age 16 when she was pregnant with her first child. As the authors plainly state, “having a child is the point of no return for emerging adulthood” (p. 47). Despite this, Monique is in the throes of instability, possibilities, and identity exploration, attempting to reclaim some of the youth that was lost through early parenthood and other adversity. Arnett and Tanner stop short of claiming she is an emerging adult; they themselves are not certain. What Monique’s life story highlights, however, is that whether or not someone is an emerging adult is not simply reducible to different demographic categories. As discussed previously, feeling like an adult and engaging with the idea of emerging adulthood may not be mutually exclusive experiences. Clearly, the age of feeling in-between is a topic that is in need of greater research, with both minority and majority samples. A good starting point would be to move beyond simply asking people yes/no/maybe questions about whether or not they feel like an adult and focus more on the psychological experience of navigating adulthood.</p>

<sec id="section8-2167696813480503">
<title>Age of Identity Exploration</title>
<p>The age of identity exploration—trying out different possibilities in order to learn more about ourselves—is unquestionably the largest and most central pillar to the theory of emerging adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813480503">Arnett, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2167696813480503">2006</xref>). Indeed, the other four pillars—instability, possibilities, self-focus, and in-betweenness—can all be thought of as aspects of the identity development process. This is ironic, because Arnett’s initial research with emerging adults did not purposefully examine identity at all (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2167696813480503">Arnett, 2006</xref>). It was through his qualitative research—hearing the voices and concerns of young people—that he discovered the importance of identity for emerging adults. The centrality of identity development for emerging adults is consistent with decades of theory and research on identity development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2167696813480503">Erikson (1950</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2167696813480503">1968</xref>) first highlighted the developmental significance of identity and specified that adolescence and the early adulthood years were the primary phase of the life span in which young people wrestled with their identities. Subsequent research using a number of different operationalizations of Erikson’s theory has provided strong support for his theorizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2167696813480503">Kroger, Martinussen, &amp; Marcia, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-2167696813480503">McAdams, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-2167696813480503">Meeus, 2011</xref>; see reviews by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-2167696813480503">Schwartz, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a large and complex literature on identity development, and within this special issue there is a review article dedicated solely to the topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-2167696813480503">Schwartz, Zamboanga, Luyckx, Meca, &amp; Ritchie, 2013</xref>). Moreover, there has recently been an excellent review article on longitudinal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-2167696813480503">Meeus, 2011</xref>), a meta-analysis on longitudinal studies using the identity status model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2167696813480503">Kroger et al., 2010</xref>), and a comprehensive two-volume <italic>Handbook of Identity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-2167696813480503">Schwartz, Luyckx, &amp; Vignoles, 2011</xref>), with another focused specifically on identity development, on the way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-2167696813480503">McLean &amp; Syed, in press</xref>). Despite these many excellent sources on the topic of identity development, there is not a lot available on the issues concerning the identity development process of racial/ethnic minorities. We outline some of the major issues in this section.</p>
<p>The largest body of research related to identity among racial/ethnic minorities is <italic>ethnic identity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-2167696813480503">Phinney, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-2167696813480503">Quintana, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-2167696813480503">Umaña-Taylor, 2011</xref>). Ethnic identity is the degree to which individuals identify with their ethnic group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-2167696813480503">Phinney, 1992</xref>). Research has clearly established the importance of ethnic identity for racial/ethnic minorities with regard to positive psychological functioning and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-2167696813480503">Quintana, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-2167696813480503">Smith &amp; Silva, 2011</xref>). For many years, theory and research suggested that ethnic identity was a task primarily located within adolescence, with at least one longitudinal study indicating deceleration in growth in ethnic identity toward the end of adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-2167696813480503">Pahl &amp; Way, 2006</xref>). However, at that time, there were few studies of ethnic identity development—either cross-sectional or longitudinal—that went beyond the high school years (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-2167696813480503">Phinney, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The situation has changed recently. For example, a longitudinal study found that ethnic identity exploration and commitment increased substantially across 4 years for Asian American, Latino, Black, and White college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-2167696813480503">Syed &amp; Azmitia, 2009</xref>). Research using survey methodology has worked to identify the pathways through which ethnic identity may lead to positive well-being and psychological health, identifying important mediators such as identity coherence, identity confusion, and meaning in life (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2167696813480503">Kiang &amp; Fuligni, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-2167696813480503">Schwartz, Zamboanga, Weisskirch, &amp; Rodriguez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-2167696813480503">Syed et al., in press</xref>). Complementing this survey research, narrative and other qualitative-based research has provided insights into how minority emerging adults think and talk about how they experience their ethnicities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-2167696813480503">Santos, Ortiz, Morales, &amp; Rosales, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-2167696813480503">Syed, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-2167696813480503">Syed &amp; Azmitia, 2008</xref>). An important finding from this research is that those in “early emerging adulthood” (e.g., 18–20) generally have a difficult time expressing their thoughts about ethnicity and, for the most part, do not seem to have given it very serious consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2167696813480503">Azmitia, Syed, &amp; Radmacher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-2167696813480503">Santos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-2167696813480503">Syed, 2010b</xref>). Thus, the collective research on ethnic identity during emerging adulthood indicates that this is a domain of identity that is still very much in play and far from complete following adolescence.</p>
<p>In the context of racial/ethnic minorities, the identity literature apart from ethnic identity is a curious thing. The majority of identity development research has focused on the <italic>processes</italic> of identity, such as exploration and commitment within the identity status model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2167696813480503">Marcia, 1980</xref>) and meaning making and autobiographical reasoning within the narrative identity model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-2167696813480503">McLean, 2008</xref>). This research typically samples across a variety of identity domains (e.g., religious, political) or memory types (e.g., self-defining, turning point), in order to assess identity development processes. Thus, this class of research can be thought of as the “general” or “mainstream” literature on identity development. However, the vast majority of this research has relied on White American and White European samples (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-2167696813480503">Schwartz, Côté, &amp; Arnett, 2005</xref>). The literature on the identity development of racial/ethnic minorities has focused primarily on ethnic identity, with very little research on how race/ethnicity is related to broader identity processes.</p>
<p>One identity domain that has received relatively more attention vis-à-vis race/ethnicity is career identity. Some of this research was previously discussed above in the context of the age of possibilities. Another prime area of focus has been on racial/ethnic minorities’ educational pathways to—and away from—science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2167696813480503">Blake-Beard, Bayne, Crosby, Muller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2167696813480503">Chemers, Zurbriggen, Syed, Goza, &amp; Bearman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-2167696813480503">Syed, 2010a</xref>). Studies by Syed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-2167696813480503">Syed, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-2167696813480503">Syed, Goza, Chemers, &amp; Zurbriggen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-2167696813480503">Walker &amp; Syed, in press</xref>) and Chemers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2167696813480503">Chemers et al., 2011</xref>), in particular, have demonstrated the critical role of identity for racial/ethnic minorities’ attraction to and persistence in STEM. Although this research on career development can be considered distinct from the ethnic identity literature, the focus remains upon a domain that is somewhat unique for racial/ethnic minorities. Minorities are underrepresented at all levels of the STEM pipeline, and thus this research is situated within a problem that is defined by the individuals’ minority status. In contrast, there is much less research on race/ethnicity and career development more generally. Considering the centrality of identity to emerging adulthood, there is a pressing need for such research.</p>

<title>Challenges to Future Research on Emerging Adulthood</title>
<p>Although the five pillars are critical to the theory of emerging adulthood, they do not represent the totality of issues pertinent to the age group. In the subsequent paragraphs, we briefly outline some of the major challenges to research on emerging adulthood, which were not covered in the context of the five pillars.</p>
<sec id="section10-2167696813480503">
<title>What About the Other Half?</title>
<p>One of the major criticisms of research on emerging adulthood is that it has mostly relied on college students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2167696813480503">Hendry &amp; Kloep, 2007</xref>). Despite the fact that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813480503">Arnett’s (2004)</xref> original research included emerging adults who were both in college and not in college, the rest of the research literature has not followed suit. Indeed, the vast majority of the research reviewed in this article was based on college students.</p>
<p>Years ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-2167696813480503">Rosenbaum (2001)</xref> coined the term the <italic>forgotten half</italic> to refer to the nearly 50% of American youth who do not attend college. This number is even greater for racial/ethnic minority and low-income youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2167696813480503">Cooper, Chavira, &amp; Mena, 2005</xref>). Thus, attending college is not the norm, yet conducting our research with college-going emerging adults is. Clearly the research base needs to be more inclusive.</p>
<p>Not only is most of the research on emerging adulthood conducted with college students, but the majority is conducted with college students of a particular type: large, 4-year, research-based university attendees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2167696813480503">Arnett, 2008</xref>). Such universities represent a fraction of higher education options pursued by young people. Indeed, nearly three quarters of all college students in the United States are considered nontraditional, meaning that they did not begin immediately after high school, attend part-time, and/or maintain full-time employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-2167696813480503">Waters, Carr, &amp; Kefalas, 2011</xref>). This statistic highlights the enormous heterogeneity of college students. From a research perspective, it also complicates the definition of “college student.” Much of the existing psychological research has not appreciated or explored the diversity of college students, even at large research-oriented universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-2167696813480503">Syed, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-2167696813480503">2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>Developing the research base on non-college-going emerging adults would help contribute to a further understanding of the distinction between emerging adults and emerging adulthood discussed previously. The majority of the existing research has focused on emerging adults in emerging adulthood, but greater inclusion of youth not in college may provide greater insights into adults living in the era of emerging adulthood. This is a significant issue for all research on emerging adulthood, not only research with racial/ethnic minorities, yet due to the disparities in college enrollment and persistence it is particularly important in this context.</p>

<sec id="section11-2167696813480503">
<title>Dimensions of Diversity: Intersecting Demographics and Identities</title>
<p>Despite the strong research focus on the identity development of emerging adults, there is still much room for improvement. Two recent advances in the identity development literature suggest important routes for future directions. First, researchers across the social sciences have become increasingly attuned to how different social categories, such as race, ethnicity, gender, and social class, intersect with one another to create unique social contexts and life experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2167696813480503">Cole, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2167696813480503">Hurtado, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-2167696813480503">Shields, 2008</xref>). This interest was inspired by the theory of <italic>intersectionality</italic> created by feminists of color to highlight the interlocking nature of oppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2167696813480503">Crenshaw, 1994</xref>). Intersectionality rejects “single-axis” analyses of difference as incomplete. In particular, oppressions based on social identities are not additive but rather intersect to create qualitatively different experiences. For example, the category “Black women” is unique in its own right and cannot be understood by simply adding the experiences of being Black to those of being a woman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2167696813480503">Bowleg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2167696813480503">Collins, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>In the context of ongoing debates within the emerging adulthood literature, the intersection of race/ethnicity and social class is particularly important. In the United States, racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately represented among the poor and working class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2167696813480503">DeNavas-Walt et al., 2010</xref>), rendering it difficult in research efforts to disentangle whether observed differences can be attributed to racial/ethnic differences or to social class differences. Studies that have taken up this question in the emerging adulthood literature indicate that racial/ethnic differences can largely be explained by class differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2167696813480503">Arnett, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-2167696813480503">Swartz et al., 2011</xref>). This approach, however, is more consistent with an additive rather than intersectional approach to multiple social identities. That is, there is a dearth of research directly assessing how race/ethnicity and social class intersect to create unique life experiences in emerging adulthood. Thus, although our statistical procedures are able to separate the effects of race/ethnicity from the effects of social class, they may assume an inaccurate homogeneity in how social class is experienced across racial/ethnic lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2167696813480503">Cauce et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The other recent development in the identity literature is closely related to the first. Drawing from both intersectionality and Eriksonian identity theory, researchers have begun to examine the intersections among emerging adults’ subjectively experienced identities, not simply their demographic categories. This research on the development of multiple identities has focused on domains such as ethnic, national, career, family, and religious identities, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2167696813480503">Kiang, Yip, &amp; Fuligni, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-2167696813480503">Syed, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-2167696813480503">Yip, Kiang, &amp; Fuligni, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-2167696813480503">Walker &amp; Syed, in press</xref>). Other research has explored multiple identities within a domain, most notably how individuals from mixed ethnic backgrounds think about and integrate their multiple ethnicities into a coherent whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2167696813480503">Cheng &amp; Lee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-2167696813480503">Renn, 2003</xref>). Developing a sense of integration and coherence among multiple identities is a central developmental task of emerging adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813480503">Arnett, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2167696813480503">Azmitia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2167696813480503">Erikson, 1968</xref>), and yet the research literature has scarcely examined what this process looks like, how it unfolds over time, and what its implications are for mental health and well-being.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-2167696813480503">
<title>Expanding Sample and Methods</title>
<p>Research on racial/ethnic variations in emerging adulthood would benefit from expanded methodological focus. Although there has been relatively little focus on race, ethnicity, and emerging adulthood in the United States, there is an alarming absence of studies outside of the United States that take such a focus. Granted, the United States is among the most racially/ethnically diverse countries in the world. But even in Canada, which is also highly diverse, there have been few studies on the minority segments of the emerging adult population (see, for exceptions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2167696813480503">Cheah &amp; Nelson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2167696813480503">Kundu &amp; Adams, 2005</xref>). The adolescence literature, in comparison, has done a better job of diversifying its samples and research foci. An excellent example is the Immigrant Youth and Transition Project, a study of the acculturation and psychological adjustment of over 5,000 adolescents from 13 countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2167696813480503">Berry, Phinney, Sam, &amp; Vedder, 2006</xref>). Research by Verkuyten and colleagues has examined identity among Turkish–Dutch and Moroccan–Dutch youth in the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-2167696813480503">Verkuyten, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-2167696813480503">Verkuyten &amp; Yildiz, 2007</xref>), but much of this work is situated within social psychology and thus does not take up many of the questions of direct interest to emerging adulthood scholars. In sum, although emerging adulthood research is found around the world, most of it relies on the participation of the majority members of the populations.</p>
<p>Finally, research on emerging adulthood has mostly relied on cross-sectional studies. There is a great need for increased use of longitudinal studies to truly understand the developmental aspects of emerging adulthood. Simple questions such as when, how, and why youth “enter” and “exit” emerging adulthood have no answers yet. Conducting such research with racially/ethnically diverse samples would be an invaluable step toward understanding whether or not the basic experiences of emerging adulthood vary by race/ethnicity. One strength of the emerging adulthood literature is that it has included qualitative studies in addition to the traditional quantitative research. A mostly unrealized methodological approach, however, is the longitudinal qualitative study, which allows for discovering nuances in developmental processes that are not well understood (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-2167696813480503">Morgan, Thorne, &amp; Zurbriggen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-2167696813480503">Swartz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-2167696813480503">Syed, 2010a</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Theory and research has advanced substantially since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2167696813480503">Arnett’s (2000)</xref> landmark paper on emerging adulthood. Although some critics have suggested that emerging adulthood is a luxury of the White middle class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2167696813480503">Hendry &amp; Kloep, 2007</xref>), there have been few focused studies or reviews to support or refute that claim. Because there is little research that directly assesses the role of race/ethnicity for emerging adulthood, we drew heavily from existing research that addresses the topic indirectly. Our analysis both highlights reasonable cause to believe emerging adulthood may not generalize to racial/ethnic minorities and suggests that some commonly held notions and stereotypes (e.g., interdependence) may be inappropriately invoked in attempts to invalidate the idea of emerging adulthood. So, do youth from racial/ethnic background “get to be” emerging adults? Is emerging adulthood restricted to the White majority as some have claimed? Clearly, there are no straight answers to these questions. Perhaps, it is best to offer one derived from the spirit of emerging adulthood: in some ways yes, in some ways no. It is our hope that future researchers will use this review to gain clarity on these and other questions of great importance to racial/ethnic minorities.</p>
