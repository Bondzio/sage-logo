<p>Over the last decade, sanctuary has been evoked as an alternative to the problems associated with an exclusionary statist asylum regime. In Canada, the United States, and Europe, a “cities of sanctuary” movement has emerged, articulated through various political vocabularies. This movement conceives of sanctuary not simply as a church-based site where asylum seekers may be secured but offers a host of welcoming practices within and beyond cities. This article specifically explores the UK-based City of Sanctuary movement, with a focus on the case of Glasgow, which has widely been read as exemplifying hospitality toward an empowerment of asylum seekers. It has been argued that while a statist discourse of fear—a “politics of unease”—posits migrants as a threat to be policed, the City of Sanctuary stimulates a softer approach. Yet, this article illustrates how the City of Sanctuary is also mobilizing a deeply troubling “politics of ease.” Based on an ethnographic investigation, I show how a politics of ease renders intractable the serious problem of protracted waiting that many controls many asylum seekers. In doing so, I demonstrate how the seemingly hospitable City of Sanctuary in fact contributes to a hostile asylum regime by indefinitely deferring and even extending a temporality of waiting.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It has been suggested that “the ancient notion of sanctuary is increasingly catching the imagination of people today.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0304375412469314">1</xref></sup> In my own ever-gentrifying neighborhood, spas boast services that provide a sanctuary escape. Meanwhile, I find a brochure to the Edinburgh Zoo referring to itself as a place of safety, a sanctuary for its recent guest: the Chinese panda. At the 2012 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, celebrities such as Paul McCartney and Penelope Cruz joined a Greenpeace campaign suggesting that we need to “draw a line in the ice” and create an “Arctic Sanctuary.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0304375412469314">2</xref></sup> So too, various politicians latch on to this concept suggesting that a violent asylum system may be challenged by “reviving” the sacred tradition of sanctuary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0304375412469314">3</xref></sup> For instance, Christina McKelvie, Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP), asserts that she “hates the word asylum”; what we need is a more “welcoming, universal and ancient practice of sanctuary.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0304375412469314">4</xref></sup> McKelvie, like others, have argued that this is especially the case in Glasgow—a city currently housing the largest number of asylum seekers in the United Kingdom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0304375412469314">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>City of Sanctuary is a grassroots movement that is gaining particular attention in the United Kingdom for its promise to create places that are more welcoming and hospitable to refugees and asylum seekers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0304375412469314">6</xref></sup> This movement supposedly offers new vision, even a “new hope.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0304375412469314">7</xref></sup> To begin with, the City of Sanctuary claims to exceed a “conventional” understanding of sanctuary as confined to a physical location (i.e., a church). Instead, it operates as a fluid network of practices aimed at shifting hostile attitudes toward refugees and asylum seekers. The movement explicitly draws on a body of literature that views the city as relational; that is, constituted through dynamic relations rather than construed as a container.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0304375412469314">8</xref></sup> In this sense, the City of Sanctuary may be understood as “place-based” rather than “place-bound.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0304375412469314">9</xref></sup> This fluid network is often celebrated for encouraging physical proximity between people with varied experiences, what urbanist Jane Jacobs may call “proximate diversity.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0304375412469314">10</xref></sup> Supporters of the movement suggest such relations stimulate culturally rich and hospitable localities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0304375412469314">11</xref></sup> And these welcoming practices are often framed as an alternative to a hostile asylum regime whereby certain migrant groups are criminalized and subjected to exclusionary control.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0304375412469314">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>While the City of Sanctuary movement has been praised for these main reasons, I contend that the more insidious dimensions of this movement have been relatively neglected. In this article, I direct attention toward a play, entitled <italic>The Roundabout</italic>, written and performed by a group of asylum seekers in Glasgow that exposes a particularly problematic facet of the sanctuary movement. This play poignantly demonstrates how sanctuary may be serving to ease and domesticate a serious problem that many asylum seekers and refugees face; namely, the problem of waiting in a state of limbo. Through this play, sanctuary is revealed to function not as a solution to an exclusionary politics but as a problematic technology that in fact regularizes and depoliticizes a violent temporality of waiting.</p>
<p>I suggest that this play shows how sanctuary functions as a governmentalizing “politics of ease,” a subversion of Didier Bigo’s “politics of unease” that has been widely used to analyze migration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0304375412469314">13</xref></sup> Bigo contends that it is through the proliferation of fear and everyday unease that the control of particular categories of migrants is justified. This is compounded, he contends, by a politics of preemptive prediction, whereby such control is normalized, and indeed rendered necessary, through the projection of migrants as would-be criminals. Although this is a valuable insight, I suggest that what also requires attention is the power of <italic>unpredictability</italic>: where the future is suspended and deferred, continually unknown. Here I suggest that sovereignty can operate precisely through unpredictability, the deferral of a decision or knowable future, and that the City of Sanctuary certainly does not escape this expression of sovereignty and actually makes such a sovereign deferral possible. Indeed, by offering ways to better oneself while one waits, and by promising hope (that may come after waiting, after gaining Leave to Remain, or in some kind of after-life) sanctuary ameliorates, facilitates, and even extends the serious problems that are associated with an unpredictable state of deferral.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0304375412469314">14</xref></sup> In this way, I suggest, the City of Sanctuary’s ostensibly soft face is deeply misleading.</p>

<title>The Roundabout…</title>
<p>“We need to make the waiting room look more uncomfortable,” Omar interjects as various ideas are scrawled down in a spiral notebook.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0304375412469314">15</xref></sup> The other eight members of the group deliberate for a moment. The elected scribe crosses a few lines out with red ink and inserts a few more in its place. With only three days to go until the opening night of their play, entitled <italic>The Roundabout</italic>, there is a heightened sense of nervousness and focus. Thoughtful eyes dart around the room when one of the men asks how they plan to procure costumes for the play. Fits of laughter erupt as another man pontificates in a nasal voice and puffs out his chest, acting out the part of a haughty Home Office representative. And a long pause lingers between this group of men when someone asks: “who is going to act out the girl?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0304375412469314">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The only break in concentration arrives with the bowls of soup offered cheerily by a woman volunteering here at the Govan Integration Drop-in at the Pearce Institute.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0304375412469314">17</xref></sup> As the swirl of ideas cedes to the silent scooping of spoons, I find myself scanning the room and am reminded of our surroundings: a cold, fairly stark room where asylum seekers and refugees are welcomed to meet and eat once a week.</p>
<p>Perhaps, it is simply because I am the only one offering to read out the lines for the female character during rehearsal at the drop-in, but I feel welcomed into this creative space. The concept for this play was developed here three months ago. This group of men decided that they would like to create something, tell a story. This story was not designed for someone per se; it was partly the coming together and the creation itself that was attractive. The men decided it would be useful to sit down as a group and exchange experiences of waiting they have endured in Glasgow. These stories resound nuance, refusing to be stifled into an easy catch phrase, yet there were some striking overlaps and patterns that they wanted to discuss. One of these overlaps revolved around the metaphor of a roundabout. The experience of being caught up in a cycle of waiting with no immediate end in sight. The map below (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0304375412469314">figure 1</xref>) was drawn during these discussions by one of the men in the group who is seeking asylum in Glasgow. He entitled the map after the name of their play. The clock in the center of the diagram, he explained, represents his sense of uncertain waiting. Crucially, the clock is lodged between the drop-in center, known as a place of sanctuary, and the Home Office that is surrounded by lines denoting barbed wire. Although the drop-in offers some relief from the violent UK office, the two are inexorably entwined in the maze. </p>

</fig>
<p>Having had their claim for refugee status rejected and, as a result, having experienced the exhaustion of destitution (no access to government service benefits, no housing, no right to work all render the roundabout that much more poignant), many of these men relate to this maze. In this situation, many were thus forced into charity or, as they label it, forms of sanctuary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0304375412469314">18</xref></sup> Sanctuary and charity are often exhaled in the same frustrated breath, that kind of support one seeks when there is nowhere else to turn.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0304375412469314">19</xref></sup> Sanctuary support is described as their sole source of support or aid, eliciting a sense of dependency, uselessness, and invisibility. Although sanctuary is seen as necessary to these men, this practice is also bemoaned for its demanding passivity, an expectation to take and take as well as an invitation to wait.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0304375412469314">20</xref></sup> Or, in the case of the seemingly more empowering sanctuary practices, these men reflect on how they are expected to be productive while passively smoothing the ways they are being forced to wait. The group discussed how there are some spaces that offer ways to “come to terms” with the waiting they face, services that offer voluntary counseling support, and places where they can convene to discuss with others who have been through the asylum system—and gained Leave to Remain—what they may expect in the future.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0304375412469314">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The men determined that writing this play was going to be a different kind of practice. Although at moments they may have found some solace in the aforementioned kinds of sanctuary, right now they did not want to be offered this kind of hope. They did not want potential time lines to ease their waiting. They did not want to focus on how best to process their claim so that it might lead to a best outcome tomorrow. Writing this play was not about charity, safety, or an idealized hope. It was not even about those words: positive, progress. This play was about digging into the experience of waiting, fleshing it out. It seemed to me that this was an experience, in part, of getting angry. It was also a process interspersed with moments of laughter.</p>
<p>Once they had written the play, the men agreed they would like to share it with others. However, anxieties about packaging and reenacting these very raw and personal truths were close to the surface. They were hesitant to put themselves on display as spectacles, partly out of distain that this may just elicit pity (and so this roundabout of charity rotates on and on). Ultimately they decided that if they were going to endure the discomfort of waiting, the audience would have to share their ordeal. It was determined that they would not encourage others to simply watch. Instead, those people coming to view this play would actually become part of the play, participants in the scene. Rather than spectators, they would become spec-actors.</p>
<p>This approach was fine-tuned through discussions with Isabel Clara Harland De Benito and Nicky Bolland, volunteers at the drop-in center who have had experiences working with forum theater. This mode of theater may be traced to Augusto Boal who was influenced by the Latin American radical educationalist Paulo Freire’s pedagogy of the oppressed, and especially his idea that “the teacher is one who learns.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0304375412469314">22</xref></sup> Drawing on Boal, the volunteers suggested that forum theater refuses to offer a complete, didactic message for passive consumption. Rather this form of theater creates space in which it is possible for people to “transgress, to break conventions, to enter into the mirror of theatrical fiction, to rehearse forms of struggle,” which may incite an uneasy sense of incompleteness that seeks continual consideration and action.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0304375412469314">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>This form of theater aims to cut across what may be perceived as a cinematic viewing experience whereby, as Michael Shapiro describes it, one “move(s) from the city streets into the theater, a shift from voyageur to voyeur.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0304375412469314">24</xref></sup> Their performance plays with this shift by unsettling the position of the audience. It seeks to keep open and insist on the voyage itself and the encounters one may confront on the street. It is an attempt to cast the voyeur into a more tenuous position where they too are part of the performance of life in all its contingent complexity. Instead of moving from the city streets to the theater, one of the men explained to me that this is “street theatre.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0304375412469314">25</xref></sup> It is theater in the most mundane daily sense of the word, designed to be as much of a chance encounter as one might experience on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>To me, this was exemplified the day of the “performance” when the men welcome their “audience” into the room in a style that seems perhaps less than welcoming to the predominantly English-speaking crowd. One of the actors commences a monologue in Swahili. A few people in the crowd exchange confused glances with one another, searching for a glint of meaning. Challenging a model of communication that necessitates a linguistic consensus as a condition for politics, here the actor seems to enact political voice by challenging “those who claim to speak correctly.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0304375412469314">26</xref></sup> This monologue trundles on to the point where a few people in the audience begin to squirm and riffle through pockets, looking for scraps of paper as if to confirm they are in the right place. Eventually, in what was a more “familiar” language to many people in the room, the actor exclaims, “I’m tired of all this! It's driving me crazy . . . //toing and froing . . . not knowing anything . . . //I'm fed-up!”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0304375412469314">27</xref></sup> The actor weaves around the room stopping briefly at different stations: the Home Office, a medical clinic and a lawyer’s office. At the lawyers office, the man acting the part of solicitor looks at his watch and states apathetically,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Ah, well you’ll need to make an appointment. Jenny (he calls across the room without getting up), when’s the next available appointment?</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Jenny:</speaker>
<p>Two weeks from now—the 13th of November.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Papa:</speaker>
<p> But that’s far too late—we need to submit an appeal in three days . . . </p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Solicitor:</speaker>
<p>Don't worry, I will try my best to help you. You’ve got plenty of time. We’ll be in touch with the home office—<italic>don’t worry</italic>.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mama:</speaker>
<p> This boy is very sick . . . we must go to the clinic immediately!<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0304375412469314">28</xref></sup></p>
</speech>
</disp-quote>
<p>This scene depicts the actors’ refusal to be appeased by a detached hope. There may be “plenty of time” for the solicitor, there may be hope in some distant future promising to assuage their concerns, but here in this scene this is not sufficient. There is no action plan, no program offered through the play to resolve this nausea-inducing roundabout. Instead, suddenly—in what seems to be the middle of the play—one of the men asks some of the people “watching” the play: “what do you think?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0304375412469314">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>An uncomfortable pause follows, but the actor does not revise the question in order to make it more inviting. Part of me wishes that he would. A woman standing next to me says, “I don’t know how realistic the performance is.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0304375412469314">30</xref></sup> This leads to a debate, back and forth between a few people in the room. Some feel it is too bleak, for others it is not bleak enough. The play resumes and halts again with another query to the audience: “and what are your experiences with destitution?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0304375412469314">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is no obvious or neat resolution to the play. There is no clean conclusion, no exit to <italic>The Roundabout</italic>. What appears to be another interruption in the sequence of acted events turns out to be an opening to a conversation that bleeds into smaller groups of people discussing amongst themselves how they experienced the play. The woman I end up speaking with is a resident of Bearsden, a relatively genteel residential area of Glasgow. She tells me that when she first arrived at the performance today, she was quite confused, even irritated. She assumed she was coming to watch a play, why was she expected to take part like that? She did not sign up to be cast in this performance. Yet, she also said that she had never been quite so affected by a performance, “it really brought me in, it made me wonder more about these things.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0304375412469314">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>The city streets, as traversed by these actors, were revealed anew to the Bearsden resident. They were not streamlined passages from one set of high-end boutiques and coffee shops to the next, rather they were fractured labyrinth-like routes interrupted with blocks and endless delays. This room in the Pearce Institute—a far cry from a glossy stage or theater—became an extension of the contested city streets of Glasgow. This street performance had a special capacity to illuminate Glasgow’s spatial and temporal rhythms. It seemed to reflect Maurice Blanchot’s observation of speech as a “detour” refusing to become “petrified”—an art form that “flees.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0304375412469314">33</xref></sup> This performance seemed to embody Shapiro’s suggestion that art holds political potential when it can “refashion force relations, oppose a politics that is mired in the official language of macropolitical institutions and thereby provide an opening to the micropolitics of everyday life.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0304375412469314">34</xref></sup></p>

<title>Mediating Waiting</title>
<p>Circulating through <italic>The Roundabout</italic> is a discussion of the serious problems associated with waiting. As an asylum seeker who has been waiting for refugee status for over nine years poignantly explained to me: “the waiting is a psychological holocaust.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0304375412469314">35</xref></sup> Even those who have been granted refugee status discover that indefinite waiting is often still a facet everyday life. As Gareth Muvley from the Scottish Refugee Council (SRC) points out, for those who are “integrated” it is difficult to know what this really amounts to. Many face structural impediments when looking for work and an impending sense of waiting persists. Integration often means integrating into destitution or chronic dependency on charity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0304375412469314">36</xref></sup> As applications for asylum status are postponed, put off, and delayed, this pattern of waiting becomes a way of life. This is seen by many refugees and asylum seekers as an oppressive and overlooked problem, a complicated apparatus that forces certain people to hurry up and wait, and wait, and wait . . . .</p>
<p>As suggested in the Introduction, the City of Sanctuary is often situated as remedying an exclusionary statist asylum regime. Most importantly, sanctuary supposedly alleviates this problem of waiting by offering a vision, one that is often linked with a transcendental and sacred hope, a link I would now like to consider in more detail.</p>
<p>The account of sanctuary as a hopeful practice was in full swing at the City of Sanctuary “World Ceilidh” event in Glasgow. Bagpipe music streamed out of the Multicultural Centre, welcoming passers-by to participate. Inside, confusion met laughter as kilt-clad aficionados spun around less coordinated beginners to the fast-paced dance, “strip the willow.” Amid this swirl of activity, another group of people circled around a large table where a poster lies. It is blank, save the title: what does sanctuary mean to you? A few people pick up the thick markers, which are sprawled across the poster, and write down their responses. A variety of phrases emerge: “welcoming,” “hospitable” and the most prevalent (and also the City of Sanctuary’s motto), “a place of safety.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0304375412469314">37</xref></sup> As discussions ensue, it becomes apparent that this notion of safety is not simply understood simply as physical protection. As one participant suggests, “Glasgow’s city of sanctuary is a place of safety because it offers hope, hope for the future and for being part of a community.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0304375412469314">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>This view that sanctuary provides safety and hope is also reiterated in Rebecca Rotter’s in-depth analysis of asylum practices in Glasgow. Rotter illustrates how many people are typically compelled to wait for extreme lengths of time as their asylum cases are considered, or after their cases have been rejected. Some, she notes, have waited in this liminal state for ten years. The difficulty of this waiting is captured in a statement made by one of her interviewees: “when you are waiting, you are not on the ground. You are hanging in-between somewhere, in limbo.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0304375412469314">39</xref></sup> Although this problem of being forced to wait “in-between” is endemic in the United Kingdom, and especially Glasgow, she suggests that there are emergent “spaces of sanctuary” that are combating the problems associated with waiting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0304375412469314">40</xref></sup> Echoing the views expressed at the ceilidh, she depicts sanctuary as offering safety and, crucially, hope. She defines spaces of sanctuary as “social settings through which understandings of waiting were developed, forms of hope nurtured, and action to improve everyday life and chances of securing Leave to Remain, instigated.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0304375412469314">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Based on her participation in various Glasgow-based charitable organizations. She suggests that
<disp-quote>
<p>Against the backdrop of protracted waiting, [these spaces] provided a setting within which social ties could be reconstituted, concerns identified and communicated, trust re-established, and concrete protection secured . . . . these were a space of trust, unquestioned acceptance, protection and security, and as such, could be regarded as a space of sanctuary <italic>from</italic> the asylum process and immigration. [emphasis added]<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0304375412469314">42</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>Rotter claims that these spaces are vital in the face of hostile practices of displacement, dispersal, and threats of deportation. These “formal support structures, she writes, offered the means by which exclusion, marginalization and alienation could be addressed and to some extent, transformed.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0304375412469314">43</xref></sup> Sanctuary here is depicted as a valuable site offering connection and reprieve from an otherwise quite bureaucratic and marginalizing experience of waiting.</p>
<p>What I want to draw particular attention to here, however, is the manner by which Rotter poses sanctuary spaces as essential for “the social mediation of waiting: people’s attempts to anticipate their futures, to make sense of their experiences and to hope for the desired future.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0304375412469314">44</xref></sup> Sanctuary, in this sense, is presented as a tool for those people who are seeking asylum to come to grips with the groundlessness of waiting, the limbo zone. Indeed, as Rotter points out, many people who are seeking asylum find these spaces of sanctuary a crucial aid to “cope with the uncertainty and powerlessness of their predicament, to improve the circumstances of everyday life, and to enhance possibilities for the future.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0304375412469314">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rotter draws a comparison between this kind of experience of waiting with the testimony of dialysis patients who apparently “felt that life was being stalled due to the endless, repetitive process of dialysis” and were “denied a sense of progressive time.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0304375412469314">46</xref></sup> She suggests that despite the absence of a postulated end, her participants were empowered to make this time meaningful and hopeful through sanctuary spaces:

<p>Religious frameworks were drawn upon to make sense of predicaments; activities were undertaken to shift attention away from the strain of waiting; and hope, which oriented them to the positive modality of waiting, was carefully fostered through social interaction. Such strategies constitute agency in terms of making meaning from otherwise confounding affairs and aiming to bring about concrete and beneficial changes in individuals’ lives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0304375412469314">47</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>Rotter goes on to suggest that while waiting may be seen as an overwhelmingly negative condition, for some it was possible to transform it into a positive experience. Such a possibility was dependent upon the ability to imbue the time of waiting with <italic>value</italic>. In other words, waiting could, in certain instances, be seen as a productive condition. Through this exploration, it was possible to reconsider what the object of waiting—gaining Leave in the United Kingdom—symbolized, in a clearer light.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0304375412469314">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Here sanctuary is constituted as a reclamation of what Rotter poses as “positive” and “progressive” time, that is, time as understood as moving forward toward some more desirable end.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0304375412469314">49</xref></sup> Or, perhaps, in the words of the City of Sanctuary’s official goal, it is about providing a vision. Waiting is not a static experience of being held still; supposedly, it can be productive, active, and infused with value. The SRC has made a similar point that “keeping busy” is seen to be a welcome and perhaps necessary distraction that can “avoid [one] thinking about problems” or “becoming psychologically depressed.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0304375412469314">50</xref></sup></p>

<title>A Politics of Ease</title>
<p>Creating opportunities for “making sense” of extended periods of waiting and providing “positive” hope for the “desired future” is undoubtedly important. This next section, however, considers whether this sanctuary ritual might serve to attenuate the serious problems of waiting that was expressed in <italic>The</italic> <italic>Roundabout</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0304375412469314">51</xref></sup> Does sanctuary threaten to ease problem of waiting in such a way that it renders it an intractable problem? Although the fluid practices promoted through the City of Sanctuary movement may exceed the spatially contained practice that holds one in church for instance, might this seemingly open movement serve to hold through a spatiotemporal grasp in the form of a promise of tomorrow . . . and tomorrow . . . and tomorrow?</p>
<p>During the City of Sanctuary National AGM and also at the ceilidh event in Glasgow, there was emphasis on providing asylum seekers, who are denied the right to work, avenues for career development. Time, it was suggested, can still be “productive” even during the period one waits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0304375412469314">52</xref></sup> In this vein, the Glasgow City of Sanctuary aims to link people seeking asylum with a myriad of internship positions. This enables people to develop networks and experience for potential work in the future. So too it is envisioned that this may yield a sense of productivity and agency even though people are put on hold in other respects.</p>
<p>However, in speaking with migrants about such internship “tracks” another dimension of this process was revealed to me. It seems that the problem of waiting risks being normalized and domesticated through some of these processes or rituals of sanctuary. For instance, this was exemplified when Amid explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>I keep going along and volunteering to be part of something, but how long can this go on? I feel I have invested here, so I cannot say ‘this is not fair’ or something like that. I would like to scream ‘I have been here too long waiting!’ but I have to keep in this.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0304375412469314">53</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>What partially emerges in Amid’s statement is that while such internships open certain opportunities, they also serve to confine his dissatisfaction with waiting. The promise of a future itself becomes a way of restricting his screams in the present that may voice the intolerability of being put on hold. Having opted into a project so too he somewhat opts into a commitment to a “progressive” time that becomes difficult to step out of. This too is echoed in the play where the men are offered the placatory words of a solicitor who implies—just hang on, hang tightly secured to the roundabout.</p>
<p>I was also struck when I met Jamal, who explained that although he was very grateful for the support offered through his local church sometimes it feels that “there are just little hopes, little things that keep me busy, keep me from making some really different life.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0304375412469314">54</xref></sup> As with Amid there is a sense that these patchwork practices of sanctuary help to lighten some of the difficulties associated with waiting; however, they also serve to de-fang, smooth out, and ease the seriousness of this problem.</p>
<p>In investigating security practices in relation to the question of migration, Didier Bigo suggests that it is a “politics of unease” that largely governs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0304375412469314">55</xref></sup> For instance, it is through the circulation of fears (such as “terrorism”) in addition to the proliferation of everyday seemingly mundane insecurities that we accept invasive technologies of control to govern life. This too produces fears (of deportation, detainment, etc.) for certain groups, such as asylum seekers, that may operate as a deterrent. For instance, these fears may ultimately force people from a position of waiting leading them to “voluntarily” return “home.” This concept is worthy of further attention for it seems that it is partly the proliferation of fear that creates a demand for sanctuary’s hopeful promise.</p>
<p>Yet I think that Amid and Jamal’s comments above unfurl another facet requiring consideration in relation to this politics of unease. What is hinted at through certain deployments of sanctuary is that there is also an <italic>easing</italic>, or domesticating, of the problems tied to waiting. Sanctuary holds out potential, and yet it may justify a “suffer[ing] in the present in the hope that enjoyment will come later.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0304375412469314">56</xref></sup> One is encouraged to accept or even embrace this waiting state. One is enjoined to approach this waiting as part of a progress story, a journey toward full citizenship perhaps, or toward greater cultural integration. This process is particularly evident in Rotter’s analysis that frames sanctuary practices in Glasgow as offering a host of opportunities for people while they wait. Rotter conceptualizes waiting as a “consequential phase in the quest for protection, hope and security.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0304375412469314">57</xref></sup> Despite the serious struggles that many asylum seekers endure as they wait, she frames this in productive and positive terms. She states that during extended waiting periods,
<disp-quote>
<p>Individuals have been able to re-construct social ties; pursue educational opportunities; enhance personal security; gain greater control over their ‘cases’; and undertake selective socio-cultural adaptation. They have also utilized a discourse of ‘integration’ circulating in Scotland to garner public support for their struggles for recognition and the right to remain . . . [Eventually], people were able to realize the ‘normal lives’ for which they had been waiting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0304375412469314">58</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>For Rotter, sanctuary is a key process through which waiting is, thankfully, eased. It is through welcoming sanctuary practices that the waiting state becomes a productive state enabling one to enhance their social ties and future opportunities. Here, a governmentalizing process operates in such a way as to incite a commitment to the rules of the game, where one willingly submits and indeed invests in the deferral, the roundabout. Of course, this does not replace Bigo’s politics of unease; rather, the politics of ease exhibited through sanctuary is perhaps another tint in the exclusionary pallet controlling migration. Sanctuary, it seems, assumes the gentler face of this kind of control. In some cases, it challenges the discourse of fear with a particular hope. Yet might the two also become intimately interwoven to produce an even more exclusionary politics? </p>
<p>As we have seen in the case of internship programs, waiting can be repackaged within a narrative of “progressive” and “positive” and “valuable’ time.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0304375412469314">59</xref></sup> Indeed, there is a productivity implied in this waiting. However, this offer of productivity also serves to encourage people to retain in, what Pierre Bourdieu terms, the <italic>illusio</italic>: a belief that the “game” we collectively agree to play is worth playing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0304375412469314">60</xref></sup> My intention here is not to make a normative claim about the meaning or role of sanctuary’s hope production as good/bad. Rather, it is to illuminate how in certain contexts hope may be, inadvertently, functioning as a technology that controls through a type of deferral. These particular sanctuary practices that instill hope may mediate and ease the problems associated with waiting. Yet, perhaps this easing is not as challenging to a hostile politics as it first appears. Indeed, in easing the problem of waiting invests the waiting game with meaning. I suggest that, in this way the city of sanctuary feeds into and sustains a powerful state of deferral.</p>

<sec id="section5-0304375412469314">
<title>Easing Unpredictability</title>
<p>In relation to this problem of a politics of unease, Bigo’s concept of prediction is also worthwhile to consider in the context of the temporality of waiting and how it may serve as a technique of control. I recently attended a public seminar <italic>Security, Prevention, Prediction</italic>, where Bigo explained that a politics of unease is increasingly justifying the production and use of technologies that claim to better predict the future. He contended that our lives are looking more and more like the science fiction film <italic>Minority Report</italic>, where pre-cog-like technologies are deployed to monitor and foresee the future. In and through the application of such technologies, would-be criminals are deterred even before acting. We are witnessing an expansion of “technologies of anticipation” to which we willingly submit precisely because of a politics of unease—the fears infiltrating everyday life—seem to dominate our lives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0304375412469314">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>In leaving the lecture theater, I found myself in conversation with a man named Medhi who explained that he is an Iranian asylum seeker living in Glasgow. For Medhi, having waited for nearly five years in Glasgow for Leave to Remain, the future is quite unknown. On one hand, the predictability that Bigo describes does seem to speak to Medhi’s experience of waiting. As Medhi suggested, he feels that as a person who is seeking asylum he has been made into a “criminal” without ever having committed a crime.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0304375412469314">62</xref></sup> We might view this imposed criminality as exhibiting Bigo’s notion about a specific future projected upon certain populations (those people seeking asylum high among them). Medhi has not committed a crime; however, as Bigo argued this is exactly how the logic of anticipation operates – it is not a question of “if” one has committed a crime, but an logic that assumes that it is a matter of “when.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0304375412469314">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet, on the other hand, Medhi was clear that the notion of prediction did not seem quite sufficient. Given that he is forced to wait indefinitely he explained that he feels cast into a system largely defined by <italic>unpredictability</italic>. Reminiscent of many other conversations I have had with asylum seekers in the United Kingdom, Medhi explained that firm dates for his case hearings have not provided by the Home Office and appeals seem to be indefinitely suspended. This is also encapsulated by Jan-Paul Brekke’s observation that the “object for which asylum seekers [are] waiting present[s] itself at an unidentifiable point in the unfolding future, giving waiting an open-endedness.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0304375412469314">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>While this application of prediction may shed some critical light, it seems that what requires more thought is how an unpredictability of the future also functions as a way of controlling certain migrant categories. It seems vital to consider the role that an unknown future (and the continual deferral of a known future) plays in governing people like Medhi. Here, again, Bourdieu's conception of power is also helpful to glean insight into this practice. Bourdieu suggests that power is partially conceived as the ability to “make oneself unpredictable and deny other people any reasonable anticipation, to place them in total uncertainty by offering no scope to their capacity to predict.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0304375412469314">65</xref></sup> At the same time that unpredictability may serve to control, Bourdieu also notes that it is through a clinging to hope in the future to come, an “aiming at something greatly desired” which maintains the “durability” of this formulation of power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0304375412469314">66</xref></sup> Crucially, a person can be “held” only insofar as she or he possesses the illusio, commitment – in this instance – to the waiting game.</p>
<p>So how does this relate to sanctuary? Sanctuary, understood as a conduit of safety and hope, eases the concerns of unpredictability. Although this may serve a helpful role in some respects, I have also illuminated how this can also neutralize or domesticate the dissatisfaction with this unpredictability (as Jamal explained, he “could not scream” about his frustration of waiting). Here, perhaps these sanctuary practices may be bound up in the problem of deferral in that they sustain the condition of waiting through mediating this experience. In a sense, sanctuary here aims to shift ones orientation toward waiting, without necessarily altering the wait itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0304375412469314">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>While the City of Sanctuary may extend a particular kind of hope, in so doing it risks sustaining a state of deferral, troublingly rendering it more durable and paralyzing. I suggest that where sanctuary practices are concerned we need to think more seriously about these processes of easing unpredictability rather than merely a politics of unease that governs through prediction and fear.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Many are keen to celebrate the City of Sanctuary. Sanctuary seems to offer a sacred escape from exclusionary statist practices and sovereign power; it opposes hostile approaches to those in need.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0304375412469314">68</xref></sup> It supposedly challenges punitive practices such as deportation, detainment, and dispersal, said to constitute a “three-pronged restriction regime” in the United Kingdom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0304375412469314">69</xref></sup> This article does not dispute that these three-prongs represent violent practices that demand critical study; however, I suggest that the dimension of deferral, which implies a temporality of waiting, requires further investigation particularly for its seeming innocuousness. Indeed, it is precisely through an appeal to an idealized vision or hope that the City of Sanctuary holds certain migrants in an exclusionary grip.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0304375412469314">70</xref></sup> Here, the City of Sanctuary is coextensive with sovereignty as state of <italic>deferral</italic>: a diffuse power that suspends decision, holding certain figures in an unpredictable limbo.</p>
<p>I suggest that inadvertently the City of Sanctuary, which seeks to “ease” this limbo, adds momentum to the violent roundabout. One of the paradoxes, or aporetic logics, teased out in this article is that the very practices of sanctuary that are supposedly temporary and offering safety can end up functioning as a more permanent state of liminality that fix certain migrants in suspense. In this way, sanctuary does not represent a solution, but a problematic. In particular, I suggest it is vital to consider this supplicatory vein that runs through the seemingly warm sanctuary linkage: sanctuary–safety–hope.</p>
<p>Although the charitable sanctuary practices may extend a hand of safety and hope (to “mediate” the waiting process), this process also serves to normalize passivity and the problems associated with protracted waiting. In extending this kind of helping hand, these sanctuary rituals also seem to extend a hold. Troublingly, the City of Sanctuary movement tends to refashion this passivity as a supposedly “active” form of citizenship (through internship programs, or other forms of cultural citizenship), again rendering this a more intractable problem.</p>
<p>While there is no simple escape from such a problematic, we are wise to pay heed to the continual detours that question these sanctuary promises of hopeful escape. I suggest the street theater is one such detour. Perhaps, one may argue, this artistic performance itself is just another release valve for a systemic process of deferral and unpredictability facing asylum seekers. So too, one may contend, this theater brings into visibility an experience of victimhood that, in fact, reifies victimization through the spectacle. However, I suggest that through the experimental interplay between visibility/invisibility that brought spect-actors into the unpredictable scene, the relationships between the people in this room were rendered productively fragile. This scene depicted and opened up a set of struggles. It was not about smoothing over or easing unpredictability. In part, it was reclaiming the unpredictable as a contested zone, illuminating the breaks and delays as a site for political conversation and contestation. The performance expressed the frustrations of being told: “be calm sir, we will know later.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0304375412469314">71</xref></sup> This sort of sovereign grip that holds one in abeyance was revealed to be a serious problem requiring further political work.</p>
<p>Although this performance emerges in a space of charity providing hope, which in some ways serves to “petrify” supplicatory relations, it also cuts across such petrified abjecthood. While bringing people together, this is not primarily about “keeping busy” nor promoting the sort of relational politics of which figures like Doreen Massey warn against: that which tends toward a “bland diversity.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0304375412469314">72</xref></sup> This is not an attempt to ease the concerns associated with waiting (by giving food, giving a romanticized hope). These problems are not just repackaged for consumption; rather they palpably bring to the fore the problematic politics of deferral and ease within which sanctuary is caught. I wish to close with these artful practices, for I suggest they represent an opening. These practices are a vital opening in that they embody a way to interrupt the waiting state, refusing to abide to the soft yet restricting sanctuary promise: don’t worry, hold on, and just wait.</p>

<p>In the past twenty years, the notion of “sanctuary” has vibrantly emerged in various contexts such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This practice seems to spark intrigue partly due to its “ancient” resonance. We are told this is the oldest form of refuge, a practice that secures the helpless in a safe and sacred place. See: Linda Rabben, <italic>Give Refuge to the Stranger: The Past, Present and Future of Sanctuary </italic>(California: Left Coast Press, 2011). A straight, unbreakable line is often etched from contemporary sanctuary practices backward to a Roman conception, which appears to naturally emerge from an ancient Greek origin. We are often told that the Greek notion of <italic>asylia</italic> organically grows into asylum (of which sanctuary is an offshoot). His article is part of my dissertation entitled <italic>City of Sanctuary: A State of Deferral?</italic> that takes issue with this framing. Following from genealogicalthinkers such as Raymond Geuss, I suggest that this type of historical amnesia problematically implies that the object being drawn out, such as sanctuary, is a unified “thing” that is given and has enjoyed a degree of consistency over time and space. What I take to be more significant is how this discourse has been deployed, functioning as a technology of control in various contexts. See: Raymond Geuss, “Nietzsche and Genealogy,” in <italic>Nietzsche</italic>, ed. John Richardson and Brian Leiter (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), 322–40.</p>

<p>Ibid. In 2000, a policy of dispersal was implemented for asylum applicants who, prohibited from working, could not survive without provision of financial support and accommodation from the government. Applicants were dispersed away from the major population center of London and the South East, to regional cities across the United Kingdom. Since that time, Glasgow has been the city with the largest number of dispersed applicants, with around 5,000 main applicants and their dependents housed each year.</p>

<p>National Annual City of Sanctuary Meeting (Nottingham Quaker Meeting House), October 31, 2011. Here hope is often invoked as a transcendental ideal, quite detached from the lived, corporeal realities of waiting. I do not wish to undermine the possibility of “hope” as a more critical, even radical expression. In fact, by unpacking the ways in which hope tends to become cemented within an idealized frame, through this particular discourse of sanctuary, this article may begin to contribute to a larger body of literature that seeks to create room to think about the language and embodiment of hope in more dynamic terms.

<p>Ibid. This framing of the city as a sacred sanctuary offering hope makes me wonder about Warren Magnusson’s claim that “there is no promise of transcendence in the municipality, although there is the possibility of acting together on matters of concern.” See Warren Magnusson, “The City of God and the Global City,” <italic>CTheory </italic>(October 5, 2006), accessed February 13, 2012, http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=520. Where the City of Sanctuary movement is concerned, there is an appeal to a politics of the everyday, an imminent order that challenges sovereign authority associated with “the state.” And yet, with regard to the City of Sanctuary, it would seem this supposedly imminent order is often tethered to a transcendental (sacred) promise. Magnusson persuasively suggests that the city is characterized by self-organization and a multiplicity of authorities, which imply “an indefinite deferral of sovereignty.” Magnusson, <italic>Politics of Urbanism: Seeing Like a City</italic> (London: Routledge 2011), 109. Yet where the City of Sanctuary is concerned might this deferral itself function as a form of sovereignty or at least an ordering that dovetails with sovereign exclusions it claims to escape?</p>

<p>Thanks to Delacey Tedesco and Cian O'Driscoll for suggesting I consider the spatiotemporal grammars implied in the City of Sanctuary discourse. One should note the prepositional shift deployed in the City of Sanctuary: from sanctuaries <italic>in</italic> the city to today’s cities <italic>of</italic> sanctuary. This seems to suggest entire cities and networks of cities are engulfed in a safety and sacredness supposedly associated with sanctuary: sanctuary is moving beyond containment and beyond a physical presence. Yet, the preposition “toward” is regularly deployed within the movement, emphasizing its role to provide a vision. This spatiotemporal grammar of moving toward gestures at a theological type of discourse that governs through an appeal to hope beyond (to be realized through the immanent practices of the city).</p>
