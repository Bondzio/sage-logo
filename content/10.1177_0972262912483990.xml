<p>The masterpiece under review provides a mesmerizing and astounding view of the chronicles that led to the present state of Asia through six meticulously researched chapters. Through a fleeting reference to the battle of Tsushima, the dying echoes of which have been resonating hitherto, the prologue sets the tone of the fast-paced action-packed book. The domino effect which the battle of Tsushima had on the Arabs, Turks, Persians, Vietnamese, Indonesians, Indians, Chinese and Egyptians has been dissected to the most microscopic level. Pankaj Mishra has performed a very minute deconstruction of the decisive war and its aftermath. The tome also examines how certain trailblazing, pathbreaking movements such as the Indian Mutiny, Anglo-Afghan Wars, Ottoman modernization, Turkish and Arab nationalism, the Chinese revolution, the First World War, the Paris Peace Conference, Japanese militarism, decolonization, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, fashioned Asia. The book will help dispel certain myths related to the two world wars and the nuclear stand-off between two super powers and establish the fact that it was another event in the preceding century which led to the awakening of a giant continent known as Asia. Icons like Mohandas Gandhi (1869–1948), Mustafa Kemal (1881–1938), Jawaharlal Nehru (1889–1964), Sun Yatsen (1866–1925), Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941), Abdurreshid Ibrahim (1857–1944), Phan Boi Chau (1867–1940), Rashid Rida (1865–1935) drew moral lessons from the triumph of Japan in the battle of Tsushima and brought about significant and much-needed changes in their own nations.</p>
<p>The timeline which the book covers is indeed very vast. It dwells on certain events which date back to almost 622 AD. The first chapter describes Napoleon’s conquest of Egypt, Alexandaria and thereafter his defeat. It dwells on Sir Thomas Roe’s visit to Emperor Jahangir’s court in 1616, the domination by the British around the year 1757 and the onslaughts carried out by Lord Macaulay. The British East India company used the fertile lands of eastern India for opium farming which it used to export to other countries in order to bring them under subjugation. The chapter discusses the destruction of Yuan Ming Yuan (the Gardens of Perfect Brightness) and explains at length how and why China relinquished the control of Honk Kong to the British apart from paying an indemnity of £6 million. The Opium Wars, also known as the Anglo-Chinese Wars—First Opium War (1839–1842) and the Second Opium War (1856–1860)—and the destruction of Yuan Ming Yuan are remembered hitherto as the most outrageous humiliations that China has ever suffered. The second chapter delves into the seminal contribution of the man who had launched one of the most violent attacks on Her Majesty’s Government and fought against Western encroachments, the man bearing the name Jamal al-Din al-Afghani who is revered (in a few countries) as the intellectual éminence grise of the Islamic Revolution. Al-Afghani was born in north–west Persia and travelled to India, Afghanistan, Egypt, Turkey, Alexandria, Russia trying to unify the Muslims. It may not be an exaggeration to say that it is impossible for human beings to measure al-Afghani’s work in unifying the followers of Islam although he was by no means an advocate of terrorist violence. The chapter highlights the differences between Ayatollah Khomeini and al-Afghani and Osama bin Laden and al-Afghani. The chapter also sheds light on the brilliant work of a few luminaries who brought about several reforms in the old, decrepit, noxious social-political order in the nineteenth century. It will also help in a deep understanding of the role played by Jews, Christians and Muslims in the nineteenth century. In fact al-Afghani had written some sentimental electrifying passages which might cause a worldwide upheaval even today and perhaps could even have invited a fatwa against him.</p>
<p>The third chapter begins with the incidence which led to the development of camaraderie between Japan and Istanbul in the 1890s. The chapter covers the expansion of the United States across the Pacific, the war between Japan and China over Korea, the games played by Russia, France and Germany and the majestic transformation of China under reformist intellectual giants like Liang Qichao, Kang Youwei, Yan Fu and Tan Sitong. The chapter delves into the Yihetuan Movement (also known as the Boxer Uprising) which was a proto-nationalist movement in China opposing foreign imperialism and Christianity. The early part of the fourth chapter is devoted to the effect of President Woodrow Wilson’s (28th President of the United States) fourteen points (his view of war aims and a post-war world order) on several powerful regimes. The chapter then moves on to Lenin who exposed a secret pact between France, Britain and Tsarist Russia. The latter part of the chapter sheds light on a few revolutionary developments in China. The fifth chapter delves into the ideologies of Rabindranath Tagore. The sixth chapter describes some of the major events and developments in Asia that took place in the twentieth century.</p>
<p>The author has built on the works of savant philosophers, noted novelists, journalists and historians like Bankim Chandra Chatterji, Edmund Burke, Ghulam Hussain Khan Tabatabai, Haji Mustapha, Yan Fu, Bhudev Mukhopadhyay, Swami Vivekananda, Abdul Halim Sharar, Fukuzawa Yukichi, Rifa’a Badawi Rafi al-Tahtawi, Flaubert, Tokutomi Soho. The book is a veritable tour de force which has been written with uncommon verve and clarity. Beyond doubt, the book is informative, enlightening, entertaining and sometimes terrifying. The book under review will especially be helpful in understanding the social and political tumult of several countries and exploring the vulnerabilities of a few races due to which they lost their own identities. The book contains startling facts. For instance, the author, Pankaj Mishra (p. 74), says that Egypt possessed telegraph and rail networks decades before Japan and China. It brings forth the fact that a Chinese scholar-official by the name of Li Hongzhang helped set up China’s first coal mines, telegraph networks and railway tracks in the 1870s (p. 139). The principle behind the extinction of nations (propounded by Liang, p. 151). A war in which an aeroplane dropped a bomb for the first time in the history of humankind is spoken of (p. 190). The reason why Indian philosophy had been a closed book to the majority of Indians has been explored (pp. 219–220). The book has some iconic photographs including the photograph of Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore involved in parley.</p>
<p>At a personal level, I feel that the reader should re-read the book after completing it once, in order to gain a sound understanding of the subject matter. The book will be of immense help to the champions of peace, strategic management, leadership studies, public policy, business ethics and values and political innovation.</p>
