<abstract>
<p>Race/ethnicity plays a role in the perception of rape and experiences of victims. This research explores sexual assault nurse examiners’ (SANE) perceptions of the influence of victims’ race/ethnicity on their responses in hospitals to rape, and whether SANEs have different ways of addressing the needs of victims of color when treating them. Data from interviews with 40 SANEs indicate that the majority believe victims of color respond to rape differently or face different issues than White victims do, and 30% of SANEs believed race/ethnicity with other factors influence responses. Half of SANEs interviewed have different ways of responding to victims based on race/ethnicity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Due to the medical system’s traumatizing and inefficient treatment of rape victims, sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE) programs began in the late 1970s. SANEs are specially trained forensic nurses who provide rape victims with emotional support, medical care, and quality and timely collection of evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1557085112454190">Brown, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1557085112454190">Campbell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1557085112454190">Ciancone, Wilson, Collette, &amp; Gerson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1557085112454190">Emergency Nurses Association, 2007</xref>). More specifically, they collect and document forensic evidence, provide prophylactic treatment for pregnancy, HIV, and STDs, and provide other medical referrals when necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1557085112454190">Ahrens et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1557085112454190">Ciancone et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1557085112454190">Ledray, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1557085112454190">Littel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1557085112454190">Plichta, Clements, &amp; Houseman, 2007</xref>). There are an estimated 600 SANE programs operating in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1557085112454190">International Association of Forensic Nurses [IAFN], 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1557085112454190">Ledray, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1557085112454190">Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner, 2010</xref>). Most SANE programs are hospital-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1557085112454190">Campbell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1557085112454190">IAFN, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Although previous research has explored rape victims’ experiences with the medical system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1557085112454190">Campbell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1557085112454190">Campbell &amp; Raja, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1557085112454190">Campbell, Wasco, Ahrens, Sefl, &amp; Barnes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1557085112454190">DuMont, White, &amp; McGregor, 2009</xref>), rape victim advocates’ perceptions of victims’ treatment in emergency rooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1557085112454190">Campbell &amp; Bybee, 1997</xref>), and rape victim advocates’ understanding of how victims’ experiences and responses to rape are influenced by race/ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1557085112454190">Maier, 2008</xref>), there is a gap in the research that details the views and experiences of SANEs. SANEs’ views are important given that victims are more likely to be treated by SANEs than non-SANEs, the number of SANE programs in the United States has increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1557085112454190">Ciancone et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1557085112454190">McLaughlin, Monahan, Doezema, &amp; Crandall, 2007</xref>), and only SANEs can discuss the ways they address the needs of victims of color who seek services in emergency departments (ED) after being raped.</p>
<p>Also, research examining different experiences and responses of victims of color is limited. Although it is commonly understood that rape should be understood through a gender and power lens, how race/ethnicity affects victims’ experiences and responses to rape and others’ responses to and treatment of victims of color are sometimes overlooked. Race/ethnicity has historically played a role in society’s perception of rape, the response of the criminal justice and legal systems to rapists, and the treatment, experiences and reactions of rape victims. Women of color face more challenges than White women obtaining assistance after rape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1557085112454190">Martin, 2005</xref>), there are limited services for victims of diverse backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1557085112454190">Macy, Giattina, Parish, &amp; Crosby, 2009</xref>), and they are less likely to seek help at rape crisis centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1557085112454190">Martin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1557085112454190">Wgliski, &amp; Barthel, 2004</xref>). Also, victims of color may be more reluctant to report victimization because they fear facing a biased criminal justice and legal system, do not think police will assist them, or anticipate being blamed by their family or community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1557085112454190">Kaukinen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1557085112454190">Low &amp; Organista, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1557085112454190">Martin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1557085112454190">McNair &amp; Neville, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1557085112454190">Thompson, Sitterle, Clay, &amp; Kingree, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to explore SANEs’ perceptions of how victims’ race/ethnicity influences their responses in the hospital to rape, and if they have different ways of addressing the needs of victims of color who seek services in EDs after being raped. SANEs, regardless of their own race/ethnicity, are in a unique position to witness how race/ethnicity may influence treatment and response because they are present if ED doctors are needed to medically clear victims with extensive injuries for treatment and examination by SANEs, when police officers interview victims, and when family and friends accompany victims to hospitals. They also assist victims in EDs shortly after the rape, when emotions can be raw. Because the purpose of this study was to explore SANEs’ perceptions of how victims’ race/ethnicity influences their responses in the hospital to rape, it is important to first explore previous literature on how race/ethnicity influences responses to rape.</p>

<title>Considerations for African American Victims</title>
<p>Race/ethnicity influences victims’ responses to rape, particularly their likelihood to discuss their victimization with others or report their victimization to law enforcement. Although African American women are more likely to be sexually victimized by African American men than men of another racial/ethnic group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1557085112454190">Collins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1557085112454190">Washington, 2001</xref>), the discussion of rape of African American women by African American men remains taboo in the African American community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1557085112454190">Collins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1557085112454190">Simmons, 2002</xref>), and African American women adopt a “culture of silence” around rape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1557085112454190">Campbell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1557085112454190">Collins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1557085112454190">Foley, Evancic, Karnik, King, &amp; Parks, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1557085112454190">Konradi &amp; Burger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1557085112454190">LaFree, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1557085112454190">Landwehr et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1557085112454190">Thompson &amp; West, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1557085112454190">Wriggins, 1995</xref>). First, the stereotype that African American women are strong, responsible for holding the family together, and therefore able to deal with victimization (“matriarch” stereotype) could also influence their silence about rape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1557085112454190">Collins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1557085112454190">Donovan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1557085112454190">Donovan &amp; Williams, 2002</xref>). Empirical research has found that because they are expected to be self-reliant in “hard times,” African American women influenced by the “matriarch” image are less likely than women from other racial/ethnic groups to seek mental health services, counseling or other services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1557085112454190">Campbell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1557085112454190">Neville &amp; Pugh, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, many fail to disclose their sexual victimization to police or rape crisis centers because they fear being seen as disloyal to the race and ostracized by their community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1557085112454190">Campbell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1557085112454190">Martin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1557085112454190">McNair &amp; Neville, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1557085112454190">Washington, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1557085112454190">Wyatt, 1992</xref>). Third, African American women’s reluctance to report to police may also arise from their recognition that African American men are treated more harshly by the criminal justice system than men of other racial/ethnic groups and face a greater threat of being unjustly prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1557085112454190">Donovan &amp; Williams, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1557085112454190">LaFree, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1557085112454190">Landwehr et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1557085112454190">Richie, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1557085112454190">Tarrezz Nash, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1557085112454190">Wriggins, 1995</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1557085112454190">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Race/ethnicity may also influence others’ reaction and treatment of them. African Americans are discredited as victims because of the legacy of slavery when they were the property of White slave owners, and because of the stereotype that they are promiscuous and therefore more deserving of victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1557085112454190">Collins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1557085112454190">Davis, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1557085112454190">Donovan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1557085112454190">Pierce-Baker, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1557085112454190">White, Strube, &amp; Fisher, 1998</xref>). Even though African American rape victims are more likely than White victims to have had weapons used during the rape, and are less likely than White victims to report drinking alcohol prior to the rape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1557085112454190">Boykins et al., 2010</xref>), it is not surprising given racially biased stereotypes and prejudice that their cases are more likely to be dropped by the criminal justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1557085112454190">Campbell et al., 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Considerations for Latina and Asian Victims</title>
<p>Race/ethnicity also influences Latina and Asian victims’ responses to rape. Hispanics and Latinos generally espouse more traditional attitudes toward women compared with other racial/ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1557085112454190">Fischer, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1557085112454190">Lefley, Scott, Llabre, &amp; Hicks, 1993</xref>), and for them, family is very important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1557085112454190">Low &amp; Organista, 2000</xref>). It is expected that Hispanic and Latina women remain chaste, and when they are sexually victimized, they bring shame to their family because they are “tainted” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1557085112454190">Lefley et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1557085112454190">Low &amp; Organista, 2000</xref>). Cultural values and victim-blaming attitudes influence Latina immigrants’ views of sexual victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1557085112454190">Ramos Lira, Koss, &amp; Felipe Russo, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1557085112454190">Lefley et al. (1993)</xref> compared cultural beliefs about rape by sampling African American, Latina and non-Hispanic White rape victims and concluded that Hispanics and Latinos are more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to blame the victim. Hispanic women may be more likely to blame themselves for causing the rape if they subscribe to the cultural belief that women are culpable for victimization and responsible for controlling male sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1557085112454190">Low &amp; Organista, 2000</xref>). Also, Asians are more likely than Whites to hold negative attitudes toward rape victims, to endorse rape myths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1557085112454190">Mori, Bernat, Glenn, Selle, &amp; Zarate, 1995</xref>), and to not disclose rape to their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1557085112454190">Scott, 1998</xref>). The mental health system and legal system also lack assistance that addresses the unique needs of native American sexual assault victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1557085112454190">Bubar, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>It is essential that SANEs are aware of the diverse cultural needs of rape victims given that the number of victims seeking medical attention in emergency rooms has increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1557085112454190">CDC, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1557085112454190">Magid et al., 2004</xref>), and sexual assaults represented 10% of all assault related injury visits to EDs for females in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1557085112454190">CDC, 2008</xref>). Many of these victims are women and men of color. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1557085112454190">Boykins et al. (2010)</xref> reviewed data from 172 rape victims seeking medical attention in an urban university-affiliated hospital emergency room and found that more than half (58.4%) were African American. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1557085112454190">Avegno, Mills, and Mills (2009)</xref> reviewed records of 1,172 rape victims treated by one hospital over a four-year period and found more than half (59%) of victims were African American. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1557085112454190">Stermac, Dunlap, and Bainbridge (2005)</xref> reviewed records of 1,018 female rape victims treated by one Canadian sexual assault urgent care center between 1998 and 2001 and found 27% identified as non-White. More than half the victims were African American in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1557085112454190">Campbell’s (2005)</xref> study.</p>
<p>Even though SANEs work with victims of various ethnicities and cultures, little research focuses on diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1557085112454190">Light, 2013</xref>). Research has failed to examine how SANEs, with their significant experience with multiple rape victims, perceive the different responses to and treatment of victims based on the victim’s race/ethnicity, or how SANE programs respond to the needs of diverse populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1557085112454190">Campbell, 2004</xref>). This article is an attempt to fill the void in the literature.</p>

<title>Recruiting Participants</title>
<p>Beginning in October 2006, letters or e-mails explaining the research and requesting participation were sent to directors/coordinators of SANE programs in four east coast states, which will remain confidential and referred to as States A, B, C, and D. Prior to recruiting participants, the research was approved by my University’s Institutional Review Board. The four states were selected for two key reasons. First, SANEs programs are organized in a variety of ways in these states. The programs in States A and D are hospital-based and funded, in State B the programs are managed and funded by a state agency, and in State C programs are managed and funded by prosecutors’ offices. Second, the racial diversity in these states was comparable to the overall diversity in the United States. According to 2006 to 2008 U.S. Census Bureau estimates, 74% of the U.S. population was White. In 2006 to 2008, the percent of the population that was White in State A was 72.5%, State B was 83%, State C was 70%, and State D was 84%. Therefore two states were slightly more diverse than the population of the United States, and two states were less diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1557085112454190">U.S. Census Bureau, 2008</xref>). All SANE programs selected were listed in the database of the Sexual Assault Resource Service, funded by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office for Victims of Crime and the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sane-sart.com">www.sane-sart.com</ext-link>). Letters or e-mails requesting participation were sent to all 78 programs listed on the sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE)-sexual assault response team (SART) website. The SANE-SART website listed eight hospital-based programs in State A, 16 programs managed by the county prosecutor’s office in State C, and 48 programs in State D. Programs in State B are funded by a state agency, and there are six regional coordinators.</p>
<p>All directors who responded to the e-mail stated that they forwarded my letter or e-mail to other SANEs, announced the research and provided my contact information at staff meetings or trainings, or passed along the information through word-of-mouth. Because of the method of recruitment used, I am unable to determine a response rate. However, only one SANE initially agreed to the interview but later said she was unable to participate because her employer (county prosecutor) would “not allow” her to participate. One other SANE agreed to participate but never responded to several voice mail messages to schedule an interview.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1557085112454190">
<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>Interviews were conducted between October 13, 2006 and April 20, 2007. Interviews ranged from 45 min to 1 hr and 45 min. The average interview lasted 1 hr and 15 min. Some interviews were longer because the respondent had more to share and went into more detail about her experiences and perceptions. All interviews were conducted over the phone for convenience—either to accommodate the SANE’s preference or due to distance. All participants were required to read and sign a three-page consent form. Because interviews were conducted by phone, consent forms were mailed, faxed or e-mailed to participants at the participant’s preference. Signed consent forms were returned to me by fax or mail. All SANE participants were given US$10 gift cards as a token of appreciation for their time, and SANEs who were also serving as directors of programs were given US$15 gift cards because they were asked additional questions about the organization and funding of programs.</p>
<p>Although this article focuses on SANEs’ perceptions of multicultural or multiethnic issues surrounding rape, the interview guide consisted of approximately 70 open-ended questions in the following areas: training; roles and responsibilities; perceptions of rape, victims and rapists; assessment of their interaction with ED doctors, rape victim advocates, police, and prosecutors and their <italic>perceptions</italic> of the treatment and revictimization of rape victims by the police, legal system and medical system; and difficulties or challenges for SANEs or SANE programs. The key questions about SANEs’ perceptions of multicultural or multiethnic issues surrounding rape were: Did you have any training on multicultural sensitivity or any issues of diversity? Do you have bilingual SANEs? Do you have different ways of helping victims based on their race/ethnicity? Do you think women of color respond to rape differently than White women? Do you think women of color respond to medical care differently than White women? Do you see more victims of color or White women? Do you think certain racial/ethnic groups are more likely to be victimized, more likely to seek medical attention, or both?</p>
<p>Although this primarily is qualitative research, quantitative descriptive analyses were conducted to provide background information about SANEs’ experiences with and perceptions of victims of color. After interviews were transcribed verbatim, analysis began. The analysis included an inductive approach. Inductive research is more appropriate for exploratory research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1557085112454190">Bernard &amp; Ryan, 2010</xref>); in inductive research, it helps to look for recurring phrases or common “threads” in informants’ accounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1557085112454190">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>, p.70). Transcripts were read numerous times and themes were identified (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1557085112454190">Patton, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1557085112454190">Rubin &amp; Rubin, 1995</xref>). Themes were simply ideas or phrases that appeared in multiple interviews. The more frequently the same concept occurs in a text, the more likely it is a theme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1557085112454190">Ryan &amp; Bernard, 2003</xref>). All codes were written in the margins of the transcripts. These initial codes allowed me to better manage data. Following the initial review of complete transcripts, I focused on questions specifically pertaining to perceptions of multicultural or multiethnic issues surrounding rape. Codes were also further developed at this time. One methodological limitation is that only one researcher coded the data in its entirety, so it is possible that others would interpret participants’ responses differently.</p>

<title>The Sample</title>
<p>Forty SANEs from four east coast states were interviewed. Of the 40 SANEs interviewed, 17 also presently served as directors of the programs and one had served as a director but resigned from the position 10 months prior to the interview.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1557085112454190">2</xref></sup> Five SANEs worked in State A, seven SANEs worked in State B, 15 SANEs worked in State C, and 13 SANEs worked in State D. Data represent the views of SANEs treating rape victims at 43 hospitals in four states. According to SANEs included in this sample, the number of SANEs working at each hospital ranged widely from one SANE to 43 SANEs.</p>
<p>The 40 SANEs interviewed were between the ages of 21 and 62 (mean 45 years old; median 46.5 years old). Thirty-eight (95%) of the SANEs interviewed were White and two (5%) were African American. All were women. Although a more diverse sample is certainly needed, the fact that the sample only includes two participants of color is most likely because nurses from minority groups are underrepresented in general healthcare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1557085112454190">Ahmann, 2002</xref>), and most SANEs are White (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1557085112454190">Campbell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1557085112454190">Patterson, Campbell, &amp; Townsend, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Thirty-two (80%) of the SANEs interviewed were registered nurses (RN), one (2.5%) was a nurse practitioner, and seven (17.5%) were not RNs because they had a bachelor’s degree in nursing (BSN). All nurses were trained at least 40 hr prior to becoming SANEs, and most SANEs (65%) did recall specific training on multicultural sensitivity or issues of diversity. Twenty-four SANEs (60%) were employed part-time for the SANE program and 16 (40%) were employed full-time. SANEs included in this sample received their nursing degrees between 1971 and 2005. Of the 40 respondents, 16 SANEs (40%) had some type of personal experience with rape. Thirteen SANEs (32.5%) experienced rape, one SANE (2.5%) experienced an attempted date rape, and two SANEs (5%) were not raped themselves but one reported her daughter was gang raped and one reported her sister and mother were raped. Of the 13 SANEs who experienced completed rapes, six were raped by acquaintances, two were raped by boyfriends, one was raped by her husband, one was raped by her military commander, and three did not reveal their relationship to their assailant. None contacted a rape crisis center, reported to the police, or sought medical attention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1557085112454190">
<title>Observation of Training</title>
<p>In addition to conducting interviews, I observed 30 of 40 hr of training for SANEs. The training was held in one of the states where interviews were conducted and was facilitated by one of the directors of a SANE program included in this research. These observations allowed me to gain firsthand knowledge of the topics covered during training. This experience was quite beneficial because I do not have a degree in nursing or nursing experience. The training took place between April 10, 2007 and May 2, 2007. In addition to the primary trainer who was a SANE, guest speakers were brought in from a rape crisis center, the special victims’ unit of a police department, and the prosecutor’s office. I attended five of the eight sessions including a tour of the city crime lab; three of the sessions were not relevant to the purposes of my research (explanation of anatomy, how to use a colposcope, how to take digital photographs, tour of emergency room, review session for certification exam). In addition to a variety of other topics (i.e., history of forensic nursing, components of the evidence collection kit, DNA, legal issues of rape and sexual assault), the training did include approximately one hr on diversity and cultural considerations. The facilitator explained that each victim has unique needs, and victims’ cultural values and beliefs may be relevant during treatment. In addition, the facilitator reviewed how African American, Asian, Hispanic and American Indian victims may respond to rape, again noting that SANEs should not make generalizations simply based on victims’ race/ethnicity.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>This section begins with quantitative findings regarding the percent of SANEs who believe race/ethnicity influences victims’ response to rape as well as the diversity of victims served. It continues with qualitative data results that explore why SANEs believe victims of color are less likely to report and how victims’ race/ethnicity influences their emotional response to rape. Last, this section describes the different ways SANEs help victims based on victims’ race/ethnicity.</p>
<p>The interconnection of racism and sexism helps to explain how victims’ families, communities, and the criminal justice and legal systems treat them, and how they respond to their own victimization. More than half of all SANEs (55%) believe victims of color respond to rape differently or face different issues than White victims do, and 30% of SANEs believed that race/ethnicity along with other factors influence the way victims respond to rape. Fifteen percent of SANEs felt that they did not have enough experience with victims of color to respond to the question. Of the two African American SANEs included in this sample, one believes victims of color respond to rape differently or face different issues than White victims do and one feels she does not have enough experience treating victims of color to respond. More SANEs (43%) revealed that they treated more White victims than victims of color; only 7.5% stated that they treated more victims of color than White victims. SANEs attributed this to the demographics of population served or the possibility that White victims are more likely to seek medical attention after being raped.</p>
<sec id="section11-1557085112454190">
<title>Less Likely to Report</title>
<p>SANEs believe race/ethnicity influences victims’ likelihood of reporting.</p>
<p>SANEs believe victims of color may be more secretive and less likely to report victimization. They do not want to reveal or discuss such a personal issue with others, particularly law enforcement, and instead chose to remain silent. According to SANEs, victims’ silence may stem from distrust of police. Leila (all names pseudonyms), an African American SANE, explains, “People of color are usually more secretive and less likely to pursue and press charges.” Mary agrees, “Certain cultures don’t want the police involved. They don’t trust them.” Victims of color may fear facing a biased criminal justice and legal system where their credibility as a victim is doubted or fear an African American or Hispanic assailant may not be treated fairly. Victims of color may simply think police will fail to assist them.</p>
<p>According to SANEs, self-blame and fear of deportation for victims who are in the United States illegally may influence victims’ likelihood of reporting. Michelle states, “For women of color, it [rape] is less reported because they think they brought it on themselves.” Patricia recalls a case where the victim did not report due to fear of deportation:
<disp-quote>
<p>Recently there was a case where the victim was Hispanic and recently came from South America and she did not want to report it because she knew the person and the person had the potential to send the family back to where they were from.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Elizabeth agrees that Hispanic victims are less likely to disclose when deportation issues are a concern. It is important to note that these statements are based on SANEs’ perceptions only. Although their perceptions are based on their experiences, it does not necessarily indicate that women of color are in fact less likely to report rape than White women are. Also, there may be additional reasons victims of color are possibly less likely to report rape. It is important to recognize diversity both <italic>among</italic> victims and <italic>between</italic> victims of different racial/ethnic groups. Not only are all racial/ethnic groups unique, victims are unique as well.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1557085112454190">
<title>Emotional Response of Victims</title>
<p>When discussing the emotional responses of victims of color, many SANEs discussed how each victim is different. Although some SANEs made generalizations about the responses to rape by women of color, many also noted the importance of recognizing that no two victims are the same and each will have his/her own unique response. For example, a few SANEs also mentioned other factors that could influence victims’ response to rape (i.e., relationship to perpetrator, length of time between rape and treatment in hospital). However, some SANEs believe race/ethnicity may influence victims’ emotional response. When SANEs were discussing how victims of color may be more upset, they mentioned that these victims were crying or “hysterical.” For example, Betty Ann explains, “Hispanic victims are usually a little bit more emotional. They cry a lot.” They perceived victims to be angry when they were yelling or were “more vocal” about their feelings toward the perpetrator or about the rape. SANEs perceived victims to be withdrawn when they were quiet, unresponsive, or “staring like they were in shock.” For example, Ashley mentions that African American victims “don’t talk much about it [sexual victimization].” Molly states, “Hispanic victims have been demoralized before so are more quiet about it [sexual victimization].” In addition to the possibility that some victims of color have been made to feel discouraged, self-blame and fear of blame from others may influence their reactions.</p>
<p>As SANEs discussed the importance of blame in victims’ decision to report, SANEs also indicate the emotional response of victims of color is influenced by self-blame and fear that their families will blame them. As previously stated, Michelle believes that victims of color think they “brought it on themselves.” Marissa reflects:
<disp-quote>
<p>The women of color that I have been involved with are more concerned about how their family is going to feel. I think they fear they are going to be blamed.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Elizabeth recalls experiences with victims from other countries:
<disp-quote>
<p>We have had a lot of clients from Nigeria and Liberia and they feel as though they are tainted because they have been raped and that they are unable to get a husband. In that culture they feel as though it is the victim’s fault.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lucille discussed an experience with a woman from Guatemala whose child was raped by a Guatemalan man. She told Lucille she was going to be disowned by her family because in her culture you don’t sacrifice an adult male for a female child.</p>
<p>In sum, more than half of all SANEs (55%) believe victims of color respond to rape differently or face different issues than White victims do, and 30% of SANEs believed that race/ethnicity along with other factors influence the way victims respond to rape. Some SANEs believe women of color are less likely to report compared with White victims. According to SANEs, Hispanics may fear deportation if they are in the country illegally or victims of color may fear that their family will blame them or are more likely to blame themselves. Some SANEs indicated that based on their experience working with victims of color, some tend to be more emotional and angrier than other victims. Other SANEs believe that some victims of color are more withdrawn and less emotional.</p>

<sec id="section13-1557085112454190">
<title>Different Ways of Helping Victims Based on Race/Ethnicity</title>
<p>Understanding how SANEs address issues of diversity could be helpful to other SANEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1557085112454190">Campbell, 2004</xref>). Although women of color may have different experiences or responses after being raped, SANEs were asked if they have different ways of helping victims based on their race/ethnicity. Half of SANEs interviewed indicated that they have different ways of responding to victims based on victims’ race/ethnicity. Eleven SANEs provided very vague responses to the question, did not answer the question at all, or discussed issues other than race/ethnicity such as treating homosexuals, victims with disabilities, the elderly, or very young victims. Nine SANEs adamantly stated they did not respond differently to victims of color. Data reveal that it is possible that some of these nine SANEs perceived treating victims of color differently in a negative way or thought it reflected prejudice. For example, one SANE stated, “They [victims] are treated with respect and dignity. No one receives special treatment no matter who or what they are.”</p>
<p>Several SANEs who have different ways of responding to victims based on victims’ race/ethnicity spoke of the importance of understanding and respecting victims’ preferences based on their cultural beliefs. Betty Ann explains:
<disp-quote>
<p>We really like to find out what the patient needs. What are they asking for? We give that person the opportunity to take control of their own body again. That may be very different for different cultures. We make sure we respect the different cultures and backgrounds by making the patients feel comfortable.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Being aware of and open-minded about cultural difference is important. Gloria states:
<disp-quote>
<p>I had a number of training opportunities on addressing issues of cultural competence and cultural diversity so I am more aware than most at recognizing the cultural individuality of each patient that we see and respecting and honoring their preferences and cultural norms.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Eliza agrees, “You have to have an awareness of their culture and how they view what is happening to them.”</p>
<p>In addition to general comments regarding the need for cultural sensitivity, respect, and awareness, several SANEs provided specific ways they treat victims of color differently. With the recognition that some victims of color may feel more comfortable with certain social service agencies, they carefully consider referrals made. Catherine explains:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’ll be very specific to the victims by asking them questions so that I can try to make recommendations that are specific to their ethnicity and culture.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Krista agrees:
<disp-quote>
<p>Resources may vary based on race/ethnicity. We have a Spanish community center that may make Hispanic victims more comfortable.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rebecca takes the same measures:
<disp-quote>
<p>I will give them [victims of color] certain types of information like if there is a counselor they might be more comfortable with because of ethnicity.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>SANEs believe it is possible that counselors of the same race/ethnicity may make victims more comfortable, and victims may relate better to them.</p>
<p>In conclusion, 20 SANEs stated they had different ways of helping victims based on their race/ethnicity. Some stressed the importance of understanding and respecting victims’ preferences based on their cultural beliefs, whereas others mentioned providing referrals that victims may be more comfortable with. Those who said they did <italic>not</italic> treat victims differently based on their race/ethnicity either stressed that every victim is unique and therefore they could not change their treatment based on race/ethnicity alone <italic>or</italic> stressed that victims receive the same exact treatment regardless of race/ ethnicity or cultural differences.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Many of the findings regarding perceptions of SANEs in this study parallel findings of previous research assessing different perspectives on the influence of race/ethnicity on rape victims’ responses and treatment. Whereas research has indicated that ethnic minorities face more challenges than White women obtaining assistance after rape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1557085112454190">Martin, 2005</xref>), this study concludes that more than half of all SANEs interviewed believe victims of color respond to rape differently or face different issues than White victims do. Some SANEs believe women of color are less likely to report being raped than White women are. Other research indicates that victims of color, particularly African American victims, adopt a culture of silence around rape and fail to disclose victimization because they fear being seen as disloyal to the race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1557085112454190">Campbell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1557085112454190">Collins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1557085112454190">Konradi &amp; Burger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1557085112454190">Landwehr et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1557085112454190">Martin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1557085112454190">McNair &amp; Neville, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1557085112454190">Washington, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1557085112454190">Wyatt, 1992</xref>). As other literature concludes that African Americans and members of other racial minorities are discredited as victims and seen as more promiscuous and deserving of victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1557085112454190">Collins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1557085112454190">Davis, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1557085112454190">Donovan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1557085112454190">Pierce-Baker, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1557085112454190">Ullman &amp; Townsend, 2007</xref>), some participants have observed that African American women blame themselves for the rape.</p>
<p>Several SANEs believed victims of color are more likely to believe they are “tainted” because of their sexual victimization, are more likely than White victims to fear that their families will blame them, and are more likely to blame themselves. According to SANEs, victims from some cultures need to be told that they are still virgins because if they have been raped they will be unable to secure a husband. Other literature confirms that when Hispanic women are sexually victimized, they are thought to bring shame to their family because they are “tainted” and no longer chaste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1557085112454190">Lefley et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1557085112454190">Low &amp; Organista, 2000</xref>). Hispanic victims are not only more likely to be blamed by their families than victims of other racial/ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1557085112454190">Lefley et al., 1993</xref>) but they are also more likely to blame themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1557085112454190">Low &amp; Organista, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Findings regarding the emotionality of victims of color relative to White victims are contradictory. Some SANEs indicated that based on their experience, victims of color tend to be more emotional and angrier than White victims or more vocal about their feelings, whereas other SANEs perceived victims of color to be more withdrawn and less emotional than White victims. <italic>Just as SANEs may observe a range of emotions exhibited by White women, they may witness a similar range of emotions exhibited by victims of color</italic>. It is possible that victims who SANEs believe are withdrawn and less emotional are influenced by the “matriarch” stereotype that requires strength, responsibility for holding the family together, and ability to deal with victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1557085112454190">Collins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1557085112454190">Donovan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1557085112454190">Donovan &amp; Williams, 2002</xref>). These withdrawn victims may also simply be experiencing shock or denial.</p>
<p>Half of the SANEs interviewed also indicated that they have different ways of responding to victims based on their race/ethnicity. They try to understand and respect victims’ preferences and needs based on their cultural beliefs, be aware of cultural differences, and carefully consider the most appropriate referrals to social service agencies.</p>
<p>Despite its contribution to the literature on SANEs, this research has a few limitations. First, the sample only has two SANEs of color. This is not unexpected, given that nurses from minority groups are underrepresented in general healthcare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1557085112454190">Ahmann, 2002</xref>), and most SANEs are White (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1557085112454190">Campbell, 2005</xref>). Other research on SANEs has also included a predominantly White sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1557085112454190">Patterson, Campbell, &amp; Townsend, 2006</xref>). Nonetheless, given the focus of this article, the lack of diversity is a limitation. Although it is impossible to determine if a more diverse sample would have yielded different results, it is important to recognize the possibility that one’s race/ethnicity may not influence her perceptions (whether women of color respond to rape differently than White women), or her actions (whether she has different ways of helping victims based on race/ethnicity). Furthermore, regardless of the respondent’s race/ethnicity, she may not have enough experience treating victims of color to speak about whether they respond differently to rape, as was the case for one of the two African American SANEs included in this sample.</p>
<p>Second, one methodological limitation is that only one researcher coded the data in its entirety; it is possible that others would interpret SANEs’ responses differently. Third, although the research provides an important perspective from individuals essential to the proper treatment of victims, the conclusions drawn from data are based solely on respondents’ perceptions of their patients, or more specifically, on SANEs’ perceptions of whether race/ethnicity influences victims’ experiences or responses in the hospital to rape. The victims they assist may not share their perceptions about the influence of race/ethnicity, and the victims of color that these women work with certainly may have very different experiences. Third, victims may exhibit different responses to rape outside of the hospital setting. Although it has been acknowledged that recruitment of rape victims for research is challenging (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1557085112454190">DuMont et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1557085112454190">Parnis, DuMont, &amp; Gombay, 2005</xref>), future research should include both SANEs and the victims of color that they assist. Fourth, this research is limited to the experiences of those who chose to participate and excludes the views and experience of those who chose not to participate in the research or were unaware that the recruitment for research was taking place. In addition, the sample is limited to SANEs in four east coast states. These SANEs’ views and experiences may not be reflective of all SANEs, and it is impossible to determine if findings would have differed if interviews had been conducted with SANEs from other states or even SANEs employed by different hospitals. Therefore the findings are suggestive and cannot be generalized. Fifth, race/ethnicity is a sensitive topic and it is possible that participants formulated their own idea of socially desirable responses to interview questions and answered accordingly. Last, it is important to note that whereas a few SANEs specifically referred to Hispanic women or African American women, many simply referred to women of color. It is important to recognize diversity both among victims and between victims of different racial/ethnic groups. Not only are all racial/ethnic groups unique, victims are unique as well. This research does a much better job of exploring SANEs’ perceptions of the experiences of victims of color compared with White victims, rather than exploring differences among and between victims of all racial/ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, this research fills the gap in the literature on SANEs by exploring their perceptions of the influence of race/ethnicity on victims<bold>’</bold> responses to rape, as well as if SANEs have different ways of addressing the needs of victims of color. This is important given that research has not addressed how SANE programs respond to the needs of diverse populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1557085112454190">Campbell, 2004</xref>). In addition, this research offers several policy implications and should encourage SANE programs to further consider issues of diversity.</p>
<p>First, all SANEs should receive training on multicultural sensitivity and awareness. Thirty-five percent of SANEs included in this research could not remember such training. Second, SANE programs should consider language barriers between victims and nurses. It is possible that SANEs may simply not be able to treat some victims because of language barriers. Most SANEs (52.5%) included in this research indicated that there are <italic>no</italic> bilingual SANEs working at their hospital, and the few who indicated there are bilingual SANEs stated that there were only one or two. When a bilingual SANE is not available, SANEs either rely on the AT &amp; T language line where a translator is provided over the phone or they rely on a translator provided by the hospital. Both can be problematic and can delay treatment. The individual translating through the language line may not have any medical experience. In addition, some SANEs indicated the language line can be difficult to use when trying to conduct an exam. There is also the concern that everything said is not being translated verbatim.</p>
<p>Third, programs need to be more racially diverse; most (60%) directors interviewed indicated that their SANE staff is not racially/ethnically diverse. Participants were not asked to clarify what they believed to be “diverse.” It is possible that although they believed the staff was diverse, there were still few SANEs of color. Directors indicated that they could not recruit SANEs of color because the general nursing population at the hospital is not diverse. The challenge for directors to recruit diverse SANEs is not surprising given that research indicates nurses of color are underrepresented in general healthcare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1557085112454190">Ahmann, 2002</xref>), and that White women have dominated the anti-rape movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1557085112454190">Scott, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1557085112454190">Washington, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1557085112454190">White, 2001</xref>). Nonetheless, the lack of racially/ethnically diverse SANEs is problematic because it may be challenging for SANEs to understand the unique experiences, beliefs and customs of every victim they treat. Even if the SANE believes she is being culturally sensitive, a victim may disagree. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1557085112454190">Scott (1998)</xref> concluded that women of color believe that White women are not capable of providing adequate services to racially diverse populations, and that victims of rape and domestic violence prefer advocates of their same racial/ethnic group (p. 415). Though challenging, SANE programs should continue to strive to be racially/ethnically diverse.</p>
<p>Fourth, as also suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1557085112454190">Campbell (2004)</xref>, future research should continue to address how SANE programs respond to the needs of diverse populations. Whereas the majority of SANEs interviewed believe that race/ethnicity alone or race/ethnicity and other factors influence victims’ response to rape or the issues they face, and half stated they had different ways of helping victims based on their race/ethnicity, almost one-quarter said they did <italic>not</italic> treat victims differently solely based on their race/ethnicity because every victim is unique <italic>or</italic> every victim deserves the same exact treatment. SANEs may face a conundrum. If they ignore cultural differences, they risk not providing victims with the most appropriate and sensitive care. Recognition that victims’ reliance on others for support and their views on healthcare providers both vary widely, as does their view on healthcare providers is key (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1557085112454190">Lech, 2008</xref>), and cultural beliefs and practices may become even more important to individuals after a traumatic incident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1557085112454190">Robichaux, Dittmar, &amp; Clark, 2005</xref>). However, although cultural competence is important, nurses must be careful not to adhere to stereotypes regarding race/ethnicity or assume all individuals of a certain race/ethnicity have similar experiences or beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557085112454190">Gustafson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1557085112454190">Washburn, 2003</xref>). SANEs may understand what victims need by simply asking them. SANEs could also consider the strategies used by SANEs in this sample to help victims of color: remain respectful and understanding of victims’ preferences based on their cultural beliefs, be aware of and open-minded about cultural differences, and carefully consider referrals made.</p>

<ack>
<p>I would like to thank all of the directors and coordinators of sexual assault nurse examiner programs who helped me gain access to their SANEs. Also, this project would not have been possible without the SANEs who allowed me to interview them.</p>

<p>On the contrary, two studies concluded that African American victims are more likely to report to the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1557085112454190">Bachman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1557085112454190">Fisher, Daigle, Cullen, &amp; Tuner, 2003</xref>). One study concluded that the race of victim or assailant was not significant when comparing victims who file a police report with those who do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1557085112454190">Jones, Alexander, Wynn, Rossman, &amp; Dunnuck, 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>One director of emergency services for a hospital (State D), and one medical director of Forensic/SANE Program (State A), were interviewed about the goals and structure of the program. Although the research was open to male participants, the medical director from State A was the only male who participated. This, most likely is due to the lack of male SANEs.</p>
