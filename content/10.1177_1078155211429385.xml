<abstract>
<p>Rasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase enzyme indicated for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), a potential life-threatening oncologic emergency that occurs most commonly during chemotherapy for hematological malignancies. As a result of the defects in the physiological antioxidant pathway, erythrocytes of patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are not protected against the oxidating stress exerted by hydrogen peroxide generated with the administration of rasburicase. Therefore, rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with known G6PD deficiency and the manufacturer recommends screening all patients with high risk for G6PD deficiency before initiating rasburicase therapy. However, it is logistically difficult in clinical settings because of the high risk of morbidity and mortality associated with TLS if treatment is delayed and the long turnaround time of the G6PD deficiency screening. Therefore, administering rasburicase to patients developing TLS before confirming a patient’s G6PD status is practically inevitable. Methemoglobinemia, and/or hemolysis, may result from the oxidative stress. Descriptions of the clinical course should it happen are limited in the literature. There are eight reported cases of rasburicase-related methemoglobinemia, with or without hemolytic anemia, in the literature of which five are pediatric patients. Six reports (including three pediatric patients) had detailed descriptions of the event and management. The recent reports of methemoglobinemia observed in patients with probable G6PD activity further complicated the picture. We are reporting a 16-year-old patient diagnosed with Burkitt’s lymphoma who developed methemoglobinemia after receiving one dose of rasburicase. He was managed by transfusion and oxygen support. The patient recovered well and the observed methemoglobinemia was reversible.</p>

<p>Rasburicase, Elitek<sup>TM</sup>, is a recombinant urate oxidase enzyme indicated for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), a potential life-threatening oncologic emergency that occurs most commonly during chemotherapy for hematological malignancies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155211429385">1</xref></sup> Methemoglobinemia, with or without hemolysis, is reported to be related to rasburicase use. It was first described in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155211429385">2</xref></sup> and more recently in patients with normal G6PD functions or in patients with low risk for G6PD deficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155211429385">3</xref></sup> As a result of the defects in the physiological antioxidant pathway, erythrocytes of patients with G6PD deficiency are not protected against the oxidating stress exerted by hydrogen peroxide generated with the administration of rasburicase and these patients are at a high risk of developing methemoglobinemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155211429385">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Use of rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with known G6PD deficiency and the manufacturer recommends screening all patients with high risk for G6PD deficiency before initiating rasburicase therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155211429385">5</xref></sup> It is logistically difficult in clinical settings because of the high risk of morbidity and mortality associated with TLS if treatment is delayed and the long turnaround time of the G6PD deficiency screening of 5 to 7 business days. Therefore, administering rasburicase to patients developing TLS before confirming a patient’s G6PD status is practically inevitable. The exact mechanism of rasburicase-induced methemoglobinemia, although well hypothesized in G6PD deficient patients, is unknown.</p>
<p>Reports of clinical experience and management with these patients are few. Since it was first described in the late 1990s, there are only eight reported cases of rasburicase (or non-recombinant urate oxidase)-related methemoglobinemia in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155211429385">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155211429385">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155211429385">6</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155211429385">9</xref></sup> (five of which are pediatric patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155211429385">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155211429385">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155211429385">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155211429385">8</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155211429385">10</xref></sup>).

<sec id="sec2-1078155211429385" sec-type="cases"><title>Case description</title>
<p>AR is a 16-year old, 70 kg, previously healthy, African American male who presented to his primary care physician complaining of a 1-to-2-week history of abdominal pain including nausea and vomiting. An outpatient computed tomography (CT) scan was performed and the patient was found to have a large right-sided abdominal mass. Due to the CT findings, the patient was instructed to go to the emergency room (ER). Once evaluated by the ER, he was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Upon biopsy the patient was diagnosed with Burkitt’s lymphoma. Initial laboratory results are as follows: white blood cell count 7.59 × 10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155211429385">3</xref></sup> (78% neutrophils, 15% lymphocytes, 6% eosinophils, 1% basophils), hemoglobin 11.8 g/dL, hematocrit 35.8%, platelet count 342 × 10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>, serum sodium 136 mEq/L, potassium 3.7 mEq/L, chloride 95 mEq/L, carbon dioxide 28 mEq/L, glucose 80 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 7 mg/dL, serum creatinine 1.2 mg/dL, calcium 9.6 mg/dL, magnesium 2.1 mg/dL, phosphorus 4 mg/dL, and uric acid 11.1 mg/dL.</p>
<p>Shortly after PICU admission, rasburicase 14 mg IV (0.2 mg/kg/dose) was given as a single dose. It was noted that 2 h post rasburicase infusion, the patient de-saturated with a SpO<sub>2</sub> of 87% but remained otherwise asymptomatic. At that time, the patient was placed on 4 L oxygen via nasal cannula, and then elevated oxygen delivery to a venti-mask at 50% oxygen. Within 4 h post rasburicase infusion, oxygen delivery was again elevated to a non-rebreather 15 L at 100% oxygen. The patient remained on this support for 12 h. At that time, oxygen was able to be decreased. Approximately 4 h after the start of rasburicase infusion, blood gas revealed a methemoglobin (MetHb) level of 4.6% and hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL. MetHb level peaked at 8% 6 h after the start of rasburicase infusion. Hemoglobin level lower limit was 7.4 g/dL 16.25 h after the start of rasburicase infusion. The patient received his first transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBC) 24 h after rasburicase infusion.</p>
<p>Over the entire hospital stay, the patient received a total of 4 units PRBC. By day 2 of hospitalization, MetHb and plasma hemoglobin levels had returned to normal without further interventions (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078155211429385">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1078155211429385">3</xref>) and the patient was transferred to the Hematology/Oncology floor. By day 8 of hospitalization, the patient had made a complete recovery and was discharged home. No further doses of rasburicase were given during hospital admission. Uric acid levels were less than 0.5 mg/dL 7 h post rasburicase infusion and continued to remain low until discharge at which time uric acid monitoring was discontinued. AR received a clinical diagnosis of G6PD deficiency without a confirmatory blood test due to his ethnic background and the lack of available literature supporting the observation of methemoglobinemia with rasburicase infusion in non-G6PD-deficient population.

<p>TLS is a potentially life-threatening complication that occurs most commonly in patients with hematologic malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Burkitt’s lymphoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155211429385">1</xref></sup> Uric acid is a terminal byproduct from purine catabolism and its crystallization is one of the major causes of acute renal failure in these patients, sometimes requiring dialysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078155211429385">11</xref></sup> Traditionally, aggressive hydration, forced diuresis, and allopurinol are the standard TLS prevention in patients at risk. Although allopurinol, a competitive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase inhibiting the synthesis of uric acid,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078155211429385">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078155211429385">13</xref></sup> has been the standard treatment for decades, it is not an ideal agent for acute TLS treatment because of its slow onset of action and its inactivity against already-synthesized, circulating uric acid molecules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078155211429385">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase not naturally expressed in humans, converts the relatively hydrophobic uric acid to allantoin, which is highly hydrophilic and readily excreted by the kidneys. It has been shown to be superior to oral allopurinol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078155211429385">15</xref></sup> and is recommended in the 2008 Guidelines for the Management of Pediatric and Adult Tumor Lysis Syndrome published by American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) to be the initial management of patients classified to be at high risk of developing TLS and in patients with intermediate risk if hyperuricemia occurs despite allopurinol prophylaxis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155211429385">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite its documented efficacy and fast onset in acute management of TLS-related hyperuricemia, rasburicase is not available as a therapeutic option for patients with known G6PD deficiency. The manufacturer lists G6PD deficiency as a contraindication for rasburicase because these patients lack the protective antioxidant pathway to detoxify the hydrogen peroxide produced when uric acid is broken down into allantoin and they are at high risk of methemoglobinemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155211429385">5</xref></sup> The enzyme G6PD catalyzes the reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) to NADPH. This reduced form of NADP maintains the supply of intracellular reduced glutathione, which is a critical component physiologically in the defense against oxidative stress and free radicals via the cytochrome-b<sub>5</sub>-methemoglobin reductase system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155211429385">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155211429385">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078155211429385">17</xref></sup> With the absence of this protective pathway, erythrocytes in patients with G6PD deficiency are vulnerable to oxidative damage, resulting in methemoglobinemia, with or without hemolytic anemia. Methemoglobinemia occurs when the iron atom within the hemoglobin molecule is oxidized from ferrous (Fe<sup>++</sup>) ion to ferric (Fe<sup>+++</sup>) ion. This oxidized heme group is incapable of binding oxygen and it causes a left-shift in the oxygen dissociate curve, resulting in reduced tissue oxygen delivery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155211429385">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155211429385">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078155211429385">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>MetHb levels are physiologically kept below 2% of total hemoglobin primarily by the NADH-dependent cytochrome-b<sub>5</sub>-methemoglobin reductase system, which is compromised in G6PD-deficient patients. Cyanosis, skin discoloration, headache, weakness, tachycardia, dizziness, and lethargy are symptoms reported when levels of MetHb are between 10% and 20%. However, when MetHb levels are elevated to above 45%, patients may experience neurological and cardiovascular symptoms such as malaise, fatigue, cyanosis, dyspnea, chest pain, tachycardia, heart failure, and also seizure and coma. Shock, respiratory and CNS depression, and death can occur when MetHb reaches 60% of total hemoglobin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155211429385">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078155211429385">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078155211429385">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The treatment of choice for methemoglobinemia despite G6PD activity is the removal of confounding agents. Symptoms other than minor cynosis need immediate intervention. Various supportive measures have been reported in the literature including oxygen administration, cimetidine, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and PRBC exchange transfusions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155211429385">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078155211429385">20</xref></sup> Methylene blue, when reduced by NADPH methemoglobolin reductase to leukomethylene blue, is a potent reducing agent and is the treatment of choice for methemoglobinemia. However, it is not recommended in G6PD deficient patients because they lack the ability to produce NADPH. Without the mechanism to reduce to leukomethylene blue, methylene blue may behave as an oxidizing agent to further increase the production of MetHb, exacerbating the condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078155211429385">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078155211429385">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>With an estimated 200–400 million patients worldwide with different degrees (class I–V) of G6PD deficiency,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078155211429385">21</xref></sup> the urgency for rasburicase administration when it is indicated, and the lack of methylene blue as the antidote, there is a need for a better understanding of the detailed mechanism of methemoglobinemia and a need for clinical management experience when it happens to patients. The recent reports of methemoglobinemia in possible or confirmed patients with normal G6PD function further complicates the picture and demonstrates the need for further research in this area.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1078155211429385"><title>Literature review</title>
<p>A PubMed literature search was conducted (from 1995 to 2011) for all rasburicase-induced methemoglobinemia cases. In total, eight case reports were found, five in pediatric patients. The majority of the case reports are in G6PD-deficient patients, but we have also summarized newer reports of methemoglobinemia with documented or probable G6PD activity.</p>
<sec id="sec5-1078155211429385"><title>Reported cases with confirmed G6PD deficiency</title>
<p>The first reported case of G6PD deficiency associated methmoglobinemia was in a 12-year-old African American male following the administration of a non-recombinant urate oxidase (Uricozyme®) during clinical testing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078155211429385">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155211429385">2</xref></sup> The patient’s methmoglobin level reached 15.6%. One patient with documented G6PD deficiency was reported to have developed rasburicase-induced methmoglobinemia in an international compassionate use study in 2003.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155211429385">6</xref></sup> Both of their symptoms and treatments were not well-documented in these case reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155211429385">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155211429385">6</xref></sup> A 14-year-old Cambodian male was reported to have methmoglobinemia (level 12.6%) with hemolysis after receiving rasburicase during his reduction chemotherapy for Burkitt’s lymphoma. The next day the patient’s G6PD assay results revealed the diagnosis of G6PD deficiency. He was treated with oxygen supplementation and PRBCs. Methylene blue was not administered due to the patient’s lack of clinical symptoms despite oxygen saturations of 80–90% and his G6PD deficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155211429385">8</xref></sup> The following year, another 12-year-old Laotian male was reported to have rasburicase-induced methmoglobinemia secondary to G6PD deficiency. He received oxygen supplementation, double-volume exchange transfusion, and two doses of methylene blue to treat a methmoglobin level of 10%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155211429385">9</xref></sup> Finally, a 50-year-old African American male with G6PD deficiency developed rasburicase-induced methemoglobiemia (level 9.8%) with hemolysis. His condition was supported with aggressive fluid support, blood transfusions, and respiratory support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155211429385">7</xref></sup>

<p>Recently in the literature, case reports of rasburicase-induced methemoglobinemia without G6PD deficiency have been documented (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1078155211429385">Table 2</xref>). Two adult cases (one with a documented normal G6PD level and the other was not tested for G6PD deficiency) have been reported. Both patients received rasburicase that resulted in methmoglobinemia (levels 14.9% and 21.5%). Both patients received red blood cell transfusions and oxygen supplementation. One of the two received two doses of methylene blue after G6PD deficiency was ruled out.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155211429385">3</xref></sup> In 2010, the most recent case of a 6-year-old patient developing rasburicase-induced methmoglobinemia (level 17.3%) with hemolysis despite not having G6PD deficiency. The patient also developed pancreatitis on day 2 of hospitalization and all symptoms resolved on day 3 with standard supportive care, no further details were given.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155211429385">10</xref></sup>

<p>An editorial by Lopes da Silva summarized several proposed mechanisms of methemoglobinemia and hemolytic anemia following tumor lysis and/or rasburicase independent of the G6PD pathway. Tumor lysis causes the release of cytokines which induce a systemic inflammatory response. The nitric oxide released promotes hemolysis. Secondly, uric acid is a potent free-radical scavenger and its rapid removal reduces a potentially protective mechanism against oxidative stress, producing methemoglobinemia and hemolysis. The author also suggested that a decreased level of normal protective enzymes and antioxidants such as superoxide dismutases, lactoperoxidases, and glutathione peroxidases may contribute to methemoglobinemia and hemolytic anemia. Finally, since urate oxidase is not naturally found in humans, these foreign molecules may elicit a drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia. These factors may explain tumor lysis and rasburicase-induced hemolytic anemia despite normal G6PD function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078155211429385">23</xref></sup></p>

<p>In summary, methemoglobinemia is a potentially life-threatening complication of rasburicase therapy for TLS in cancer patients. Patients with G6PD deficiency are at increased risk of this adverse effect; thus, high risk patients (based on family history and ethnicity) should be pre-screened.</p>
<p>Recent reports of non-G6PD-deficient patient developing methemoglobinemia following rasburicase further complicate the pre-screening process and stress the importance of a better understanding of this complication in all populations.</p>
<p>Methylene blue, an antidote for methemoglobinemia, given to G6PD-deficient patients may further exacerbate this complication and should not be administered without confirming normal G6PD activity. Thus, the literature review demonstrates the best treatment for methmeglobinemia with unknown G6PD activity is supportive care with oxygen and blood product support. Based on the documented case reports, patients stabilize and the condition improves dramatically with supportive case and removal of the confounding agent when possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, TLS, methemoglobemia, and poor oxygenation comprise a complex scenario resulting in an acute, critical, and life-threatening situation. Thus, more rapid screens are needed to detect G6PD deficiency in this oncologic emergency to prevent or successfully treat this rare but serious complication. More research is needed to identify those patients who are at risk of developing this complication in relationship to their G6PD activity.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1078155211429385"/></p>
