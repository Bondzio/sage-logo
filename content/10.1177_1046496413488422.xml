<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this article is to describe a series of techniques for teaching students about groups. Vygotsky’s social constructivism is used as a theoretical framework to understand the ways that students acquire knowledge about groups. After a brief discussion of this framework, we turn to a discussion of five specific pedagogical techniques for teaching small group and teamwork principles. These techniques include (a) carefully assigning group membership, (b) using a grading structure that incorporates individual, group, and peer evaluation assessment, (c) testing students individually and in groups, (d) asking students to write two papers that require an analysis and synthesis of both readings and observations, and (e) requiring a comprehensive service learning project from students that requires their collaboration for successful completion. The last portion of the article describes the challenges of using each of these techniques and the typical results of their application.</p>

<p>A recent survey of the National Association of Colleges and Employers (2011) found that the top quality (outside of major-specific knowledge) that employers seek in prospective employees is the ability to work on a team. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1046496413488422">Association of American Colleges and Universities (2006)</xref> also advocates that teamwork be an outcome of a liberal arts education. They recommend that students be assessed on their ability to contribute to group meetings, to encourage the contributions of other group members, to make individual contributions to meetings (including work outside of meetings), to foster a constructive team climate, and to deal effectively with conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1046496413488422">Rhodes, 2010</xref>). So, the challenge for faculty is to arm students with these skills prior to graduation. It is our contention that the best way to teach students how to function in groups is to make group work the focus of the classroom. In this article, social constructivism is used as a theoretical framework to explore the design of a small group communication course. The pedagogical techniques of the course are discussed as well as the instructional challenges and results of using those techniques. We contend that these techniques can be productively employed in a variety of courses.</p>

<title>Characteristics of Social Constructivism</title>
<p>Social constructivism is a branch of constructivist thought, which holds that knowledge is individually constructed via one’s experiences. Social constructivism was developed in Russia in the 1930s by Lev Vygotsky (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1046496413488422">Vygotsky and Kozulin, 1989</xref>), parallel to Piaget’s cognitive constructivism, and the two paradigms share many similarities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1046496413488422">Lourenco, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1046496413488422">Powell &amp; Kalina, 2009</xref>). The main point of divergence is that Piaget’s theory stresses the student’s autonomy in the social environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1046496413488422">Lourenco, 2012</xref>), whereas Vygotsky’s work emphasizes the impact of social and cultural influences on students, the ways their varied backgrounds and experiences shape students’ learning, and the ways students understand and interpret concepts. Vygotsky believed that learning does not just take place within the individual. He argued that learning is a social and collaborative activity where people create meaning through their interactions with one another. For instance, instructors can harness the natural verbal energy of students to promote a critical discussion of course content, so that students can actively construct and internalize their own meanings of the concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1046496413488422">Powell &amp; Kalina, 2009</xref>). Because participants bring their own worldviews to the learning context, their social interaction allows for multiple perspectives on the content and multiple representations of reality. In addition, collaboration with diverse others can be a vehicle for developing an appreciation of personal and cultural differences.</p>
<p>In the classroom, constructivist teaching involves a change in teaching from a telling-listening relationship to a complex and interactive relationship where the students’ own efforts to understand are the focal point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1046496413488422">Prawat, 1992</xref>). For Vygotsky, the learning context was of critical importance in shaping knowledge. He was a strong advocate for learning as experiencing, and emphasized the importance of creating a learning environment where students are active participants in the creation of their own knowledge. To maximize student involvement, instruction should be contextualized (vs. abstracted; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1046496413488422">Jonasen, 1994</xref>) by presenting authentic tasks that are meaningful, relevant, and parallel to problems in the real world. Optimally, learning should also involve the interplay of cognitive, emotional, and physical experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1046496413488422">Jaramillo, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The role of the constructivist instructor is illustrated in Vygotsky’s concept of the <italic>zone of proximal development</italic> [ZPD], a metaphor meant to help explain the way that social and participatory learning takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1046496413488422">Daniels, 2001</xref>). In short, students can, with the help of instructors or more advanced peers, master concepts and skills they cannot master on their own. The instructor serves as the <italic>guide on the side</italic> instead of the <italic>sage on the stage</italic> by helping to clarify concepts and aid in solving problems particular to individual and group needs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1046496413488422">Chen (2012)</xref> summarized the constructivist classroom by explaining that the instructor does more than simply assign projects. The instructor is an integral part of how students learn; encouraging students to look at problems critically and with fervor. A good instructor is able to foster a helpful learning environment by asking relevant questions and promoting discovery. Especially important is the instructor’s role in helping a group of students to overcome any obstacle to its progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1046496413488422">Prawat &amp; Floden, 1994</xref>). The role of the instructor here is to ask leading questions and help the group generate a list of potential solutions, not to solve the group’s problem. Guidance and support are provided for tasks that are beyond the students’ capability, until such time as they can complete the tasks autonomously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1046496413488422">Hodson &amp; Hodson, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>To summarize, social constructivism stresses several positions on teaching and learning that can be productively applied in the small group classroom. First, when one individual interacts with another, she or he socially negotiates meanings and develops her or his own understanding of concepts and behaviors. Second, human interaction occurs within a sociocultural context that shapes participants’ understandings. Third, constructivist teaching assumes that students are capable of their own knowledge production as long as they are provided with meaningful experiences and guidance from an instructor or a more knowledgeable peer. Fourth, the instructor’s role is to monitor, coach, guide, advise, and facilitate learning while encouraging students to take ownership of the learning process. Finally, instruction in an academic context is more effective if provisions can made for students to have authentic learning experiences that mimic real world problems and environments.</p>

<title>Teaching Strategies for the Small Group Classroom</title>
<p>The premise that students have to experience small group communication and behavior, under circumstances as close to real life as possible, before they can truly grasp what it means to work collaboratively with a group, stems from a social constructivist philosophy. A constructivist position also suggests that the zone of proximal development [ZPD] applies to peer learning groups, “where students have incomplete but relatively equal expertise—each [member] possessing some knowledge or skill but requiring the others’ contribution in order to make progress” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1046496413488422">Goos, Galbraith, &amp; Renshaw, 2002</xref>, p. 195). Shifting the curricular design of a course from a lecture—testing format to one where the focus is on the group work can be a powerful means of teaching students the basics of effective teamwork. The teaching strategies discussed in this section have been used by the first author for teaching small group communication courses, but they can be applied to a wide range of courses involving team learning. These techniques have been refined by the first author over the course of 20 years, are supported by research, and based on her student’s feedback, have proven successful in preparing students for future group encounters.</p>
<sec id="section3-1046496413488422">
<title>Group Assignments and the Execution of Group Work</title>
<p>Groups of five to seven people are created by the instructor during the first week of class. These groups are permanent; students are not allowed to switch groups or trade members. Having access to some demographic information about the students is essential when creating groups. At a minimum, it is useful to know each student’s sex, major, age, race/ethnicity, or other important attributes that could affect group interaction. The goal is to create groups that are as diverse as possible, and preferably groups whose members do not already know each other.</p>
<p>By the end of the first week of class, students are given their group assignments and then asked to sit in circles by group. After introductions, the students’ first task is to share with other group members three strengths and three weaknesses that they bring to the group (e.g., “I write well,” “I am not very organized,” “I commute to campus and have limited availability,” “I have a lot of contacts in the community”). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1046496413488422">Moreland (1999)</xref>, the performance of self-managed groups can be improved when members learn enough about one another to make optimal use of the group’s human resources. Next, groups are asked to develop and record their own rules to govern members’ behavior for the duration of the semester (e.g., “Listen to one another,” “Come to group meetings prepared”). Examples are given, but these behavioral norms are developed without instructional intervention or modification. The purpose of having groups develop explicit behavioral norms is to help group members acclimate to one another and also to provide a starting point from which group members can create a sense of group identity.</p>
<p>The locations of the groups in the classroom can be changed as time goes by, but students should sit in groups during every class, so the classroom must be able to accommodate this type of seating arrangement. Most class activities and discussions occur within the context of small groups. The close proximity of group members is designed to facilitate their ongoing interaction, and to allow all group members to observe the group’s evolution and progress. This ongoing contact (in addition to the contact that students may have together outside of class, while working on their group project) provides students with unmistakable real-life examples of the concepts they are learning about in their textbook. Although some groups may not reach the membership and competence stages of group development (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1046496413488422">Bushe &amp; Coetzer, 2007</xref>) most groups are able to develop a group identity (membership phase) and can arrange for their members to work together successfully (competence phase).</p>
<p>The rationale for these suggestions is fourfold. First, social interaction among group members who bring different perspectives to problem-solving activities is a very effective technique for increasing cognitive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1046496413488422">Tudge, 1992</xref>). Second, it is more challenging to communicate with people who have different worldviews, and one of the primary outcomes of the class is to teach students to work effectively with diverse others. Third, when students graduate, most of them will not be able to pick their teams at work—they will be assigned to a work group and must learn to adapt to the other members. Thus the classroom group assignments approximate the work experience. Fourth, research shows that students claim their worst classroom group experiences occur when they are assigned to groups that are too small (three or fewer) or too large (eight or more), when students are allowed to pick their own groups, and when groups are dissolved and re-formed on a constant basis (Fiechtner &amp; Davis, 1992).</p>

<title>Course Grading Structure</title>
<p>In a traditional classroom, students’ grades are often based entirely on the students’ own performance on assignments, exams, papers, and other individual products. The grading structure in the first author’s Small Group Communication course is based on the team learning model performance evaluation system proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1046496413488422">Michaelson and Black (1994)</xref>. In this model, a student’s grade reflects individual performance, group performance, and peer evaluation. They contend that unless
<disp-quote>
<p>the reward system is specifically designed to ensure individual accountability and include incentives for participating in group work, it will significantly reduce the willingness of students to engage in the kinds of behavior that are needed for successfully implementing any group based instructional approach. (p. 17)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The grading structure for the first author’s Small Group Communication course varies slightly from the team performance model in that group participation and peer evaluation are grouped together under a category called <italic>group maintenance</italic>.</p>
<p>The major course assignments will be described in a moment, but the rationale for the grading system is as follows. Individual performance constitutes 40% of a student’s grade, with four individual exams (20%) and two individual papers (20%). The grades on these components ensure that students are held accountable for completing reading assignments and that they have a baseline understanding of the fundamental course concepts and can apply these concepts to real and hypothetical situations. Group performance also constitutes 40% of the student’s grade with four group exams (10%), a major group project and paper (20%), and a final group presentation (10%). This portion of the grade reflects a <italic>cooperative incentive structure</italic> in which two or more individuals are rewarded based on their performance as a group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1046496413488422">Slavin, 1983</xref>). On each of these items, all members of a group receive the same score. If students are to learn how to work effectively as a team, their grade must stem in part from their collective effort. In cooperative learning groups, students learn better only if they are given clear incentives for doing well as a group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1046496413488422">Ravenscroft, Buckless, McCombs, &amp; Zuckerman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1046496413488422">Slavin, 1983</xref>). Finally, group maintenance comprises 20% of a student’s grade, which involves peer evaluation (10%) and class participation (10%). Group maintenance can be defined as behaviors (in addition to task work) that are required to foster cohesiveness and keep the group functioning effectively. The peer evaluation component is an average of group member’s ratings of one another at two points in the semester. It ensures that all group members contribute their share of the work and behave in a professional manner toward one another. The class participation component encourages group members to attend class regularly and to come to class prepared for group business (a portion of each class is devoted to group work). Fiechtner and Davis’ (1992) research on students’ best and worst group experiences supports this grading structure. They report that the best learning groups have (a) at least 20% (but no more than 60%) of the grade coming from group work, (b) no more than one group presentation, (c) three or fewer papers, (d) group exams but no more than four of them, (e) class time devoted to group work, and (f) peer evaluations incorporated into the grading system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1046496413488422">
<title>Individual and Group Exams</title>
<p>To ensure that students keep up with the course readings, the textbook and lectures are divided into four sections and students are tested over each section. The students are expected to read the relevant readings before coming to each class, and then class time is devoted to a discussion of concepts from the readings, or to an applied exercise designed to reinforce the course concepts and help the students apply them to their own experiences. For instance, when teaching about group roles, an episode of a television show (e.g., <italic>The Big Bang Theory, Friends, Gilligan’s Island</italic>) is shown so students can identify in group discussion the roles that the characters play and the utility of those roles for group cohesiveness and productivity. It is critical for students to keep up with the readings; as a group evolves and experiences challenges, they are reading about applicable—and helpful—concepts in their textbook.</p>
<p>Each test has 25 questions (a combination of multiple choice, true/false, short answer, and/or matching). Students first take the test individually, taking as much time as they need, and then each one turns in his or her answer sheet, but retains the list of test questions. After all of a group’s members have finished their individual exams, the group takes the same exam together. The group is given as much time as it needs to complete the test (although the group test generally takes longer than the individual tests), and the entire group turns in one answer sheet, along with the lists of questions. The purpose of the individual exam is to assess the degree of individual learning and ensure individual accountability. Although the group test may seem redundant, collaborative testing produces significant increases in test scores and retention of course content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1046496413488422">Bloom, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1046496413488422">Slavin (1996)</xref> points out that information is better retained when people must explain the material to someone else.</p>
<p>There are a number of other pedagogical benefits of collaborative test taking including increased achievement, increased retention, increased accountability, improved social skills, and increased critical thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1046496413488422">Bloom, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1046496413488422">Meseke, Nafziger, &amp; Meseke, 2008</xref>). When individual success is predicated on the performance of all group members, people pay more attention to one another’s efforts and apply normative pressure to study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1046496413488422">Slavin, 1983</xref>). Talking about test questions also allows group members to practice a number of communication skills, such as listening, argumentation, asking questions, conflict resolution, and negotiation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1046496413488422">
<title>Group Analysis/Peer Evaluation Papers</title>
<p>Twice during the semester, students are required to write an individual paper describing the evolution and progress of their group. The paper has two parts. In the first part, students must apply the concepts they have learned from the textbook and the lectures to the behavior of their group (e.g., stages of group development, leadership style, nonverbal behavior, group roles, and conflict management techniques). Students must provide actual examples to support their analysis of the group. The purpose of the group analysis is for students to demonstrate higher order thinking skills, as per Bloom’s taxonomy (analysis, synthesis, and evaluation).</p>
<p>In the second part of the paper, students provide anonymous feedback for every member of their group, evaluating his or her performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1046496413488422">Latane (1981)</xref> has argued that monitoring individual performance can increase individual effort and decrease social loafing in groups. Using the same font, margins, and spacing, they write two well-developed paragraphs that describe in detail the strengths and weaknesses of each group member. Students are told to make sure that the feedback is specific, detailed, and focused on behaviors (rather than personality). Students are also asked to assign every group member a peer evaluation grade (a score between 0 and 25), and the scores that an individual student receives from each one of his or her group members is averaged for the final peer evaluation score. Students must grade one another on a curve, which means that they cannot assign all of their group members a score of 25; each score they assign must be different. The students’ scores must also correspond to the written portion of the evaluation; otherwise, they might assign all group members unrealistically high scores regardless of performance. Because the peer evaluation is a part of their paper, students are graded by the instructor on the quality of the feedback they give to others. Students’ feedback materials are compiled by the instructor, and the anonymous feedback forms are then distributed to students along with their peer evaluation grades. This portion of the paper provides a mechanism for students to reflect on the functional and dysfunctional aspects of the group’s behavior. Peer feedback is also critical because the groups spend considerable time outside of class working on their group projects, and outside of the classroom only group members are privy to what happens in the group. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1046496413488422">Michaelsen and Black (1994)</xref> point out, peer feedback also provides incentives for members to participate and helps alleviate students’ fears that they might have to do all the work of others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1046496413488422">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Group Project, Paper, and Presentation</title>
<p>The group service project is the most important component in the class. Service learning not only directly connects the academic environment to the community but it also positively transforms the community and the students who perform the service. The most important form of learning occurs when individuals discuss an issue, problem, or situation that has some significance for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1046496413488422">Philpott &amp; Batty, 2009</xref>). As a result, our student groups are given an ill-structured problem (service learning project) to solve. Ill-structured problems are characterized by vaguely defined goals and incomplete or ambiguous information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1046496413488422">Chin &amp; McGee, 2003</xref>). A good deal of interaction is required to solve ill-structured problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1046496413488422">Cohen, 1994</xref>). The benefits of this type of assignment include enhanced cognitive and metacognitive skills, and advanced argumentation skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1046496413488422">Jonasen, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>For this assignment, groups are given the freedom to negotiate, select, design, and execute a socially worthy and significant project that will somehow benefit humankind. They are expected to spend 20 to 30 hr outside of the classroom working on the service project and they are required to bring all of their intellectual skills to bear through the planning and completion stages of the project (sweeping floors or stuffing envelopes for an organization would not qualify as a project). Students first come to a consensus about what they want to do, then they select an organization to help. Next, they contact that organization to see if their services are needed, then they plan the steps and timeline for the project. Every project must be approved by the instructor, but once that approval is granted, team members can begin to work together to carry out the project. The key here is that students completely own the project—it is not imposed on them. The group is expected to set its own goals for the project, and then work on its own to accomplish those goals. The instructor serves as a facilitator to help guide the group’s work, to contact the organization and verify its assent to the group’s help, and to check in periodically on the group to evaluate its progress. Examples of these service projects include campaigns to collect food and coats for the homeless, trips to an amusement park for underprivileged children, sleeping outside for a week to raise awareness of homelessness, designing a class and teaching farm safety to high school students, and building a Halloween haunted house to raise money for a charity.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1046496413488422">Laal and Laal (2012)</xref> point out that group work only qualifies as collaborative learning if it meets five criteria. Group members must be interdependent, interact often, and be accountable to one another. They must also practice their social skills, and somehow evaluate the group. Our group service project meets these criteria.</p>
<p>From a social constructivist perspective, the goal of education is to keep students in their ZPD as much as possible by giving them challenging and meaningful tasks that would be difficult for them to complete on their own. This means that they need to work with others to complete those tasks. As the student accomplishes each task, the difference between what she or he can accomplish independently and what she or he can only accomplish with assistance decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1046496413488422">Shabani, Khatib, &amp; Ebadi, 2010</xref>). When completing a class project, students often exceed their own expectations and surprise themselves and one another with their accomplishments. From an instructional standpoint, it is very impressive to watch what students can achieve if given the freedom to do so. Groups also have the freedom to fail. But that experience can also be instructive. Students are not graded on the outcome of their class project but rather on their ability to analyze the group processes that affected that project.</p>
<p>This analysis occurs at the end of the semester, when the students must give a group project presentation and write a group project paper. In the group project presentations, which typically last for 20 to 30 min, groups share the results of their projects with the rest of the class. All group members are expected to go to the front of the room for the presentation. Although they are not explicitly required to do so, group members generally divide the presentation equally among themselves. Groups are asked to describe why their project was socially significant, what happened during the course of the project, what they learned over the course of the semester, and what they accomplished. In their group paper, students are asked to describe (using textbook concepts where applicable) the evolution of their group, the steps they took to accomplish the project, the obstacles they faced and the extent to which they overcame those obstacles, photographic documentation of the project, and the project’s results or social impact. Students must also consider how they would do the project differently, if they had the chance to do it again.</p>
<p>The extent to which students benefit from all of this group work depends on their level of participation. Benefits arise when students give and receive help; it is through the processes of building on opinions, sharing knowledge, and justifying their reasoning that group members are able to reach a consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1046496413488422">Webb, 2009</xref>). This means that some students and groups learn more than others, because some students are more motivated than others to participate. However, the course grading structure and assignments are designed to encourage maximum participation. And, just by virtue of interacting and working with an ongoing group and by observing the progress of other groups, even unmotivated students are likely to learn more in this instructional setting than they would in a passive learning environment.</p>

<title>Assigning Groups</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A small group of random people can become cohesive. When we were first put into my group, my first impressions of some of the members were not very good. By keeping an open mind and getting to know everyone, this allowed us to bond and come together in order to create a successful project. (Student comment)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At the start of the new semester, an instructor encounters a classroom full of students whose familiarity with one another varies. It is difficult to identify fraternity brothers, roommates, softball teammates, romantic partners, and others who share friendships or other relationships. And students often maneuver to be assigned to certain groups. But, it is important to try to eliminate potential cliques (based on major or gender similarity), before they happen. One way to accomplish this is to have students fill out a brief demographic questionnaire on the first day of class. Separate students on the basis of sex and major first, and then use other questions to further separate them. Finally, determine the number of classroom groups needed and randomly place students from each category into each group. If there are to be six groups, for example, then begin with the women and place one business major in each group. Now continue on with the science majors, then the history majors, and so on, so that each group is comprised of women from each major. Use the same procedure for the men. If the section is filled with students from the same major, then use another demographic characteristic to generate groups that are as diverse as possible. The more diverse the group, the more its members can learn from one another.</p>

<title>Course Grading Structure</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I believe that because 10% of my grade was taken from the peer evaluation it did indeed cause me to contribute more to my group than if the same portion of my grade had come from the professor. It put the power into the hands of my peers and gave me more respect for them and as communicators and workers within the small group infrastructure. (Student comment)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The primary challenge in using a grading structure of this sort is the initial resistance students have to working in groups where their grades are dependent on others. This can be overcome by carefully explaining at the beginning of the class the psychological commitment and effort expected from students, as they work with other members of their group, both inside and outside of class. Another challenge is that the grading structure is somewhat complicated and requires more record keeping than in courses where students only receive individual grades. However, dividing students’ grades into an individual portion and a group portion allows students to recognize the benefits of their collaboration, making the added time necessary for computing grades well worth the additional effort.</p>

<title>Individual and Group Exams</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It was amazing to me to see how much better we did on the group exams than our individual [exams]. It makes sense but I have never seen it firsthand. I have never taken a group test before so the phrase “two heads are better than one” clicked for me. Being able to work together on the test really contributed the most to my learning. (Student comment)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Naturally, some of the students come less prepared for the tests than do other students. Another challenge is that some group members dominate the test discussions and force their answers on less assertive group members. However, students’ grades on the group tests are almost always higher than their individual grades. When students are unprepared, they often lose points on their peer evaluations and so, after a while, they tend to work harder in preparation for the tests. In cases where one student with the right answer has been ignored, the other students in the group quickly realize their error (because they can compare their individual scores against one another and against the group score). As a result, they try to listen and include everyone in the group discussions. Another interesting phenomenon occurs once cohesion has been established in a group; if a group member has been a contributing member up to the point of the test, but arrives at the test with a legitimate excuse for not being prepared, other group members will forgive the unprepared member and pick up the slack on his or her behalf.</p>

<title>Group Analysis/Peer Evaluation Papers</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Of all of the items we were graded on in the course I would say the group analysis/peer evaluation papers were the most important items that contributed to my learning experience within this course. It gave the students a platform to apply the academic knowledge they acquired from the text and class lectures to the real world experiences they had completing their projects in their groups. It brought the learning process full circle and layered a new depth of knowledge into the class. (Student comment)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The first part of this paper is very easy for students to complete. Students understand how to structure their discussion of group behavior, and they have many firsthand examples of that behavior to use as illustrations. The second part of the paper is more difficult for students to complete. They grumble and argue about having to grade their peers on a curve, and they are reticent to discuss the weaknesses of their peers and assign them a score. The first mid-semester peer evaluation reports also tend to change the tenor of the group, especially when some members receive low peer evaluation scores. Still, in many instances a poor peer evaluation encourages non-participating members of the group to increase their meeting attendance and contributions. Most students take the feedback to heart and try in good faith to improve, for instance by sharing more ideas during group problem solving or not being so controlling. Occasionally, however, a group member pouts as a result of the peer evaluation and withdraws from the group. The group generally ignores such behavior and proceeds as normal. After a few weeks, the withdrawn member generally resumes normal interaction with the group and makes an effort to address the suggestions made in the peer evaluation report. Another interesting result is that very cohesive groups sometimes work around the requirement to curve peer evaluation scores because they see themselves as hardworking people who all deserve the highest peer evaluation score. These groups coordinate their peer evaluation scores, deciding together what scores they will assign one another so that each member of the group receives the same average score as every other member. This practice corresponds with equity showing that when participants are placed in a situation they believe to be inequitable, they will opt for lower personal rewards in favor of equitable rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1046496413488422">Schmitt &amp; Marwell, 1972</xref>).</p>

<title>Group Project, Paper, and Presentation</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If we had not done [a service project] I do not think we would have learned nearly as much about working in a small group environment. When we did our service project we had to put all our efforts in our group and come together as a group to get one common objective complete, which was our service project. We had to get through many things a group faces when working in a group and if we had not had a service project to work towards, then we never would have experienced those things. (Student comment)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On this assignment, students often have difficulty negotiating meeting times that work for all group members. When that happens, it is best to encourage students to determine a set meeting time for the rest of the semester and advise them to clear their schedules accordingly. Students tend to follow the path of least resistance and try to select easy projects that require little effort. So, the service project often turns out to be more difficult than students initially expect, and they are confronted throughout the semester with the politics of the group and the unforeseen obstacles that arise during project. The main challenge from an instructional standpoint is helping students find ways to solve their interpersonal conflicts and discover solutions to the problems that they face. In spite of this, I never cease to be amazed at what students can achieve during this exercise. Their contributions to the community exceed even their own expectations and most students feel a profound sense of accomplishment at the end of the semester—even when they do not reach their goals! A part of this sense of achievement arises from their sense of increased skills at working with a group. As the semester goes on, students are occasionally asked to give a brief project update to the entire class, and so the groups begin to compete informally with one another to see who can be the most successful and cohesive group. This competition among the groups tends to foster cohesion within each group. The last portion of the assignment is to present the results of the group project to the rest of the class. These presentations are instructive to everyone who hears them. As each group discusses the challenges that it faced and the ways in which it overcame (or not) those challenges, other groups learn vicariously from that experience. These presentations are also an opportunity for groups to celebrate their accomplishments, big and small, and help to end the semester on a positive note.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The lessons learned by physically working in a group are extremely important and valuable. What you learn in this class you can apply to various situations, especially within a future job. All students need to communicate effectively in groups, and this class helped my ability to do so.(Student comment)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The purpose of this article was to review some tried and tested methods of teaching teamwork and group behavior. These teaching strategies are suitable for a wide range of authentic problems and for a wide range of subject matter. The group work teaches interaction skills and problem solving that can be employed at a later date to future problems. Perhaps the most important outcome of this pedagogy is that in working with others to accomplish a socially worthy goal, students are empowered, they learn about citizenship and building a better world, and they develop confidence for future group interactions.</p>

<p>Although students cannot switch groups, the instructor does allow groups to fire individual group members for gross negligence and severely inappropriate behavior. All group members must agree to fire the individual, and they must come and present their case to the first author. If the group has just cause, the instructor notifies the person who has been dismissed and negotiates an alternate assignment with him or her to make up for the group portion of the grade. The threat of being fired (and the prospect of writing a 20 to 30 page research paper in lieu of the group work) has generally provided enough incentive to guarantee student participation—only three students have been fired during the 20 years in which the course has been taught.</p>
