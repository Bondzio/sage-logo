<abstract>
<p>Existing research suggests that relationships among organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), task performance, and individual career outcomes are necessarily positive. The authors question this assumption and hypothesize that in organizations with outcome-based control systems, time spent on OCB comes at a cost to task performance. Building on this idea, the authors propose not only that time spent on task performance is more important than time spent on OCB in determining career outcomes (i.e., performance evaluation, salary increase, advancement speed, promotion) in an outcome-based control system but also that time spent on OCB may negatively impact career outcomes. Results based on archival data from 3,680 employees in a professional services firm lend some support for these ideas. Specifically, time spent on task performance was more important than OCB in determining all four career outcomes. Further, controlling for time spent on task performance, employees who spent more time on OCB had lower salary increases and advanced more slowly than employees who spent less time on OCB. These findings suggest that relationships between OCB and outcomes are more complex than originally thought and that boundary conditions may apply to conclusions drawn about the outcomes of OCB.</p>

<p>Every organization has a purpose, known as an organizational mission, for its existence. The mission identifies the scope of operations in terms of products, services, or markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206311407508">Pearce &amp; David, 1987</xref>) and determines the concrete tasks that employees perform to help the organization reach its goals. Because an individual’s goals are not necessarily aligned with the organization’s goals, control systems are used to monitor and reward individuals so that they pursue the collective interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206311407508">Eisenhardt, 1985</xref>). Ideally, any job performance on the part of the individual that contributes to the achievement of the organization’s mission should be rewarded.</p>
<p>There are, however, different ways that individuals can contribute through their performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311407508">Campbell, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206311407508">Katz &amp; Kahn, 1978</xref>). Within the job performance domain, <italic>task performance</italic> refers to the behaviors that relate to core job requirements and contribute to the technical core of the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206311407508">Borman &amp; Motowidlo, 1993</xref>); these behaviors tend to be job specific. Task performance includes behaviors generally found in traditional job descriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0149206311407508">Williams &amp; Anderson, 1991</xref>). The other category of job performance includes behaviors that “support the social and psychological environment in which task performance takes place” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0149206311407508">Organ, 1997</xref>: 95). These behaviors are viewed as more discretionary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206311407508">Van Scotter, Motowidlo, &amp; Cross, 2000</xref>) and tend to be similar across jobs. Examples of these behaviors may include helping others, volunteering for extra work, or socializing new employees. This category of behaviors has been known under a variety of construct names, such as prosocial organizational behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206311407508">Brief &amp; Motowidlo, 1986</xref>), contextual performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206311407508">Borman &amp; Motowidlo, 1993</xref>), and extra-role behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206311407508">Van Dyne, Cummings, &amp; Parks, 1995</xref>), all of which have considerable overlap. Building on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311407508">Katz (1964)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0149206311407508">Organ (1988)</xref> coined the term <italic>organizational citizenship behavior</italic> (OCB) for this category of overall behaviors, and this is the term we adopt here. OCB is “individual behavior that is discretionary, not directly or explicitly recognized by the formal reward system, and in the aggregate promotes the efficient and effective functioning of the organization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206311407508">Organ, Podsakoff, &amp; MacKenzie, 2006</xref>: 3).</p>
<p>Research on task performance and OCB has proliferated, most likely due to the strong relationships each type of behavior exhibits with individual outcomes. For example, research shows that both task performance and OCB are positively related to performance evaluations (see the meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206311407508">Podsakoff, Whiting, Podsakoff, &amp; Blume, 2009</xref>) and rewards or reward recommendations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206311407508">Allen &amp; Rush, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206311407508">Kiker &amp; Motowidlo, 1999</xref>). Recently, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206311407508">Johns (2006)</xref> indicated the importance of context in organizational research and pointed out that unmeasured contextual variables at one level (e.g., the organization level) may influence relationships at another level (e.g., the individual level). He suggested that the influence of context is often unrecognized and that it could actually reverse the sign of relationships between variables.</p>
<p>We noticed that the vast majority of past research on OCB has focused on its effects in behavior-based control systems in which a wide range of behaviors are evaluated and rewarded. As a result, it is not surprising that OCB tends to exhibit positive relationships with individual outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206311407508">Podsakoff et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206311407508">Bergeron (2007)</xref>, however, proposed that the positive relationship between OCB and individual outcomes seen in behavior-based systems may be very different in an outcome-based control system because of what is evaluated and rewarded. In an outcome-based control system, behaviors that do not directly contribute to increasing one’s own productivity, such as helping others, may not be valued and may even come at a cost. Given that productivity is what is most important in this type of system, engaging in OCB may take time away from productivity and therefore may be negatively related to certain individual outcomes. Indeed, a recent study at the team level showed that time-consuming OCB dimensions had negative relationships with performance in certain groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206311407508">Nielsen, Bachrach, Sundstrom, &amp; Halfhill, 2012</xref>). There also may be costs at the individual level—particularly in outcome-based control systems. Thus, one limitation of past research is that most of the empirical work has investigated only the effects of OCB for individuals in behavior-based control systems.</p>
<p>A second limitation of existing research is that most work on individual outcomes has focused on performance evaluations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0149206311407508">Borman, White, &amp; Dorsey, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206311407508">Johnson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0149206311407508">Werner, 1994</xref>) and, to a lesser extent, on rewards or reward recommendations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206311407508">Allen &amp; Rush, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206311407508">Kiker &amp; Motowidlo, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206311407508">Orr, Sackett, &amp; Mercer, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0149206311407508">Yun, Takeuchi, &amp; Liu, 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0149206311407508">1</xref></sup> Very little research has gone beyond subjective performance evaluations to investigate longer term objective career outcomes in field settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206311407508">Van Scotter et al., 2000</xref>, is an exception). Researchers have specifically called for work examining the relationship between OCB and promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206311407508">MacKenzie, Podsakoff, &amp; Paine, 1999</xref>). One reason this is important is because the factors that influence subjective outcomes (i.e., performance evaluations) may not be the same factors that influence objective outcomes (e.g., compensation, career advancement). Thus, it is important to take both types of outcomes into consideration in studying OCB. Further, the research that has been done on rewards either has focused on reward recommendations (i.e., what managers <italic>would</italic> reward rather than what managers actually did reward; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206311407508">Allen &amp; Rush, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0149206311407508">Yun et al., 2007</xref>) or has been conducted inlab studies where reward decisions do not have real-world consequences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206311407508">Kiker &amp; Motowidlo, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206311407508">Orr et al., 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, most work on OCB has examined its effectiveness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206311407508">Johnson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0149206311407508">Rotundo &amp; Sackett, 2002</xref>) or its frequency (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206311407508">Lee &amp; Allen, 2002</xref>). More recent work, however, has raised the issue of time spent on OCB. It is important to understand the composition of time spent on work behaviors with regard to the relative amount of task performance versus OCB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206311407508">Bergeron, 2007</xref>). The reasoning is that if activities have different value, then it is not just about effectiveness but also about the amount of time spent (or not spent) on activities. Thus, in this study, we focus on the amount of time spent on behaviors.</p>
<p>Based on the extensive research showing positive relationships between OCB and individual outcomes, advice is being dispensed that encourages employees to engage in OCB (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206311407508">Fodchuk, 2007</xref>). Yet, based on the limitations above, more research is needed to understand whether this positive relationship holds in an outcome-based control system. Further, the relationship between subjective performance evaluations and other types of objective career outcomes may not be as direct or as strong as is assumed. Although most research on OCB shows a positive relationship to subjective performance evaluations, it is unclear whether this relationship will hold for objective career outcomes. In this article, we attempt to address these gaps and past limitations by using longitudinal data of how individuals spent their time.</p>
<p>In what follows, we describe behavior-based versus outcome-based control systems and posit that, in an outcome-based control system, task performance is much more important than OCB. We test this relationship with regard to individual performance evaluations, noting that our theoretical framework applies specifically to organizations and work groups with individual-level outcome-based control systems. It does not apply to team-level outcome-based control systems. We then examine the trade-off between task performance and OCB and, based on this trade-off, suggest that there may be a cost to OCB in outcome-based systems. We also show how the relationship between OCB and outcomes may be different depending on whether the specific outcome is a subjective performance evaluation or an objective career outcome (e.g., career advancement). In sum, using a professional services firm that utilizes an outcome-based control system, we test relationships between two types of job performance (i.e., task performance and OCB) and the outcomes of performance evaluation, salary increase, and career advancement (i.e., promotion and promotion speed).</p>

<title>Control Systems and OCB</title>
<p>Organizational control systems guide employee behavior and ensure that employees act in accordance with the best interests of the organization. A control system is a set of organizational procedures designed to monitor, direct, evaluate, and compensate employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206311407508">Eisenhardt, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311407508">Ouchi, 1979</xref>). There are two dominant types of organizational control systems: <italic>behavior-based</italic> control systems and <italic>outcome-based</italic> control systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0149206311407508">Ouchi, 1980</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-0149206311407508">
<title>Existing Evidence for the Effects of OCB in Behavior-Based Systems</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206311407508">Oliver and Anderson (1994)</xref>, organizations using behavior-based systems focus on monitoring inputs (i.e., employee behaviors) rather than on monitoring outputs. There are high levels of management direction and more subjective and complex evaluation processes based on what employees know (e.g., knowledge, aptitude) and what employees do (i.e., behaviors). Typically, employees are rated by managers on a number of behaviors, which may be weighted and combined into a composite evaluation used to determine salary and promotion decisions. Performance evaluation, in this type of system, is more subjective because managers must decide to what degree inputs (i.e., behaviors) generate desired outputs at a later point in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0149206311407508">Oliver &amp; Anderson, 1995</xref>). Thus, in behavior-based control systems, organizations are concerned with <italic>how</italic> work gets done; therefore, specific behaviors are evaluated and rewarded.</p>
<p>Because OCB contributes to organizational and group effectiveness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206311407508">George &amp; Bettenhausen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206311407508">Podsakoff, Ahearne, &amp; MacKenzie, 1997</xref>), it follows that employees would be positively evaluated when engaging in OCB in a behavior-based control system. The results of field and lab studies indicate that both task performance and OCB are positively related to evaluations of individuals’ overall performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206311407508">Allen &amp; Rush, 1998</xref>, Study 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0149206311407508">Whiting, Podsakoff, &amp; Pierce, 2008</xref>). The strong weighting of both types of performance is substantiated by a recent meta-analysis that showed that OCB and task performance have approximately equal weight in determining performance evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206311407508">Podsakoff et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The importance of OCB in behavior-based control systems may suggest that OCB, in addition to task performance, is a central component of the job in this type of system. There are two likely reasons for this. The first is that, in a behavior-based system, the boundary between OCB and task performance may be somewhat blurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206311407508">Van Dyne et al., 1995</xref>). Research shows that it is not always clear where the line is between what is part of one’s job and what is considered extra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206311407508">Morrison, 1994</xref>). The second reason is that, because OCB is a type of behavior, it follows that employees would be positively evaluated when engaging in OCB in a system that rewards behaviors. In fact, employees may be able to compensate for low performance in one area (e.g., task performance) by contributing more in another area (e.g., OCB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206311407508">Griffin, Neal, &amp; Neale, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Judging by the samples and organizational contexts described in previous research (e.g., mechanics, students, supervisors, military, support staff, managers), it seems that most research on OCB has taken place within behavior-based control systems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206311407508">Allen &amp; Rush, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206311407508">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206311407508">Heilman &amp; Chen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206311407508">MacKenzie, Podsakoff, &amp; Fetter, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206311407508">Motowidlo &amp; Van Scotter, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206311407508">Orr et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206311407508">Van Scotter et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0149206311407508">Werner, 1994</xref>). Thus, it seems fairly clear that OCB and task performance contribute to performance evaluations in a relatively equal manner, and this body of research demonstrates the importance of OCB in determining performance evaluations. However, because OCB has been studied primarily in behavior-based control systems, it is less clear how OCB will relate to outcomes in an outcome-based control system. Past research shows that certain aspects of the job may become more or less important depending on the context (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206311407508">Dierdorff, Rubin, &amp; Morgeson, 2009</xref>). Thus, we develop predictions about the role of task performance and OCB with various career outcomes within an outcome-based control system.</p>

<sec id="section3-0149206311407508">
<title>The Effects of OCB on Subjective Career Outcomes in Outcome-Based Systems</title>
<p>In contrast to behavior-based systems, outcome-based control systems focus on monitoring outputs and rely heavily on objective results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206311407508">Oliver &amp; Anderson, 1994</xref>). Some typical characteristics of this type of system include a managerial focus on results rather than behaviors and performance evaluations based partly on observable results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0149206311407508">Oliver &amp; Anderson, 1995</xref>). Common examples include sales and professional service firms. In these types of systems, there is relatively less monitoring of employees’ behaviors and little managerial direction. Rather, employees are held accountable primarily for their results, and less for how they accomplish those results. Generally, results are assessed by some type of objective measure (e.g., sales, publications, billable hours) against which employees are evaluated and rewarded. This type of system provides a compelling motivation because it determines rewards (i.e., compensation, promotion) based on measurable results. Thus, in outcome-based control systems, organizations are concerned with <italic>what</italic> gets done (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206311407508">Oliver &amp; Anderson, 1994</xref>) and individual results are what is evaluated and rewarded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0149206311407508">Oliver &amp; Anderson, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Due to the differences in the reward systems, it is likely that task performance will be much more important than OCB in an outcome-based control system. There are two likely reasons for this. The first is that the boundary between OCB and task performance is likely to be more clearly defined than in a behavior-based system. In an outcome-based control system, there are very few criteria upon which to be evaluated. Results, in whatever form they are measured, are what count. As such, task performance is well defined, while behaviors such as helping others (i.e., OCB) may be seen as tangential to what matters. The second reason is that results are what is rewarded. Considering the two types of job performance, task performance is more proximal than OCB to the central mission of the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206311407508">Borman &amp; Motowidlo, 1993</xref>). Because task performance focuses on contributing to the organization’s central mission, it seems that task performance would be very important in determining individual outcomes in an outcome-based system, given the obvious link between individual results and organizational results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206311407508">Rich, Bommer, MacKenzie, Podsakoff, &amp; Johnson, 1999</xref>). Indeed, most research shows a strong positive relationship between task performance and individual outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206311407508">Allen &amp; Rush, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206311407508">Kiker &amp; Motowidlo, 1999</xref>). However, in contrast to a behavior-based system, it does not seem possible to compensate for a lack of results by engaging in more OCB in an outcome-based system. Therefore, compared to past research in behavior-based systems, we expect task performance to be much more important than OCB in an outcome-based control system.</p>
<list id="list1-0149206311407508" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Time spent on task performance is more important than time spent on OCB in determining subjective performance evaluations in an outcome-based control system.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Despite the focus on results, subjective assessments continue to play a role in outcome-based systems because factors beyond results may also be taken into consideration in determining career outcomes. There are a few reasons why it is likely that OCB will still be positively related to performance evaluations in outcome-based systems (although it will be less important than task performance). First, performance evaluations can be considered a type of reward in that they are a form of recognition for a job well done (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206311407508">Suazo, Martinez, &amp; Sandoval, 2009</xref>). Because OCB makes groups function more effectively (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206311407508">Podsakoff et al., 1997</xref>), it makes supervisors’ jobs easier. Assigning some value to OCB in subjective performance evaluations is a way that supervisors can informally reward good citizens. Second, an outcome-based control system can encourage a short-term perspective on the part of employees, such that employees are encouraged to focus on short-term payoffs and ignore behaviors that may be beneficial to the organization’s long-term results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206311407508">Anderson &amp; Oliver, 1987</xref>). For example, employees may avoid mentoring junior employees or socializing new employees because this time could be better spent on increasing their individual results. Taking OCB into consideration when conducting subjective performance evaluations may be a way to encourage cooperation and helping-related behaviors. For these reasons, it is expected that OCB will be positively related to performance evaluations.</p>

<title>The Trade-Off Between Task Performance and OCB</title>
<p>Beyond the relationships of task performance and OCB to performance evaluations, little or no research has empirically examined the possibility that there is a trade-off between task performance and OCB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206311407508">Bergeron, 2007</xref>). Past research frequently has examined relationships between either OCB or task performance and outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206311407508">Allen &amp; Rush, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206311407508">Avila, Fern, &amp; Mann, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206311407508">Heilman &amp; Chen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206311407508">Hui, Lam, &amp; Law, 2000</xref>). What has not been empirically addressed, within the job performance domain, is the relationship that one type of performance has to the other. From a resource allocation perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206311407508">Bergeron, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0149206311407508">Hockey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206311407508">Kanfer &amp; Ackerman, 1989</xref>), resources—in the form of time—are fixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206311407508">Becker, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206311407508">Moore, 1963</xref>). Thus, a week contains 168 hours, and more time (i.e., hours) cannot be added to a given week. Thus, there is a certain resource capacity, and multiple demands must compete for the same units of time within the limited pool of resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0149206311407508">Hockey, 1997</xref>). Within a specific week (or month or year), individuals make resource allocation decisions about where to spend their time. Within the time allocated to work, one of the resource allocation decisions includes the amount of time spent on OCB relative to task performance. The concept of time is important because, generally, it is difficult to engage in two types of behavior at the same time (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0149206311407508">Schmidt &amp; Dolis, 2009</xref>). Thus, two activities (i.e., task performance and OCB) are not always independent of each other. Any change in time allocated to OCB may come at a cost to task performance, and vice versa. For example, one study found that when given a difficult goal, participants chose not to help others in order to increase their task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0149206311407508">Wright, George, Farnsworth, &amp; McMahan, 1993</xref>). Hence, individuals may be forced to make a choice among possible behaviors.</p>
<p>However, the few studies including both task performance and OCB (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206311407508">Allen &amp; Rush, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206311407508">Avila et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311407508">Turnley, Bolino, Lester, &amp; Bloodgood, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0149206311407508">Yun et al., 2007</xref>) generally show a positive and moderately strong correlation between the two types of performance. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis shows that the average correlation between the two types of performance ranges between .49 and .60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206311407508">Hoffman, Blair, Meriac, &amp; Woehr, 2007</xref>). The likely reason for this positive correlation is because OCB and task performance are generally assessed using subjective ratings of effectiveness (i.e., supervisor evaluations). This approach stands in contrast to examining the amount of time spent engaging in each type of behavior. The amount of time spent on behavior is important because subjective evaluations of help may differ depending on who is doing the evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311407508">Flynn, 2006</xref>). Thus, an individual may spend a lot of time on OCB but not be perceived as being effective or may spend very little time on it but be perceived as being quite effective. Thus, there can be large differences in ratings depending on whether OCB is measured objectively as time spent versus subjectively as effectiveness. Some evidence for the trade-off is seen in the few studies in which task performance is measured objectively. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206311407508">MacKenzie and colleagues (1999)</xref> examined task performance and OCB in a sample of insurance agents, where task performance was an objective measure of sales. They found an average negative correlation of −.19 in Study 2. Thus, it seems that time spent on OCB was time taken away from task performance (i.e., sales). Further evidence for this assertion is based on a negative correlation between task performance and OCB in a lab study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0149206311407508">Wright et al., 1993</xref>). Laboratory studies generally use a fixed amount of time (e.g., 45 minutes) in which participants must complete some task. Thus, time is artificially controlled in a laboratory experiment, and the trade-off between the two types of performance becomes salient. A trade-off between task performance and OCB, however, has not been hypothesized or empirically tested in the literature. Based on the above arguments, we hypothesize that individuals who spend more time on OCB will have lower task performance than individuals who spend less time on OCB.</p>
<list id="list3-0149206311407508" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: Time spent on OCB will be negatively related to task performance.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We note that the trade-off between OCB and task performance should exist regardless of the type of control system. This trade-off, however, manifests differently in each system. In a behavior-based system, as discussed earlier, both OCB and task performance carry relatively equal weight in determining individual outcomes. Thus, although there may be a trade-off between the two types of performance, the trade-off does not impact individual outcomes because both types of performance have the same approximate value and are rewarded at approximately the same rate (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206311407508">MacKenzie et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206311407508">Podsakoff et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that employees can engage in both types of behavior and still have positive individual outcomes. In an outcome-based control system, however, this is not the case. Due to what is valued and rewarded, it is likely that the trade-off will result in a cost to individual career outcomes.</p>

<title>The Effects of OCB on Objective CareerOutcomes in Outcome-Based Control Systems</title>
<p>Most research examining career outcomes of OCB has focused on subjective performance evaluations. Ostensibly, this is because good performance evaluations result in other types of positive career outcomes. However, subjective performance evaluations may not be strongly coupled to other important career outcomes. Evidence for this perspective comes from a recent meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206311407508">Podsakoff et al., 2009</xref>) examining the relationship between OCB and outcomes. Results showed a corrected correlation between OCB and reward recommendations of .77.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0149206311407508">2</xref></sup> Interestingly, the corrected correlation between OCB and <italic>actual</italic> rewards was only .26. Thus, there is a difference in the strength of the relationship between a subjective recommendation (or evaluation) and an objective outcome. Further, it may be that the factors influencing performance evaluations (task performance, OCB) are weighted differently when determining objective career outcomes.</p>
<p>As stated earlier, in an outcome-based control system, the focus is on results. Although OCB may carry some weight in determining subjective performance evaluations, objective career outcomes are most likely determined by contributions to the core task of the organization (i.e., results). While it may be possible to compensate for low task performance by engaging in more OCB in behavior-based systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206311407508">Griffin et al., 2000</xref>), this is not possible in outcome-based systems. Rather, spending time on anything that does not directly contribute to individual results may not be beneficial to employees in this type of system. Therefore, the positive relationship seen between OCB and individual outcomes in behavior-based control systems may be weaker or even negative in outcome-based control systems.</p>
<p>Because different activities (task performance, OCB) have different value in an outcome-based system, where time is spent becomes critical. It is important to understand how the total set of resources (i.e., time) is allocated across possible behaviors. This pattern of resource allocation is important to understanding individual outcomes in this type of system. Even in an outcome-based system, individuals generally have some discretion over how they spend their time. For example, a retail employee who is rewarded solely on sales may still take time to share expertise with a junior employee. This helping behavior, however, will not translate into compensation or promotion if results are what count, because any time spent on OCB can take time away from task performance. Since task performance is more rewarded, spending too much time on OCB is likely to lead to negative individual outcomes. This is one reason that the issue of measurement (effectiveness vs. time spent) becomes important. An employee may spend a lot of time on OCB, but this helping behavior may not be noticed or rewarded. This individual, however, still subsumes the “time cost” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206311407508">Bergeron, 2007</xref>) of engaging in OCB but does not receive the payoff by being recognized for it. Although there is a trade-off, it is not an absolute one because individuals can choose to work more hours (i.e., the number of hours is not fixed). However, when an individual’s resources (i.e., time) are at maximum capacity for that individual, the trade-off becomes absolute. For example, an employee may easily be able to spend 38 hours per week on task performance and 2 hours per week on OCB. If this employee’s maximum time capacity for work is 40 hours, then he or she cannot spend 38 hours per week on task performance and 5 hours per week on OCB. If the individual engages in 5 hours per week on OCB, his or her task performance will decrease. Thus, an absolute trade-off happens only at the maximum threshold of capacity (expressed as work hours).</p>
<p>There is some evidence for the cost of this trade-off. One study showed a positive relationship between OCB and performance evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206311407508">MacKenzie et al., 1999</xref>) but a negative relationship between OCB and individual results (as measured by total sales commission). Compensation in this same study was completely determined by individual productivity—not by performance evaluations. This suggests that although individuals were rewarded with good (subjective) performance evaluations, they actually had lowered (objective) compensation as a result of their good citizenship. Although a few instances of OCB may not amount to much, it is possible that there is a damaging cumulative effect. Individuals who spend too much time on OCB are likely to have lower career outcomes because they spend less time on task performance, which is the core of what is rewarded. Thus, not only is task performance more important than OCB, but OCB may actually result in lower individual outcomes. In sum, the above theoretical arguments lead to the following hypotheses:</p>

<title>Study Context</title>
<p>To assess the effects of time spent on task performance and OCB on various work outcomes, we obtained archival data on a sample of consultants from a large U.S.-based professional services firm. Such a firm is an appropriate context in which to test our hypotheses for a number of reasons. First, this firm operates using an outcome-based control system. Similar to other industries such as law, accounting, or information technology consulting, billable hours (i.e., time spent on client projects) are part of this organization’s core business model. Because employee salaries are fixed costs, additional billable hours translate into additional profit for the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0149206311407508">Wallace, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0149206311407508">Yakura, 2001</xref>). Thus, managers pay close attention to employees’ time allocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206311407508">Kaveny, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0149206311407508">Yakura, 2001</xref>). Second, because work on client projects (i.e., billable hours) is the main task of client-serving professionals, the human resources (HR) department has a tracking system where employees log their billable hours as well as hours spent on various other activities (as we discuss below). Finally, the majority of professional service firms have an “up-or-out” time-based control system on the partner track (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0149206311407508">von Nordenflycht, 2010</xref>). That is, employees are promoted based on good performance and should be promoted within a relatively specific time frame. If individuals are not promoted at that time, they are encouraged to leave the firm. Thus, career advancement is clear and easily quantifiable, as people entering in the same cohort should be promoted at approximately the same time.</p>
<p>Extensive conversations were conducted with firm partners and HR professionals to ensure an accurate understanding of which activities were included within each time category as well as to ensure that consultants accurately reported their hours. We learned that this firm (similar to other professional services firms) has a strong emphasis on billable hours and that industry norms encourage a high percentage of work time to be directed toward client-related activities. As a result, consultants are aware that performance evaluations are strongly tied to billable hours. Further, this firm trains consultants on how to log their hours as well as on the ethics of the profession for accurately reporting their timesheets.</p>
<p>As might be expected, consultants’ days and weeks are driven by the demands of the job (e.g., client work, required training). Consultants generally keep track of their hours on a daily basis with regard to where they spend their time. Similar to many jobs, full-time employees are expected to work a full week (i.e., 40 hours), and company norms suggest that a majority of these hours should be billed to a client. Consultants can increase their billable hours within the demands of a project by coming in early, working late to meet a deadline, or requesting more projects. If consultants need additional time to complete a project, the managing partner on the project can sell additional hours to the client. Thus, although there is an estimated number of billable hours for a specific project, consultants may vary in their billable hours based on their initiative for getting assigned to projects and working as many billable hours as possible. Consultants also vary in the total number of hours they work each week, as there is no company policy on a maximum number of hours a consultant can work.</p>
<p>Although billable hours are the main type of work activity, there are a number of other activities on which consultants can spend their time. Individuals who are not engaged in client work are expected to accurately record that time in other classification codes on their timesheet. For instance, when consultants are out sick or on vacation, the time is logged as illness or vacation hours. There are also time classification codes for time spent on business development, internal firm projects, or required professional certification training (note, however, that our data set does not contain this latter information). Further, because client work can be cyclical, there are times that some consultants may not be assigned to client work, in which case their time is logged as unassigned hours. Finally, there is also an administrative hours category, which is discussed in more detail below as the measure of OCB.</p>

<sec id="section8-0149206311407508">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were full-time employees holding ranks from entry-level hire through first-line management and for whom billable hours was the primary measure of task performance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0149206311407508">3</xref></sup> They were approximately 30 years old (ranging from 22 to 70 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.20); 45.4% were female. The sample was largely Caucasian (77%). Tenure with the firm averaged 5 years (ranging from 2 to 25 years). The effective sample size for our archival data set was 3,680.</p>

<sec id="section9-0149206311407508">
<title>Study Variables</title>
<sec id="section10-0149206311407508">
<title>Task performance</title>
<p><italic>Task performance</italic> was measured as the hours employees worked on projects directly for clients, because billable hours are the main task of client-serving professionals. These hours were recorded by employees on a weekly basis in an online information system. The total number of task hours per year was transformed into average weekly hours by dividing annual hours by 52 (i.e., the number of work weeks in a year). Billable hours required a specific client code associated with a project; thus, individuals could only bill hours to clients to which they were assigned. These hours were closely monitored by the managing partner on each project to avoid going under or over budget. If a project was projected to go over budget, partners had the option to sell additional hours to the client or to ask the consultant to lower his or her billable hours to meet the budget. However, our discussions with the HR directors assured us that rarely (if ever) were consultants asked to “fudge” their numbers, because partners closely monitored weekly hours against the budget. Further, consultants working on client projects occasionally face unanticipated circumstances that often result in recontracting with the client (i.e., increasing the budgeted billable hours). Thus, we expect that these hours are reliable in terms of employees’ time on task performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0149206311407508">
<title>Organizational citizenship behavior</title>
<p>To establish the measure of OCB, company representatives viewed a list of various citizenship behaviors (e.g., modified items from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206311407508">Podsakoff et al., 1997</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0149206311407508">Williams &amp; Anderson, 1991</xref>) and were asked where employees recorded time spent on each of these behaviors. Examples included mentor other employees, share information that would help a coworker, help a new employee “learn the ropes,” share specialized expertise with a colleague, and attend nonmandatory functions or events. Company representatives stated that all of these types of behaviors are categorized as “administrative” tasks in the online information system. This administrative category, however, also included time dedicated to “required” administrative tasks, such as entering hours on client projects. We were assured by HR and a number of company employees that required administrative hours are very low at all levels, with company estimates of 1 hour per week for nonmanagement employees and 4 hours per week for management employees. Thus, to get a more accurate measure of OCB, we subtracted 1 hour per week for nonmanagement employees and 4 hours per week for management employees to remove time spent on required tasks from our measure of OCB hours. To further establish content validity and to verify that citizenship behaviors would be captured within the administrative hours category, we contacted 35 alumni of the first author’s institution who currently work for the firm. Thirteen individuals responded (37.4% response rate) and were given the same list of citizenship behaviors referred to above. All 13 individuals unanimously reported that time spent on these behaviors is logged within the administrative code, which suggests that after subtracting the minimal time for required administrative activities, the remaining time is spent on various citizenship behaviors. Similar to billable hours, OCB hours were recorded weekly and were transformed from an annual measure into average weekly hours by dividing by 52 weeks.</p>

<title>Outcome Variables</title>
<p>Dependent measures in the study were performance evaluation, salary increase, and two career advancement measures. All dependent measures were obtained from HR records in the fiscal year (FY2004) following the task performance and OCB measures (FY2003) to reflect the proposed direction of causality. As a result, performance evaluation and salary increase occurred approximately 3 months into FY2004 (i.e., a lag of approximately 3 months after task performance and OCB), and career advancement some time thereafter.</p>
<sec id="section13-0149206311407508">
<title>Performance evaluation</title>
<p><italic>Performance</italic> was evaluated by managers on a 1 to 5 scale (1 = <italic>did not meet expectations</italic>, 3 = <italic>fully met expectations</italic>, and 5 = <italic>significantly exceeded expectations</italic>). To assign performance ratings, managers in each division met to discuss each employee’s performance over the previous year relative to all other employees in the same rank and division. Feedback about the employee’s performance was gathered prior to the meeting, and typically, multiple individuals in the meeting would have had direct experience working with the employee on a client project. All performance ratings were decided by consensus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0149206311407508">
<title>Salary increase</title>
<p><italic>Salary increase</italic> is the percentage increase in salary each individual received for the year. Within this firm, salary increases are at the discretion of supervisors, based on a matrix from corporate that provides suggested guidelines for percentage increases at each performance level (e.g., 3, 4, or 5). Each group of supervisors, however, had the authority to distribute their salary increases according to the individuals viewed as most responsible for the year’s revenue and most valuable relative to company needs. Supervisors had a fixed amount of money for salary increases such that giving more of an increase to one employee results in a smaller increase to another employee.</p>

<sec id="section15-0149206311407508">
<title>Career advancement</title>
<p>The career advancement analyses are available only for a subset of the sample (<italic>n</italic> = 2,356) because entry-level employees are subject to an up-or-out system (35% leave within the first 2 years). Entry-level individuals are not included in the career advancement analyses because (assuming good performance) promotion and advancement speed at entry level are based mostly on time in rank. Thus, for the remaining employees at the associate and manager ranks, two measures of career advancement were used: advancement speed and whether or not the employee was promoted. <italic>Advancement speed</italic> was assessed as the number of years employees spent in the associate rank. Thus, for those employees who were promoted to the manager rank, this variable was the total amount of time they spent in the associate rank. For those employees who were not promoted, this variable was their time in the associate rank up to the point of data collection. This variable was reverse coded for ease of interpretation such that positive numbers indicate faster advancement speed (i.e., less time in rank), while negative numbers indicate slower advancement speed (i.e., more time in rank). <italic>Promotion</italic> was dummy coded to indicate whether or not an individual was actually promoted to the manager rank (0 = <italic>not promoted</italic>, 1 = <italic>promoted</italic>). The company reported that the decision of whether or not to promote an individual was based largely on satisfactory performance.</p>

<sec id="section16-0149206311407508">
<title>Control Variables</title>
<p>Several variables were used as controls in the analyses: rank, tenure, rehire status, race, sex, and other timesheet work hour categories. <italic>Rank</italic>, which included three levels of employees (1 = <italic>entry-level hire</italic>, 2 = <italic>associate</italic>, and 3 = <italic>manager</italic>), was controlled for because employees at different levels may allocate their time slightly differently based on various job expectations. <italic>Organizational tenure</italic> is the number of years an employee has been with the firm. We controlled for <italic>rehire status</italic>, whether someone had left the firm and was later rehired (1 = <italic>rehire</italic>, 0 = <italic>original hire</italic>), in the event that this may influence outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206311407508">Brett &amp; Stroh, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206311407508">Furst, Rosen, &amp; Shipp, 2006</xref>). <italic>Sex</italic> and <italic>race</italic> were also controlled for in all analyses and were dummy coded; race was coded as being a member of a minority group or not.</p>
<p>Because individuals recorded other types of weekly hours, these were also used as controls to eliminate alternative explanations for the results. We controlled for <italic>illness hours</italic> and <italic>vacation hours</italic> because they represent time not working. In addition, we also controlled for <italic>unassigned hours</italic>, time that an individual was not assigned to client engagements but had no other active work projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311407508">Evans, Kunda, &amp; Barley, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Means, standard deviations, and correlations among variables are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0149206311407508">Table 1</xref>. On average, employees spent 32.34 hours per week on task performance (i.e., billable hours) and 2.89 hours per week on OCB. Overall, performance was rated highly (<italic>M</italic> = 3.83), with the majority of individuals rated a 3 or above. This is not surprising given that low performers were counseled out early. Average salary increase was 10%. Of the subsample that excluded those at entry-level rank, the average time spent in the associate rank was 4 years, and 71% of this sample was promoted to the manager rank.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0149206311407508">4</xref></sup> Time spent on task performance was positively related to performance evaluation, salary increase, and promotion, suggesting the importance of task performance to career outcomes.

For advancement speed, positive numbers indicate less time in rank (i.e., faster speed). Thus, the correlations show that individuals who spent more time on task performance advanced more quickly, whereas those who spent more time on OCB advanced more slowly.

<p>Hypotheses 1 and 2 predicted that task performance would be a stronger predictor than OCB of subjective performance evaluation but that OCB would still be positively related to performance evaluation. To test these hypotheses, hierarchical regression analyses were conducted with the set of control variables entered in the first step and with task performance and OCB entered in the second step. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0149206311407508">Table 2</xref> (Model 2), task performance and OCB accounted for an additional 4% of the variance beyond the control variables (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). OCB had a positive relationship with subjective performance evaluation (β = .04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), but this relationship was smaller than the relationship between task performance and subjective performance evaluation (β = .21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Thus, Hypotheses 1 and 2 were supported.</p>

These results show that time spent on task performance was related to faster advancement speed, whereas time spent on OCB was related to slower advancement speed.</p>
<p>Finally, because promotion is a dichotomous variable (promoted or not), we used hierarchical logistic regression. The addition of task performance and OCB (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0149206311407508">Table 5</xref>, Model 2) significantly improved the fit of the model (Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 12.49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), indicating that the inclusion of these two types of job performance, beyond the control variables, represented a more complete model (χ<sup>2</sup> = 539.34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Task performance was significantly related to promotion (β = .02, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), whereas OCB was not (β = −.02, <italic>ns</italic>), indicating that task performance had the stronger relationship, although the effect size of task performance was relatively small. The odds ratio indicates that the odds of being promoted to the manager rank increases by a factor of 1.02 for each 1 point increase in task performance.</p>

<p>Taken together, these results provide support for Hypothesis 4, given that task performance was more strongly related to each outcome than was OCB. Hypothesis 5 was partially supported in that OCB was negatively related to salary increase and advancement speed (i.e., longer time to be promoted) but was not related to promotion.</p>

<title>Post Hoc Analyses</title>
<p>Given that most research on outcomes of OCB has focused on subjective performance evaluations, it seemed important to determine whether task performance and OCB had any effect on objective career outcomes (i.e., salary increase, advancement speed, and promotion) <italic>above and beyond</italic> the effect of subjective performance evaluations. For these post hoc analyses, the set of control variables was entered in the first step, performance evaluation was entered in the second step, and task performance and OCB were entered in the third step. Interestingly, although performance evaluation was a strong predictor of salary increase (β = .32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and promotion, Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = 2.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 102.51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, it did not account for any significant variance in advancement speed. With regard to job performance (task performance, OCB) and outcomes, the results of these post hoc analyses were remarkably consistent with the results above, given that the coefficients were of similar magnitude and direction. Even after controlling for the effect of performance evaluation, OCB and task performance explained a significant amount of variance in salary increase (Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .07, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and advancement speed (Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). However, the change in model fit for promotion based on task performance and OCB was nonsignificant after controlling for performance evaluation (Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 3.34, <italic>ns</italic>). We discuss these results in more detail below.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Fifteen years ago, the question was asked, “What other consequences accrue to persons who render much OCB . . . ?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206311407508">Organ &amp; Ryan, 1995</xref>: 797). We attempt to provide some answers to that question by studying the relationships between OCB, task performance, and career outcomes in a professional services firm operating within an outcome-based control system. In doing so, we tested the general ideas that (1) task performance is more important than OCB in an outcome-based control system; (2) OCB may detract from task performance; and (3) because of this trade-off, relationships between OCB and objective career outcomes may be negative within an outcome-based control system. We found support or partial support for each of these ideas. In doing so, we address four limitations of past research that were recently raised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206311407508">Bergeron, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206311407508">Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Paine, &amp; Bachrach, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0149206311407508">Whiting et al., 2008</xref>). First, we examined relationships between OCB and career outcomes in an outcome-based control system. Second, in examining career outcomes, we go beyond subjective performance evaluations and also look at objective outcomes (i.e., salary increase, advancement speed, promotion), thus enabling comparisons among different outcomes. Third, our data are time lagged and not cross-sectional; thus, we have some grounds to reduce concerns about the temporal precedence of OCB prior to outcomes (i.e., career outcome measures are from the year following task performance and OCB measures). Finally, common method variance is not an issue because our independent and dependent measures were derived from different sources.</p>
<p>Several important insights emerged from the pattern of results and suggest that relationships between task performance, OCB, and outcomes may be more complex than previously realized. First, although time spent on task performance and OCB were both positively related to performance evaluations, our findings suggest that task performance is more important than OCB in an outcome-based control system. This is in contrast to past research that shows a much more equal positive weighting of both types of performance with regard to performance evaluations (see the meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206311407508">Podaskoff et al., 2009</xref>). Although previous research has found OCB to be important for performance evaluations, it is much less so in an outcome-based control system. This suggests that time might be better spent on task performance than on OCB in an outcome-based control system.</p>
<p>Second, our results indicate that there is a trade-off between OCB and task performance. Although prior empirical studies have reported significant and positive relationships between task performance and OCB (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206311407508">Barksdale &amp; Werner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206311407508">Griffin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311407508">Turnley et al., 2003</xref>), this may be because past research has focused on effectiveness (i.e., subjective ratings) rather than on objective measures of time spent on each. Time spent on OCB was significantly and negatively related to time spent on task performance. These results are similar to, but stronger than, the negative correlation between OCB and task performance found in MacKenzie et al.’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206311407508">1999</xref>, Study 2) sample of insurance sales managers. Although sales and professional services firm both operate under outcome-based control systems in which resource allocation is important, the trade-off between OCB and task performance is more immediate and apparent in professional services firms because consultants’ time (task performance) is the outcome. When sales is the outcome, the effect of the trade-off is more lagged and attenuated because the trade-off is in terms of behaviors (i.e., task vs. OCB), the result of which manifests as actual sales productivity at a later point in time.</p>
<p>Third, our results indicate that there may be a cost to individuals for engaging in OCB within an outcome-based control system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206311407508">Bergeron, 2007</xref>). Although progress has been made in understanding relationships between task performance, OCB, and career outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206311407508">Kiker &amp; Motowidlo, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206311407508">Orr et al., 1989</xref>), research has not examined boundary conditions to these relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206311407508">Johns, 2006</xref>). In an outcome-based control system, our results showed that task performance was much more important than OCB in determining salary increase and promotion, as time spent on task performance was more strongly and positively related to salary increase, advancement speed, and promotion. In contrast, time spent on OCB was negatively related to salary increase and advancement speed, and it was unrelated to promotion. This is in contrast to much of the existing research showing a positive relationship between OCB and career outcomes. Part of the explanation may be that some of these positive relationships were found in lab studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206311407508">Kiker &amp; Motowidlo, 1999</xref>) rather than field studies, and the few field studies were in behavior-based control systems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206311407508">Allen &amp; Rush, 1998</xref>). Our findings are somewhat similar to the results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206311407508">Van Scotter et al.’s (2000)</xref> field study showing that, although both task performance and OCB each accounted for significant variance in subjective career outcomes, only task performance explained variance in actual promotion within one sample, while OCB did not. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206311407508">Puffer (1987)</xref> found that, within an outcome-based control system, OCB had no relationship to sales, which suggests that OCB provides benefits to the organization rather than financial benefits to the individual. We took this line of thinking one step further and proposed that there may actually be a cost to engaging in OCB. This cost manifested as a lower salary increase as well as in slower advancement speed. Thus, if individuals spend time on OCB in an outcome-based control system, they may experience a negative impact on career outcomes.</p>
<p>Finally, our post hoc analyses suggest that even after controlling for performance evaluation, task performance continues to have a positive relationship with objective career outcomes (salary increase, advancement speed) and OCB continues to have a negative relationship with these outcomes. In these additional analyses, performance evaluation was a strong determinant of promotion but had no relationship to advancement speed. These results are intriguing because, had we included only promotion (and not advancement speed) as an outcome variable, we would have concluded that OCB is important because it contributes to performance evaluations, and performance evaluations are the primary determinant of promotion. In making sense of the findings for the two forms of career advancement, it seems that promotion is essentially a “tournament” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206311407508">Turner, 1960</xref>), that is, a competition among a number of employees for the same position where the most deserving person wins. High performance evaluations are the cost of entry to the tournament. However, once you are in the game, task performance determines who wins the fastest. Thus, performance evaluations may be a “necessary but not sufficient” condition for advancement in outcome-based control systems.</p>
<sec id="section20-0149206311407508">
<title>Limitations and Directions for Future Research</title>
<p>There are a number of limitations that can be addressed in future research. One limitation is with regard to the measure of OCB used. It would have been ideal to have supervisor or peer ratings of OCB in addition to time spent on OCB. One issue with the OCB measure used in this study is that it may underrepresent the amount of time spent on OCB. For example, it is easy to imagine scenarios in which an employee is stopped in the hall and asked for assistance but later does not record the time spent helping. These situations are not captured in our measure and suggest that, if they had been, our results and effect sizes may have been stronger.</p>
<p>A second limitation is with regard to the type of outcomes studied. We studied the relationships between task performance, OCB, and career outcomes in an outcome-based control system. Clearly, the same findings may hold in other fields with billable hours (e.g., law, consulting) or fields such as sales and academe, where quantifiable outcomes such as sales figures and number of publications are available. However, future research should examine these relationships with a broader array of outcomes (e.g., access to social networks) that also may influence objective career success in an outcome-based system. Further, conducting additional research in settings with more variance in the outcome measures may uncover even stronger results of the differential effects of task performance versus OCB.</p>
<p>Finally, although measures of the amount of time spent on task performance and OCB were used, we do not have specific ratings of the effectiveness of either behavior (although the performance evaluation rating can be regarded as a general indicator of effectiveness). Because it was an up-or-out system, we can assume a certain level of proficiency in task performance, but future research should replicate this study with effectiveness ratings of both task performance and OCB in addition to examining the amount of time spent on each.</p>
<p>We highlight two additional directions for future research beyond the ideas discussed above. The first is to investigate the role of <italic>indirect</italic> relationships between OCB and outcomes. That is, even if there are some direct negative relationships between OCB and career outcomes, there also may be indirect positive relationships that outweigh the direct negative impact. For example, if an individual spends time helping others, this may come at a direct cost to his or her task performance. However, those acts of helping may have strengthened interpersonal relationships and earned additional social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206311407508">Bolino, Turnley, &amp; Bloodgood, 2002</xref>). This social capital may provide the individual with greater access to information, resources, or support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206311407508">Burt, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206311407508">Ibarra, 1992</xref>), which are positively related to higher salaries and more promotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206311407508">Seibert, Kraimer, &amp; Liden, 2001</xref>). Although the direct effect of OCB can be somewhat negative, the indirect effect through increasing social capital may be very positive such that there is a net gain over time. Thus, there is a great need to study the direct and indirect relationships between OCB, task performance, and objective and subjective outcomes over a much longer time frame.</p>
<p>Second, more research is needed on the relationship between OCB and outcomes at the group level. One moderator may be the level at which outcomes are assessed. That is, although we found some negative relationships at the individual level within an outcome-based control system, these relationships may be positive when outcomes are rewarded at the group level. For instance, although an OCB such as orienting new employees may result in a short-term cost to the helpful employee’s task performance, this seems more than compensated for by the net gain in group productivity of new employees getting up to speed more quickly. When team members are interdependent and OCB helps work groups be more effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206311407508">Bachrach, Powell, Collins, &amp; Richey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206311407508">Nielsen et al., 2012</xref>), higher levels of OCB should help group productivity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206311407508">George &amp; Bettenhausen, 1990</xref>). If the group’s rewards are based on productivity, individual members should do better in a group-based outcome control system when everyone engages in OCB than they would fare in an individual-level outcome-based control system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0149206311407508">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>Our findings have implications for individuals in outcome-based control systems as well as for organizations. For individuals, our results suggest that there may be a potential “pacification by performance evaluation” effect. Because positive performance evaluations send a signal to employees that they are engaging in the right behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206311407508">Suazo et al., 2009</xref>), employees assume they are on track for career advancement if they continue to spend time on those behaviors. Given that performance evaluations occur much more frequently than other types of outcomes (e.g., promotion), there is a time lag between the two. Thus, it may not be immediately apparent that some factors (i.e., task performance) are more important than others (i.e., OCB) in determining longer term objective career outcomes. Individuals need to discern whether the factors that determine performance evaluations are the same as those that determine other desired outcomes (e.g., compensation, promotion).</p>
<p>Individuals also need to recognize that there may be a cost to OCB in outcome-based control systems and that it is imperative to pay attention to time allocation. Most people do not allocate resources rationally (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0149206311407508">Seshadri &amp; Shapira, 2001</xref>) based on a cost–benefit analysis. This may be especially true in a fast-paced work environment. Small acts of OCB, if engaged in consistently, may accumulate over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206311407508">Becker, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0149206311407508">Merton, 1973</xref>), leading to large disparities in task performance or other career outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206311407508">Allison &amp; Stewart, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0149206311407508">Merton, 1968</xref>). For example, increases in compensation generally are more likely to occur with promotions rather than with continued good performance in the same position (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206311407508">Baker, Jensen, &amp; Murphy, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206311407508">Campbell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206311407508">Gibbs, 1995</xref>). If OCB results in slower career advancement and less compensation as a result, good citizens are likely to have lower lifetime compensation than those who had a series of early promotions. Thus, the magnitude of these effects may be small in any given year, but over time, these effects accumulate to produce very large differences in earnings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206311407508">Abelson, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the trade-off between OCB and task performance, one issue for employees is how this trade-off can be avoided. The obvious response is to work longer hours. This, however, can have other negative consequences, including a cost to one’s personal life (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206311407508">Bolino &amp; Turnley, 2005</xref>). A better strategy may involve being selective in the types of OCB in which one engages. For example, future research could explore whether engaging in less time-consuming forms of OCB, such as sportsmanship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0149206311407508">Organ, 1988</xref>) or voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0149206311407508">Van Dyne &amp; LePine, 1998</xref>), still detracts from task performance and subsequent career outcomes.</p>
<p>For organizations, the challenge is to align the reward system with the employee behaviors that have the most impact on the firm’s long-term success. Research shows that OCB makes work groups and organizations more effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206311407508">Nishii, Lepak, &amp; Schneider, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0149206311407508">Podsakoff &amp; MacKenzie, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0149206311407508">Walz &amp; Niehoff, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0149206311407508">Whitman, Van Rooy, &amp; Viswesvaran, 2010</xref>). By rewarding only short-term task performance, organizations may put their long-term viability at risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206311407508">Felton &amp; Fritz, 2005</xref>). OCB seems especially critical in an outcome-based control system because it can be viewed as a system that actively discourages OCB. An attorney working within an outcome-based control system commented to the first author, “If you spend time on this stuff [OCB], it’s not rewarded. They kind of pat you on the back and say ‘Thanks a lot. Nice job.’ But it doesn’t count for promotions or bonuses.” Relying on the goodwill of employees, especially if there is a personal cost to OCB, is not an effective long-term strategy. This is an important point because recent research suggests that some employees are aware of the cost of OCB and that it may influence their decision of whether or not to engage in these behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206311407508">Joireman, Kamdar, Daniels, &amp; Duell, 2006</xref>). It may also influence whether they choose to leave and join an organization where they are a better fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0149206311407508">Kristof-Brown, Zimmerman, &amp; Johnson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0149206311407508">Schneider, Goldstein, &amp; Smith, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results suggest a paradox: What is good for the organization may not always be good for the employee. Although OCB helps performance evaluations, it may have certain costs in outcome-based control systems. Although this perspective challenges the traditional positive perception of OCB and runs counter to recent meta-analytic findings showing a positive relationship between OCB and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206311407508">Podsakoff et al., 2009</xref>), the idea is not inconsistent with previous research. Rather, it simply identifies that the type of control system may be an important boundary condition in drawing conclusions about the relationship between OCB and career outcomes. It also highlights the fact that the relationship may change depending on whether the outcome under investigation is a subjective performance evaluation or an objective career outcome. Although Claudianus said that virtue is its own reward, given that OCB improves work group and organizational functioning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206311407508">Bachrach et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0149206311407508">Podsakoff &amp; MacKenzie, 1994</xref>), it is important to make sure it does not come at a cost to the good citizen’s career outcomes.</p>

<p>Due to shared variance between organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) and task performance measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0149206311407508">Stone-Romero, Alvarez, &amp; Thompson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0149206311407508">Vey &amp; Campbell, 2004</xref>), studies that include only OCB (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206311407508">Allen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206311407508">Hui, Lam, &amp; Law, 2000</xref>) may inadvertently measure aspects of task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0149206311407508">Vey &amp; Campbell, 2004</xref>). Thus, to avoid potential confounding effects that may have muddied results, we cite only past research that included measures of both types of performance.</p>

<p>For the subsample of employees in the career advancement analyses, it is not surprising that 71% of the sample was promoted. Similar to academe, a high rate of promotion is expected at intermediate ranks (e.g., associate, manager) in an up-or-out system. Promotion rates drop after the manager rank, as some employees become plateaued at the manager or senior manager ranks without ever being promoted to the partner (i.e., “owner”) rank (again, this is similar to academe in that not everyone is promoted to full professor).</p>
