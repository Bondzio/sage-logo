<abstract>
<p>This study examines the impact of a Medicaid-supported intervention (Antenatal and Neonatal Guidelines, Education and Learning System) to expand a high-risk obstetrics consulting service on the use of specialty consults between 2001 and 2006. Using a Medicaid claims-birth certificate data set, we find a decline over time in use of specialty consults for lower risk diagnoses and a shift to remote modalities for contact. Local physician participation in grand rounds via teleconference was associated both with specialty contact and use of remote modalities. Local physician use of a Call Center service was also associated with patient specialty contact. Expansion of telemedicine remote sites did not increase the likelihood of contact but was associated with the shift toward remote modalities. Specialty consult use and modality were influenced by the care context of the patient, particularly level of pregnancy risk, the specialty of the primary prenatal care provider, the timing of her prenatal care, and her ethnicity and education level.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>When income eligibility for pregnant women in Medicaid was expanded through federal mandates in the 1980s, many studies examined whether the availability of insurance coverage improved birth outcomes. The general conclusion was that while expanded Medicaid coverage was associated with earlier starts of prenatal care, expanding coverage per se did not reduce the rates of low birth weight births, preterm births, infant morbidity, or infant mortality, which remain higher for this population than for privately insured individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712458157">Dubay, Joyce, Kaestner, &amp; Kenney, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077558712458157">Howell, 2001</xref>). This is the case because many of the risk factors for these conditions, including preexisting health issues of the mother, African American ethnicity, intendedness of the pregnancy, stress, tobacco exposure, young and older maternal age, and poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712458157">Behrman &amp; Butler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077558712458157">Meis, Ernest, &amp; Moore, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712458157">Mercer et al., 1996</xref>), are more common in the lower socioeconomic population covered by Medicaid programs. A recent review on this topic concluded that when risk factors are taken into account, there are generally no statistically significantly different birth outcomes between Medicaid and non-Medicaid covered populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712458157">Anum, Retchin, &amp; Strauss, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>While Medicaid coverage does not alter pregnancy outcomes, these state programs can be a vehicle for implementing enhanced prenatal care that can potentially improve these outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712458157">Anum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712458157">Baldwin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712458157">Buescher, Roth, Williams, &amp; Goforth, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077558712458157">Keeton, Saunders, &amp; Koltun, 2004</xref>). One aspect of enhanced prenatal care that is particularly relevant to the Medicaid population is access to subspecialty obstetrics care for high-risk pregnancies and to delivery settings that can support the care of preterm infants and others with complications. As measured by the portion of low birth weight infants born in hospitals with neonatal intensive care services, access to such care is often uneven, particularly for women living farther from the location of such care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712458157">Bronstein et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077558712458157">Gould, Sarnoff, Liu, Bell, &amp; Chavez, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077558712458157">Samuelson, Buehler, Norris, &amp; Sadek, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2003, the Maternal Fetal Medicine (MFM) Division of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS), based in Little Rock, with the support of the Arkansas Medicaid Agency and the cooperation of the Arkansas Department of Health and the state Medical Society, launched an intervention called ANGELS (Antenatal and Neonatal Guidelines, Education, and Learning System). This intervention is aimed specifically at increasing access to specialty care services for high-risk pregnancies in the state. The ANGELS program has four components: (a) development of consensus practice guidelines for specific conditions and guidance on use of MFM consultants; (b) weekly telemedicine conferences on obstetric and neonatal topics, open to all Arkansas practitioners; (c) a Call Center located at UAMS supporting consultations for providers and their patients; and (d) enhanced telemedicine communication lines enabling video conferencing and remote consults at increasing numbers of locations around the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077558712458157">Lowery et al., 2007</xref>). Elsewhere we have shown that these program interventions did not increase the overall portion of preterm infants born in neonatology-staffed hospitals, but women residing in counties where physicians participated in the weekly telemedicine conferences were more likely to deliver their preterm infants at UAMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712458157">Bronstein et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This study examines factors associated with the use of Medicaid paid MFM specialty contacts for Medicaid-covered pregnant women in Arkansas between April 2001 and December 2006. For the time period after ANGELS implementation in March 2003, we measure the likelihood and intensity of exposure of the woman and her prenatal care provider to the four ANGELS program components described above. We do so by indicating in the data set, for the 6-month period encompassing each delivery, how many practice guidelines were under consideration and the cumulative number that were finalized, the level of participation in the obstetric and neonatal telemedicine conferences by physicians in the woman’s residential county, whether any patients had called the consulting Call Center from the woman’s residential county, and whether any obstetrics care providers had called the Call Center on behalf of patients in the woman’s residential county. We also assess the impact of a woman’s residential distance to the closest telemedicine site in operation. We assess whether these components of the ANGELS intervention were associated with the likelihood of receiving MFM contact, taking into account and also exploring the impact of maternal demographic characteristics, pregnancy risk factors, prenatal care use, and the specialty of her prenatal care along with selected demographic characteristics of her residential county.</p>
<p>In the Arkansas context, contact with an MFM can take one of three forms: an in-person contact in an office or clinic, a consult from a remote location using telemedicine, or a specialist reading of an ultrasound, done either in a clinic or via telemedicine. It is possible that the four ANGELS interventions had different impacts on these different types of MFM contacts. Here, we also examine whether the program components and characteristics of the individual and the care context affect in-person specialty contacts differently than contacts involving only telemedicine-based care or only ultrasounds.</p>

<title>New Contribution</title>
<p>This study applies an explicit conceptual framework for the provision and completion of specialty referrals to the provision of obstetrics specialty care to a low-income, high-risk pregnant population. We use empirical data to explore this model and also assess the impact of a Medicaid-funded intervention intended to increase access to appropriate referrals for this population.</p>

<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>The likelihood that a woman with a high-risk pregnancy will receive a specialty consult is the consequence of the interaction between her primary provider’s decision to refer her for a consult and her decision to complete the referral. For a primary care provider, the process of involving specialists or subspecialists in the care of a given patient has two components: first, deciding whether to refer and then deciding to whom to refer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558712458157">Anthony, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712458157">Grembowski, Cook, Patrick, &amp; Roussel, 1998</xref>). Deciding to refer is driven in large part by clinical factors and is very dependent on how the primary provider understands the limits of his or her expertise. Obstetrics care is an area of medical practice with some contention concerning the delineation of expertise among primary, specialty, and subspecialty providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712458157">Baldwin, Hart, &amp; Rosenblatt, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558712458157">Cain &amp; Jonsen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077558712458157">Eden, Penka, Britt, Landsberger, &amp; Evans, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077558712458157">Franks &amp; Elsinger, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558712458157">Hueston, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077558712458157">Onion &amp; Mockapetris, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077558712458157">Vintzileos, Ananth, Smulian, Scorza, &amp; Knuppel, 2001</xref>). Other factors that may affect the decision to refer a patient for MFM specialty care include community norms and expectations, institutional arrangements, financial concerns for lost patient volume and revenue, standards set by payers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558712458157">Cain &amp; Jonsen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558712458157">Donohoe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077558712458157">Ludke, 1982</xref>), and expectations or requests by patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712458157">Armstrong, Fry, &amp; Armstrong, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712458157">Langley, MacLellan, Sutherland, &amp; Till, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Deciding to whom to refer has been conceptualized as a way for primary care physicians to develop and maintain professional networks. Within these networks, primary care physicians exchange a flow of referral patients, which specialists need to maintain their practice viability, for expertise which expands their scope of practice on an “as-needed” basis without the physician making a permanent investment in resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558712458157">Gonzalez &amp; Rizzo, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712458157">Grembowski et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077558712458157">Shortell &amp; Anderson, 1971</xref>). Referrals are more likely when this social exchange has a positive net benefit for the referring provider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712458157">Grembowski et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077558712458157">Shortell &amp; Anderson, 1971</xref>). Physician integration into functional referral networks, including having a personal relationship with the other members of the network, increases the likelihood that primary providers will make the decision to refer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077558712458157">Ludke, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077558712458157">Mold &amp; Stein, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077558712458157">Roland &amp; Morris, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Three of the four ANGELS interventions are focused on altering primary care physician perceptions of the circumstances under which MFM referrals during the prenatal period are appropriate, thus clarifying the boundaries of primary provider expertise. Practice guidelines are drafted by MFM specialists and reviewed and approved by community practitioners; they are subject to periodic review. As of March 2012, there were 102 finalized obstetrics guidelines and 56 finalized neonatal guidelines. An overarching obstetric guideline, first published in April 2003, is titled “Suggested Levels of Clinical Care for High-Risk Pregnancy Cases.” This guideline lists 20 medical history conditions, 10 pregnancy risk factors, 6 exam or laboratory findings, and 19 current obstetrical conditions and indicates for each whether they can be managed by the primary provider, whether an MFM consult should be considered, whether a consult is recommended, and whether it is suggested that an MFM comanage or assume care of the patient (these guidelines can be accessed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uams.edu/cdh1/guidelines.aspx">http://www.uams.edu/cdh1/guidelines.aspx</ext-link>). Management of cases and appropriateness of MFM referrals are also the subjects of weekly ANGELS grand rounds, which are available to practitioners around the state through a network of teleconference sites. On a one to one basis, primary providers can discuss cases with MFM specialists by calling the 24-hour ANGELS Call Center. Call Center staff can arrange emergency transport of a patient to UAMS if necessary.</p>
<p>Three of the four ANGELS interventions are intended to lower barriers to contact between MFM specialists and primary maternity providers and to build personal relationships across the provider community. The weekly teleconference grand rounds are designed to familiarize specialists and primary providers with each other and to communicate a sense of mutual respect and cooperation across the provider community. The availability of the Call Center is intended to increase convenience and lower the barriers to accessing MFM expertise. In particular, use of the Call Center to gain advice may substitute for an actual referral of a primary patient to a specialist for care, thus potentially diminishing concerns about lost patients and lost revenue for the referring primary provider. Similarly, the expansion of clinical telemedicine sites increases the potential convenience and speed of receiving an MFM consult for an obstetrics patient, while maintaining distance between the patient and the specialist, again decreasing concerns about losing patients with referrals.</p>
<p>Because this study uses Medicaid claims to document contact with MFM specialists, we are only able to observe those primary physician referrals that are completed by the patient. Patient decisions to complete referrals are influenced by their perceived level of need, along with enabling and predisposing factors such as travel distance and insurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712458157">Eggleston, Coker, Das, Cordray, &amp; Luchok, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077558712458157">Forrest, Shadmi, Nutting, &amp; Starfield, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077558712458157">Blankson and Goldenberg (1994)</xref> reported that a large portion of women referred to a high-risk obstetric specialty clinic did not know the reasons for their referral or did not agree with the perception that they had a health condition that was potentially harmful to their baby. About a quarter of those interviewed did not believe that high-risk medical care could help their condition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558712458157">Campbell, Chez, Queen, Barcelo, and Patron (2000)</xref> reported that missed appointments for specialty obstetrics care averaged 28% in clinics oriented to low-income populations compared with 5% in clinics oriented to privately insured patients. They also found that about half of their interviewees did not believe that their high-risk condition was harmful. Additional barriers to the completion of specialty referrals for high-risk pregnancies include the mobility of low-income patients, difficulties in reaching them via telephone, and the lower priority low-income patients may place on traveling for specialty prenatal care in the context of other more immediate challenges.</p>
<p>In summary, any factors that increase a woman’s perception of pregnancy risk and reduce travel time for consults could increase the likelihood of MFM contact, independent of their impact on physician referral patterns. The expansion of sites for clinical telemedicine consults around the state did reduce travel costs to patients for accessing specialty MFM care. Also, by arrangement with the primary obstetrics providers, some patients are provided with the telephone number of the ANGELS Call Center, and they can contact specialists directly with questions about their pregnancy symptoms during hours when their primary provider cannot be reached.</p>
<p>Based on this conceptual framework, we hypothesize that the increase in established practice guidelines will increase the likelihood of MFM contact for cases identified in the Levels of Care document as appropriate for referral, while decreasing referrals for cases identified as appropriate for local management because of their effect on clarifying boundaries of expertise. We hypothesize that exposure of local physicians to ANGELS teleconference rounds will increase the likelihood of MFM contacts for appropriate conditions because of their role in establishing relationships between referring and specialty physicians. While physician use of the Call Center also builds relationships, we hypothesize that the likelihood of MFM contact will decline with more exposure because the calls may substitute for patient referrals. On the other hand, we hypothesize that patient use of the Call Center will be associated with increased likelihood of MFM contact because referral completions will be enhanced if patients have a clearer understanding of their pregnancy risks. Finally, we hypothesize that the expansion of clinical telemedicine sites will be associated with an increased likelihood of MFM contact because expansion lowers the costs of such contact for both primary providers and patients. We anticipate that all these factors will have more of an impact on contacts made via telemedicine than on in-person contacts because these newer modes of contact will be less influenced by established referral patterns.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section5-1077558712458157">
<title>Data Sources and Variable Selection</title>
<p>The primary data source for this study is a set of Medicaid claims for pregnancy linked to birth certificates for women covered by Medicaid in Arkansas who delivered infants between April 2001 and December 2006. The matching process is described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077558712458157">Bronstein et al., 2009</xref>). Clustering claims into pregnancy episodes by date in association with the infant’s birth date recorded on the birth certificate, we identified a total of 108,703 pregnancies yielding 110,892 live births. These included Medicaid-covered births to Arkansas residents that occurred in surrounding states. Pregnancies in this population were considered to include an MFM specialist visit if a paid claim for an ambulatory visit, an ultrasound, or a telemedicine service from an MFM provider was present in the episode of care. Women were categorized as receiving in-person care if they had any paid claims for an ambulatory MFM visit, whether or not they also had an ultrasound or a telemedicine service from an MFM. The remaining women who had only ultrasounds or telemedicine services were categorized as receiving remote specialty care.</p>
<p>The Levels of Clinical Care guideline developed in the course of the ANGELS program identified 16 clinical conditions where comanagement or transfer to an MFM specialist is recommended and 23 conditions where consults are recommended. We used a combination of diagnoses from medical claims data and flags for maternal conditions on birth certificate data to code 20 of these 39 conditions, and we indicated their presence as a comanagement or consulting risk condition on the records for the pregnant women. The remaining 19 conditions could not be coded from available administrative data. Details of the coding procedure are reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077558712458157">Wingate, Bronstein, Hall, &amp; Lowery, 2012</xref>). These risk factors are termed <italic>targeted conditions</italic> in this study.</p>
<p>Additional demographic data on the pregnant women derived from the matched vital records data were also included. We distinguished three categories of marital status: married, unmarried but with a father identified on the birth certificate, and unmarried without a father identified on the birth certificate, because father identification has been linked to birth outcomes in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077558712458157">Gaudino, Jenkins, &amp; Rochat, 1999</xref>). County of residence for pregnant women in the data set was ascertained based on the zip code of residence recorded on Medicaid claims. Where there were multiple zip codes recorded, the zip code recorded on the claim closest by date to the delivery was used. Demographic data for the county of residence in the calendar year of the delivery was drawn from the Area Resource File.</p>
<p>We used prenatal care claims for pregnancies in the data set to identify medical specialties for the primary prenatal care provider, defined as the maternity service provider who billed for the majority of a woman’s prenatal care visits. Providers who billed for a global prenatal care and delivery service were counted as providing seven prenatal care visits. We indicated if women saw health department providers in addition to private providers, because in several Arkansas counties women covered by Medicaid use prenatal care at health department clinics until their third trimester, when they transfer to the care of a private provider for delivery services. Women who saw health department providers and no other private providers for at least two visits were designated as having prenatal care providers at the health department only. Women who had fewer than two visits from the same prenatal care provider were counted as having “inconsistent” prenatal care. Where the billing claims did not include enough information to identify the prenatal care provider, we flagged the pregnancy as having an unidentified provider. To adjust for the convenience of women accessing specialty care services, we included on each record the distance in miles (estimated as the straight line distance from the centroid longitude and latitude of the zip code pair) from a woman’s residence to the UAMS in Little Rock, which is the primary resource for MFM specialists in the state.</p>
<p>We included six measures of exposure to ANGELS program activity in the time period of the pregnancy. For the 6-month period (January to June or July to December) that included the delivery, we counted the number of completed obstetrics and neonatal practice guidelines and the number in preparation and flagged the occurrence of any physician calls and any patient calls to the ANGELS Call Center from the woman’s residence county. We flagged any participation in ANGELS obstetrics teleconferences at the hospitals in the residential county in the year of delivery. Finally, we measured the straight line distance from the woman’s residential zip code to the zip code of the closest clinical telemedicine facility, expressed in 10 mile units. To control for other factors related to the time trend, we included a dummy variable for cumulative quarters elapsed between April 1, 2001, and the infant delivery date.</p>
<p>This study was approved by institutional review boards at UAMS and the University of Alabama at Birmingham.</p>

<sec id="section6-1077558712458157">
<title>Statistical Approaches</title>
<p>We modeled both whether women had any MFM contact and whether women had only remote versus any in-person contact, conditional on having an MFM contact, as logistic regressions. We adjusted for the clustering of women within specific prenatal care providers or within the category of “inconsistent” for the women with multiple care providers. The requirement to specify a prenatal care provider reduced the sample size to 84,990 episodes of pregnancy.</p>
<p>We used logistic regression analysis with standard error adjustment for clustering (SAS Proc Survey Logistic) to examine the relationship between the individual- and county-level factors and the likelihood of any type of MFM contact. We estimated two models, one for pregnancies with a diagnosis for a condition that had been identified in the ANGELS Level of Care document as recommended for MFM consult or recommended for MFM comanagement (targeted conditions) and one for pregnancies without such diagnoses.</p>
<p>We estimated a second set of logistic regression models to assess, among cases where there was MFM contact, whether or not the set of contacts included an in-person visit. Those which did not include an in-person visit could have been conducted entirely by telemedicine. These models were also estimated separately by targeted and nontargeted conditions and adjusted for clustering by provider.</p>
<p>It is possible that some of the MFM contacts identified through billing data were actually services provided by university-affiliated providers during routine prenatal care visits. To test for any bias introduced by including these visits as MFM contacts when they may not have actually been consults for specialty care, we reestimated the models for any MFM contact excluding Pulaski County, where UAMS is located. To test for any bias introduced by excluding cases where the prenatal care provider was unknown, we reestimated the models for MFM contact clustering all unknown prenatal care providers as “unknown.” The results of these sensitivity estimates are reported in the Limitations section.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>The demographic characteristics of the Medicaid population changed between 2001 and 2006 due to two changes in the state’s eligibility criteria: (a) the income threshold for eligibility for pregnant women was increased from 133% to 200% of the federal poverty level and (b) women without documented citizenship were accepted into the program under a modification of the state’s Children’s Health Insurance Program. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558712458157">Table 1</xref> shows, the portion of Hispanic women, women aged 25 to 34 years, and women with some college education in the Medicaid population increased over this period, while the portion of women under age 24 years and unmarried women without fathers identified on the birth certificate decreased. The distribution of women across prenatal care providers also changed over time. By 2006, fewer women were receiving inconsistent care from several different provider types and from family and general physicians. More women were receiving a combination of care from obstetricians and gynecologists (OB-Gyns) or family and general physicians combined with the public health department. Over the time period, more counties reported having high-risk obstetrics available at their local hospitals, and the covered population was more likely to reside in rural rather than urban areas. Exposure to ANGELS program activity began and increased over the time period. In particular, women in the Medicaid population in 2001 lived 88 miles, on average, from a clinical telemedicine facility. In 2006, covered population lived 26 miles, on average, from such a facility.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077558712458157">Table 3</xref> shows the results of the multivariate analysis of factors associated with any MFM contact for women with and without diagnoses targeted for referral. Examining exposure to the program measures first, we find, as hypothesized, that local physician participation in weekly teleconferences is associated with a greater likelihood that women with targeted conditions will have MFM contact. However, proximity to a clinical telemedicine site was associated with a lower likelihood of contact. Physician use of the Call Center did not substitute for patient referral but instead was associated with an increase in the likelihood of patient referral for consult services. Neither the availability of more practice guidelines nor patient calls to the Call Center were associated with MFM contact.</p>

<p>MFM contact was also associated with specialty of prenatal care provider and level of pregnancy risk. Women with inconsistent providers and those with health departments as prenatal providers (with or without additional physician care) were more likely to have MFM contact than those receiving prenatal care from either specialty of physicians. MFM contact was least likely for women with physician prenatal care providers and nontargeted diagnoses. Similarly, women with diagnoses targeted for referral who lived in counties where the hospitals reported offering high-risk obstetrics were less likely to have MFM contact than those living in counties without such local expertise. Primiparous women, women who delivered before term (i.e., with lower gestational ages at birth), and those pregnant with multiples were more likely to have MFM contact. MFM contact was more likely for women who started prenatal care in the first trimester.</p>
<p>Taking provider specialty and level of pregnancy risk into account, Hispanic women and women between the ages of 18 and 24 years were less likely to have MFM contact. Women were less likely to have MFM contact if they lived in counties with higher poverty rates, but more likely if they lived closer to UAMS. Among women with diagnoses targeted for referral, there was no difference in the likelihood of MFM contact between Black and White women, but among women without targeted diagnoses, Black women were more likely to have MFM contact. Also among women with targeted diagnoses, those who were unmarried and had no identified father on the birth certificate were more likely to have an MFM contact.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077558712458157">Table 4</xref> shows the results of the multivariate analysis of factors associated with receiving remote only rather than in-person contact, among women with any MFM contact, for those with and without diagnoses targeted for referral. Examining exposure to program measures first, we find, as hypothesized, that women living closer to clinical telemedicine facilities were more likely to have remote contact, as were women living in counties where physicians participated in weekly teleconferences. For women without diagnoses targeted for referral, patient calls to the Call Center were associated with a greater likelihood of remote rather than in-person contact, but local physician calls to the Call Center were associated with a lower likelihood of remote as opposed to in-person contact. When all other factors are taken into account, only this group showed a statistically significant time trend, indicating that remote contact actually was less likely over time for women without diagnoses targeted for referral.</p>

<p>Specialty of the prenatal care provider was associated with use of remote rather than in-person contact, but in this case, women with prenatal care provided by OB-Gyns were more likely to have remote consults than women with other provider types. Women living in counties with hospitals reporting high-risk obstetrics were less likely to have remote MFM contacts. Primiparous women and women who went on to deliver preterm were less likely to have remote contacts, but women with multiple pregnancies were equally likely to have remote or in-person contacts. The timing of prenatal care start was also not associated with having remote or in-person contacts.</p>
<p>Taking these factors into account, among women with diagnoses targeted for referral, Black women, less educated women, and unmarried women with identified fathers were all less likely to have remote as opposed to in-person contacts. Those without diagnoses targeted for referral were less likely to have remote referrals if they lived in a county with a larger Black population. Women in both categories were less likely to have remote contact the closer they lived to UAMS.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There is wide documentation of barriers to access to specialty care for individuals covered by Medicaid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558712458157">Cook et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077558712458157">Skinner &amp; Mayer, 2007</xref>). Often, the issue is that specialty physicians refuse to accept or limit the number of patients they accept for consults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558712458157">Bisgaier &amp; Rhodes, 2011</xref>). In the case reviewed here, however, MFM specialists were willing to see high-risk pregnant women covered by Medicaid for consults and created a set of interventions to encourage referrals from primary prenatal care providers by clarifying the boundaries of expertise between specialists and primary providers, strengthening relationships and making consults more convenient.</p>
<p>We did not in fact observe an overall increase in the number of women receiving contact with MFMs but did observe a decline in contacts for diagnoses that fell outside the set recommended for specialty care in the ANGELS consensus practice guidelines. This may have occurred coincident to the increased involvement of OB-Gyns (alone and in combination with health departments) as prenatal care providers and the increased availability of local high-risk prenatal care, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077558712458157">Table 2</xref>. OB-Gyns were less likely to refer than other providers, probably because they themselves have a broader scope of expertise. In addition, the fact that contact for nontargeted rather than for all conditions declined suggests that the ANGELS practice guidelines shifted the boundaries of expertise between primary and specialty providers, more in the direction of expanding the scope of practice of primary providers rather than encouraging referral to specialty providers. Women whose residential county providers participated in weekly teleconferences and used a Call Center to contact the MFMs were more likely to have contact, reinforcing observations made in the literature that stronger personal relationships among referring and referral providers increase the likelihood of referrals. However, neither use of the Call Center by pregnant women nor the establishment of remote clinical telemedicine sites altered the likelihood of a completed MFM referral. It seems likely that the primary predictors of the likelihood that women will complete a specialty referral are not measured in these data.</p>
<p>The occurrence of a referral was strongly influenced by the specialty of women’s prenatal care providers, the availability of specialty expertise in their residential locale, and the promptness of the start of their prenatal care, as well as clinical conditions associated with level of pregnancy risk. Some demographic characteristics were also associated with a greater (being unmarried without a father identified on the birth certificate) or lesser (being age 18-24, Hispanic ethnicity, and living in a high-poverty area) likelihood of MFM contact, either because prenatal care providers were more or less likely to refer these women or because they had greater or lesser difficulty completing the referral. As discussed in the Limitations section below, some of the associations between demographic characteristics and MFM contacts were sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of Pulaski county residents, and it may represent characteristics of women living locally who were seen by MFM specialists rather than factors associated with MFM referrals across the state.</p>
<p>The use of remote as opposed to in-person contact increased over the time period reviewed. Closer proximity to clinical telemedicine sites, more participation by local physicians in teleconferenced rounds, and direct access to the MFM Call Center by patients were associated with a greater likelihood of use of remote care. Women with OB-Gyn prenatal care providers were more likely to use remote modalities for MFM contact than were women with other types of providers. Remote contact was less common for women with indications of higher risk pregnancies and was also less common, within the group of women with diagnoses targeted for referral, for Black women, women with less education, and unmarried women with fathers identified on birth certificates. Thus, although the increased availability of remote modalities for MFM contact did not increase the overall likelihood of this contact, it did help to shift the distribution of contacts so that lower-risk women with OB-Gyn prenatal care providers were less likely to travel for in-person specialty consults.</p>

<sec id="section9-1077558712458157">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>An important limitation of this claims-based study is that we have no record of all the women for whom referrals were made for specialty care. We only have information on whether or not they completed a specialty visit. It is thus not possible to distinguish between factors affecting whether the primary provider made a referral and those affecting whether the patient completed the referral. Since we also do not have a complete record of all the conditions actually affecting the women during the pregnancy, we cannot judge here whether local care providers are making all appropriate referrals or the extent to which patient failure to complete a referral exacerbates her pregnancy risk. In particular, some of the conditions targeted for referral in the ANGELS guidelines could not be coded with claims data, and they are represented here in the pool of nontargeted conditions, along with less serious conditions that are not recommended for referral. Another limitation of the claims-based study is that it is possible some telemedicine consults were billed simply as consults, without the telemedicine designation. We checked telemedicine logs to verify the modality of consults and hand corrected any claims we found that did not have the telemedicine designation, but some errors in designation may have remained in the claims data.</p>
<p>As noted above, it is possible that some ambulatory visits to MFM physicians counted here as specialty contacts were actually part of routine care, if academic-affiliated physicians filed claims in connection with rotations at prenatal care clinics in the Little Rock area. To test whether inclusion of such contacts biased our findings, we repeated the multivariate analysis of MFM contact, excluding women who resided in Pulaski County, where Little Rock is located. We found no difference in the extent and statistical significance of the association between the ANGELS program measures and MFM contact for women with or without diagnoses targeted for referral. Excluding Pulaski County, we did see an association between higher education levels and likelihood of an MFM contact for a targeted condition but did not see an association between being primiparous and contact or marital status and contact, and we did not see a greater likelihood of Black women without targeted conditions to receive MFM contact. Excluding residents of Pulaski County, women with targeted conditions receiving prenatal care from family or general physicians only were less likely than women receiving prenatal care from OB-Gyns to have MFM contact. These findings suggest that Black, primiparous, and unmarried women with no fathers identified on birth certificates, and those receiving care from family and general physicians, were likely to receive care from academic MFMs if they lived in Pulaski County, but not if they lived elsewhere in the state. The findings also suggest that, elsewhere in the state, among women with conditions targeted for referral, those with more education are more likely to have MFM contact.</p>
<p>Also as noted above, we excluded about 20% of our entire study population because we were unable to identify their prenatal care providers in claims data. We conducted the multivariate analyses of MFM contact using the entire study population and grouping these cases as “provider unknown.” There were no differences in association between the ANGELS program measures and MFM contact with inclusion of these records.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>State Medicaid programs cover an increasingly large portion of infant deliveries across the states in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077558712458157">Kaiser Family Foundation, 2011</xref>), including a significant portion of high-risk deliveries. While Medicaid coverage per se is not likely to reduce the risk level of these pregnancies or improve outcomes, features of the program can be used to direct women toward enhanced prenatal care tailored to the challenges they face in their pregnancies. Here, we have examined an enhancement added to care for pregnant women covered by Medicaid in Arkansas, the ANGELS intervention, which is intended to increase access to MFM specialty care to high-risk women. Use of these specialty contacts remains relatively low overall, at about 25% of the women with targeted conditions, but increased opportunities for interaction between primary providers and these specialists increased the likelihood of patient specialty contact. Expanded availability of telemedicine sites helped shift MFM contact toward remote as opposed to in-person interactions. The impact of the ANGELS intervention on use of MFM specialty care was clearly mediated by the availability of local expertise for pregnant women. Use of MFM specialty consults varied by the specialty of women’s prenatal care provider and the availability of high-risk obstetrics care in local counties. This reinforces the significance of perceived boundaries of primary care expertise on the referral process. Use of specialty care was also influenced by some of the women’s characteristics, including education, age, Hispanic ethnicity, and poverty level, indicating the importance of predisposing and enabling features of women’s lives in supporting or inhibiting their use of specialty care.</p>
