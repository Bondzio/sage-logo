<p>Historically, all animals had been fasted prior to blood and urine collections for toxicology studies. Because of the mouse’s propensity to not drink if not fed, this often resulted in varying degrees of dehydration and low blood and urine volumes. Thus, fasting was abandoned for mice with resultant dramatic improvements in obtainable blood volumes with no detrimental interpretive effect on other hematology or clinical chemistry parameters. However, the usable volume and quality of urine samples remained a quality issue. Urine samples in the past and until recently were collected via dripping into an open container positioned below the cage allowing for considerable evaporation. In spite of mesh filters over the outflow collection tube, urine samples tended to be flocculent with varying amounts of diet debris contamination. We have developed a method by which a gelatinous form of food is offered to mice during urine collection to eliminate the contamination issues and the physical collection device has been modified to mitigate the potential for evaporation. Two internal studies were conducted using the newly created protocol for urine collection in mice. These studies demonstrated clear advantages of this procedure over the previous protocol for collecting urine from mice. The number of samples that met the minimum volume requirements for analysis using the Clinitek Atlas<sup>®</sup> Automated Urine Chemistry Analyzer were increased by 56%. In addition, the quality of the urine was also enhanced as evidenced by the analysis of the data produced by the Clinitek Atlas<sup>®</sup> and the drastic reduction of foreign sediments in the microscopic evaluation. There were no physiological or toxicologically meaningful differences relative to the different diets that would affect interpretation of hematology or clinical chemistry results. MPI Research has adopted this as our standard protocol for urine collection in mice.</p>

<p>Dried blood spot (DBS) sample collection has many advantages compared with traditional sampling techniques. Here we describe pharmacokinetic evaluation of a single dose of diltiazem (DTZ) comparing use of a novel automated DBS technique to manually spotted DBS, and traditional plasma samples, all collected using the Culex<sup>®</sup> Automated Blood Sampling system (ABS). One group of 8 male rats was prepared with intra-arterial catheters in both femoral and carotid arteries externalized for connection to the ABS. The rats were administered DTZ by oral gavage, at a dose of 20 mg/kg. Blood samples were collected at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours post dose. The ABS was successfully used to robotically collect whole blood samples in the DBS format in support of a rat pharmacokinetic study. Exposure profiles were similar when measured in plasma, ABS-spotted DBS, or manually pipetted DBS. Differences in the mean AUC<sub>0-8</sub> and C<sub>MAX</sub> between manually and Culex collected DBS were &lt;14.0%. Lowest AUC<sub>0-8</sub> and C<sub>MAX</sub> variability was observed with automated DBS (39.0 / 40.0% CV respectively). Blood collected before and after the sampling schedule indicated some decrease in red cell mass from the intensive bleeding schedule, but post-study results remained within the laboratory reference range (RBC) or slightly lower (Hgb and HCT). Manually-spotted DBS were more variable in size, shape and appearance than automated DBS. Labor required for manual spotting, and for traditional plasma processing, was greater than for automated DBS. Sample shipment was easier and less costly for DBS cards vs. frozen plasma.</p>

<p>The Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability (BCOP) assay uses excised bovine corneas obtained from cattle slaughtered for food use. Consequently, the age of the cattle is generally not provided with the corneas. This introduces a variable at the start of the assay, which can be reduced by using eyes from cattle at a defined age. The OECD guidelines for the testing of Chemicals No. 437 recommends the use of eyes from cattle 6 to 12 months of age but encourages investigators to report the estimated age and/or weight of the animals providing the corneas. In a commercial operation, capable of killing large numbers of cattle to provide suitable numbers of eyes, it may not be possible to determine age and weight since animals are received from a number of suppliers. Additionally, random-source animals typically have not been raised in constant environment and are subject to numerous environmental variables. This study looked at the effect of the cattle’s age on the BCOP assay. The calf eyes used in this study were obtained from a well-managed barn-raised herd, which had weekly veterinary monitoring and controlled feed and medication. In this study we compared the In Vitro Scores (IVS) from random source cattle corneas with those of corneas from a well-managed calf herd of 4 to 5 months of age. Thirty over the counter cleaners, hair dyes, hair sprays, deodorants and moisturizers, which had IVS scores obtained from random-age animals were used in the evaluation. The IVS scores from the random aged animals ranged from -0.62 to 111.58. The IVS scores from age-defined calf eye corneas ranged from −1.11 to 22.86.</p>

<p>To reduce the number of animals for safety screening of potential irritating chemicals and phototoxins, efforts have been made to develop more predictive in vitro assays. One model in more common use is reconstituted human epidermis (MatTek Epiderm) resembling in vivo human skin. In this investigation, these human skin models were exposed to a known skin irritant, 8-methoxypsoralen (8MOP), at a dose comparable to the EC10. The samples were also either kept in the dark or exposed to solar simulated light (SSL). Gene activity was analyzed with mRNA microarrays at 1, 6, and 20 hr to determine potential cellular and molecular mechanisms of action. Two levels of biological control samples were used: a) samples not treated with 8MOP and kept in the dark or exposed to UV light and b) samples treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) [positive control]. Purified, labeled, and fractionated cRNA isolated from each of the biological samples were hybridized onto whole human genome mRNA expression microarrays, each containing 41,000 unique probes. Data analysis was done by a tiered approach. Coefficients of variation (CV) from all the probes passing quality measures or a total of 11,335 probes for each biological sample within the treatment groups ranged from 18.5-33.1%. The least variability was observed with the principal components analysis (PCA) for the negative control samples (those not exposed to 8MOP) and the samples exposed to 8MOP under dark conditions. The most activity was seen with 8MOP and SSL exposures at 6 and 20 hr as well as exposures to SDS, the positive control. Several genes in common between treatments with SDS and 8MOP were CXCL14, fibrillin2, tropomyosin alpha 1, CYP26B1, HSP70B AND VEGF-A. Funding was provided by NIEHS Grant No. 5-R44-ES-11927-02.</p>

<title>P104 Vehicle-Dependent Effects on Hexylcinnamaldehyde Responses in the LLNA</title>

<p>Hexylcinnamaldehyde (HCA) is the default, preferred positive control substance in the Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA), due to its moderately potent dermal sensitizing properties. We have tested the effects of use of varying vehicle solvents for HCA on the endpoints of Stimulation Index (SI), lymphotype subsets (immunophenotyping; IP), and irritation as measured by ear swelling. Herein, we show that the choice of vehicle does biologically and statistically significantly (P &gt; 0.05) impact the HCA endpoint values, most importantly, the SI. HCA at 25% was evaluated in all vehicles (AOO, DMSO, Acetone, Ethanol and DAE433, petrolatum, PG, etc.), and compared to naïve or untreated controls, as appropriate. Most importantly, some vehicles (besides the default AOO) that are commonly used were more prone to causing or enhancing irritation induced by vehicle-alone treatment, or either decreased or increased SI values and variability when compared to AOO. Generally, DAE433 was a ‘better’ vehicle than DMSO alone, resulting in lower background proliferation and less irritation (ear swelling Day 1 through Day 6). Petrolatum gave good results as a vehicle for 25% HCA with an SI = 10.3, comparable to AOO SI = 9.8 and DMF SI = 9.9. Acetone and PEG had significantly higher SI values and B: T cell ratios than DMSO and AOO. DMSO and DMA had the lowest SI values for 25% HCA, at 7.8 and 5.8, respectively. In addition, DMSO was significantly irritating to the ears of mice as a vehicle, and caused very pronounced ear swelling when used as a vehicle for HCA ( &gt; 15% increase). In conclusion, the vehicle chosen for the LLNA can significantly affect multiple endpoints of interest in the assay, especially the Stimulation Index, and that this variability should be taken into account when testing similar or borderline test substances in vehicles other than AOO.</p>

<p>The Local Lymph Node assay (LLNA) is known to be susceptible to false-positives caused by irritating test substances. We have incorporated ear thickness measurements on Days 1, 3 and 6 of the LLNA in order to measure dermal irritation-induced ear swelling. Known LLNA false-positive irritants SLS and BAC caused increases in ear swelling on Day 6 (when compared to Day 1) of 25% or greater (&gt;1.25-fold). In addition, the default positive control Hexylcinnamaldehyde (HCA) has irritation potential, which was confirmed at concentrations above 10% HCA. Interestingly, all common LLNA vehicles (Acetone: Olive Oil 4:1(AOO), Acetone, Ethanol, Dimethylacetamide: Acetone: Ethanol 4:3:3 (DAE433), etc.) did not affect ear swelling through Day 6, with the notable exception of Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). DMSO-treated mouse ear swelling was increased over 15% during the six-day experimental term. This implicates DMSO as moderately irritating and possibly a problematic vehicle for the LLNA.</p>

<p>Using a series of non-animals assays in a tiered approach, the Replacement Ocular Battery (ROBatt) accurately predicts the categories of acute ocular irritation corresponding to OECD, EPA and GHS guidelines. At present, no single alternative assay has been accepted by regulatory agencies to completely replace the use of live animals. The BCOP (Bovine Cornea Opacity/Permeability) test has been accepted by OECD as a screen for severe and corrosive materials. The Cytosensor Microphysiometer has been accepted for sub-severe testing but it applicable for aqueous-based materials. The ROBatt approach uses a series of two to three non-animal assays to categorize both aqueous and non-aqueous materials. An NIH/FDA Grant has been awarded to develop the ROBatt decision tree criteria. Initially screening will use the Chorioallantoic Membrane Vascular Assay (CAMVA) to discriminate slight or non-irritants from moderate to severe irritants. Slight or non-irritating materials will be categorized using the Porcine Cornea Confocal Assay (PorFocal). The Bovine Cornea Opacity/Permeability test (BCOP) will be used for discriminating between moderate and severe to corrosive materials and the Porcine Cornea Opacity Reversibility Assay (PorCORA) will be used to categorize severe irritants and corrosives. Fifty validation chemicals from the ECETOC database of ocular irritation will be initially used. Having performed over 6,700 CAMVA, 5,700 BCOPs, and nearly 100 PorCORA assays, the researchers are confident of the ability to complete categorize any material to international standards.</p>

<p>Total blood volumes in animals, especially rodents, present a practical limitation when sampling blood over a 24 hour period to obtain toxicokinetic data. This limitation can increase the numbers of rats or mice used on a study and/or limit the number of samples collected per animal. Microsampling strategies (e.g., dried bloodspots) are one way to overcome this limitation and have become more common in recent years due to the increased pressure on the pharmaceutical industry to reduce animal use and costs. Reducing the volume of blood collected at each time point can have a positive impact by decreasing the number of animals used on a study and allowing for more robust serial sampling in an individual animal. Plasma microsampling (∼75 μL of blood per time point) significantly decreases the amount of blood (∼70%) collected per time point for toxicokinetic analysis. Using EDTA coated capillary tubes with a thixotropic agent, it is possible to decrease the volume of blood collected for plasma exposure analysis. The current study compared data collected in male rats (n = 8) after a single 600 mg/kg dose of acetaminophen using a plasma microsampling method and a standardized plasma collection method (250 μL of blood per time point). Drug exposure at 4 separate time points (1, 2, 5, and 8 hours) were compared and found to be within 8% overall and within 5% for the majority of samples (23 of 32). Mean AUC and C<sub>max</sub> values were within 1% of each other using the 2 different collection methods with individual AUC or C<sub>max</sub> values within 5% or 6% of each other, respectively.</p>

<p>The current OECD Test Guideline for the conduct of the Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA) recommends the use of only female mice for the assessment of skin sensitization potential for a given chemical. The NIH publication no. 99-4494 recommends that only female CBA mice be used, as they reportedly develop a stronger contact dermatitis response when compared to males. Males were also reported to display a larger variation in response due to a greater tendency to fight and to be involved in ‘social ranking’ behavior when group housed. However, there are several advantages to consider with the inclusion of male mice in LLNA testing including a more refined and responsible use of animals from supplier breeding programmes. The NIH publication highlights that if males are to be considered, systematic studies evaluating potential sex differences should be conducted. Therefore, to begin to systematically assess the appropriateness of using male mice in the LLNA a comparative guideline study was conducted with individually housed mice using the well known sensitizer, α-Hexylcinnamaldehyde (HCA). The study compared 5 male and 5 female CBA/J mice/group, at three test material concentrations (3%, 10% and 30% (w/v) HCA), with 1% aqueous (v/v) pluronic L92 surfactant as the vehicle. Stimulation indices (SI) for the three HCA treatment groups were 3.75, 5.59 and 12.50 for male and 2.19, 4.05 and 7.37 for females, respectively. The results revealed no significant difference between samples means or variability between the sexes and the SI values observed for both male and female mice were within the range of historical control data for female mice. EC3 value for male could not be calculated; however EC3 value for female (6.05%) was in range of reported value (4.9 to 15%) in guideline. These data provide initial support for the use of male mice in the LLNA and will be followed by further experimentation with a variety of chemicals to systematically evaluate potential for sex differences in an effort to support the use of male mice in the LLNA as a further assay refinement.</p>

<p>
<bold>Background</bold>: Hospira has developed a stable one-vial presentation of docetaxel, a cytotoxic anti-mitotic drug. Docetaxel has very low water solubility, and its delivery in the infusion solution is achieved by micelle formation in polysorbate 80 (PS80). Hospira Docetaxel contains the same amount of PS80 as the innovator, with additional excipients to permit a stable, ready-to-dilute product. <bold>Aim</bold>: A preclinical program was designed to confirm that the changes in the excipients would not alter the in vivo pharmacology of docetaxel. <bold>Methods and Results</bold>: All studies compared Hospira Docetaxel with a then marketed product and all methods were validated. Some studies were GLP. The drug released from micelles in the infusion solution was similar. At clinically relevant plasma concentrations (0.2 to 2.0 mcg/mL), protein binding by equilibrium dialysis was similar in dog and human plasma. The immunogenic potential was also equivalent, as measured by complement terminal complex (SC5b-9) formation in 10 human serum samples. A cross-over pharmacokinetic study was performed in 10 male Beagle dogs at 1 mg/kg. Where neutropenia was noted, all animals had recovered prior to the second dose. Docetaxel was quantitated by a validated LC/MS/MS method, and plasma protein binding was determined using equilibrium dialysis. Pharmacokinetics of total and unbound docetaxel were equivalent between the two products. <bold>Conclusion</bold>: These preclinical studies formed the basis of assuring that the in vivo pharmacology of a non-aqueous formulation of docetaxel was comparable to a then marketed product. Hospira Docetaxel has been granted marketing approval in many countries.</p>

<p>Miniature swine are a recognized predictive model for human drug candidate dermato-pharmacology studies. Tape stripping is a simple and effective method for removing the stratum corneum (SC) and is commonly employed during <italic>in vivo</italic> studies investigating the percutaneous penetration and disposition of topically applied candidate drugs. The objective of this study was to assess the remaining thickness of the SC following 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 repetitions of tape stripping of skin. Animals were young adult, male Yucatan miniature swine weighing 33-36 kg (N = 3). Animals were maintained under general anesthesia for the entire duration of the procedures. Following clipping of the pelage over the dorsal lumbar and thoracic areas, 6 sites, approximately 5 cm by 5 cm, were demarcated and skin was stripped using U-Line 1.8 mm clear acrylic adhesive tape applied with uniform, firm pressure. Following tape applications, the center of the each test area was punch biopsied (8 mm) and samples fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Samples were processed, stained by H&amp;E, and read under light microscopy. The results showed an inverse pattern to the number of tape stripping repetitions. Fifty passes were required to remove nearly all SC. These data demonstrate that skin can be stripped of SC in a linear fashion based upon repetition of the technique.</p>

<title>P112 Guidance on the Derivation of Acceptable Daily Exposure (ADE) Values for Pharmaceuticals—An Industry Proposal</title>

<p>The Acceptable Daily Exposure (ADE) concept follows a well-established paradigm that has long been successfully used in nutritional toxicology to set acceptable levels of chemical food contamination (oral intake) and in occupational toxicology to derive acceptable levels of workplace exposure (via inhalation). ADEs are now being introduced as a measure of safe residual contamination of “multi-product” manufacturing equipment. Therefore, they will become the object of new regulatory scrutiny. ADE is defined as a substance-specific dose that is unlikely to cause an adverse health event or undesirable physiological effect if an individual is exposed daily at or below this dose during lifetime. The ADE is typically based on nonclinical and clinical data. Here we propose a standard procedure for ADE setting from nonclinical safety data: The reference effect level (e.g. NOAEL) established in the most sensitive species is multiplied with a human body weight of 60 kg. The resulting dose has to be divided by adjustment factors to compensate for uncertainties in the model applied. These include interindividual variability (F1), interspecies differences (F2), duration of the toxicity study (F3), severity of toxicity (F4), and the quality of the reference effect level (F5). While default values for F1 - F5 are provided, we recommend replacing them by substance-specific values wherever possible. Modifications of this standard procedure are proposed for CMR substances. Limitations of the proposed procedure, different routes of exposure, and differential sensitivity in human subpopulations are discussed. In conclusion, we are presenting a standard approach implemented at F. Hoffmann-La Roche for the derivation of ADEs which may provide some guidance for also other toxicologists in charge of ADE setting.</p>

<p>As part of an integrated testing strategy under the Registration, Evaluation, and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH) regulation, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) has specified that vertebrate animal testing shall be avoided and/or minimized through the development of read-across strategies and the identification of acceptable surrogates. The relevance of the approach must be substantiated however through a robust evaluation of the physicochemical properties and available toxicological parameters.</p>
<p>This case study, the application of read-across to fulfill physicochemical and toxicological parameters in the REACH registration of 2,6-xylenol (2,6-dimethylphenol), presents the rationale for the use of the structural analogues chosen. Various options including read-across to mixed xylenol isomers or to specific isomers sharing similar functional groups were critically evaluated. Consideration was given to the presence of the phenolic hydroxyl group and the position of methyl groups as well as data availability. The predicted metabolic pathways for the substances chosen were broadly similar based on similar reactions considering probable and plausible transformations. A matrix of available REACH Annex VII and VIII human health toxicity data including the oral and dermal acute toxicity, skin and eye irritation, mutagenicity, and repeat dose data were evaluated to determine the appropriateness of the approach for extrapolation to higher-tiered study requirements. The overall strategy required a well-documented, well-defined methodical approach for submission under the regulatory framework. A substance registration was developed using the read across approach that defines the impact and importance of the substance categories, while including other options such as data waivers. An overview of the strategy, matrix, hazard analysis and overall risk assessment will be presented.</p>

<p>The 3T3 NRU Phototoxicity Test historical control data demonstrates a robust and reproducible assay in this laboratory. Chlorpromazine (CPZ) as the positive control for 60 plus sponsored assays displays reproducibility and assay validation as per the OECD 432 guideline. The overall IC<sub>50</sub> (irradiated) and IC<sub>50</sub> (non-irradiated) was 1.037 ± 0.403 mg/L and 29.198 ± 12.053 mg/L, respectively, agreeing with the OECD guideline requirements. We have also run assays using different light sources, UVA/UVB irradiance ratios and the number of dosed wells per concentration. In all cases the data are reproducible and within guidance limits. Evaluation of test articles with the 96 well plate lids removed, increases the UVB portion of the irradiance from approximately 19 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> to approximately 32 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> concomitant with the recommended 5 J/cm2 of UVA irradiance. The resulting IC<sub>50</sub>, PIF, and MPE data show no adverse effect on the assay from the increased UVB fluence and acceptable CPZ results, allowing evaluation of test articles absorbing primarily in the UVB. Cell sensitivity to UVR and cell viability met the recommended levels, regardless of the UVR exposure conditions. The dosing of a single well per test article concentration, as opposed to the typical dosing of six wells per test article concentration, generates usable and valid data and increases the throughput of the assay in a ‘screening mode’. The 3T3 NRU Phototoxicity assay has proven to be a useful, robust and valid hazard assessment tool in the preclinical process of drug discovery, either under standard or other conditions of use.</p>

<p>Assessment of toxicokinetics (TK) using “sparse” blood sampling in main study rats instead of a separate satellite cohort provides an opportunity to reduce the number of rats required to conduct nonclinical safety studies. In this approach, the volume and/or number of TK blood samples collected from each rat are typically reduced in an attempt to minimize potential blood withdrawal effects on clinical pathology data, particularly hematological parameters. The objective of the present study was to evaluate how a sparse TK blood collection approach prior to a multiday necropsy interval affects hematology parameters. Seventy-five female Crl: CD (SD) rats, 11 weeks old and weighing 192-230 g each, were assigned to 3 groups (Groups 1-3; 25 rats/group). Blood samples (0.375 ml each) were collected via the lateral tail vein on Day 1 (Group 3 rats) and Day 2 (Group 2 and Group 3 rats) to mimic 6 and 24 hour TK blood sampling, respectively. Terminal samples were then collected from Groups 1 (control), 2, and 3 on Days 2 (approximately 2 hours following the mock 24-hour TK collection in Groups 2 and 3), and then in the mornings of Day 3, 4, 5 and 8 (5 rats/group). In Group 2 rats, there were no noteworthy hematology changes. In Group 3 rats, there were statistically (<italic>P</italic> &lt;0.05) and physiologically significant decreases in red blood cell-associated parameters (red blood cell counts, hemoglobin concentrations and/or hematocrit values) compared to pretest and control values beginning on Day 2 with a compensatory increase in reticulocyte counts (notably “high” RNA reticulocytes) observable by Day 4. Red blood cell parameters were subsequently increased towards control/pretest range by Day 5 following the TK blood sampling. The results from this study demonstrate a temporal effect of sparse TK blood sampling on hematology parameters over a 4-day necropsy interval that is influenced by the number of TK blood samples collected relative to necropsy. These effects, which could confound interpretability of test item-related hematology changes, should be considered when designing nonclinical safety studies in rats.</p>

<p>Drug-induced inhibition of the cardiac hERG potassium channel is assumed to predict delayed cardiac repolarization (DR). The consequent QTc prolongation is a surrogate marker of torsade de pointes (TdP), a rare but potentially lethal iatrogenic outcome. Drugs with effective therapeutic plasma concentrations (ETPC) within 30-fold of their hERG IC<sub>50 </sub> s are thought to be dangerous despite the fact that multiple ion channel effects (MICE) can mitigate DR. Here we demonstrate that a logistic regression model, which integrates MICE, predicts TdP with much greater certainty than the hERG safety ratio (hERG IC<sub>50</sub> /ETPC) alone. Safety ratios were calculated for 40 drugs (19 +TdP and 21 -TdP) from multiple classes by dividing their hERG, Nav1.5 and Cav1.2 IC<sub>50</sub> values by each drug’s ETPC. Two logistic regression models were constructed; one using the hERG IC<sub>50</sub> /ETPC ratio alone (Model 1), the other integrating hERG IC<sub>50</sub> /ETPC + Nav1.5 IC<sub>50</sub> /ETPC + Cav1.2 IC<sub>50</sub> /ETPC data (Model 2). The predictive power of each model was evaluated by performing leave-one-out cross validations. Each model’s accuracy for discriminating +TdP and -TdP drugs was determined by comparing their receiver–operator characteristics (ROC, true vs. false positive rates). Model 1 had a 52% False Positive Rate associated with a 90% True Positive Rate and a ROC area under the curve (AUC) of 0.72. Model 2 significantly improved accuracy showing a 15% False Positive Rate associated with a 90% True Positive Rate and a ROC AUC of 0.86. We propose that models that incorporate quantitative drug effects on multiple cardiac ion channels will be robust nonclinical predictors of cardiac risk.</p>

<p>Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) remains a major cause of failed drug development and withdrawal of drugs post marketing. Therefore predictive toxicology screening assays are required which enable early identification and deselection of compounds that have the potential to cause DILI in man. In this study, multiplexed high content screening (HCS) with automated fluorescence microscopy and image analysis based technology was used to develop cellular assays that detect key mechanisms considered relevant to DILI. The following parameters were evaluated: cell proliferation (nuclear dyes): apoptosis (antibodies to activated caspase 3); cell cycle (antibodies to pHistone H3); stress (antibodies to HSP70/72); reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation (H2DFFDA staining), and mitochondrial damage (TMRE staining). Experiments were undertaken in human primary hepatocytes and in HepG2 cells at 4, 24 and 48 hrs. In addition, in some studies S9 liver fractions from Arochlor induced rats were added extracellularly to overcome the inherent metabolic limitations of HepG2 cells. In HepG2 cells dosed with cyclophosphamide (CP), an effect on cellular proliferation and induction of apoptosis was observed in the presence of S9, but not in the absence of S9, which is consistent with the metabolism of CP to toxic metabolites. No effect was observed in the absence of S9 or NADPH. In addition, a concentration dependent decrease in expression of pHistone H3 was observed with CP in the presence of S9 after 24 hours of exposure but not at 48 hours, which suggests a potential metabolite dependent cell cycle block that recovers after reactive species dissipate. Another interesting observation was HSP70/72 induction in HepG2 cells dosed with low concentrations of Geldanamycin, which is known to cause cellular stress <italic>in vivo</italic> and induce HSP proteins. This raises the possibility that evaluation of drug induced elevation of HSP70/72 in human liver cells could serve as an earlier indicator of cellular changes that may be relevant could be toxicity. These results indicate that multiplexing of markers directly linked to cellular mechanisms of toxicity is useful for evaluation of the ability of test compounds to cause toxicity to isolated liver-derived cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. To determine the value of this approach for prediction of DILI <italic>in viv</italic>o, it will be important to undertake a follow up evaluation of a broad range of marketed drugs which cause DILI or do not cause DILI in man.</p>

<p>Delivery of therapeutics to the brain to treat neurological diseases and other central nervous system (CNS) disorders is a challenge due to the impenetrable nature of the blood brain barrier (BBB). Intranasal (IN) drug administration is a non-invasive approach for rapid direct delivery from the nasal cavity to the CNS, thereby minimizing systemic exposure. The pathways along olfactory and trigeminal nerves innervating the nasal passages are involved in the nasal uptake of drugs by transcellular or transneuronal transport. Other agents are believed to access the CNS from the nasal cavity by moving between the epithelial cells, a process called paracellular transport. On the basis of previous reports, the current study focuses on the use of the IN route for direct delivery of the nucleoside drug gemcitabine (GEM) to treat brain tumors. GEM is structurally similar to zidovudine (AZT), the latter of which can be delivered to the brain by the IN route. In order to enhance drug delivery to the CNS, we propose to use papaverine (PV), which has been demonstrated to transiently increase the permeability of the brain-tumor barrier (BTB) and BBB after systemic administration. We hypothesize that by transiently increasing the permeability of nasal epithelial tight junctions, we will increase the concentration of GEM in the brain extracellular fluid (BECF) following intranasal drug administration, with the goal of delivering therapeutic concentrations of nucleoside drugs to treat HIV dementia and brain tumors. Experimental methods include <italic>in vivo</italic> brain microdialysis for collection of BECF to analyze drug levels, <italic>in vitro</italic> recovery of GEM, and HPLC analysis to measure the concentration of GEM in BECF. A non-toxic dose of PV, which enhanced delivery of GEM to BECF, was determined. BECF pharmacokinetics of GEM shows AUC = 6.95 ± 1.17 μg.h/ml for PV (1.4%) + GEM- (50mg/kg) treated animals (n = 3) and it is comparable to the AUC values when GEM and another BBB permeabilizer (RMP-7) were administered intravenously. Thus, it appears that transient permeabilization of nasal epithelial tight junctions can enhance delivery of nucleoside drugs to the CNS.</p>

<p>The proposed ICH M7 draft guidance on submission of new drug approvals to regulatory agencies includes the opportunity to submit <italic>in silico</italic> predictions of genotoxicity instead of Ames tests for low-level impurities. This issue raises questions concerning the qualification of robust (Q)SAR models that are appropriate for predicting genotoxic impurities. This approach investigates how external validation sets (such as the public Hansen data set) should be appropriately used for validation of (Q)SAR models. Fingerprints representing the toxicophores of the external validation sets are compared with model training sets to determine the how the domains of a (Q)SAR model and validation set overlap. Performance characteristics specific to individual toxicophores in the overlapping set are proposed. Interpretation of individual (Q)SAR predictions using results contributed from underlying structural features present as model descriptors is also investigated. The goal is to help establish a method of qualifying (Q)SAR models for predicting genotoxic impurities based on model robustness and interpretability.</p>

<p>Proteasome inhibitors (PIs) have the potential to cause peripheral neuropathy. This peripheral neuropathy has been linked to development of multifocal ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates (UPAs) in vivo and in vitro. In a mouse model of PI-induced peripheral neuropathy, UPAs appeared in the dorsal root ganglion cells; nerve injury subsequently developed. In differentiated PC12 neuronal cells exposed to PIs from 3 chemical scaffolds (peptide boronate, peptide epoxyketone and a lactacystin analog), correlative UPA formation was observed. To further dissect these effects in neurons, differentiated PC12 neuronal cell cultures were exposed to these 3 PI chemotypes at the concentrations resulting in 90% ± 5% inhibition of 20 S proteasome activity (IC<sub>90</sub>) and at the concentrations resulting in 50% cell death (LD<sub>50</sub>). Cellular effects were assessed by electron microscope (EM) imaging. All treatments elicited similar microscopic changes: in the dying cells prominent juxtanuclear inclusions with varying size, loss of surface microvilli, diminished organelles in the peripheral regions and swollen nuclei and other cytoplasmic organelles. The inclusions were structurally consistent with aggresomes. In addition, ultra-structural observations indicated that necrotic cell death had occurred. In conclusion, consistent with the earlier findings on mechanism-based UPA formation in PC12 neuronal cells, EM images show that PIs induce qualitative ultra-structural changes regardless of the chemical scaffold of the PI. Thus, these effects in vitro are mechanism-based, not chemistry-based.</p>

<p>The effects of sodium arsenite exposure on parameters of hepatocyte maturation during the cellular and functional reorganization period (PND 9 - 28) of developing rat liver were studied. Wistar rat pups belonging to the experimental group received sodium arsenite (1.5 mg/kg body weight) and the control group received distilled water by intraperitoneal (i.p.) route from PND 9 until the day of sacrifice (PND 29). Perfusion fixed liver tissue was processed for paraffin embedding and H&amp;E staining. Fresh liver tissue was processed for Sudan Black B (SBB) staining and for biochemical estimation of reduced glutathione (Ellman’s method). Microscopic observations revealed mature hepatic lobular pattern along with comparable distribution of uninucleate and binucleate hepatocytes in the control and experimental groups. Using an Image Analysis system (NIS-Elements AR 3.1) increase in mean nuclear area (34.42 ± 3.28 µm<sup>2</sup>) and nuclear diameter (6.65 ± 0.31 µm) of hepatocytes was observed in experimental group. The experimental group also showed decreased levels of reduced glutathione (11.23 ± 0.98 µg/g of wet liver tissue). Lipid droplet distribution pattern (SBB stained) revealed higher centrilobular staining (mature) in both the groups and semiquantitative estimation showed lower cumulative grey values in zone 3 against zone 2 and 1 (suggestive of setting in of the adult pattern). The developing hepatocytes (PND 9 - 28) exposed to low dose arsenic showed increased vulnerability.</p>

<p>A resource-sparing in vivo cardiovascular screen is valuable for the selection of lead drug candidates early in development prior to the start of longer, more resource intensive safety pharmacology and toxicology studies. Our goal was to develop a sensitive and predictive anesthetized small animal model to assess effects on ECG that are predictive of the non-rodent safety pharmacology telemetry models. We compared the ECG effects of 26 compounds in this anesthetized guinea pig model with those in non-rodent telemetry models. Results<underline>:</underline> ECG effects in guinea pigs were 92%, 100% and 92% concordant with effects in non-rodent telemetry for PR, QRS and QTc intervals changes, respectively. The rates of false positives and false negatives for QTc and PR interval changes in guinea pigs were 0% and 8% when compared to telemetry. For QRS interval, rates of false positives and false negatives were 0% compared to telemetry. Further, this model has shown to be sensitive for detection of AV block and QTc prolongation mediated by hERG, I<sub>Ks</sub> and I<sub>K1</sub> inhibitors and for evaluating the effects of mixed ion channel blockers on the QTc interval. Conclusion: The anesthetized guinea pig is a sensitive model for assessing QTc interval prolongation and predictive of ECG effects relative to non-rodent telemetry models. Thus, ECG parameters can be reliably evaluated using this resource-sparing small animal model that reduces test article requirements, reduces the number and cost of animals, and improves overall data throughput. Importantly, the design and implementation of this model is consistent with the “3Rs” for animal research.</p>

<p>The purpose of this project was to develop a model of glaucoma via surgical induction of increased intraocular pressure (IOP) in Yucatan miniature swine. Three pigs (two female, one male) had bilateral IOP measurements performed prior to surgical intervention to establish a baseline IOP for each animal from which future changes in IOP could be identified. IOP measurements (mm Hg) were taken with a Tonopen Vet Tonometer. In order to reduce venous drainage from the eyes, episcleral veins were scarified by cauterization in each eye. IOPs were periodically measured for several weeks post-cauterization surgery. Pharmacologic intervention was then instituted with a commercially available synthetic prostamide analog with ocular hypotensive activity. Drops were applied once daily, and IOPs continued to be measured. After 7 weeks of daily treatment, eye drops were discontinued, and IOP measurements continued to be obtained. All animals presented with significant increases in IOP measurements post surgical intervention and significant decreases in IOP with pharmacological therapy. Statistical tests included sample mean comparison by 2-tail T-test P-value (T≤t). Data by phase as follows-Mean ± SD (N readings), P-value: <bold>Baseline</bold>: 19 ± 4 (65); <bold>Post-Surgery</bold>: 24 ± 5 (124), ≤0.005 (Baseline vs. Post-Surg); <bold>Treatment</bold>: 18 ± 4 (75), ≤0.0006 (Post-Surg vs Treatment) <bold>Recovery</bold>: 20 ± 4 (80), ≤0.006 (Treatment vs Recovery). Therefore, the Yucatan miniature swine should be considered a viable model for surgically induced glaucoma. The miniature swine eye is also responsive to pharmacological therapy to reduce IOP and as such could be a potential model for future pharmacological research.</p>

<p>The TP53 gene is one of the most extensively studied tumor suppressor genes and has been found to be mutated in almost all cases of human cancer. In designing animal models to mimic the involvement of TP53 several lines of transgenic mice have been developed and have shown, when homozygotes are used, a relatively uniform tumor spectrum with thymic lymphomas as the dominant tumor type, and a fast onset of disease. However, the tumor spectrum when heterozygotes are used is more diverse and is similar to humans with a slower onset of tumorgenesis, indicating that a loss of heterozygosity has to precede tumor development. Here we present the first in-depth characterization of a TP53 deficiency in the rat, generated using a target-selected mutagenesis approach. Homozygous rats, completely lacking TP53 protein, display a decrease in survival due to tumorgenesis, developing sarcomas with a high incidence of pulmonary metastases, at 4 months of age. In contrast, heterozygous rats exhibit a slower onset to tumorigenesis with sarcomas developing by 8 months of age. Molecular analysis of these tumors shows a loss of heterozygosity of the wild type P53 allele. These unique features complement existing rodent p53 knock out models and provide a versatile tool for investigating tumorigenesis</p>

<p>Introduction: The most common evaluation of ECG from both toxicology and safety pharmacology standard studies is focused on acute and regular events such as ECG interval changes or arrhythmias. However, some of these changes are irregular or develop as a slow onset phenomenon. This case study highlighted the value of chronic monitoring of ECG when using a telemetered guinea pig model in detecting irregular and slow onset atrioventricular block (AV block).</p>
<p>Methods: Guinea pigs instrumented with radiotelemetry transmitters for continuous collection of ECG signals were utilized to investigate potential chronic cardiac conduction issues with Merck compound X. A single oral dose study with vehicle, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg compound X using a dose escalating design was conducted initially for dose range finding. In the repeat dose study which followed, five guinea pigs were dosed orally with 100 mg/kg compound X and three with vehicle as a control for 5 days.</p>
<p>Results: The baseline incidence of AV block was low in naive guinea pigs. Sporadic and slow onset second degree AV block was noted in 2 out of 3 guinea pigs following 100 mpk single dose of compound X. The AV block was preceded by progressive PR prolongation and followed by PR shortening as a typical Mobitz type 1 or Wenckebach AV block. The occurrence of AV block appeared to be dose-dependent. The incidence of AV block also increased with multiple daily doses of compound X with more than 300 instances of AV block on average at day 4. Heart rate was significantly decreased after multiple dosing too. There were no test article related changes in other measured ECG intervals (PR, QRS and QT/QTc).</p>
<p>Discussion and Conclusion: The data suggest that conscious telemetered guinea pig is a sensitive model to detect irregular and slow onset AV block. The results are consistent with the findings from dog and human, although different from preliminary data from rat and monkey. The potential mechanisms behind these findings will be discussed.</p>

<title>P206 Optimal Duration of Jacket Habituation Based on Cardiovascular Endpoints in Beagle Dogs and Cynomolgus Monkeys</title>

<p>The invasive telemetry system and snapshot recording of ECG are commonly used to monitor cardiovascular (CV) endpoints in safety pharmacology and toxicity studies. Due to the recent development of non-invasive jacket telemetry systems, CV endpoints can be monitored for longer periods on toxicity studies in unrestrained dogs and monkeys. It is essential to habituate animals to the jacket prior to the data collection period to obtain good quality data. The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal habituation period based on heart rate response. Heart rate (HR) was collected from 4 jacketed non-human primates (NHPs) following 3 consecutive occasions of jacket habituation. Heart rate was also collected from jacketed dogs following 3 and 7 consecutive occasions of jacket habituation. Heart rate data collected following 3 and 7 day jacket habituation was compared with the Testing Facility’s historical control data collected from non-jacketed, invasive telemetry models in both species. Heart rate collected from jacketed monkeys (following 3 day habituation) and dogs (following 3 and 7 day habituation) are comparable to data from non-jacketed animals. Therefore, we concluded that a three day habituation is optimal to prevent undesirable effects in the CV data that may result from insufficient jacket habituation.</p>

<p>In recent years, zebrafish larvae have emerged as an exciting and predictive <italic>in vivo</italic> platform for assessing toxic liabilities of compounds early in the drug development process. These assays often rely on relatively simple morphological or behavioural readouts to allow a medium to high throughput for screening. Although these readouts are predictive for identifying toxic compounds, in order to realise the full value of this platform, high content technologies can be applied to help understand the underlying pathology induced after toxic insult. Evotec has developed a medium throughput semi-automated histology platform capable of simultaneously capturing full-body histological sections from up to 50 zebrafish larvae. This approach offers the opportunity to integrate diverse histological endpoints into the established zebrafish screening assays. In this study, 12 compounds with known hepatotoxic liabilities were assessed using a combined phenotypic and histological screening approach. Zebrafish larvae were treated for 48 hr with up to four concentrations of compound alongside a vehicle control, scored for liver abnormalities and sectioned using the histology array. Liver tissue in sequential sections was assessed for morphological alterations (H&amp;E stain), glycogen levels (periodic acid-Schiff stain) and fibrosis (trichrome stain). The outcome of how these histological data support the morphological analysis will be reported.</p>

<p>Zebrafish have gained increasing popularity for toxicity testing over the past decade due to numerous advantages over other vertebrates, including the use of an <italic>in vitro</italic>-like assay format in multi-well plates, requiring only single milligrams of test compound for a full dose response and the transparency of the zebrafish larva, which decreases the need for invasive procedures and dissection. Evotec previously evaluated its zebrafish developmental toxicity assay by testing 90 blinded compounds. In comparison to results from mammalian embryo-foetal developmental toxicity studies, the zebrafish assay was ∼90% predictive for identifying toxic compounds. One key challenge highlighted in the study was the need to distinguish distinct embryotoxic effects from acute toxicity (effects that would commonly be detected as maternal toxicity in mammalian assays). In the current study, 20 compounds with known teratogenic liabilities were assessed using a combined embryonic and larval screening approach. Zebrafish were treated for 96 hr with five concentrations of compound alongside a vehicle control and scored for morphological abnormalities and lethality throughout the assay. Since compound uptake by zebrafish larvae could vary during development, the actual body burden (ng/larva) was determined at the respective NOECs and LOECs for both embryos and larvae via LC-MS. A comparison of toxicity exhibited in embryonic versus larval zebrafish together with how this outcome supports a classification for teratogenic and/or embryotoxic compounds will be reported.</p>

<p>The ICH S6(R1) guideline was issued in June 2011. Part of the guideline specifically addresses study design elements and study initiation timing in nonhuman primates (NHPs). Embryo-fetal (EFD) and enhanced pre/postnatal (ePPND) studies may be conducted prior to or concurrently with Phase III clinical trials. Initiating studies concurrent with Phase III will require extremely stringent timelines. In collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, contract research laboratories that offer these resource- and time-consuming EFD/ePPND studies in NHPs may need to shorten study timelines. One of the approaches to consider is expedited enrollment of pregnant animals to study. For example, instead of 16 weeks to fill a 60-animal study, the duration would be 10 weeks. This may require adjustments both to resource management and the approach to breeding practices. One key factor to take into account is the historical rates of pregnancy loss in NHPs unique to each laboratory setting. The question then is, will the pregnancy loss rates compromise the timing by requiring replacement animals on study? As an example, of 398 pregnant monkeys in our facility between 2007 and 2011, there was 17.8% embryo/fetal loss on or before gestation day 130 (GD130), 2.5% infant loss due to premature birth (viable or dead infant) between GD131 and GD145, and 15.3% loss due to non-viable births (delivery of dead infant on or after GD146). Even though these loss rates are within normal historical values and published data, three of the 24 studies (13%) required additional animal replacements resulting in an extension of the study timelines. To cater for potential animal replacements and other unforeseen events that may result in extensions of study timelines despite potential decrease in enrollment duration, it is always encouraged to plan EFD/ePPND studies as far in advance as possible</p>

<p>Non-human primates are used extensively for anticoagulant therapy development. Availability, cost and size has led to an increased use of <italic>M. fascicularis</italic> (cynomolgus) for testing. Differences for coagulation responses between M. mulatta and M. fascicularis were previously demonstrated and, in addition, genetic diversity among macaques from different sources has also been observed. The present study examines potential disparities of coagulation responses for animals attributed to sources in Vietnam, Philippines, Indonesia, China and Mauritius. The coagulation cascade is evaluated by determination of clotting tests such as prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), common pathway (Heptest<sup>®</sup>), and thrombin time (TT). Blood was drawn and immediately transferred to sodium citrate tubes (3.2% at 9 parts blood to 1 part sodium citrate), centrifuged to obtain plasma and stored at -80<sup>o</sup>C. Clotting tests performed included PT, aPTT, Heptest<sup>®</sup>, and TT assays using the ACL 300+ and BBL Fibro System manual fibrometers. PT values, regardless of source, were within a range of <underline>+</underline> 2 seconds. Similar results were also observed for the aPTT data. However, Heptest<sup>®</sup> values appeared to vary with animal source. The lowest values (mean 16.4) were observed for the Vietnamese and the highest values (mean 24.5) for Mauritius sourced animals. Thrombin Time had the largest variance in values, but no differences between sources were observed. The data show differences for some coagulation parameters depending upon the source of the animals. It is essential to identify the source of animals and determine baseline values for studies in which coagulation parameters play a major role. A clear understanding of these differences is essential when interpreting past data and assessing new anticoagulants for efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics.</p>

<p>Cynomolgus monkeys are often used as a surrogate model for human CYP 450 mediated metabolism. Cynomolgous monkeys share similar CYPs as humans with a high percentage of amino acid sequence homology. Major human CYPs and homolgous Cynomolgous monkey CYPs (Cyno CYP, % amino acid sequence homology) are as follows: 1A2 (1A2, 93), 2C9 (2C43, 93), 2D6 (2D17, 93), 2E1 (2E1, 94), and 3A4 (3A8, 93). A UHPLC/MS/MS CYP 450 phenotyping assay was used to compare the major human CYP 450s to the cynomolgus monkey using in-vitro microsomal incubations. Microsomes were prepared from cynomolgous monkeys and compared to pooled human microsomes. UHPLC separation was carried out on a Waters Acquity HSS T3 1.8mcm (2.1x100 mm) column with an Acquity HSS T3 1.8mcM Vanguard Pre-Column. Compounds were eluted with a gradient of Acetonitrile/ THF/ Formic Acid (20/ 4/ 0.1) in methanol. Mass spectrometry detection was carried out with a AB Sciex 4000 Qtrap triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a Turbo V IonSpray as an LC/MS interface. Positive ion mode ESI mass spectra were acquired from microsomal extracts for the following probes (corresponding CYP 450 in parenthesis): caffeine (1A2), dextromethorphan (2D6 and 3A4), and testosterone (3A4) along with their metabolites paraxanthine, dextrorphan, hydroxymorphinan, and 6-beta hydroxytestosterone. Negative ion mode was used to identify probes (CYP 450): chlorzoxazone (2E1) and diclofenac (2C9) along with their metabolites 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone and 4-hydroxydiclofenac. Incubations show large differences in dextromethorphan metabolism, which was a probe for 2D6 (dextrorphan) mediated metabolism and 3A4 (hydroxymorphinan) metabolism.</p>

<p>As part of a multi-lab validation, we examined induction of Pig-a mutant red blood cells (RBCs) and reticulocytes (RETs) by flow cytometry (FCM) during 28-day subchronic studies in male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg/day DMBA, or 5, 10, 20 and 35 mg/kg/day DEN. The same animals were analyzed for micronucleated RETs (mnRETs) in peripheral blood by FCM, and DNA damage in liver via Comet assay. Also analyzed were Comet response in peripheral blood (DEN-treated animals), or micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (mnPCEs) in bone marrow (DMBA-treated animals, by manual scoring). DMBA induced dose-related increases in Pig-a mutant RBCs and RETs (Days 15 and 29), mnRETs (Days 4 and 29), and mnPCEs (Day 29), but no increase in Comet response was observed in liver at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day, which appeared to be below the MTD (upon re-testing up to 200 mg/kg/day for 3 days in a follow-up acute study, DMBA induced a positive Comet response in liver, but was negative in peripheral blood). In contrast, DEN was negative for induction of Pig-a mutant RBCs and RETs (Days 15 and 29) and mnRETs (Days 4 and 29), but induced dose-dependent increases in Comet response in liver and blood (Day 29), at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (higher dose groups were terminated early due to excessive toxicity/mortality). These results emphasize the extreme care that must be taken in dose and endpoint selection when incorporating genotoxicity endpoints into routine toxicity studies.</p>

Animals also were analyzed for: micronucleated RETs (mnRETs) by FCM; DNA damage in blood, liver, and stomach by the Comet assay; and chromosome aberrations (CAbs) in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). Dose-and time-related increases were observed in Pig-a mutant RBCs and RETs (Days 15 and 29), as well as mnRETs (Day 29, but not Day 4). No increases were observed in PBL CAbs (Days 4 and 29), or DNA damage in liver (Days 15 and 29), stomach (Day 29), or PBLs (Days 1, 15 and 29). A follow-up study was performed at the same cumulative doses given in 1 or 3 daily doses (the latter as in a typical Comet/micronucleus combo assay). Dose-related increases were observed for Pig-a mutant RBCs and RETs (15 and 29 days after last dose), mnRETs (3 days after last dose), and Comet responses in PBLs, liver and stomach (3 hours after last dose). Except for Pig-a mutant RETs and RBCs, all responses decreased at the later timepoints. Dose-dependent increases in micronucleated bone marrow polychromatic erythrocytes also were observed 3 hours after the last of 3 doses, but no increase in CAb was observed in PBLs, possibly due to technical issues. These results emphasize the extreme care that must be taken in dose and endpoint selection when incorporating genotoxicity endpoints into routine toxicity studies as recommended in ICH S2(R1).</p>

<p>The objective of the study was to evaluate the pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) of Sprague Dawley rats, equipped with a telemetry implant, when administered U-44069, a PGH<sub>2</sub> analog, similar to endogenously formed thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> which can be titrated to induce the desired degree of pulmonary vasoconstriction, 3 times a day. Prior to the study, rats had a subcutaneous telemetry device implanted and the catheter was placed in the right ventricle and advanced into the pulmonary artery. Rats received intravenous infusions of U-44069 at a formulation concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, administered for 15 minutes at a dose rate of 10 mL/kg/hr, 3 times per day, separated by approximately 1 hour. Additional control rats were kept in the restrainer and followed the same regimen (ie. 3 times per day). The PAP increases were similar after each administration, although slightly less significant increases were observed after the second and third administrations. However, there were still significant increases in PAP of at least 51%, and therefore, it is considered that multiple daily administrations are appropriate for this model. In addition, there were no significant changes in PAP in control animals, therefore the restraint procedure is not considered to have an impact on the evaluation and interpretation of the data with this model.</p>

<p>Preclinical guidelines often specify the use of prepubertal, pubertal, or sexually mature animals. However, “puberty” and “sexual maturity” can be defined in a number of different ways which reflect androgen production, including the onset of mounting behavior, penile erection and/or ejaculation ± sperm capabilities, or, histologically, by a “threshold” portion of seminiferous tubules engaged in spermatogenesis ± epididymal sperm. Furthermore, “sexual maturity” can also be interpreted slightly differently, depending on the type of toxicology study programs (e.g., DART versus repeat dosing studies). Since Yucatan boars have been reported to reach “puberty” as early as 12 weeks or as late as 16 to 20 weeks of age, it is critical, regardless of how the stages of sexual development are defined, to know what is happening histologically in the testes at these various ages. Modified Davidson’s-fixed and PAS-stained testicular and epididymal sections were evaluated from 12-, 14-, 16-, 18-, 20-, 22-, and 24-week-old Yucatan boars (n = minimum of 4/age group). Approximately 200 seminiferous tubules were evaluated per testis for the presence of round spermatids only (immature tubules), as well as for species-specific cellular associations (stages) involving round and/or elongate spermatids (“mature” tubules). The proportion of the total number of seminiferous tubules represented by “mature tubules” was calculated. The presence of sperm in the caudae epididymides was also noted. Round spermatids began to appear at 12 weeks of age, and a majority of 14-week-old boars had seminiferous tubules containing both round and elongate spermatids. While sparse numbers of sperm appeared in the epididymides of one boar at 14 weeks of age, at least half of the 16- and 18-week-old boars exhibited some spermiation with sperm in the excurrent duct system. By 20 weeks of age almost all seminiferous tubules were “mature”, with sperm present in the epididymides. These novel data can be taken into consideration, along with other indices of sexual development, when designing toxicology experiments of varying durations which require Yucatan boars at a given stage of sexual maturity.</p>

<p>Benralizumab (MEDI-563) is a humanized, monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the human interleukin-5 receptor alpha subunit expressed predominantly on eosinophils, a cell believed to play a functional role in bronchial asthma. Similar to the mechanism of other anti-IL-5 antibodies, benralizumab blocks the binding of IL-5 to its receptor, but benralizumab was also engineered to be afucosylated, which is anticipated to result in enhanced ADCC-mediated destruction of eosinophils and basophils, offers a novel approach to asthma treatment. To support benralizumab clinical development for the treatment of asthma, a chronic intravenous infusion (10 or 25 mg/kg) or subcutaneous (30 mg/kg) dose study was performed in cynomolgus monkeys (6/sex/group) with benralizumab administration every other week for 39 weeks (20 total doses). Necropsies were performed 3 days and 12 weeks after the final benralizumab dose administration. Following repeated benralizumab administration, the expected pharmacologically-mediated depletion of blood and bone marrow eosinophils was observed. An instance of transient petechiae and ecchymosis, decreased platelet count, and indicators of circulating erythrocyte mass occurred in one female in the 25 mg/kg IV dose group after the fourth dose (Day 43). After a dosing holiday on Day 57, this animal remained on study with continued benralizumab dosing (Platelet values and red blood cell mass in this animal fluctuated after dosing was resumed but were near baseline levels by the end of the dosing period and lacked any correlating macroscopic or microscopic findings at scheduled necropsy). There were no benralizumab  related effects observed including no effects on male and female fertility parameters. Under the conditions of this study, the benralizumab NOAEL was 25 mg/kg/dose (IV) and 30 mg/kg/dose (SC), the highest doses evaluated for each route of administration.</p>

<p>The mini-pig is considered a suitable model for local tolerance and safety assessments of formulations administered subcutaneously because skin and subcutaneous space closely resembles that of humans. Consequently, the feasibility of continuous subcutaneous infusion (24 hrs) utilizing a daily rotation of sites, in the Göttingen Mini-pig was evaluated over 10 days. Using two mini-pigs (12.8 and 19.0 kg, respectively), a subcutaneous tissue infusion set was inserted through the skin and secured in place using adhesive dressing. The mini-pig was fitted with a jacket connected to a tether system and the cannula to a swivel and external infusion pump. Saline was continuously infused (2.5 mL/h) subcutaneously, through a 0.22 µM filter, at sites between the scapular and lumbar thoracic regions for 10 days alternating through different site each day. Parameters evaluated were daily detailed examinations, weekly body weights, daily food evaluation, clinical pathology evaluations (Days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10), macroscopic and microscopic examinations. Continuous subcutaneous infusion was successfully conducted for 10 days. As expected, no adverse effects in parameters of systemic toxicity were seen and no unexpected events were encountered during blood collections. Local responses of slight, well-defined areas of erythema and dark areas and/or swelling at the infusion sites were noted macroscopically. Microscopically, some procedure-related findings of minimal or slight inflammation, hemorrhage and/or necrosis were noted, however the adjacent skeletal muscle was unaffected. The low incidence and severity of the local responses at the infusion sites were considered unlikely to hinder study interpretation. In conclusion, 24 hour subcutaneous infusion in the Gottingen Mini-pig was well tolerated systemically and presented minimal experimental background changes. Indications of recovery at the infusion sites suggest that repeat administration at a given site may be acceptable with an appropriate recovery period between administrations.</p>

<p>This study determined the tolerability and toxicity of various formulations of Solutol/PEG 400 on female dogs and Cremophor/PEG in male dogs, in two 28-day, oral, repeat-dose studies. Five groups of 3 female dogs were given either water vehicle, 10% Solutol/90% PEG (2 mL/kg/day (mkd)), 30% Solutol/70% PEG (2 mkd), 10% Solutol/90% PEG (5 mL/kg/day), or 30% Solutol/70% PEG (5 mkd). All dogs tolerated the administration of 10% Solutol/90% PEG or 30% Solutol/70% PEG (2 mkd). Three groups of male dogs were given either water vehicle or 10% Cremophor /90% PEG at a dose volume of 2 or 5 mkd. Loose/watery feces and minimal mucus-cell hyperplasia of the ileum were present in all Solutol groups. Total bilirubin was minimally ↑ at all doses of Solutol. ↑ red blood cell mass and ↓ urine volume in animals given 30% Solutol/70% PEG (5 mkd) were likely due to subclinical dehydration and hemoconcetration associated with the loose/watery feces. Emesis was present in all animals given Cremophor with a dose volume-dependent ↑ incidence of emesis and minimal subepithelial gastric hemorrhage. Minimally ↑ serum urea nitrogen was seen in dogs given 5 mkd Cremophor/PEG. Neither 10% Solutol/90% PEG, 30% Solutol/70% PEG nor 10% Cremophor/90% PEG at either dose volume produced overt toxicity, however using the lower dose volume of 2 mkd minimized the incidence of loose/watery feces and emesis.</p>

<p>A vaccine against enterotoxigenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (ETEC) is being developed for travelers and young children at high risk of ETEC diarrhea. The purpose of this study was to determine the potential toxicity and immunogenic potential of the vaccine when administered alone or with an enterotoxin adjuvant to New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits by the transcutaneous route. This study was also designed to determine the persistence, late onset, or reversibility of any toxic effects over a 20-day no-treatment recovery period. NZW rabbits (14/sex/group) were assigned to the study and were treated via wet skin patch with either PBS; vaccine (250 µg/dose); adjuvant (50 µg/dose); or both vaccine (250 µg) and adjuvant (50 µg) on Study Days (SD) 1, 22, 43, and 64. Two animals/sex/group were sacrificed on SD 3 (interim), six animals/sex/group were sacrificed on SD 66 (terminal), and the remaining animals were sacrificed following the recovery period on SD 85 (recovery). Parameters evaluated included mortality, physical examinations, cageside observations, dermal Draize observations, measurement of dosing sites, body weight and changes, body temperatures, humoral responses to the vaccine and adjuvant, clinical pathology (serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and C-reactive protein), gross pathology, organ weight data, and microscopic pathology. When administered alone or together, treatment with the adjuvant or vaccine did not produce systemic toxicity. Treatment with the adjuvant alone or in combination with the vaccine was associated with dose site reactions, including erythema, edema, and inflammation; however, these findings were transient and non-adverse. Treatment with the vaccine alone was not associated with dose site reactogenicity. Both the vaccine and adjuvant were highly immunogenic.</p>

<p>A vaccine against enterotoxigenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (ETEC) is being developed to protect travelers and young children that are at risk from this disease. The purpose of this study was to determine the immunogenicity, local skin reactogenicity, and potential toxicity of the ETEC vaccine candidate, when administered alone or in combination with an adjuvant derived from <italic>E. coli</italic>, to Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs by the intradermal route on Study Days 1, 22, 43, and 64. Guinea pigs were treated with 100 µL of the vaccine given alone or the adjuvant mixed with either PBS or the vaccine. Parameters evaluated included mortality, cageside observations, physical examinations, body weights, body temperatures, dermal Draize scores, dose site induration measurements, gross pathology, organ weights, and histopathology. Treatment with vaccine with or without adjuvant had no effect on mortality, cageside observations, physical examinations, body weights, body temperature, gross pathology, or organ weights. Administration of the vaccine alone resulted in a few observations of mild erythema but no induration. Administration of the adjuvant resulted in a dose-related increase in severity of erythema and edema but the severity appeared to decrease with repeated dosing. In addition, the incidence of positive Draize scores appeared to be lower in those animals that received vaccine in combination with adjuvant. Administration of adjuvant alone or in combination with vaccine resulted in areas of induration following the first dose that increased with dose level. However, only animals receiving the adjuvant without vaccine developed areas of induration at subsequent intervals. The tested vaccine components all produced variable inflammation at the inoculation site that was evident two days post-inoculation but which had resolved completely by three weeks post-inoculation.</p>

<p>α-Chlorohydrin (αCH) is reported to produce spermatotoxicity, however little is known of the lasting effects of αCH. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of αCH given orally (p.o.) or subcutaneously (SQ) on male reproductive parameters and body weight (BW) and food consumption (FC) in rats with a 1-week recovery. Sixty rats &gt; 9 weeks old were randomly divided into 5 groups of 12 and given control (water) or 5, 20 or 40 mg/kg/day αCH p.o. or 40 mg/kg/day αCH SC. Following treatment (TRT), half the animals were euthanized. The remaining animals were euthanized following a 1 week recovery (REC). The right vas deferens was collected for sperm motility and right epididymis was collected for sperm count and morphology. Mean sperm counts decreased in animals given 40 mg/kg/day αCH p.o. or SQ (TRT∼320 million/g; REC∼300 million/g) compared with controls (TRT = 1416 million/g; REC = 1630 million/g). Percent abnormal sperm increased in animals given 40 mg/kg/day αCH p.o. or SQ (TRT &gt; 50%; REC∼90%) compared with controls (TRT = 0.4%; REC = 0.9%). The percent of sperm with missing tails increased in animals given 40 mg/kg/day αCH p.o. or SQ (TRT &gt; 50%; REC &gt; 90%) compared with controls (TRT and REC∼5%). Body weight was decreased in males given 40 mg/kg/day αCH p.o. or SQ (TRT∼9%, p &lt; 0.05; REC∼10%) compared with controls. This was reflected in decreased BW gain and FC (∼50% and ∼80% of controls, respectively) during TRT. REC FC was similar while REC BW and BW gain were different between rats given αCH or control. In conclusion, route of administration of αCH had similar effects on measured parameters. Rats given 40 mg/kg/day αCH p.o. or SQ with a 1-week recovery had a higher percentage of abnormal sperm and sperm with missing tails than rats at the completion of treatment.</p>

<p>Polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules have been linked to protein drugs to alter the kinetics or reduce the immunogenicity of the protein. Of the PEGylated proteins on the market, 4 contain PEG ≥30 kDa -- the largest PEG is a branched 40 kDa PEG. Several other PEGylated proteins are in clinical development. No PEG-related systemic toxicity has been reported for these drugs. BAY 94-9027, a PEGylated, recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) developed for hemophilia A, contains a single, 60 kDa PEG to prolong half-life and therefore efficacy. A clinical intravenous dose of 50 IU/kg for BAY 94-9027 corresponds to a very low PEG intake of approximately 3 microgram PEG/kg per dose. Before clinical trials, potential safety of PEG-FVIII was evaluated, including any special concerns over the use of a large PEG molecule. In intravenous toxicology studies of 60 kDa PEG, no adverse effects and no histopathological changes were observed up to and including the highest doses tested: 210 mg/kg after single dose or 11 mg/kg dosed every other day for 4 weeks. The dose of 11 mg/kg is more than the cumulative clinical lifetime dose of 60 kDa PEG received from BAY 94-9027. A literature evaluation of the safety and elimination of PEGylated proteins (PEG ≥30 kDa) is provided, and this information is consistent with the lack of toxicity seen for 60 kDa PEG here. The data indicate that long-term treatment with BAY 94-9027 will not result in PEG-related systemic toxicity.</p>

<p>The use of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in colony-forming cell (CFC) assays to test the effects of environmental toxins, chemotherapeutics, and other drug classes has been well documented. These assays have been used to screen compounds for toxicity before the initiation of costly clinical trials and as a tool to help determine maximum tolerated doses (MTDs). While several assays exist for studying different progenitor types, a great deal of research has focused on use of the colony forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) assay as a measure of the progenitors of the granulocytic/monocytic lineage. In fact, this assay has been optimized and validated for use as an <italic>in vitro</italic> predictor of acute-onset neutropenia by potential hematotoxicants. Choice of species is an important consideration when testing a new drug. Mouse CFC assays can be an important tool for determining toxic doses before committing to an <italic>in vivo</italic> study. Previous studies by Pessina et al. (Tox Sci. 2003. 75:355-367) indicate that for many drugs, human maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) can be predicted by adjusting mouse-derived MTDs. However, some studies indicate that significant differences exist among human, canine, rat and mouse hematosensitivities to certain pharmaceuticals/toxins, with human cells showing higher sensitivity to the toxic effects of the compounds studied. Consequently, information from comparative CFC assays may be of great importance before entering clinical trials. Recent studies were conducted using chemotherapeutics and an environmental toxin to evaluate their effects on myeloid (CFU-GM) progenitors acquired from human, canine, rat and mouse bone marrow. The resulting data show that while all tested compounds displayed a dose-dependent toxic effect on colony growth, each compound demonstrated species specificity. While conditions in the human body cannot be completely reproduced <italic>in vitro</italic>, CFC assays can be used to help bridge the gap between high throughput screening technologies and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies.</p>

<p>Most nonclinical/clinical drug safety assessments are conducted in developmentally mature subjects, which may not represent the most appropriate test sample for evaluating compounds with pediatric-specific indications. When children are the primary population, age-appropriate studies in juvenile animals are important for assessing direct toxic or developmental risks. With emerging trends in biologics, the necessity of conducting juvenile toxicology studies in non-human primates (NHP) will likely increase. The purpose of this study was to characterize the postnatal developmental progression of key cardiovascular safety endpoints in approximately 7-14 month old juvenile NHPs. To assure a comprehensive evaluation, utilizing continuous data sampling procedures without complications associated with chemical or physical restraint; eight recently weaned cynomolgus macaques were surgically instrumented with radiotelemetry transmitters to measure systemic arterial pressures and body temperature, and to record a standard electrocardiogram (ECG). A pressure-sensitive catheter was introduced femorally and positioned within the descending aorta, and bipolar electrode implanted to record a Lead II ECG. To facilitate long-term vascular access, a femoral venous catheter was implanted and connected to a subcutaneous vascular access port. Heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature and the ECG were collected according to a bi-weekly schedule using PoNeMah (Ver 4.1) software. Telemetry data, including standard ECG reference intervals (RR, PR, QRS, QT, QTc), heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature will be presented and compared to a reference historical control dataset previously collected from a large sample of adult NHP subjects (Gauvin et al., 2006, J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods 53:140-51). The nature and putative bases for observed differences in baseline values for these physiological variables between adult and developing juvenile animals will be discussed.</p>

<p>Several renal injury biomarkers can outperform or add value to conventional serum BUN and creatinine (sCr) in rat toxicology studies. Here we report daily measurement of exploratory urinary biomarkers of renal function, tissue injury and leakage during 15 day studies in rats treated with doxorubicin (DOX), or cisplatin (CDDP). Biomarker results are compared to terminal histopathology and serum chemistries (pretest, d7 and terminal). Renal histopathology showed dose-dependent glomerular, proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) and collecting duct damage in DOX-treated animals and PCT necrosis in CDDP-treated animals. Serum BUN and sCr were unchanged compared to vehicle controls in all treatment groups. In contrast to BUN and sCr, albuminuria increased in DOX-treated animals compared to vehicle (high dose at d4 and low dose at d7). Albumin increases were followed by changes in other functional biomarkers (d6-7 high dose, d9-10 low dose) such as β<sub>2</sub> microglobulin and cystatin C which were then followed by inducible injury marker responses (d8-10 high dose, d13-15 low dose) such as KIM-1, lipocalin-2 and clusterin. Biomarker responses matched well with type and incidence of histopathology findings. Biomarker profile in CDDP-treated animals differed from that seen in DOX-treated animals, consistent with a mechanistic link between biomarker and type of injury. These results suggest differences in biomarker profiles are indicative of direct and indirect PCT damage. The dose-related onset and severity of injury also matched well with temporal biomarker responses in both models.</p>

<p>Captisol<sup>®</sup> (β-cyclodextrin sulfobutyl ether sodium salt) is an excipient used in toxicology studies to solubilize and stabilize test materials. To evaluate the potential for vehicle effects on cardiovascular (CV) parameters with Captisol<sup>®</sup>, beagle dogs (n = 2 females/group; instrumented with left ventricular and aortic pressure sensors) received i.v. doses (6 mL/kg as 1- to 2-minute bolus doses via catheters placed in the cephalic vein) of saline (0.9%) or Captisol<sup>®</sup> (12% in purified water, pH 6). CV parameters (systolic, diastolic, mean arterial, and pulse pressure, dP/dt<sub>max</sub>, and heart rate) and body temperatures were measured 30 min pre-dose through 3.5 hrs post-dose. The dogs were placed in slings for the duration of CV data collection. Noteworthy clinical signs occurred only with Captisol<sup>®</sup> and included tremor, loss of consciousness, loss of muscle control, and/or aggression. A transient increase in heart rate occurred with both saline and Captisol<sup>®</sup> that persisted only during the 1- to 2-minute dosing interval. With saline, there were no appreciable effects on blood pressure or inotropy. Captisol<sup>®</sup> caused a biphasic blood pressure response, with an initial increase followed by a severe ( &gt; 50%) transient decrease that necessitated the i.v. administration fluids to 1 dog as rescue therapy. A decrease in left ventricular inotropic state was noted in the dogs treated with Captisol<sup>®</sup>. Because of the concomitant decrease in blood pressure, it was not possible to determine if the decreased inotropy was a direct effect or secondary to a decrease in afterload.</p>

<p>A positive control study was conducted with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) to support training on identification of fetal anomalies. Rats (10-12/group) were administered a single dose of ASA orally by gavage at 0 or 500 mg/kg (5 mL/kg in 0.2% methylcellulose) on gestation day (GD) 9, 10, 11, or 12. A laparohysterectomy was performed on GD 21 and fetuses were weighed and examined for external, visceral, and skeletal anomalies. Postimplantation loss was increased in the GD 9 and 10 groups (mean of 54.2% and 13.3% vs. 3.5% in controls). In the GD 9 group, this was due to increased dead fetuses (mean of 1.0 vs. 0 in controls), early resorptions (6.3 vs. 0.6 in controls), and late resorptions (0.6 vs. 0 in controls); but was due to increased early resorptions in the GD 10 group (2.0 vs. 0.6 in controls). There was a resultant decrease in the number of live fetuses in the GD 9 and 10 groups (7.0 and 12.8 vs. 15.4 in controls). Neural tube, abdominal wall, and tail anomalies were observed in the GD 9 group, and cleft lip/palate in the GD 9, 10, and 11 groups. Cardiovascular, reproductive, liver, renal, adrenal, spleen, and diaphragm anomalies were observed with the overall group incidence in the order GD 9 &gt; 10 &gt; 11 &gt; 12. The most common anomalies were great vessel transposition, absent aortic arch, ectopic testes/ovaries, abnormal liver lobation, absent diaphragm; and supernumerary kidney (GD 11 &gt; 9). Axial skeletal development was markedly affected in the GD 9 group with numerous skull, rib, sternebral, and vertebral anomalies, most notably absent and fused structures. In conclusion, ASA administration to rats during major organogenesis resulted in embryolethality and/or malformations, which is consistent with the published literature. A single oral dose on GD 9 produced the most severe effects, followed by GD 10, and to a lesser extent GD 11 and 12.</p>

<p>The purpose of the presented study was to characterize the response of biomarkers for photocarcinogenicity of high doses of simulated sunlight (UVR) and the combination of 8-Methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and UVR. Both exposure to UVR alone and 8-MOP+UVR are known to enhance photocarcinogensis in mice and humans, and were chosen to evaluate biomarker response as a surrogate for skin tumor development in hairless mice. The employed biomarkers included apoptosis as determined by sunburn cell production, cell proliferation as determined by incorporation of bromo-deoxyuridine during DNA synthesis, epidermal cellularity and thickness, and dermal inflammatory infiltration. Clinical observations, skin reaction observations, body weights and skin thickness measurements were recorded. Six groups of albino hairless mice were treated over 13 weeks as follows: untreated control, UVR low dose (600 Robertson-Berger Units/week (RBU/wk)), UVR mid dose (1200 RBU/wk), UVR high dose (2400 RBU/wk), 8-MOP low dose + UVR low dose, 8-MOP high dose + UVR low dose. Low dose 8-MOP formulation concentration was 0.01 mg/mL (100µL/25 cm<sup>2</sup>) in Weeks 1-8 and 0.1 mg/mL in Weeks 9-13. High dose 8-MOP formulation concentration was 0.1 mg/mL in Weeks 1-8 and 1 mg/mL in Weeks 9-13. UVR caused a dose-related increase in all biomarkers. The combination of 8-MOP and UVR had only minimal effects on biomarkers at the low dose of 8 MOP, whereas the effects of high dose of 8-MOP with UVR were generally greater than UVR alone. Skin reaction observations and skin thickness measurements generally correlated well with the biomarker results. The findings indicate that the evaluated biomarkers were clearly affected by two stimuli known to enhance photocarcinogenesis: simulated sunlight exposure alone; and a phototoxic regimen (8-MOP + UVR).</p>

<p>The objective of this study was to assess the modified contextual fear conditioning (CFC) testing paradigm utilized at WIL Research Laboratories, LLC, using scopolamine hydrochloride as the positive control agent. The animals used for this study consisted of adult Long Evans males (n = 10/group), approximately 12 weeks of age at initiation of testing. The CFC assessments took place over 2 days, with the initial training on Day 1, followed by cue and contextual testing on Day 2. Animals were given an intraperitoneal injection of either scopolamine (20 mg/kg) or vehicle (saline) approximately 15 minutes following the completion of training. Training on Day 1 consisted of a single 3 minute session in which a 2 second 0.5 mA foot shock (aversive stimulus) was paired with an 85 dB auditory tone (neutral stimulus). Context Testing on Day 2 consisted of a single 5 minute session without the aversive and neutral stimuli. Cue testing on Day 2 consisted of single 6 minute session with a modified floor overlay and presentation of the neutral stimulus. The parameters included freeze count, percent time freezing, time spent freezing, and average motion index were recorded and analyzed quantitatively. As expected, there were no differences between either treatment groups during training on Day 1. However, both context and cue testing on Day 2 indicated impaired performance in the scopolamine versus vehicle treated group with an increased number of freeze counts, decreased time spent freezing, decreased percent time spent freezing and increased motion index over each test session. Therefore, these results validate that the methodologies and testing procedures described at WIL Research.</p>

<p>The objective of this study was to assess the drug discrimination (DD) testing paradigm utilized at WIL Research Laboratories, LLC, using morphine as the reference compound with test drug substitutions including tramadol hydrochloride, oxycodone hydrochloride and morphine sulfate in the rat within the scope of the European Medicines Agency guidelines. The animals used for this study consisted of adult Sprague Dawley males (n = 12-16), approximately 8 weeks of age at initiation of training and testing. Rats were first trained by food pellet reinforcement under a fixed ratio (FR) 20 schedule to discriminate between the compound associated levers when administered the reference compound (RC), morphine (5.6 mg/kg), or the vehicle control (saline) via intraperitoneal injection approximately 30 minutes prior to the drug discrimination session. Discrimination testing was conducted following compound substitution of the following test drugs: tramadol at 1.0, 10, 20 and 30 mg/kg; oxycodone at 1.0, 5.0, 10 and 20.0 mg/kg; and morphine at 0.3, 3.0, and 9.0 mg/kg. Using this paradigm, the first 20 lever presses were reported as the relative percent of RC lever selection. The results of this study showed RC lever selection ( &gt; 80%) for substitution with oxycodone (5.0 mg/kg) and morphine (5.6 and 9.0 mg/kg). Tramadol resulted in intermediate levels of substitution over the dose levels administered, with RC lever selection between 10 and 60%. Also, the remaining dosage levels for each compound did not fully substitute (RC level selection below 25%) or substitution assessment criteria were not achieved (failure to complete the first FR) over the high dose levels administered. The DD testing paradigm was able to characterize the selected compounds for their known discriminative potential. Therefore, these results validate that the methodologies described at WIL Research are in accordance with the EMEA guidelines.</p>

<p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of Kinder Scientific Startle Response Chamber, Kinder Scientific Motor Activity Chamber and Complex water T-maze to detect decreases and increases (as appropriate) in each endpoint following treatment with various CNS acting compounds in adult male and female Sprague-Dawley Crl: CD rats. For each neurobehavioral assessment and compound, separate subsets of 20 rats/sex were assigned to each control and treatment group. To assess decreased auditory startle response, chlorpromazine was administered (SQ) at dosage levels of 0, 2 and 10 mg/kg on PND 60. For increased auditory startle response, amphetamine was administered (IP) at dosage levels of 0, 1.0 and 5.0 mg/kg on PND 60. To assess decreased motor activity, haloperidol was administered (IP) at dosage levels of 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 mg/kg prior to behavioral testing on PND 61. For assessments of increased motor activity, amphetamine was administered (IP) at dosage levels of 0, 1.0 and 5.0 mg/kg on PND 61. For impaired learning/memory performance, scopolamine was administered (IP) twice daily at dosage levels of 0, 0.5, 1.5 mg/kg from PND 62-68. The results of this neurobehavioral study in adult rats found that treatment on PND 60 with chlorpromazine resulted in a dose dependent decrease in the maximum force across all blocks of trials, with an increase in the time to reach the maximum force. Amphetamine-treated males and females exhibited an increase in the mean maximum response force on PND 60. Treatment with haloperidol caused a dose-dependent decrease in locomotor activity (total activity counts and ambulatory counts) for both male and female rats at PND 61. Amphetamine treatment resulted in an increase in locomotor activity (mean total and ambulatory activity) in male and female rats on PND 61. Scopolamine administration from PND 62-68 resulted in a generalized and dose dependent impairment, with an increased time to escape the maze and increased error number. Therefore, these results validate that the methodologies and testing procedures described at WIL Research.</p>

<p>XOMA 3AB is being evaluated for the treatment and prevention of botulinum toxin type A (BoNT/A) poisoning. XOMA 3AB is composed of an equimolar mixture of three human or humanized IgG<sub>1</sub> monoclonal antibodies (mAb), referred to as NX01, NX02 and NX11, that target unique non-overlapping regions on BoNT/A. These antitoxin mAbs bind to BoNT/A resulting in rapid clearance of the toxin from the systemic circulation. Nonclinical safety evaluation pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicology studies were conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats to support the clinical development of XOMA 3AB. The PK of XOMA 3AB was evaluated in rats for 71 days following a single intravenous injection at dose levels 0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg. XOMA 3AB was administered weekly for five weeks by intravenous injection at doses up to 50 mg/kg and by intramuscular injection at a dose level of 3 mg/kg for toxicology assessment. Parameters evaluated included clinical observations, food consumption, body weights, clinical pathology, ophthalmology, urinalysis, macroscopic and microscopic evaluation. Bioanalytical assays were developed using an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) format to measure the individual mAbs in rat serum. An ECL assay was also developed to measure total anti-drug antibodies to XOMA 3AB. The results show that NX01, NX02 and NX11 have similar PK profiles and demonstrate a dose proportional bi-exponential decline in initial and terminal half-lives, clearance and volume of distribution. The half-lives of NX01, NX02 and NX11 ranged from 12.4 to 17.2 days. Animals with anti-drug antibodies showed increased clearance of XOMA 3AB from the serum. There were no toxicologically significant findings related to administration of XOMA 3AB to rats. The no-observable-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) following intravenous administration was ≥ 50 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. In summary, the three mAb components of XOMA 3AB show similar PK profiles following IV and IM injection, and there were no drug-related adverse toxicological findings in rats.</p>

<p>PRO044 is a 2’-O-methyl phosphorothioate RNA antisense oligonucleotide (AON) product that is currently being developed for the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), a lethal orphan disease for which currently no therapy exists. The fundamental cause of this disease is mutations in the DMD gene leading to out of frame transcripts for the muscle protein dystrophin. AON-induced exon skipping of exon 44 in the human dystrophin pre-mRNA results in the restoration of the reading frame and might result in a (partially) functional dystrophin protein. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of PRO044 was assessed using <italic>in vitro</italic> tests in bacteria and mammalian cells and an <italic>in vivo</italic> rodent assay. The bacterial reverse mutation assay (i.e. Ames test using <italic>Salmonella typhimurium </italic>TA98, TA100, TA102, TA1535 and TA1537) showed that PRO044 has no mutagenic activity at concentrations up to 10.000 µg per plate, in the presence or absence of an <italic>in vitro</italic> metabolic activation system (S9-mix). The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) chromosomal aberration assay showed that PRO044 did not induce structural aberrations in the presence or absence of S9-mix, up to the maximum tested concentration of 5.000 µg/mL. In addition, PRO044 didn’t induce any polyploidy nor gave indications of mutagenic properties in the presence or absence of S9-mix at 5.000 µg/mL. In the <italic>in vivo</italic> micronucleus assay, no genotoxic effect was observed in the bone marrow of mice following repeated subcutaneous administrations at three PRO044 dose levels (i.e. 80, 200 and 500 mg/kg on days 1, 3, 5 and 8) resulting in a weekly exposure of 320, 800 or 2.000 mg/kg. In conclusion, results from the above mentioned tests demonstrate that PRO044 is not mutagenic nor clastogenic which confirms the uniform consensus that 2’O-methyl AONs do not exert mutagenic nor clastogenic effects.</p>

<p>One of the class toxicities of phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) is the activation of the complement pathway shown in non-human primates. Rapid infusion of high levels of AONs can result in clinical, hematologic, and hemodynamic disturbances. This condition has been linked to the activation of the alternative complement pathway, since complement split products C3a and Bb were shown to increase in plasma, which may activate neutrophils and macrophages. In order to assess the predictive value of <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis of the levels of the complement split factors C3a and Bb, monkey plasma was incubated with AONs PRO044 and PRO046 (containing a full 2′O-methylated backbone) and compared to <italic>in vivo</italic> data obtained with cynomolgus monkeys treated with these AONs. The mentioned AONs are currently developed by Prosensa for the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), by means of exon skipping. As a positive control, monkey plasma was also incubated with cobra venom factor (CVF). <italic>In vitro</italic>, levels of C3a and Bb increased upon exposure to the AONs and CVF. <italic>In vivo,</italic> a similar activation pattern of the alternative pathway was found for the tested AONs. These results indicate that an <italic>in vitro</italic> screening of the activation of complement pathway by AONs can be used to predict <italic>in vivo </italic>complement activation in monkeys. Activation of the alternative pathway by AONs was also tested in human plasma. PRO044 did not activate the alternative complement pathway, while PRO046 and CVF showed an increase in the levels of complement split factors C3a and Bb. In contrast to PRO044, PRO046 has been shown to form multimers, which seems to be a stimulating factor for complement activation. These results substantiate that the activation of the alternative pathway by 2′O-methyl AONs is sequence and species specific and that monkeys are more sensitive than humans.</p>

<p>PRO044 is a 2′-O-methyl phosphorothioate RNA antisense oligonucleotide (AON) product that is currently being developed for the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). The aim of PRO044 is to restore the human dystrophin pre-mRNA reading frame by means of exon skipping, resulting in a (partially) functional dystrophin protein. In order to identify potential signals that could subsequently be monitored in human clinical trials, PRO044 was tested in several safety pharmacology studies. The overt central and peripheral nervous system effects were assessed in mice, by means of the so-called IRWIN test. Actions on respiratory and cardiovascular systems were tested in the <italic>in vitro</italic> electro-conductivity (so-called hERG) assay and an <italic>in vivo</italic> study using non-human primates. In the IRWIN test, repeated subcutaneous administrations of PRO044 at dose levels of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg on test days 1, 3, 5 and 8, did not result in any effect on neurobehavioral functional assessments reflecting normal central and peripheral nervous system activity. In the hERG assay, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing the potassium channel hERG were exposed to PRO044 and the channel tail current was measured by means of the patch-clamp technique. No effects on the channel tail current were observed after exposure to PRO044 concentrations of 15, 75 and 150 μM, corresponding to 0.11, 0.55 and 1.09 mg/ml, respectively. Cardiovascular and respiratory effects potentially induced by PRO044 were investigated in a sub-chronic repeated dose study in monkeys. No changes in ECG parameters, including QT intervals up to 13 weeks at a maximum dose of 54 mg PRO044/kg/week were observed. In conclusion, no PRO044-induced effects were observed in the tested battery of safety pharmacology studies.</p>

<p>D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) is a valuable excipient for hydrophilic and lipophilic drug vehicles because it is an emulsifier, solubilizer, and absorption enhancer. However, TPGS has been said to affect (mask) drug effects because of potential anti cancer/anti-oxidant effects. Tocopherol succinate (TS), the vitamin E (VitE) form in TPGS, has anti-cancer/anti-oxidant effects in vitro and when injected into tumors or given intraperitoneally (IP) in animal cancer models. When TPGS is administered orally (PO), TS is hydrolyzed in the gastrointestinal tract to tocopherol (TOC), the less active VitE. The goal of this study was to evaluate TS exposure after PO TPGS, 2 groups of rats (N = 10/group) were given different TPGS-containing vehicles for 7 days: 60% polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG-400)/40% TPGS (550 mg/kg/d TS) or aqueous 75% 0.1 M phosphate buffer/15% PEG-400/5% polyvinyl pyrrolidone/5% TPGS (70 mg/kg/d TS). Two control groups received daily PO PEG-400 (no VitE supplement) or IP TS (100 mg/kg, days 1, 3, 5, 7). On Day 8, plasma, liver, kidney, brain, and adrenal TS and TOC concentrations were measured by LC-MS. Plasma and tissue TS and TOC were not significantly increased after PO TPGS vehicles and TS was poorly absorbed when given PO. These data support the conclusion that VitE concentrations are not significantly increased in rats following PO TPGS, even at a TS dose of 550 mg/kg/d. Thus, TPGS-containing drug vehicles are unlikely to mask drug effects in PO toxicity studies.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s Disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder in the United States. Its pathology is characterized by a selective loss of pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra resulting in dopamine depletion. Pesticides causing chemical alterations that lead to neuronal apoptosis will also hinder the production of this neurotransmitter, possibly resulting in Parkinsonism or other diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. The present study investigated the effects of Maneb and Mancozeb pesticides in PC12 cells, which resemble the chemistry and physiology of dopaminergic neurons. Cells were treated with a 20 μM Maneb and 20 μM Mancozeb for 1 hour. Using MTT toxicology assay Maneb and Mancozeb treated cells showed a decrease in mitochondrial function of 24.64% and 21.56% respectively. These PC12 groups were then treated with Polyphenols (10 μM), known to be potent ROS scavengers, in order to study potential neuroprotective effects. No PC12 cell survival was observed in affected cells treated with Polyphenols suggesting that Maneb and Mancozeb do not act as oxidative stressors or that neuron death results from multiple mechanisms in which oxidative stress is not the driving event. DNA fragmentation was also examined using comet-assay. DNA breakage was evident in Maneb and Mancozeb exposed groups, demonstrating that these neurotoxins are capable of causing considerable genetic damage. Findings indicate that both pesticides do in fact disrupt PC12 mitochondrial function and cause DNA damage. This study confirmed the neurotoxicity of Maneb and Mancozeb adding to their relevance in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>A short-term 5-day nose-only smoke exposure study was conducted in Fisher 344 rats to identify smoke-induced tracheal protein changes. Groups of 10 male and female 5 wk old rats were assigned to 1 of 4 exposure groups. Animals received filtered air, or 75, 200 or 400 mg total particulate matter (TPM)/m<sup>3</sup> of diluted 3R4F Kentucky reference cigarette mainstream smoke. Exposures were conducted for 3 hrs/day, for 5 consecutive days. Half of the tracheal tissue was processed for pathology, and the other half frozen immediately for proteomics. We hypothesized that smoke activated tracheal inflammatory and stress-induced pathways. Mucosal epithelial toxicity from the inhaled material was evidenced by cilia loss in smoke-treated animals. Tracheal changes in females were more severe than in males. Mucosal atrophy occurred in females in the 200 mg TPM/m<sup>3</sup> group. In the 400 mg TPM/m<sup>3</sup> group mucosal epithelial hyperplasia was evident, but was more severe in females. Tracheal lysates from control vs. treated animals were screened for 800 proteins using antibody-based microarray technology and subsequently the 18 most changed proteins evaluated by Western blot. Tracheal proteins expressed at high levels that were markedly increased or decreased by smoke treatment depended on dose and gender and included: caspase 5, ERK 1/2, p38, protein phosphatase 2Cα (PP2C/α), protein phosphatase 6 catalytic subunit (PP6C) and pyruvate kinase, muscle (PKM2). Thus, smoke affected protein pathways include stress, inflammation, tumor suppression, cell cycle control, cell proliferation and survival, apoptosis, and transformation. Inflammatory protein changes occurred with proteomics and pathology. Changes in identified proteins affected by smoke exposure may induce functional tracheal changes and could serve as early indicators of tracheal damage and associated disease.</p>

<p>The initiation of cigarette smoking related lung damage in both acute and chronic exposure conditions is associated with inflammation in smokers’ lung concomitant with the recruitment of inflammatory cells to sites of airway injury. We developed a novel <italic>in vitro</italic> cell system to model conditions related to smoke-exposed human lung by exposing normal human lung epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) co-cultured with human macrophage inflammatory cells (U937) to mainstream cigarette smoke. The co-culture was exposed in a chamber attached to a smoking machine which delivered various amount of mainstream smoke from one, two or three 3R4F Kentucky reference cigarettes (ISO smoking conditions). The system was incubated for 24 hours in a cell culture incubator prior to cytotoxicity and inflammatory cytokines analysis. Exposure to 1, 2, 3 cigarettes smoke resulted in about 15%, 50%, 80% cell death, respectively. The co-culture supernatant was analyzed for a 42-plex human cytokine panel. Cytokine release was independent of U937 number in the absence of smoke, but 8 of 42 cytokines were unique to U937 in smoke exposed co-culture indicating the role of U937 cells in smoke response. The levels of most cytokines were inhibited at 2 or 3 cigarette smoke exposure due to cytotoxicity. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> co-culture study indicates that the presence of macrophage-like inflammatory cells, U937, is essential to induce various inflammatory responses typically seen in animal and human smoking conditions. This co-culture system provides an improved, relevant platform for toxicological inflammatory testing for cigarette ingredients and prototypes.</p>

<p>2, 2-Bis (bromomethyl)-1, 3-propanediol (BMP) is a brominated flame retardant found in urethane foams and polyester resins. In a two year dietary study, BMP caused neoplastic lesions at multiple sites including the urinary bladder of both rats and mice. However, liver is not a target tissue in this study. To help understand the mechanism(s) of BMP-induced carcinogenesis, this in vitro study investigated BMP-induced DNA strand breaks in a target cell line (UROtsa cells, a human uroepithelial cell line) and in non-target cells (primary rat hepatocytes). Strand breaks were assessed using the comet assay. Following 1 h of exposure, BMP (10-100 µM) significantly increased the extent of DNA strand breaks in UROtsa cells. However, this DNA damaging effect of BMP was not observed in rat hepatocytes under the same conditions applied to UROtsa cells. Evidence indicates that oxidative stress contributes to the DNA damage associated with exposure of UROtsa cells to BMP. These evidences include a concentration and time dependent increase in ROS generation following BMP exposure; complete attenuation of BMP induced DNA strand breaks by the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (2 mM) pretreatment, and oxidative base modifications measured in the human 8-hydroxyguanine DNA-glycosylase1 (hOGG1) modified comet assay. Total content of intracellular GSH quantified in UROtsa cells (4.8 ± 0.7 nmol/mg protein) was 4 fold lower than that in hepatocytes (20.3 ± 0.8 nmol/mg protein) suggesting UROtsa cells may have inadequate antioxidant defense mechanisms. In addition, as opposed to the rat hepatocytes, UROtsa cells lack the ability to biotransform BMP. HPLC analysis indicated BMP was not metabolized and/or consumed in UROtsa cells at any of the concentrations tested (10-250 µM). However, in rat hepatocytes, BMP was extensively converted to a mono-glucuronide at low concentrations (&lt;50 µM). The extent of glucuronidation decreased at higher concentrations (125-250 µM). These results demonstrate that a target cell line such as UROtsa cells are more susceptible to BMP induced DNA damage when compared to non-target cells (hepatocytes). This increased susceptibility of damage to DNA in UROtsa cells may relate to the deficiency of antioxidant and/or metabolic capabilities in UROtsa cells. The role of this oxidative DNA damage in BMP-induced carcinogenesis remains to be established.</p>

<bold>RATIONALE</bold>: Cigarette smoke is the major cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), yet pathogenic mechanisms are not fully understood. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the major regulators of endothelial cell survival and is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Fibroblasts are a significant source of VEGF in the lungs; however the effect of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) stimulation of VEGF release by fibroblasts is not fully understood. We hypothesized that disturbed VEGF release by human lung fibroblasts in response to CSE is a potential pathogenetic mechanism that could contribute to COPD. <bold>METHODS: </bold>CSE was prepared by modification of the methods of Carp and Janoff (<italic>Am. Rev. Respir. Dis, </italic>1978). Human fetal lung fibroblasts (HFL-1) were exposed to different concentrations of CSE (2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10% in serum free media) and for different durations (24, 48 and 72 hours). VEGF release into the media was measured using Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). TGF-β1/Smad3 as a potential pathway for the observed effect was also investigated using Smad3 siRNA. <bold>RESULTS: </bold>CSE induced VEGF release by HFL-1 was observed 48 hours after exposure and increased further after 72 hours. The increase in VEGF release by CSE exposed HFL-1 (79.8 ± 11.4 pg/105 cells at 48 hrs 10% CSE exposure and 169.8 ± 19.3 pg /105 cells at 72 hrs of 10% CSE) was significantly higher than that of control (38.38 ± 3.2 pg/105 cells at 48 hrs and 47 ± 6.5 pg/105 at 72 hrs, both (P &lt; 0.05). The effect of CSE on VEGF release by HFL-1 cells was concentration dependent. In addition, CSE stimulated release of VEGF from adult lung fibroblasts (7.2 ± 3.3 pg/105 cells at 0% CSE and 71 ± 31.5 pg/105 at 10% CSE). Suppression of Smad3 by siRNA not only eliminated the stimulatory effect of CSE on VEGF release (219.3 ± 35.8 pg/105 cells of the non-targeting control-siRNA vs 70 ± 9.6 pg/105 cells of the Smad3-siRNA transfected cells, p &lt; 0.05), but also inhibited baseline VEGF production (84.1 ± 0.75 pg/105 cells of control-siRNA vs 26.2 ± 4.4 pg/105 cells of Smad3-siRNA, p &lt; 0.05). Nicotine as a major CSE component did not inhibit VEGF release by HFL-1 in dose and time dependent effect. <bold>CONCLUSIONS: </bold>Our data indicates that CSE stimulates VEGF release by lung fibroblasts and Smad3 may modulate the stimulation of VEGF release. Nicotine is not the active agent responsible for this response in HFL-1. The ability of lung fibroblasts to produce VEGF may play a role in repair following injury and disease pathogenesis.</p>

<p>Selection of suitable vehicles and/or excipients is critical in both non-clinical and clinical studies as formulation impacts the intrinsic characteristics of the final drug product, e.g. (extended) release, absorption, distribution and (local) tolerance, to mention some. Inappropriate selection of vehicles and/or excipients can have negative impact on drug evaluation (which may be unwarranted) and consequently delay or stop development. This type of information is available for mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and non-human primates (NHP), but information specific to minipigs is scarce.</p>
<p>More than forty marketed drug products (FDA/EMA dossiers) have been reviewed and vehicles and excipients used are presented in this poster. Data includes information on route of administration, dosage, study duration, and (where possible) notable reactions. Published literature on this topic is also included.

<p>With recent publications from the European RETHINK Project on the evaluation of the minipig as an alternative non-rodent species in toxicity testing, and following recommendations to systematically take minipigs into account during selection of an appropriate species, it is important to evaluate the background historical data and assess the suitability of the animal model for various routes of administration. Minipigs have been used by Charles River Laboratories as a non-rodent species for toxicity testing over more than 20 years. Pharmacokinetic, safety pharmacology, and toxicity studies using various dose routes including oral (gavage and pilling), intravenous and subcutaneous injections or infusion as well as studies utilizing target tissue dosing; dermal and ocular (instillation, intravitreal and subretinal injections) administrations have been conducted in minipigs. Dosing regimens varied from a single dose to 26 week daily administration (oral or IV infusion). Data types collected included clinical observations, body weights, food consumption, electrocardiograms, electroretinograms, ophthalmology, ocular pressure, blood pressure, clinical pathology (hematology, clinical biochemistry) and anatomic pathology (organ weights, macroscopic and microscopic findings). Comparisons of basic parameters obtained from control minipigs surgically instrumented or surgically manipulated, with that of minipigs given control substances orally, revealed that data sets were generally comparable, with predictable variability observed in parameters affected by differences in study design inherent to each route of administration. In conclusion, models utilizing the minipig are considered to be predictable and a suitable alternative as a non-rodent species for use in toxicology studies.</p>

<p>In the US, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) established that the manufacturer or distributor is responsible for ensuring that its dietary supplements are safe before they are marketed. Unlike drugs, FDA does not approve dietary supplements for safety or effectiveness before they are marketed. However, a manufacturer or distributor of a new dietary ingredient (NDI) submits a notification to FDA containing safety data to support the proposed use of the NDI. Although FDA does not opine on the safety of the NDI, it may issue an adverse status statement declaring the notification contains an “inadequate basis for reasonable expectation of safety.” To prevent this, an adequate and appropriate NDI safety dossier is needed. The authors investigate how various manufacturing process changes and various product use scenarios proposed for the NDI alter the needs of the safety data set. Strategies for assembling adequate safety data to support the use of the NDI are discussed. The authors analyzed the potential impacts of various processing methods for select ingredients on the safety of the NDI and its components. While minor changes in volatile components or concentration in aqueous solution or a solid in suspension may have no significant impact on composition and hence safety, other changes such as hydrolysis or esterification, removal of some components by chromatography, distillation or filtration may change the chemical composition of the NDI. Processing with a solvent other than water or aqueous ethanol to make an extract of the NDI may also change the chemical composition of the ingredient. The impacts of several alternative processing methods on the requirements for the safety dossier are considered and alternative approaches to obtaining adequate and sufficient data are discussed. The authors describe a variety of assessment tools including bridging data from studies of components of the NDI; and conclude that sufficient data may be available for an NDI even when the NDI is produced using new methods or in new formulated products.</p>

<p>Through the collaborative work of contract research organizations (CROs), industry and FDA, the production release of the SEND (Standard for Exchange of Nonclinical Data) Implementation Guide v 3.0 has been completed (www.cdisc.org/send). A rapid adoption of this standard is planned, and regular submissions are expected in 2012. SEND benefits include increased reviewer efficiency and enhanced communications between CROs, sponsors, and FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). SEND supports automated creation of tables and graphs and allows data subsetting and mining, thus facilitating collaborative inter-industry efforts to interrogate information across boundaries. SEND will also enable FDA’s objective to develop a repository for all study data, clinical and nonclinical. SEND datasets are intended to replace data tabulations currently submitted as paper or PDFs; the study report will continue to provide methods and interpretive information. The purpose of SEND is to promote improvements in submission efficiency and quality through the establishment of a single international data standard for nonclinical data. Development of this standard began more than a decade ago and has gained momentum through piloting programs and the active participation of more than 50 volunteers across a wide array of pharmaceutical companies, CROs, vendors and the FDA. The current release defines standards for general toxicology, and carcinogenicity studies. Work is continuing to finalize standards for safety pharmacology and reproductive toxicology studies. CDER has already established processes and technology infrastructure to support the receipt, processing, review, and archiving of SEND formatted datasets.</p>

<title>P605 Anticaner Drug-Induced Cardiotoxicity: A Retrospective Analysis of the Accuracy of Nonclinical Safety Studies to Predict for Adverse Cardiovascular Events in the Clinic</title>

<p>Drug-induced cardiovascular toxicity can manifest as changes in blood pressure, arrhythmias (especially torsades de pointes induced by QT prolonging drugs), myocardial ischemia, thrombosis or impairment in myocardial contraction and/or relaxation. In the clinic, these toxicities can range from subclinical abnormalities to life-threatening and in some cases fatal events. Anticancer drugs have long been known to cause adverse cardiovascular events in the clinic. However, because these drugs are highly effective in settings where treatment options are limited, cardiovascular risk is rarely a development limiting barrier. The prevalence of literature highlighting anticancer drug-induced cardiovascular toxicity prompted us to conduct a meta-analysis to determine whether nonclinical safety data submitted for approval of these drugs accurately predicted for adverse cardiovascular events observed in the clinic. Inclusion criteria consisted of anticancer drugs with (1) cardiovascular toxicity listed as a “boxed warning” or “adverse event” on the drug label, and (2) accessible FDA or EMA drug approval package documents. Our results revealed that of the 33 anticancer drugs analyzed, approved between 1993 and 2011, only 17 had definitive findings of cardiovascular toxicity identified in nonclinical safety studies. Moreover, 2 drugs with boxed warnings for cardiovascular toxicity (trastuzumab and arsenic trioxide) had no indication of cardiac abnormalities in their nonclinical safety studies. Although results of this analysis suggest that traditional nonclinical safety studies may not accurately predict for anticancer drug-induced cardiotoxicity in the clinic, it should be noted that cancer patients represent a population with comorbidities and/or a history of prior treatment that may predispose them to adverse cardiotoxic events upon further drug administration. Taking this into account, the authors conclude that the addition of specialized nonclinical studies, including the use of stem cell derived cardiomyocytes as well as animal models with pre-existing disease or pre-exposure to relevant drugs (e.g. anthracyclines), may be useful when assessing the risk of anticancer drugs for cardiotoxicity in this complicated patient population.</p>

<p>Accessing toxicology data is challenging today because the data is located in many different places, with each database requiring the use of separate applications or web sites to search the information. Supplementing known information with results from multiple types of predictive models is often desirable; however, it can be difficult to use different software applications. This poster describes a prototype of an integrated prediction system that brings together toxicity data and predictions within a single graphical user interface running in a web browser. This user interface provides access to toxicology endpoints and studies from multiple databases, including public and proprietary data. The user is able to assess the toxicity of an existing or new compound using QSAR models or structural alerts from multiple suppliers including Leadscope, Inc., Lhasa Limited, and MultiCASE, Inc. The system was designed for use by scientists with different backgrounds; hence, it had to be easy to use and transparent to all stake holders. This poster will illustrate how the platform can be used to profile a set of compounds based on known toxicity information, browse prediction model results and explanations from multiple vendors and understand associations between different toxicity tests.</p>

<p>Regulatory guidances state that comparability assessment of biotechnology-derived products is required to assess the potential impact of manufacturing changes on quality, safety and efficacy. Nonclinical comparability programs are generally designed in a step-wise fashion. Physicochemical and biochemical analytical data and results of in vitro pharmacology assays inform decisions on whether or not in vivo nonclinical studies are warranted, and if so, how they should be designed. Regulatory guidances on monoclonal antibody development and comparability testing are largely silent on specific nonclinical study design features. A regulatory intelligence review of publicly available information was performed for 26 monoclonal antibody products approved from 1994 to 2011, with a focus on nonclinical in vitro and in vivo comparability programs as described in regulatory authority approval packages. When nonclinical studies were presented, comparative in vitro pharmacology studies and single-dose pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies were more common than repeat-dose toxicity studies, consistent with an incremental approach to comparability assessment. The implications of the results of the regulatory intelligence review for nonclinical development of innovator and biosimilar monoclonal antibody products are discussed.</p>

<p>Historical control data are important for the evaluation of certain histologic lesions identified during subchronic rodent toxicity studies. For uncommon lesions or lesions of uncertain relationship to the test article, historical control data can provide information about the incidence of spontaneously occurring background lesions in the species and strain of animal used on test. By providing this information, historical control data help support the significance (or lack thereof) of common and uncommon histopathology findings. In this work, an initial study was performed to investigate and develop a preliminary historical control database for the Harlan Rcc: Han Wistar rat strain at Covance Laboratories, Madison. Sixty male and sixty female Harlan RccHan: Wistar rats were sacrificed after 28, 90, or 180 days (360 animals total) of daily oral gavage dosing with reverse osmosis water. At initiation, animals were 4 to 8 weeks of age. Clinical signs, body weight, and food consumption were recorded; and hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis samples were analyzed. Animals were necropsied; macroscopic observations recorded; organs weighed; and tissues processed for microscopic evaluation. Electron microscopy was performed on selected tissues from a limited number of animals. Among the data analyzed, the incidence of spontaneously occurring nonneoplastic and neoplastic histologic lesions was determined and are presented in this work. Lesions included spontaneous degenerative and inflammatory changes, as well as a limited number of neoplasms. Additionally, histopathologic findings considered part of normal morphologic changes due to age progression are also discussed. Overall, the purpose of this data is to facilitate the selection of the most appropriate animal model for subchronic toxicity studies and to facilitate the interpretation of results using the Harlan RccHan: Wistar rat strain.</p>

<p>Screening of molecules as candidates in a new dermal drug program is mostly based on the desired pharmacological properties and potency of the molecules (e.g. anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, anti-microbial, etc.) and their “drugability” (chemical structure, solubility, etc. that lead to desirable ADME properties). However, once the screening procedure has reduced the number of dermal candidate molecules to a relatively small number, it is important to assess these molecules for potential adverse effects. For dermal drug candidates, which will reach a high concentration in the skin, local skin irritation, contact sensitization and phototoxicity, are important hazards that should be assessed before making the final selection. The skin penetration properties of these molecules, or the influence of various formulation ingredients on the penetration of the molecule into the skin are important. We propose a tiered battery of <italic>in silico</italic>, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays focused on providing a range of data to assist the development program in candidate selection for active ingredients and formulations. Once the final, optimised dermal drug candidate has been selected, a regulatory non-clinical safety program must be conducted to support clinical trial and marketing of the drug. The program will comply with regulatory guidance and be built in a step-wise manner to support each consecutive phase of the specific dermal clinical trial program. Important program and study design decisions to be made include: 1) choice of rodent and non-rodent species for the program, 2) choice of a suitable dermal vehicle for the non-clinical dermal studies, and 3) potential inclusion of systemic route of administration in the tox program.</p>

<p>LY2196044, a pan (kappa, mu and delta) opioid receptor antagonist under development for the treatment of alcohol use disorders was evaluated in a series of nonclinical acute, repeat-dose, reproductive and genetic toxicology and safety pharmacology studies. A single oral dose of 2000 mg/kg given to rats resulted in no important effects. Repeated oral doses of 1500 mg/kg to rats and dogs produced dose-limiting toxicity indicative of excitatory central nervous system (CNS) toxicity, including convulsions and increased mortality/euthanasia. In a rat 6-month study, males given 1500 mg/kg/day also exhibited atrophy/degeneration of the testes and histiocytosis in the ileum and mesenteric lymph node. These changes occurred at exposure levels ≥28x the exposure at the maximum proposed clinical dose of 250 mg and were completely (testes) or partially (ileum and lymph node) reversible following a 1-month recovery period. No clear adverse effects were observed in a 9-month dog study at doses up to 1000 mg/kg. LY2196044 was negative in a standard battery of genotoxicity tests and no adverse reproductive or developmental effects were observed at doses up to 1000 mg/kg in rats or 500 mg/kg in rabbits. In a mouse CNS safety pharmacology study, transient hypoactivity and enhanced effects of barbiturates were observed at 300 mg/kg. No substantive changes in cardiovascular function or QTc interval were observed in dogs at doses up to 800 mg/kg and no changes in respiratory function in rats or gastrointestinal motility in mice were observed at doses up to 300 mg/kg. In conclusion, the results of nonclinical toxicology and safety pharmacology studies demonstrate an acceptable safety profile for the clinical study of LY2196044. The lowest margins of safety (MOS) for LY2196044 based on systemic exposure from chronic rat and dog studies and the highest proposed clinical dose of 250 mg were 5-fold for Cmax (rats) and 6-fold for AUC (dog).</p>

<p>LOR-253 is a first-in-class inhibitor of the Metal Transcription Factor-1 (MTF-1) with a novel mode of action. This consists of the induction of the tumor suppressor factor Krüppel like factor 4 (KLF4) leading to the down regulation of cyclin D1, an important regulator of cell cycle progression and cell proliferation, and decreased expression of genes involved in tumor hypoxia and angiogenesis. The toxicity profile of LOR-253 HCl has been investigated in intravenous (IV) infusion toxicology studies in Sprague-Dawley rats and Beagle dogs. In the single-dose toxicity studies, LOR 253 HCl was administered by IV infusion (over 4 hours) to rats at doses up to 384 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and to dogs at doses up to 840 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. In rats, LOR 253 HCl was well tolerated at all dose levels tested and was not associated with any adverse effects or histopathological findings. In dogs, LOR 253 HCl was well tolerated up to 350 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, with the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) determined to be 840 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, based on changes in body weight, clinical chemistry parameters and kidney microscopic findings. In the pivotal GLP, 4-cycle toxicity studies in rats (0/125/200/350 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and dogs (0/175/250/350 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), a single cycle was equivalent to 5 consecutive days of dosing per week. Based on the results of these studies, the kidney, liver/biliary gland, and blood were identified as primary target organs of toxicity for LOR-253 HCl. Toxicokinetic results showed significant dose-related exposure. The results of the pivotal LOR-253 HCl toxicity studies in rats (STD10 &gt; 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and dogs (HNSTD = 250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) supported the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial in cancer patients at a starting dose of 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (1/10 of the STD10). In the Phase 1 trial, the dose frequency was reduced to a 2-day dosing period over 14 days based on supporting data from mouse xenograft studies.</p>

<p>Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) constitute an expanding class of therapeutic molecules in preclinical and clinical development for oncology indications. These biologic-based drugs are designed to increase delivery of cytotoxic payloads to tumor targets in order to improve efficacy and minimize toxicity. Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate-1 (STEAP1) is a multi-transmembrane, cell-surface antigen that is over expressed in the majority of human epithelial prostate cancers. STEAP1 ADC is comprised of anti-STEAP1 monoclonal antibody and monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). MMAE is a potent anti-mitotic agent that is conjugated to the antibody through an enzyme-cleavable linker. STEAP1 ADC has anti-tumor activity in STEAP1-positive explant and xenograft prostate cancer models. The safety profile of STEAP1 ADC was evaluated in antigen-dependent and antigen-independent animal models. The main clinical and anatomic pathology findings showed toxicities to the bone marrow, liver, and testis. These findings were considered antigen-independent, clinically manageable, and consistent with the anti-proliferative effects of MMAE. In summary, STEAP1 ADC shows favorable efficacy and safety profiles in nonclinical models and is currently being evaluated as a new therapy for prostate cancer patients.</p>

<p>Inhibition of the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) enzyme has been advocated as therapy for autoimmune disease, due to the important role of Syk in signaling downstream from immunoglobulin receptors on cells integral to the inflammatory process. CC-118 is a small molecule selective kinase inhibitor with high potency against the Syk target (enzyme IC<sub>50</sub> of 7 nM) and slightly less potency for the Janus kinase-2 (Jak2; enzyme IC<sub>50</sub> of 30 nM) and colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1-R; enzyme IC<sub>50</sub> of 28 nM) targets. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of CC-118 in Sprague-Dawley rats when dosed once daily via oral gavage for 7 days. In female rats dosed with 0, 50, 200, 400, and 1000 mg/kg/day, doses of 400 and 1000 mg/kg/day were not tolerated with deaths and/or early sacrifice required by Days 3 – 6. Doses of 0, 25, 50, and 200 mg/kg/day were well-tolerated in male rats. Accumulation of CC-118 was observed at doses greater than 200 mg/kg/day, resulting in both higher Cmax and AUC levels upon repeated dosing. Exposures were generally similar across doses between males and females. In both sexes, decreased body weight was observed at ≥200 mg/kg/day and relative spleen and thymus weights were decreased at ≥200 mg/kg/day. Hematological changes included increased neutrophil counts at ≥200 mg/kg/day and decreased white blood cell, lymphocyte, and eosinophil counts at 400 mg/kg/day. Increased serum blood urea nitrogen was observed at ≥200 mg/kg/day and serum alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase were observed at ≥200 mg/kg/day. At necropsy, the thymus and spleen were small and the mesenteric lymph nodes were mottled red. Microscopic changes consisted of myelosuppression (bone marrow hypocellularity) and lymph node erythrocytosis at ≥50 mg/kg/day and lymphoid depletion (thymus and spleen) and femur physeal dysplasia in females only at ≥200 mg/kg/day. These changes were generally attributed to inhibition of targeted kinases including Syk (lymphoid depletion), Jak2 (myelosuppression), and CSF1-R (physeal dysplasia, splenic red pulp atrophy, and elevated liver enzymes).</p>

<p>Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins suppress apoptosis and are overexpressed in a variety of cancers. GDC-0152 is a small molecule that triggers tumor cell apoptosis by selectively antagonizing IAPs. Several cytokines and chemokines are expressed in tumor cells as a result of GDC-0152-induced NFκB transcriptional activity, with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) being the most important for single-agent tumor activity. However, a variety of normal cells also produce TNFα upon IAP antagonism, which may contribute to both efficacy and toxicity. Here, we characterized the toxicology profile of GDC-0152 in rats and dogs following intravenous dose administration once every two weeks. Findings in both species consisted of a dose-related, acute inflammatory response and hepatic injury. Specifically, in-life observations included cytokine/chemokine production, an inflammatory leukogram, and elevated transaminases in addition to histopathological findings of inflammatory infiltrates and apoptosis/necrosis in multiple tissues. All findings were biologically linked, by direct or indirect mechanisms, to TNFα and are therefore expected to track with efficacy. The relationships between plasma cytokine/chemokine levels, specific pathology findings, and GDC-0152 plasma exposures were explored. Elevations in blood neutrophil count, serum MCP-1 and other markers of inflammation corresponded to GDC-0152 exposure and toxicity and show promise for further safety biomarker qualification.</p>

<p>The Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway is an endogenous protective mechanism promoting detoxification and cell survival against cellular stress and environmental insults. Previous research has demonstrated that the Nrf2-dependent defense response is imperative in protecting cells against arsenic toxicity. However, chronic activation of Nrf2 has been shown to be present in many types of cancers, contributing to chemoresistance. Here, we demonstrate that arsenic-mediated Nrf2 activation is dependent on p62, a specific substrate of autophagy, and can be attenuated when expression of p62 is silenced by siRNA. This noncanonical Nrf2 pathway results in a chronic, sustained increase of Nrf2 activation. Moreover, we demonstrate by live cell imaging that arsenic causes deregulation of autophagy, specifically resulting in accumulation of autophagosomes and leading to colocalization of Keap1, p62, and LC3 (a marker of autophagosomes). Utilizing a tandem RFP-GFP-LC3 construct, arsenic was shown to inhibit the later stages of autophagy, thereby affecting autophagic flux in <italic>in vitro </italic>models. Interestingly, the aforementioned arsenic-induced effects on autophagy were reversible by sulforaphane, a chemopreventive compound that specifically activates Nrf2 through the Keap1-mediated pathway. Collectively these findings provide experimental evidence that arsenic causes prolonged activation of Nrf2 through autophagy dysfunction, which may lead to a novel mechanism for arsenic carcinogenicity in humans.</p>

<p>Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is an innovative form of therapy that has recently been found to benefit acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients. Our laboratory has demonstrated that ATO stimulates oxidative stress therefore causing ATO-induced cytotoxicity in human leukemia (HL-60) cells. Pro-oxidants have been known to play a role in free radical-mediated oxidative stress. Cholecalciferol (vitamin D<sub>3</sub>), an active metabolite of vitamin D, inhibits the growth of a number of cancer types such as prostate, breast, colorectal, leukemia, and skin cancers. The specific aim of this research was to determine whether co-exposure to vitamin D<sub>3</sub> increases the efficacy of ATO through cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and apoptosis associated with increased ATO toxicity in human leukemia (HL-60) cells. In our current investigation, we performed the MTT assay and trypan blue exclusion test to measure cell viability. We also performed the lipid peroxidation assay to determine the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) production in HL-60 cells co-exposed to ATO and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in combination. The results of trypan blue exclusion and MTT assay indicated that vitamin D<sub>3</sub> exposure potentiates the toxic activity of ATO in HL-60 cells in a dose dependent manner. Co-administration of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> and ATO resulted in a significant (P &lt; 0.05) increase in MDA level compared to ATO alone. A statistically significant and dose-dependent increase (p &lt; 0.05) was recorded in annexin V positive cells (apoptotic cells) with increasing doses of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in ATO-treated cells. This finding was confirmed by the result of DNA laddering assay showing clear evidence of DNA fragmentation in ATO and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> treated HL-60 cells. Overall, the present study indicates that vitamin D<sub>3</sub> potentiates the antitumor effects of ATO at least part, via cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, nucleosomal fragmentation and phosphatidylserine externalization.</p>

<p>Activation of telomerase activity and lengthening of telomeres are key steps in carcinogenesis. Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), an environmental pollutant, are probable human carcinogens. To explore if PCBs affect telomerase and telomeres, immortal human skin keratinocytes were exposed to PCB congeners 28, 126 and 153 at 5 µM concentration for 48 days. Cells were re-seeded every 6th day with fresh medium and telomerase activity, telomere length (qPCR), cMyc, hTERT, hTR, CYP1A1 mRNA (RT-PCR), CYP1A1 activity (EROD production), cell cycle distribution (flow cytometry), and superoxide level (DHE oxidation) were determined. All PCB congeners reduced telomerase activity and telomere length. PCB126 caused the most prominent reduction of telomerase activity (50%), hTR and hTERT mRNA (10%), telomere length (40%) and cell growth, along with an increase in CYP1A1 mRNA and activity, and in superoxide levels from day 6 to 48; Treatment with PCB126 was continued until day 90. From day 54 on, an increase in cell growth, cMyc, hTERT, and hTR mRNA level (to 130%) along with re-activation of telomerase activity (to 100%) and re-elongation of telomere length (to 90%) was observed. This increase in cMYC, hTERT, and hTR transcripts after critical telomere shortening may be an indication of genomic instability, a hallmark of carcinogenesis. This study shows for the first time that PCBs initially reduce telomerase activity, telomere length, and cell growth, but prolonged exposure may later lead to telomerase re-activation, telomere lengthening and increased cell growth, all key components in cancer initiation and progression.</p>
