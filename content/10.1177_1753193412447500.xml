<body>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>A 55-year-old female presented to the emergency department with worsening pain and swelling of her left index finger for 18 h. She did not recall any recent trauma, but several hours before onset of the pain, she was wringing out sponges. She was afebrile and systemically well. She did not have any significant past medical history, including diabetes mellitus, inflammatory arthropathy, or a recent infection.</p>
<p>Her finger displayed all of Kanavel’s classical signs of (1) a part-flexed finger, (2) fusiform swelling, (3) tenderness along the flexor sheath, and (4) pain on passive extension. No signs of penetrating trauma were apparent. Her finger was slightly warmer than its neighbours, but there was no sign of superficial cellulitis. An interesting finding was a 3 × 8 mm transverse haematoma in the distal 1/3 of the pulp over her distal phalanx. Her white cell count was 6.1 (NR 4–11), CRP was &lt;1 and INR was 1.0. Plain radiographs showed only soft tissue swelling.</p>
<p>Owing to high clinical suspicion of acute flexor sheath infection, she was taken to theatre for washout of her flexor sheath. A standard two-incision approach was made, with one incision at the level of the A1 pulley and one over the A5 pulley. Approximately 2ml of fresh blood discharged from her flexor sheath under high pressure. The tendon sheath was then irrigated in an antegrade and retrograde manner. Fluid samples were taken for microbiological culture and a synovial biopsy was obtained. Her wounds were closed primarily.</p>
<p>Postoperatively, she made a rapid and complete recovery. No further washouts were undertaken. She regained full movement in the affected digit, with no evidence of flexor tendon rupture or tethering. There was no bacterial or mycobacterial growth in the fluid sample and the histological report showed mild chronic inflammatory changes only. Rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP, and follow-up inflammatory markers were all within normal limits. A contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan did not show any abnormality. We conclude that the underlying pathology was a simple haematoma owing to minor blunt trauma, causing a tear of a vincular vessel.</p>
<p>We believe that this is a case of an acute flexor sheath haematoma caused by low-energy blunt trauma mimicking a flexor tendon sheath infection. Two previous cases have reported on tendon sheath haematomata. One involved a penetrating injury in an 18-month-old baby, although at operation the tendon sheath appeared to be intact. The other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412447500">Dacruz et al., 1986</xref>) was a closed hyperflexion injury of the thumb, resulting in a haematoma of the sheath of extensor pollicis longus. While this was an extensor sheath haematoma, it appears to be the first recorded use of the term ‘haemorrhagic, traumatic tenosynovitis’, which describes our case well.</p>
<p>One case reported on a flexor sheath haemangioma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412447500">Rico et al., 1994</xref>) that mimicked a subacute infection. This presentation was similar to our case, however MRI was utilized preoperatively and detected a vascular tumour in the hand. At operation, no blood was found in the tendon sheath.</p>
<p>Another entity that mimics infection is gouty flexor tenosynovitis. One reported case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412447500">Aslam et al., 2004</xref>) avoided surgery because the flexor sheath was aspirated and urgent microscopy reported urate crystals.</p>
<p>Some authorities treat suspected flexor sheath infections non-operatively if they present early. We speculate that a proportion of those that respond to non-operative management are owing to spontaneous haematoma or other causes of non-suppurative tenosynovitis, such as gout. We therefore advocate diagnostic aspiration in such cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412447500">Ryan and Hoopes, 1975</xref>) as both a first aid measure, a research tool, and a guide to further management.</p>
