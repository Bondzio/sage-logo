<p>62.7250 ABDUL HAMID, Ahmad Fauzi; TAKIYUDDIN ISMAIL, Muhamad — <bold>Abdullah Ahmad Badawi: a Malaysian neo-conservative?</bold> <italic>Japanese Journal of Political Science</italic> 13(3), Sept. 2012: 379–399.</p>
<p>This article analyzes changes implemented during Malaysia's Prime Minister A. A. Badawi's administration (2003–2009), using the theoretical framework commonplace in studies on conservatism. Based on the premise that transformations in conservative polities are prone to producing conflict, the dynamics of conflict situations during Abdullah's checkered Premiership is foregrounded. As we apply the main criteria defining conservatism to regime behavior in Malaysia, it becomes clear that such criteria are stoutly held by the regime's elites in their quest for social harmony and political stability. Regime maintenance then finds justifications in such seemingly sublime ends, thereby self-perpetuating Malaysian conservatism. Such despondency prevailed during Mahathir Mohamad's administration (1981–2003), which displayed bias against changes and introduced schemes to justify the systems it upheld. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.7251 AHUMADA CERVANTES, Brenda; CANDELARIA PELAYO TORRES, María; ARANO CASTEÑON, Arturo — <bold>Sustentabilidad ambiental, del concepto a la práctica. Una oportunidad para la implementación de la evaluación ambiental estratégica en México (Environmental sustainability, from concept to practice: an opportunity for the implementation of strategic environmental assessment in Mexico)</bold>. <italic>Gestión y Política pública</italic> 21(2), 2012: 291–332.</p>
<p>The adoption of sustainable development as a purpose represents a global issue for developing countries and international organizations: ensuring that environmental considerations are integrated into development planning. This article advocates the adoption of Strategic Environmental Assessment [SEA] as a practical mechanism to make environmental sustainability operational. It analyzes the current status of the development planning process and the Environmental Impact Evaluation [EIA] as a baseline for the proposed implementation of SEA in Mexico. Finally, the article proposes the reform of the General Law of Ecological Equilibrium and Environmental Protection to add SEA as a tool of preventive environmental policy to assess the environmental impact of certain sectoral, regional, institutional and special programs referred in the Act Planning.

<p>62.7252 ALDRICH, Richard J.; KASUKU, John — <bold>Escaping from American intelligence: culture, ethnocentrism and the Anglosphere</bold>. <italic>International Affairs</italic> 88(5), Sept. 2012: 1009–1028.</p>
<p>American intelligence continues to privilege old-fashioned strategic analysis for policy-makers and exhibits a technocratic approach to asymmetric security threats, epitomized by the accelerated use of drone strikes and data-mining. Distinguished commentators have focused on the panacea of top-down reform, while politicians and practitioners have created entirely new agencies. However, these prescriptions for change remain conceptually limited because of underlying Anglo-Saxon presumptions about what intelligence is. Although intelligence is a global business, when we talk about intelligence we tend to use a vocabulary that is narrowly derived from the experiences of America and its English-speaking nebula. This article deploys the notion of strategic culture to explain why this is. It then explores the cases of China and South Africa to suggest how we might begin to rethink our intelligence communities and their tasks. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.7253 AMOS, Merris — <bold>The dialogue between United Kingdom courts and the European Court of Human Rights</bold>. <italic>International and Comparative Law Quarterly</italic> 61(3), July 2012: 557–584.</p>
<p>This article considers the scope for dialogue between UK courts and the European Court of Human Rights in theory and in practice. Having demonstrated that meaningful dialogue does take place in certain circumstances, the author considers the impact of dialogue and questions whether or not there can be any further expansion in dialogue whilst avoiding negative outcomes such as confusion over the creation of human rights norms and a loss in legitimacy for national courts adjudicating upon human rights issues.

<p>62.7254 ARJOMAND, Said — <bold>Middle Eastern constitutional and ideological revolutions and the rise of juristocracy</bold>. <italic>Constellations</italic> 19(2), June 2012: 204–215.</p>
<p>The author positions himself against metaphorical uses of the term “constitutional revolution” and the related notion of “juristocracy” advanced by R. Hirschl and provides an account of constitutional developments in Egypt and Iran to clarify the relationship between judicialization of politics and “real” constitutional revolutions. Arguing that the pattern of legal development in Egypt fits the category of new constitutionalism, whereas the pattern in Iran represents a left-over from the earlier epoch of ideological constitutions, he uses each case to present an argument against Hirschl: By highlighting the pattern of legal mobilization in Egypt, which has facilitated democratization from below, he points to the difficulty of generalizing Hirschl's thesis to a country where constitutional politics plays the role of offering an avenue of resistance against authoritarian rule.

<p>62.7255 ASHBEE, Edward — <bold>The [US] Obama Administration, the Left and narratives of failure</bold>. <italic>Political Quarterly</italic> 83(3), July-Sept. 2012: 567–575.</p>
<p>B. Obama's election as US president gave rise to hopes of radical reform. Many on the left were quickly disappointed by the limited character of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the abandonment of proposed reforms, and the concessions that were made to ensure the passage of healthcare legislation. Some explained these failures through agency-based accounts and pointed to what they saw as personal weakness. Others stressed the structural constraints imposed by the asymmetric character of partisan polarization, the political weight of capital, and the institutional character of the American state. The article argues that the character of the “Obama coalition” should also be considered. It has been relatively narrow particularly when compared with the “Roosevelt coalition”. In particular, it failed to draw business fractions into its ranks. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.7256 ASQUER, Alberto — <bold>Managing the process of decentralization: transforming old public entities into new agencies in the agricultural sector [in Sardinia, Italy]</bold>. <italic>International Public Management Journal</italic> 15(2), 2012: 207–229.</p>
<p>In an effort to reconfigure the system for the delivery of agricultural services, the Regional Government of Sardinia in Italy decided, in 2006, to suppress five public entities, and to establish three regional agencies in their place. This article narrates the episode of implementing the organizational restructuring of this part of the regional government's agricultural policy. Drawing on this case, this article then explains the process of carrying out organizational transformations (namely, mergers and demergers) within sub-national governments' administrative systems. The study finds that policy process features and context conditions figure prominently as explanatory factors for the path and outcome of the implementation of the organizational restructuring.

<p>62.7257 AVERY, James M.; FINE, Jeffrey A. — <bold>Racial composition, white racial attitudes, and black representation: testing the racial threat hypothesis in the United States Senate</bold>. <italic>Political Behavior</italic> 34(3), Sept. 2012: 394–410.</p>
<p>We make the case for why the racial-threat hypothesis should characterize the relationship between states' racial composition, whites' racial attitudes, and black representation in the US Senate. Consistent with this claim, we find that senators from states with larger percentages of African-Americans among the electorate and more racially conservative preferences among whites provide worse representation of black interests in the Senate than their counterparts. We also apply theories of congressional cross-pressures in considering how senator partisanship and region moderate the effect of white racial attitudes on black representation. Finally, consistent with the racial-threat hypothesis, we show that the negative effect of white racial attitudes on the quality of black representation is stronger when state unemployment rates are higher.

<p>62.7258 BAH, Abu Bakarr — <bold>State decay: a conceptual frame of failing and failed states in West Africa</bold>. <italic>International Journal of Politics, Culture and Society</italic> 25(1–3), Sept. 2012: 71–89.</p>
<p>Civil wars in Africa have brought many states to near collapse while many others have been plagued by political and economic failures. Studies of Africa have frequently noted the prevalence of weak and failed states. However, the notion of state failure rests more on the outcome of the political, economic, and social crises that have undermined African states, rather than the process of state failure. While the notion of state failure is a useful concept for studying the realities of war-torn African states, it is an inadequate concept to explain the conditions that lead African states into civil war. This study develops the notion of state decay and contends that it is a much more useful concept for examining the conditions that lead to civil wars and state failure in Africa. [R]</p>
<p>62.7259 BAKKER, Judith, <italic>et al</italic>. — <bold>Citizens' initiatives [in the Netherlands]: how local governments fill their facilitative role</bold>. <italic>Local Government Studies</italic> 38(4), Aug. 2012: 395–414.</p>
<p>In the context of drastic cutbacks, many Dutch municipalities consider citizens' initiatives (CIs) as an attractive alternative for municipal policies aimed at improving the livability and safety in neighborhoods, simultaneously building responsible citizenship. We combine different theoretical perspectives to analyze the institutional settings in which CIs are being realized, and how municipalities try to facilitate such initiatives. Municipalities can do this by either trying to structure the relevant networks or by various forms of process management. This analysis sheds light on how municipalities use a variety of instruments to mobilize citizens to participate in CIs. In using such instruments they can influence various factors (like motivations, personal resources, social capital and expected responsiveness) that increase the likelihood of civic engagement.

<p>62.7260 BALDI, Gregory — <bold>Schools with a difference: policy discourses and education reform in Britain and Germany</bold>. <italic>West European Politics</italic> 35(5), Sept. 2012: 999–1023.</p>
<p>This article explains why Britain reformed its early post-war policy of placing students in separate secondary schools on the basis of perceived ability while Germany has retained the practice. While recent accounts of skill-formation have stressed the role of producer groups in shaping the development of education and training systems in advanced democracies, this article maintains that the variation observed in the cases is largely explained by the timing of changes in dominant policy discourses. In Britain, new ideas concerning human ability led policy-makers to reconsider the appropriateness of differentiation in secondary education, leading to changes in the 1960s that created “comprehensive” schools attended by most students. In West Germany, by contrast, cultural federalism and structural legacies from the Nazi era served to delay the acceptance of such ideas. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.7261 BASSOK, Or — <bold>The two countermajoritarian difficulties [in the US political system]</bold>. <italic>Saint Louis University Public Law Review</italic> 31(2), 2012: 333–382.</p>
<p>In recent years, the countermajoritarian difficulty has split into two. According to its traditional version, the difficulty arises when unaccountable [US] Justices strike down statutes passed by electorally accountable branches of government. According to the newer, literal version, the difficulty arises when Justices strike down statutes that are supported by the majority according to public opinion polls. By explicating the difference between the two versions of the difficulty, I expose the deep influence of public opinion polls on American constitutional thought. For many years, scholars conflated the two difficulties under one banner and offered normative justifications for the Court's countermajoritarian authority. In recent years, many constitutional theorists, oriented toward social science, attempt to dissolve the literal countermajoritarian difficulty by showing that the Court is not countering the majority will but following it.

<p>62.7262 BATTISTA, James Coleman — <bold>State legislative committees [USA] and economic connections: expertise and industry service</bold>. <italic>State Politics and Policy Quarterly</italic> 12(3), Sept. 2012: 284–302.</p>
<p>American state legislators commonly remain connected to the market, giving them the potential for unique expertise on how policy affects the industries they are connected to and the opportunity to help enact laws favoring those industries. This paper describes the extent to which state legislative committees are populated by legislators with economic connections to their jurisdiction, and analyzes appointment patterns to help distinguish stacking to tap expertise from stacking to serve an industry. I find that a substantial minority of committees are stacked with connected legislators. Appointment patterns show limited evidence for expertise in education and health care, for industry service in banking, and for both in agriculture. [R]</p>
<p>62.7263 BATTO, Nathan F.; KIM, Henry A. — <bold>Coordinative advantages of state resources under SNTV: the case of Taiwan</bold>. <italic>Japanese Journal of Political Science</italic> 13(3), Sept. 2012: 355–377.</p>
<p>Success in SNTV [single non-transferable vote] requires not merely winning but also coordinating votes. Governing parties often reap coordination advantage thanks to their control of the state and its resources. Since governing parties in authoritarian states enjoy greater control over the state and its resources, we argue that they should also enjoy magnified coordinative advantages in SNTV election. Of course, authoritarian regimes often use state resources to win more votes; we argue that, in SNTV, in addition to winning more votes, those votes can also be distributed more effectively. We demonstrate our claims using election data from both local and national SNTV elections in Taiwan from 1954 to 2005. [R]</p>

<p>While the new Constitution innovates in proclaiming the separation of powers, the monarchy remains the keystone of the political system. Sooner or later, the regime must evolve towards an acceptance of democratic legitimacy as preponderant.</p>
<p>62.7265 BENNISTER, Mark; HEFFERNAN, Richard — <bold>Cameron as Prime Minister: the intra-executive politics of Britain's coalition government</bold>. <italic>Parliamentary Affairs</italic> 65(4), Oct. 2012: 778–801.</p>
<p>Forming a coalition involves compromise, so a prime minister heading up a coalition government, even one as predominant a party leader as D. Cameron, should not be as powerful as a prime minister leading a single-party government. Cameron has still to work with and through ministers from his own party, but has also to work with and through Liberal Democrat ministers — not least the Liberal Democrat leader N. Clegg. The relationship between the prime minister and his deputy is unchartered territory for recent academic study of the British prime minister. This article explores how Cameron and Clegg operate within both Whitehall and Westminster: the cabinet arrangements, the prime minister's patronage, advisory resources and more informal mechanisms.

<p>62.7266 BESANCENOT, Sophie — <bold>An Anglophone invention? The difficult emergence of a French security sector reform practice</bold>. <italic>International Peacekeeping</italic> 19(3), June 2012: 348–362.</p>
<p>The concept of security sector reform (SSR) was first formulated by UK development actors. Since 2008, France has officially adopted an SSR strategy and promoted the concept at the European level during the country's 2008 EU Presidency. However, what appears on paper to resemble full support from French institutions is in fact more complex. If the Anglophone roots of the policy initiative do not seemingly explain its lack of institutionalization in the French context, it would appear that the difficulty faced by the French administration in finding a whole-of-government agreement on what the content of SSR should be, does.

<p>62.7267 BIDDULPH, Sarah; COONEY, Sean; ZHU Ying — <bold>Rule of law with Chinese characteristics: the role of campaigns in lawmaking</bold>. <italic>Law and Policy</italic> 34(4), Oct. 2012: 373–401.</p>
<p>We explore the role played by the enforcement campaign in the development of the Chinese legal system. We focus on the campaign waged between 2004 and 2007 to redress the chronic failure to pay wages. Chinese enforcement campaigns are integrally linked to cycles of law reform in the PRC. They also have an important role in influencing the drafting of legislation and the interpretation of law. This article documents the impact of this campaign on the production of law: in speeding up the iterative process of lawmaking, interpretation, and implementation, with production of important reforms to existing labor law in 2007 and 2008. It is the strong “planned” nature of the campaign and its emphasis on state leadership of lawmaking and enforcement that shapes China's particular version of the “rule of law”. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.7268 BLACK, Ryan C.; BOYD, Christina L. — <bold>US Supreme Court agenda setting and the role of litigant status</bold>. <italic>Journal of Law, Economics and Organization</italic> 28(2), June 2012: 286–312.</p>
<p>Whether the “haves” come out ahead of the “have nots” in the judicial process is a topic of great interest for scholars of the judiciary. Although studies of lower courts have found that litigant status generally matters, research at the US Supreme Court is not of one voice, with conflicting results across several studies. Bringing a novel perspective to this debate, we analyze litigant status at the Supreme Court's agenda-setting stage. Using archival data from the articles of Justice Blackmun, we find that litigant status influences the Court's decision making but that the nature of the effect can be mitigated by the interplay between a justice's ideology and the presence of interest group support.

<p>62.7269 BOEHMKE, Frederick J.; SKINNER, Paul — <bold>State policy [USA] innovativeness revisited</bold>. <italic>State Politics and Policy Quarterly</italic> 12(3), Sept. 2012: 303–329.</p>
<p>How do the American states vary in their propensity for innovativeness, or their willingness to adopt new policies sooner or later relative to other states? Most studies today use event history analysis (EHA) to focus almost exclusively on one policy area at a time at the expense of a broader understanding of innovativeness as a characteristic of states. Our study revisits and updates the original approach with new data covering more than 180 different policies. We use these data to construct a new, dynamic measure of innovativeness that addresses biases and shortcomings in the original measure and we provide measures of uncertainty for both. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.7270 BOSWELL, Christina — <bold>How information scarcity influences the policy agenda: evidence from U.K. immigration policy</bold>. <italic>Governance</italic> 25(3), July 2012: 367–389.</p>
<p>This article explores how patterns of information-supply on policy problems influence political attention. It advances two central claims: (1) different policy areas are associated with distinct practices in monitoring policy problems: some produce abundant, ongoing, and reliable information, while others yield scarce, sporadic, and/or unreliable data. (2) These variations in information-supply are likely to influence political attention, with information-rich areas associated with a more proportionate distribution of attention, and information-poor areas yielding punctuated attention. The article tests these claims through comparing UK political attention to asylum and illegal immigration. Asylum is observed on an ongoing basis through bureaucratic data, court hearings, and lay observations, producing more constant and proportionate political attention. Illegal immigration is observed sporadically through focusing events, usually police operations, eliciting more punctuated attention. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.7271 BRIDGE, Colin — <bold>Citizen centric service in the Australian Department of Human Services: the department's experience in engaging the community in co-design of government service delivery and developments in e-government services</bold>. <italic>Australian Journal of Public Administration</italic> 71(2), June 2012: 167–177.</p>
<p>The Department of Human Services (DHS) is responsible for delivering the majority of the Australian Governments social, health and welfare programs. Government services have traditionally been delivered in policy program silos. However, there has been growing acknowledgement of the overlapping needs of those accessing services, such as employment, mental health and housing. Co-design moves towards gaining an understanding of the experiences of the users and their communities, and giving these communities a legitimate role in development and design. Co-design is about finding the balance between what customers want, what is possible and what is viable. DHS has undertaken a series of community fora to better understand these needs and wants, to further inform the development of new service offers under the Australian Government's Service Delivery Reform (SDR) agenda.

<p>The active support expressed by fundamentalist Muslim migrants for the introduction of Shari'a courts has triggered intense debate in the Western democracies affected. While official Shari'a courts are permitted in some countries, they meet in secret in others. This article evaluates the existence of these courts from the perspective of political philosophy, incorporating the viewpoints of liberalism and multiculturalism. Both come to the same conclusion: in constitutional democracies, multiple systems of law cannot operate with equal status. Given that the “positive neutrality” of the state towards religion, as practiced in Germany and Austria, already takes the religious needs of minorities including Muslims extensively into consideration, further-reaching demands for the introduction of Shari'a law appear to be primarily motivated by reasons of ideology and power politics.

<p>62.7273 BROOKS, Thom — <bold>The British citizenship test: the case for reform</bold>. <italic>Political Quarterly</italic> 83(3), July-Sept. 2012: 560–566.</p>
<p>Immigration presents a daunting challenge to successive British governments. The public ranks immigration as one of the leading policy issues after the economy and employment. There is also greater public support for stronger immigration controls than in many other countries. In response, government strategy has included the use of a citizenship test. While the citizenship test is widely acknowledged as one key part of immigration policy, the test has received surprisingly little critical analysis. This article [examines] serious problems with the current test and offers recommendations for its revision and reform. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>As the challenges of maintaining (or, in the US case, attaining) affordable universal coverage multiply, the debate about what constitutes “real” reform intensifies in Western health care systems. The reality of reform, however, lies in the eyes of myriad beholders who variously enshrine consumer responsibility, changes in payment systems, reorganization, and other strategies — or some encompassing combination of all of the above — as the essential ingredient(s). This debate, increasingly informed by the agendas of health services researchers and health policy analysts, arguably serves as much or more to becloud as to clarify the practical options policy makers face and remains severely imbalanced with respect to the institutional sectors on which it concentrates, the fields of knowledge on which it draws, and the roles it envisions for markets and the state.

<p>Successive New Zealand governments have failed to adopt effective climate-change policies. A positive step was taken with the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme in 2008, founded on a framework of comprehensive coverage, applying to all sectors of the economy and all Kyoto gases, addressing the challenge of creating an emissions-trading scheme tailored for a country characterized by large forest sinks and substantial agricultural emissions. Amendments in 2009 created significant changes in the way the scheme operates. The development of New Zealand's climate-change policy highlights the difficulties of a unique emissions profile and strong political interests, particularly the influence of a powerful agriculture sector.

<p>62.7276 BURGOON, Brian; KOSTER, Ferry; VAN EGMOND, Marcel — <bold>Support for redistribution and the paradox of immigration</bold>. <italic>Journal of European Social Policy</italic> 22(2), July 2012: 288–304.</p>
<p>This paper argues that immigration has varying implications for attitudes about government redistribution depending on the level at which immigration is experienced. Working in occupations with higher shares of foreign-born employees can raise individual economic insecurities in ways that might overwhelm the way high foreign-born shares of the population can reduce solidarity or increase fiscal burdens. Hence, experiencing more immigration in one's occupation might more positively affect support for government redistribution than does experiencing more national-level immigration. We test this and other expectations on survey data in 17 European polities, focused on occupational and national measures of immigration. While national-level exposure to foreign-born populations tends to have little effect on support for government redistribution, occupational-level exposure to immigration tends to spur such support.

<p>Scholarly interest in the study of education from the perspective of political science has increased rapidly in the last few years. However, the literature neglects the analysis of micro-level foundations of education policies in terms of individual preferences and their interaction with macro contexts. This paper engages in a multilevel analysis of survey data for a large number of OECD countries. The core research question is how institutional contexts — in this case socio-economic and educational inequalities — shape the micro-level association between the individual income position and support for education spending.

<p>In 2004, the first citizenship ceremony was conducted in the London Borough of Brent. These compulsory ceremonies for those who have been granted British citizenship had been proposed in the government White Paper and then in the 2002 Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act. They were designed to celebrate the moment of achieving citizenships and were one response to a perceived “crisis of citizenship” in Britain. This study examines the texts of the “local welcome” which is given by a local dignitary at every ceremony as a moment of invention of tradition and of narrating citizenship and thereby narrating the nation-state. The study explores how and what the speeches tell us about understandings of citizenship and its relationship to diversity. It explores how history is also represented within the speeches.

<p>While US-led unipolarity may still be the guiding frame for post-Cold War international economic, political, and military relations, we argue that its applicability to global science and environmental issues is waning. We begin by discussing the global problem of anthropogenic climate change, and the technologies involved in geo-engineering as one possible response. We then recognize both the abundance of oil in Alberta and the near-term melting of the Arctic as critical inputs into Canadian climate change policy. Finally, we examine Canada's abilities and resources as a middle power to act as a foreign policy leader in the formation of a global geo-engineering regime.

<p>Its more central involvement in the government of economic and fiscal policy requires a new public law for the EU. This must be alive to the positive, negative and intractable qualities of conflicts associated with these fields. Such a law would internalize conflicts within the political process so that their irresolution and ongoing struggle become the dynamo endowing the Union with qualities of political engagement, imagination and justice. The recent reforms make mediation of conflicts a central mission of the Union but still use the public law structures of the regulatory state which lack these three qualities.

<p>This article examines the effect of the internet on politics in China. Specifically, it suggests that the relationship between the internet and political change in China is conditioned by the government's strategic responses based on the national interest. Research regarding the effect of the internet on politics in China needs to take into account the government's responses to diverse types of online issues, here categorized under politics, society, and nationalism. The article examines how the Chinese government's responses vary by issue type. The two existing theories — mobilization theory and reinforcement theory — do not offer sufficient explanation of the Chinese government's responses to specific issues. [R]</p>
<p>62.7282 CLARK, Tom S. — <bold>The genealogy of [US Supreme Court] law</bold>. <italic>Political Analysis</italic> 20(3), Summer 2012: 329–350.</p>
<p>Many theories of judicial politics have at their core the concepts of legal significance, doctrinal development and evolution, and the dynamics of precedent. Despite rigorous theoretical conceptualization, these concepts remain empirically elusive. We propose the use of a genealogical model (or “family tree”) to describe the Court's construction of precedent over time. We describe statistical assumptions that allow us to estimate this kind of structure using an original data set of citation counts between [US] Supreme Court majority opinions. The genealogical model of doctrinal development provides a parsimonious description of the dependencies between opinions, while generating measures of legal significance and other related quantities. We employ these measures to evaluate the robustness of a recent finding concerning the relationship between ideological homogeneity within majority coalitions and the legal impact of Court decisions.

<p>Human rights transformed international politics beginning in the 1970s. This transformation was rooted in a dialectical relationship between international and domestic human rights institutions and movements. This article explores how we can use social movements, law, and politics to demonstrate the way international human rights norms were received, interpreted, and applied domestically and how this affected states' participation in international politics. The focus is on Canada, which was profoundly influenced by international human rights norms and in turn contributed to transforming international politics. These developments were especially pronounced in the 1970s. [R]</p>

<p>This article reassesses the neo-liberal shift within British economic policy-making and the international political economy, focusing especially the role of the IMF in the 1960s. We explore the evolving content of IMF conditionality and the economic ideas underpinning it. We argue that the negotiations between the IMF and the UK Government in the 1960s can be seen as part of the Fund's drive towards a crucial change from discretionary to rules-based approaches to macroeconomic policy making. This drive took place within a struggle over a specific policy instrument, domestic credit expansion (DCE), at that time regarded as an important measure of monetary policy. The article locates the IMF advocacy of DCE within an attempt by the Fund to constrain discretionary policy-making through increasingly specific and binding rules. [R, abr.]</p>

[Résumé en français]</p>
<p>This text deals with the construction of a French employment policy instrument: “la Prime pour l'emploi”. The birth of this income tax credit marks a cognitive shift in French employment policy. The arrival of new actors in the sector has opened the door for a more market-oriented orientation. This orientation was reinforced by several expert reports that gave scientific and political credit to a reform that breaks with prior “socialist” orientation of employment policy. This social process has led to a new definition of French employment policy. Contrary to the former decades, the unemployed are now more perceived as responsible for their situation, while the meaning of “employment” has shifted from a “status” to an “activity”. [R]</p>

<p>This article draws on T.H. Marshall's celebrated classification of civil, political and social rights to examine the use of the courts by individuals seeking to establish rights to particular forms or models of welfare service provision. It argues that tensions between the collective and individual aspects of social rights, the relationship of social rights to inequality, and the difficulty of quantifying (and therefore enforcing) legitimate expectations, all make the use of litigation to establish social rights intensely problematic. Drawing on the recent UK Supreme Court case of R (on the Application of McDonald) vs. Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, it suggests that we would do better to adopt Marshall's emphasis on the citizenship basis of social rights and on the social and political context within which they necessarily exist.

<p>Cuba faces a development dilemma: it promotes equity and human capital while failing to deliver economic growth. For the government, the country's equity and human capital achievements are a source of pride, a sign that its priorities are right. This essay argues instead that this “equity without growth” dilemma is a sign of malaise. Theory and evidence suggest that high levels of equity and human capital should produce high levels of economic growth. Because growth is often weak or negative, some onerous barriers to development must be present. These barriers are restrictions on property and political rights. By comparing Cuba and China across two sectors, the bicycle industry and internet access, this article shows how these restrictions have hindered growth. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article analyzes some of the “numbers” behind the migration phenomenon and immigration policy design in the US. This study assesses the use of quantitative data and analyses, migration statistics and the mass media to support the passage (or justify the failure) of recent key initiatives that affect undocumented or illegal immigration in the US, in particular immigration originating in Mexico. The misuse of numbers, the production of media spectacles that present illegal immigrants as harmful for the US economy and society, and the politicization of the immigration process in general, have had a major impact on recent failed attempts to reform the dysfunctional US immigration system. These factors also influenced the passage of Arizona's SB 1070 in 2010, as well as the recent passage of other anti-immigrant legislation in more US states. [R, abr.]</p>

The debate over the exact conceptual and operational “framing” of territorial cohesion, launched by the European Commission's Green Paper, constitutes one of the many arenas through which ESP currently evolves, together with the transnational initiatives developed in the framework of the European Territorial Cooperation objective, the European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion (ESPON) and the process that recently led to the publication of the Territorial Agenda of the EU 2020.

<p>This article examines China's innovation strategy as a key part of its economic development policy to achieve the next stage of the country's domestic market modernization. The news that China now possesses the world's fastest supercomputer appears to confirm the country's inexorable journey from the world's manufacturer and assembly hub to leading global innovator. However, this article examines broader-based innovation metrics which cast a different light on China's position, showing that much work still remains to be done in order to lift domestic innovative activity to world-class levels. The country does not yet appear to have become a leader. The article draws on the latest research data of China's innovative capabilities and links these to empirical assessments of the country's information and communications technology sector to illustrate current strengths and weaknesses.

<p>The relationship between constitutional secularism and gender equality acquires peculiar dimensions in the context of the <italic>laïcité</italic> project in republican France — particularly, in the contemporary conflict between a <italic>laïcité</italic> interpreted as a politics of emancipatory social transformation, and the more minimalist liberal conception prevailing in French law.

<p>Subject to conditions that public law can secure, social conflicts can be normatively appealing for their dividend in terms of dynamism, identity and stability. While this notion was key to post-World War II European public law, it no longer holds true now that social conflicts are increasingly marginalized by the expansion of supranational law and its consensus culture. However, far from disappearing, social conflicts re-emerge as challenges to the current institutional setting, even despite the policy of constitutional gesture undertaken by EU institutions. This paper tracks the role of social conflicts in European public law and argues that as long as EU politics fails to embrace a culture of social conflicts, challenges to the authority of EU law can be normatively justified.

<p>The lack of descriptive representation of Palestinians in Jordanian politics has long been the focus of scholars studying the “democratic deficit” in the country. Using two case-studies, that of the quota for women in elected bodies and that of the communal rift in Jordan, this article demonstrates how representation of ideas poses greater challenges to democracy and equality in Jordan than representation as presence. Moreover, representation of ideas of “loyal” constituencies replaced the under-representation of “opposition” constituencies as the significant impediment to the reformist policies of the monarchy.

<p>In November 2002, in China, the first known case of SARS [appeared]. However, it was not until April 2003 that the Chinese government admitted to the full scale of SARS, after the disease had rapidly spread across the world. In 2008, Zimbabwe experienced [a major] outbreak of cholera. By February 2009, the disease had spread across all of Zimbabwe and to neighboring countries, causing thousands of infections among their populations. This article examines what duties the Chinese and Zimbabwe states had to protect their citizens and the international community from these outbreaks. It refers to the International Law Commission's study into the role of states and international organisations in protecting persons in the event of a disaster to consider whether there is an international duty to protect persons from epidemics.

<p>This paper focuses on agenda-change affecting the politics of “fracking operations” in the US, a process of extracting natural gas from underground shale formations. We examine how the movement of this policy issue between the state and federal levels of government has become increasingly contentious because of rising public concern about pollution impacts. Using information obtained from documentary sources and media content-analysis, we found that the natural gas policy coalition has largely focused on a political strategy based on maintaining fracking regulatory controls at the state level, while the environmental policy coalition has pushed for increased regulation of drilling practices in general, including a larger policy and oversight role for federal agencies such as EPA.

<p>With the exception of few comparative case studies, the literature on regulatory reform and regulatory impact analysis (RIA) tends to focus on internal political actors, activities, and processes. Furthermore, empirical analyses of new public management have overlooked the dynamics of communications among networks of administrative reformers. This article fills these gaps, presenting results of an event-history analysis on the diffusion of RIA. It probes rationales for the origin of RIA and administrative capacity explanations in combination with variables referring to international and transnational communication channels of administrative reforms. A hypothesis based on legal origin is also tested. The findings show that the decision to adopt RIA rests on transnational networks as well as administrative variables such as government expenditure and legal origin. [R]</p>

<p>The EU budget is distributed primarily in the form of intergovernmental grants to sub-state governments, which invest the grants in local projects. Transfers are allocated under the auspices of the European structural funds. This article assesses the causal links between electoral incentives on the recipient side, European funding goals, and local grant-allocation. Tobit regressions of the allocation patterns in 419 local districts in Germany for the period 2000–2006 suggest the following: although recipient sub-state governments enjoy substantial discretion in selecting projects, their distributive choices are largely in accord with European goals. As theoretically predicted, however, there is robust evidence that sub-state governments' electoral concerns distort the local allocation of structural funds. [R]</p>

<p>Although numerous advancements have been made in the study of agenda-setting among the media, the president, and Congress, scholars have struggled to develop a cohesive theory about who influences whom. I integrate exogenous agenda-setting variables from the American politics and policy literatures into traditional agenda-setting models, focusing on one specific domestic policy area: biofuels. The results indicate that exogenous agenda-setting variables should be included in models of dynamic agenda-setting, because they play an important role in the relationship among the media, the president, and Congress. In the case of biofuels, economic indicators, public opinion, and election year politics affected the agendas of the media, the president, and Congress, and they drowned out the influence that these actors had on one another.

<p>Recent literature in public administration emphasizes enhanced collaboration between elected and administrative officials.

This article proposes and tests new variables to understand what enhances the policy-making role of city managers and the administrative role of elected officials. Employing data collected from a nationwide survey of city managers and utilizing structural equation modeling methodology, this research finds that the council's expectations and the city manager's role conception significantly influence the city manager's involvement in policy-making, while the context of policy-making, the city manager's support, and the council's access to resources affect elected officials' involvement in administration.

<p>This paper explains how different political visions, and their clashes and coalitions over two decades of independent statehood, influenced the Slovenian citizenship regime, which is rife with undemocratic practices. Drawing on the “nationalizing state” approach, the paper illuminates two dominant political agendas: the nationalizing state agenda and the Europeanizing state agenda. However, both agendas are frequently intertwined and provide legitimacy to political actors across the ideological spectrum depending on the circumstances. These circumstances are external or internal to the political system and determine the relevance of either of the two agendas. As such, they also play an important role in shaping the outcome of the political bargaining that has left its mark on the Slovenian citizenship regime.

<p>Liberal capitalist polities are held up as the ultimate civilizational achievement precisely at a point in time when the energy-demanding built environments and growth imperatives of these societies are threatened by global climate change and the coming end of cheap and abundant carbon energy. Throughout the 20th c, this pattern of energy-intensive social reproduction was largely shaped by the oil and gas sector creating what I call a petro-market civilization. However, given the challenges presented by peak oil and global warming, transitioning to a low-carbon or green energy future has gathered increasing attention and investment. I use a power theory of value approach to offer a preliminary assessment of whether this transition is likely given the entrenched power of the oil and gas sector in the economy. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This research demonstrates that a polarity paradox exists in the enactment of landmark laws by the US Congress. Moderate conflict facilitates the production of landmark laws whereas movement to the polar extremes of conflict — toward low or high conflict — inhibits it. The number of landmark laws passed by a Congress is low when polarization between the parties is low, particularly if uncivil interpersonal conflict within the parties is low, and when polarization between the parties is high, particularly if uncivil interpersonal conflict between the parties is high. Movement away from these polar extremes toward moderate conflict yields increased landmark productivity. [R]</p>

We validate a number of narratives around the ideological lineage of prime ministers in relation to their party predecessors, and invalidate others, by analyzing the speeches using the Comparative Manifestos Project coding scheme.

<p>This article examines the judicialization of electoral politics in Asia, an important but understudied trend, as demonstrated in Thailand and Indonesia. Though the constitutional courts in both have similar histories and institutional arrangements, their electoral interventions vary radically. We argue that the diffusion or concentration of power among post-transition elites determines whether the effect of judicial activism will be to shore up or undermine electoral governance. Where power is diffused, as in Indonesia, political actors, less able to impose their own will on the judiciary, seem to prefer a credible referee, which fosters electoral competition. Where power is concentrated, as in Thailand, elites have both the motive and the means to turn judicial activism to antidemocratic ends. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>In Europe, a variety of national policies regulate access to citizenship. This article analyzes how citizenship policies affect naturalization rates among immigrants. Our analysis confirms that favorable citizenship policies positively affect naturalization rates, especially among first-generation immigrants with more than five but fewer than twenty years of residence. However, most variation is explained by other factors. Immigrants from poor, politically unstable, and non-EU countries are more likely to be a citizen of their European country of residence. Other important predictors of the citizenship status of immigrants are language, years of residence (first generation), and age (second generation). Explanations of naturalization rates in Europe should [consider] not only institutional conditions but also other destination and origin-country factors and individual characteristics of immigrants.

<p>This contribution systematically evaluates patterns of change in socio-economic models in Hungary and Slovakia, highlighting the role of the state in the process. While the countries share general similarities in their type of capitalism, a closer overview of institutional domains reveals that important differences exist in the character of change and the role of key actors. In terms of the overall reform paths, Slovakia, especially since the late 1990s, is more coherent and overwhelmingly in a liberal direction, while Hungary appears less radical and encompasses a combination of liberal elements and active state involvement. In this contribution we focus on industrial policy and find that Hungary adopted more comprehensive and vertical industrial support geared towards upgrading, foreign-capital openness throughout the economy, and support of the domestic small and medium enterprise sector. Slovakia developed its industry more through regulation than a direct intervention, opened to foreign capital only in late 1990s, and since then eschewed any attempt to nurture domestic capital.

<p>Although the citizenship regime of Montenegro was generated amidst domestic political competition, it has also been significantly affected by regional and international political forces.

Further explanations for the restrictiveness of Montenegro's citizenship regime are based on the legacies of the different Yugoslav “citizenship constellations”. Yet as a consequence of the country's aspirations to join the EU, the rigid citizenship regime of Montenegro remains permeable to international norms and influence.

<p>Activists in post-Saddam Iraq (2003–2010) were in the process of forging a new discourse. They rejected the “incremental track” in favor of a “fast track” discourse. Development, of the country and/or women, was no longer accepted as a prerequisite for democratic rights. Rather, activists believed that immediate measures must be taken to ensure women's inclusion for the simple reason that there can be no democracy without adequate representation of women. Yet, realities in Iraq undermined this discourse; “representation as presence” did not result in the subsequent “representation of ideas” hoped for by these activists. Moreover, the rising tide of communal politics threatened not only to sweep away past hard-won advances but to de-prioritize women's concerns — again.

<p>Despite almost thirty years of international negotiations, the US and Europe cannot reach an agreement on harmonized standards in the field of substantive patent law. The article identifies the reasons for the lack of a common approach. We argue that differing regulatory paradigms and diverging actors' coalitions impede a substantial rapprochement from either side. Moreover, the path-dependent inertia is reinforced by the institutional configuration of political decision-making structures and their selective responsiveness. The article assesses the potential for substantial reforms of historically rooted regulatory regimes. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7146]</p>

<p>Recent debates within the gender and politics field have reflected a shift to consider how, when, where, why and by whom the representation of women's interests occurs [J. Lovenduski, “Research on women's political representation”, <italic>PSA Women and Politics Conference</italic>, 2008]. Indeed, K. Celis, <italic>et al</italic>. [“Rethinking women's substantive representation”, <italic>ibid</italic>. 44(2), July 2008: 99–110; <italic>Abstr</italic>. 59.3010] have suggested that those who seek to act on behalf of women may not necessarily be female. This possibility is significant and requires both conceptual and empirical analysis. This article adopts a case-study approach to comparing the ways in which men and women MPs articulate women's interests. [R]</p>

<p>Reserved seats for Indigenous Australians have been proposed as a means by which to stimulate the relatively low voting participation of Indigenous citizens and to afford them more effective representation in parliament. Yet, the idea of dedicated Indigenous seats is regularly rejected by committees of inquiry and there are significant obstacles to their establishment. One is the lack of agreement or understanding about how dedicated seats would work in practice. We help clarify this issue by testing in a modeling experiment how reserved seats might affect the outcome of elections and the composition of the Federal Parliament. We then assess the relative merits of each model for ease of implementation and likely acceptability for both the public and political elites and find that there are viable models with good chances of finding acceptance.

<p>This paper argues that the relationship between law and politics must be reconfigured within the EU. Dissecting recent crises in economic, social and political organization within Europe with reference to the three “fictitious” commodities of K Polanyi, we find that law in Europe has contributed to de-legalization, de-socialization and disenfranchisement. Reviewing the potential for law to respond to crisis through new paradigms of conflict-resolution as suggested by R. Dahrendorf, we find that the steering capacity of law is nevertheless limited if it fails to establish a sustaining relationship with politics. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7292]</p>

<p>In May 2011, the Coalition government published a draft bill for reform of the House of Lords, proposing an upper chamber composed of 80% elected and 20% appointed members serving for single 15-year terms. These plans reflect aspects of the stated positions of the main political parties, votes in the House of Commons, and broader political and scholarly debates over the past decade. Nevertheless, there is significant opposition from across the political spectrum, and a significant possibility that the proposed reforms will not be enacted before the next general election. This article draws on the views of participants in a Symposium to argue that the likely failure of the reforms may be less disastrous than many suppose. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>[We argue] that the governance structure embodied in Canada's parliamentary system has contributed importantly to the maintenance of fiscal stability. [We examine] specific sub-periods when the ideological background for political policy-making changed and/or when the institutions and organizations for operationalizing policy varied in ways that either improved or discouraged responsible fiscal performance. We consider ideational and institutional factors that are predicted to either enhance or detract from accountability and fiscal stability, including central banking, the adoption of Keynesianism, inflation targeting and periods of minority government, and test for their effects on long run stability of the debt to GDP ratio using data for almost the entire history of the modern state from 1867 to 2008.

<p>The author argues that Colombian constitutionalism after 1991 should be understood as an example of counter-hegemonic constitutionalism: the Colombian Constitution and the newly created Constitutional Court have been instrumental, against the attack of traditional elites, in preserving a space for progressive political agendas that had been excluded from the political process. To make his case, he describes the historico-political context surrounding the Constituent Assembly, focusing on the inability of the elites to control the Assembly and the historical imperative of having to respond to a serious crisis of institutional performance.

<p>Despite the prominent principle of ministerial responsibility, empirically, the “personal consequences” of ministerial scandals in their area of responsibility, display a large variance. Some ministers resign because of rather trifling affairs, others stay in office in spite of serious scandals. Taking into consideration the delegation relationship between the executive and the parliament, in view of the principal-agent theory, a minister's resignation due to major political or personal misconduct is to be expected. On the other hand, the actual constitutional configuration of ministerial responsibility casts theoretical doubts on the ministerial loss of office. The quantitative analysis of 133 resignation issues in the years 1949 to 2009 reveals that ministerial responsibility bears no relevance to the decision whether to resign or not. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This paper develops a consensus voting model for estimating preferences of [US] federal circuit court judges. The consensus model accounts for the norm of consensus in the courts of appeals by including a cost of dissent in the judicial utility function. A test of the consensus voting model on a data-set of asylum appeals demonstrates that it provides a substantially better fit then a comparable sincere voting model and also generates more accurate predictions of voting probabilities. The model generates credible estimates of the impact of panel composition on case outcomes, which is surprisingly large in the asylum cases. Even though 95 percent of these decisions were unanimous, roughly half of the cases could have been decided differently if assigned to different panels. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Do governments still have margins for maneuver? The answer to this question can only be positive. Did not governments rescue the financial markets from bankruptcy in 2008? The question is, therefore, about the EU: the member countries of the euro zone find themselves in the situation of federated states without a federal government. The result is a power deficit that mirrors the democratic deficit in Europe: on the one hand, the federated states have legitimacy but no means of action; on the other hand, means of action exist but their usage is limited by international treaties. We are, therefore, confronted with a politics of powerlessness rather than the impotence of politics. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.6971]</p>

<p>Although post-communist countries share a common past, the variability of outcomes in both democracy and economic reform is very large in the region. Only a few countries have become Western-type democracies in Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic. By contrast, the norm is clearly not democracy for other Soviet successor states. The author attributes this variation to differences in the infrastructural capacity of the state. Using both quantitative and qualitative analyses within 26 postcommunist countries, the author argues that for democracy to flourish, the state must first possess the necessary means to maintain law and order and to protect the rights of citizens, in other words, to ensure the maintenance and delivery of essential public goods.

<p>Immigration policy studies often assume the relevance of path dependency or contingency. This study weighs institutional changes, party changes and media as factors potentially driving immigration policy shifts after 11 September 2001. Despite change with each of these factors, immigration policy debate in the US and Canada presents framing as a vehicle for absorbing exogenous shock while maintaining consistency in terms of immigration policy orientation. The US and Canada converge after September 11 in filtering immigration through the lens of terrorism. However, in the longer run, political representatives in Canada frame terrorism around human rights issues and thereby return immigration to its distinct and familiar policy orientation of openness and inclusiveness.

<p>The author provides a pragmatist rejoinder to the post-secularist challenge concerning the limits of liberal solutions to the problem of religion's place in modern liberal democracies. Because liberal solutions — including those of J. Habermas and C. Lafont — leave intact the public-private divide as intrinsic attributes of epistemic objects, he argues that they also preserve the “gatekeeping” function of public reason whereby religious arguments are subjected to some form of translation before they are admitted to public deliberation. In their stead, he advances a pragmatist conception of public reason, which he claims can, by replacing the liberal distinction between types of beliefs with the functional distinction between types of normative practices, grant religious beliefs a role that transgresses neither the liberal ethics of citizenship nor the communitarian call for a less restrictive understanding of the public sphere.

<p>The English courts have been ambivalent [about] the “operational” use of evidence obtained by torture carried out by others. The House of Lords held that the Executive could rely on evidence obtained by torture carried out by others as long as the UK was not complicit in the torture. But what if receiving that evidence was part of complicity in it? In the case of <italic>Ahmed &amp; Anor v. R</italic>, the Court of Appeal answered that question categorically: the passive receipt of evidence obtained by torture does not amount to complicity. Considering complicity in its broadest sense, this article challenges that conclusion, and its implications. When it comes to the international wrongfulness of involvement in torture, it is not enough to simply look to the “ordinary principles” of secondary participation.

<p>Introducing nuclear power to a Japanese population “allergic” to the idea of anything nuclear was not an easy task. The construction of nuclear power plants had to be accompanied by various promotional campaigns, including advertising, PR centers and educational programs. However, today the events in Fukushima have constrained the efforts of the nuclear triumvirate — METI, big business and political advocates — to revise its message so as not to reactivate the “allergy”.

<p>MPs in many countries are legally permitted to execute (un)paid jobs in addition to their political mandate. It is often argued that such “moonlighting” activities are unproblematic for the chain of democratic delegation and accountability as long as outside interests/earnings are disclosed to citizen-principals; the latter may then sanction (perceived) misconduct through the ballot box. Using principal-agent theory as an analytical framework and the German national parliament as a case study, this paper discusses why the accountability mechanisms of moonlighting disclosure and electoral control are often impaired in practice. We also illustrate that these concerns generalize beyond the German setting. [R]</p>

<p>This article offers a new perspective on the typology of minor parties elected to parliament. In particular, it analyzes minor parties elected to the Australian Senate from 1949 to 2010, and accounts for a shift in the type of minor party winning parliamentary representation. Minor parties elected from 1955 to 1983 were created as a result of major-party fragmentation and sought to use their position in the Senate to either frustrate the major parties or act as “watchdogs”. Minor parties elected since 1984, however, promoted a specific policy agenda with links to social movements. The article argues that the first minor parties to win Senate representation can be seen as “secessionist” minor parties, while those elected since 1984 can be seen as “movement” minor parties.

<p>The contribution considers two related institutional domains, industrial relations and industrial training, in the United Kingdom. It analyses the trajectory and magnitude of change, seen in terms of (a) forms of coordination/governance and (b) the saliency of these domains. The contribution covers a long time period, pivoting on the years of Conservative government between 1979 and 1997. It argues that trajectories of change in these two domains began earlier than these years and are still not fully unfolded in the industrial training area. Throughout, change involved combinations of both strategic transformation and muddling through by key actors. There are some complementarities between these two domains and with other domains, but there are also significant disjunctures. In explaining change, some emphasis is placed on politics, but also on the “voluntaristic” nature of labour market institutions in Britain and on employer preferences in labour, product and financial market and in political contexts.

<p>Competitive political parties and election campaigns are central to the health of democracies. Parties and campaigns require significant resources to be effective. India has developed complex election-expenditure, political party-funding, and reporting and disclosure laws. We suggest that these laws may have perverse impacts on the electoral system: they tend to drive campaign expenditure underground and foster a reliance on unaccounted funds or “black money”. This tends to lead to an adverse selection system, in which those willing and able to work with black money dominate politics. We conclude with some possible remedies, including partial state financing of political parties, that might restore the health of India's electoral system.

<p>New Zealand has been ranked consistently as one of the five least corrupt countries in the world (Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, TI-CPI) over the past 16 years, but may have suffered somewhat from its international renown. There is no clear legal definition of corruption in New Zealand. There is a rather diffuse institutional policing of whatever is considered to be corruption, an apparent growth of organized crime, and sometimes public controversy surrounding conflicts of interests in public procurement. Some concerns have been raised about the sale of state assets in the 1980s and 1990s. There is also occasionally evidence of corruption in high public offices and with the parliament's tardiness in ratifying the UN Convention against Corruption. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article focuses on the UK's Coalition Government's plans to abolish the discretionary Social Fund and replace it, at least in part, with Local Welfare Assistance (LWA). It locates LWA in debates about localism, the idea of which in policy terms unites the two political parties that make up the Coalition government. The article explores the Coalition government's approach to localism and debates about it, and related issues concerning autonomy, freedom and democracy. It then examines the reasons for the abolition of the discretionary Social Fund and the Coalition government's plans for LWA. LWA is framed by a discourse related to the Coalition government's view of the importance of localized solutions to entrenched economic and social problems. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Since early 2000, the EU recognized the importance of curbing corruption and began to require that candidate countries adopt and implement anticorruption strategies prior to accession. Given Romania's long struggle with corruption, it was required to adopt more anticorruption strategies than any other candidate to date. This paper elaborates upon the degree to which the EU was able to influence domestic political will, identifies and discusses lessons learned from Romania that may aid the EU in future enlargements, and evaluates whether the “carrot” approach was more effective than the “stick” approach in propagating domestic political will.

<p>Russia is seeing both internal migration from underdeveloped and climatically disadvantaged regions to the country's central regions, and immigration from the “near abroad” (the former Soviet republics) and other, primarily Asian states. A considerable proportion of the latter takes the form of illegal migration. Russians feel that their country is being swamped by foreigners, resulting in frictions which in some cases spark open altercations. The Chinese “land grab” in Russia's Far East is particularly fraught with problems. Immigration is destabilizing and weakening the country, both internally and externally. Even legal immigration is having a similar effect. [R]</p>

<p>The exposure of alleged coup plots in 2007 has shaken the guardian role of the Turkish military in politics. What were the conditions that led to the exposure of the coups and what is their significance for the future of Turkish democracy? Drawing on insights from southern Europe, the article argues that failed coup plots can lead to democratic civil–military relations especially if they work simultaneously with other facilitating conditions, such as increasing acceptance of democratic attitudes among officers, consensus among civilians over the role of the military, and the influence of external actors, such as the EU. The article focuses on such domestic and international factors to analyze the transformation of the Turkish military, the splits within the armed forces and the resulting plots. [R, abr.]</p>

The Court's decision practically amounts to the death sentence of the rule of law: the Hungarian Constitutional Court has given up on the ideal of constitutionalism.

<p>Providing policy advice is often the epitome of a public service career, the opportunity to have a direct influence on policy. Yet there is a wide range of circumstances in which policy advice might be sought, requiring different information, timetables and depths of analysis. This necessitates the development of [various] skills and depends on the political and administrative circumstances. Using the [Australian] Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet as a case study, we develop a typology of policy advice, ranging from intelligence gathering, to reviewing options, coordinating policy and sometimes initiating strategy. We illustrate the implications of these differing types of work to show how public servants must approach policy advising, conscious of and within a framework that supports different approaches to policy work according to the situation.

<p>To what extent are citizens able to control their elected officials? Does representation improve when issues become visible? Conflicting results in studies of legislative representation are frequently attributed to issue salience or subconstituency politics. However, most conclusions about the effect of issue-salience rely on studies of responsiveness on issues held to be either important or visible. Consequently, we have little idea of how changes in salience serve to alter the representational relationship. To examine this question, we employ a natural experiment to exploit the sudden increase in issue visibility surrounding the consideration of the Armenian Genocide Resolution. We are unable to detect any evidence that salience (as measured by visibility) enhances responsiveness to majority preferences. Instead, salience appears to alter legislators' sensitivity to different intense subconstituency groups in their districts. [R]</p>

<p>Does constitutional review in emerging democracies tend to enhance horizontal accountability or to preserve state-elite hegemony? The results of a quantitative analysis of abstract constitutional review in Turkey during the 1984–2007 period show: (1) that the Constitutional Court was no more likely to accept unconstitutionality claims by state-elite parties than by non-state-elite parties; and (2) that the Constitutional Court was more likely to accept unconstitutionality claims of executive transgressions than those of state-principles violations. In sum, the findings largely point to the Constitutional Court's preference for horizontal accountability over hegemonic preservation. [R]</p>

<p>This article looks at the status quo of Indian counterterrorism policy — which largely favors “physical” or “hard” measures — and proposes that the government adopt a more holistic strategy. Termed “Countering Violent Extremism”, this would involve measures geared towards long-term prevention, with greater attention paid to the reasons for which people commit terrorism and to the impact of counterterrorism on communities. As such, the article focuses on “counterradicalization” (society-wide prevention), “deradicalization” (a nuanced response to convicted terrorists) and uses Islamism as a case study, with the proviso that many “countering violent extremism measures” can also be applied successfully to other types of violent extremism.

<p>This article accounts for the gap between Russia's weak initial implementation of the Kyoto Protocol and its more active engagement in climate policy during the D. Medvedev presidency. We examine the intersection of climate policy and broader efforts to modernize Russia's economy, drawing attention to synergies between domestic and international politics. We argue that international factors alone do not explain the change in climate policy as they have remained relatively constant. Instead, greater attention toward climate policy results from efforts to introduce new technologies and increase energy efficiency, spurred by the recent financial crisis and a shift in domestic policy priorities associated with the Medvedev presidency.

<p>The police in Eastern Europe are often regarded as politicized, poorly trained and corrupt. This article argues that the police follow a patrimonial logic. Neo-patrimonialism is mostly understood as an authoritarian regime with a personal ruler at the top. By contrast, here a concept is suggested which reformulates patrimonialism as the practice of the acquisition of offices and material resources. Based on this, two case studies analyze the police administration in Albania and Georgia. The findings suggest that patrimonial practices play a central role in the recruiting and financing of law-enforcement officers. The result is a hybrid administration, which is significantly subject to special interests. [R]</p>

<p>In May 2008, S. Berlusconi's newly elected coalition introduced new measures to facilitate the expulsion and repatriation of European community citizens, simultaneously declaring a “State of Emergency with regards to the Settlement of Nomadic Communities in Lazio, Campania and Lombardy Regions”. Through an analysis of these laws and their material effects, this article shows how they constituted Romanian Roma as abject European citizens. It argues that this process of abjection was dependent on earlier processes that first categorized the Roma as “nomads” and relegated them to the abject space of the “nomad camp”. The article argues that the constitution of the Roma as abject citizens does not only occur through the act of expulsion, but through the condition of deportability induced by the threat of expulsion.

<p>Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (TRCs) have emerged as an international norm and are assumed to be an essential element of national reconciliation, democratization, and post-conflict development. [However], there is little understanding of the long-term effects and consequences of TRCs. This article explores both the rise in TRCs as an international norm and the contradictions and inadequacies in existing efforts to measure the impacts and successes of commissions. Through this examination, we demonstrate the need for more critical, interactive, and inclusive mechanisms of assessment for understanding the effects of TRCs. This article emphasizes the need to think rigorously about how we assess the effects of TRCs and offers insights into the value of more comprehensive mechanisms for assessing the impacts and local perceptions of commissions.

<p>Given the knowledge that encompassing institutional change after 1989/1990 triggered winners and losers, in addressing the transition in Central and Eastern Europe after the collapse of communism, this article focuses on enforced institutional change and, since policy has been greatly influenced by theoretical debates, focuses on the relation between theory and practice.

<p>Control over mineral wealth has become a highly politicized issue in Latin America, and the region-wide leftwards political shift of the 2000s has profoundly changed mineral policies. After the neoliberal development model of free markets, the state has recently taken a center stage position again, at least with regard to oil, gas, and metallic minerals. This article studies the nature and implications of the shift from neoliberal to post-neoliberal mineral policies in Latin America, using a political economy angle. It analyzes the policies and politics of neoliberal regimes in the 1980s and 1990s, the subsequent booming markets and rising Chinese influences, and the new mineral policies of some Leftist governments. Finally, it discusses political conflicts related to these new policies. [R]</p>

<p>This article provides new insights into theorizing on “critical mass” and “critical acts”, a widely studied topic within feminist political science. From a more comprehensive viewpoint, these concepts are linked to the descriptive and substantive representation of women (DRW and SRW). It applies and tests a key element — the recruitment hypothesis — with empirical data from Finnish parliamentary standing-committee hearings. The project simultaneously pinpoints theoretical and methodological problems in the way we conceive and study DRW and its potential effects regarding SRW. The overall implications represent a profound challenge to theorists and empiricists alike: Perhaps we should reconsider some of our beliefs concerning the accumulation of knowledge in this field from the perspective of “strong objectivity” and start reviewing fundamental assumptions that underpin our concepts of “critical” mass and acts.

Opinion-policy consistency is assessed over time and across policy domains, with extended discussions of how opinion affects (and fails to affect) policy, using the “shock therapy” policies of the early 1990s and the first and second Chechen conflicts as examples.

<p>This paper analyzes the relationship between fiscal decentralization and the level of the public debt in the twenty-seven member countries of the EU. Our panel-data analysis points to the importance of size as fiscal decentralization reduces public debt in large and small countries, but not in medium-size countries. In addition, our results show that the number of government levels and average size of the lowest government unit is insignificant with respect to the public debt in these countries. [R]</p>

<p>All levels of government in Australia are increasingly contracting with charitable and other not-for-profit organizations (and, at times, for-profit businesses) for the delivery of public services. The shift to “purchase of service” contracting and other forms of “managed markets” has been partly motivated by a desire to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery. However, some critics argue that it leads to a range of problems for not-for-profit organizations, including being burdened by excessive regulation, movement away from their core purpose, and a weakening of the connections with the community they serve. This article examines the prevalence of the contracting arrangements and some of the main reasons why they have come about. It also considers the main gains and challenges resulting from such arrangements, in particular for public sector management. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7763]</p>

<p>This article assesses the practice of e-government in Taiwan from a citizen-centered perspective. The analysis of e-government reveals that the government has neither made the best use of technology to understand and incorporate citizens' needs into e-government nor made the necessary changes in the process and established institutional arrangements for integrated services. This article identifies the problems and challenges to enhance e-government in Taiwan. It contends that the limited role and narrow-mindedness of IT personnel in charge of designing e-government as well as a risk-averse culture among public servants could stop e-government from moving forward. The article discusses the lessons learned from Taiwan's experience and claims that transforming the role of IT personnel, strengthening political leadership and developing strong public value are necessary to building citizen-centric e-government.

<p>Citizen participation is heralded as the hallmark of democracy and economic transparency. Yet citizen participation is not limited to political and economic processes. I consider the incorporation of participatory measures in security provision, [considering the case of] Colombia. Despite notorious images of paramilitary forces, guerrilla insurgents and vigilante groups, citizen participation in security provision tends to be banal, boring and not particularly effective, as average people attend local meetings, work through state bureaucracy, and comply with new policy initiatives. I argue that insecurity in Colombia is neither a product of apathetic citizens nor of violent, uncontrollable mobs, but rather part and parcel of an emerging form of governance in which citizens are made responsible for their own security provision.

<p>Over the past three decades, China's response to international human rights pressure has been guided by its strong state identity, prioritizing the pursuit of economic productivity, material power and international prestige. Beijing participated in the UN human rights regime for strategic and diplomatic gains, and later endorsed human rights norms that were perceived as consistent with them. Accordingly, the PRC saw colonialism, imperialism, hegemonism, and racism as key human rights violations, while opposing the universality of human rights and rejecting intrusive human rights monitoring, deemed as detrimental to its strong state goal. Thus, instead of the normative influence leading to norm-compliant behavior, China has sought to diminish human rights pressure and shape international human rights institutions in ways that are advantageous to its state interests.

<p>We develop a framework to examine empirically how politicians with electoral pressures control bureaucrats with career concerns and the consequent implications for bureaucrats' career investments. Unique microlevel data on Indian bureaucrats support our key predictions. Politicians use frequent reassignments (transfers) across posts of varying importance to control bureaucrats. High-skilled bureaucrats face less frequent political transfers and lower variability in the importance of their posts. We find evidence of two alternative paths to career success: officers of higher initial ability are more likely to invest in skill, but caste affinity to the politician's party base also helps secure important positions.

<p>There is little question that regulations encouraged European banks to invest in European governments' bonds, but it does not appear that this encouragement led to more government borrowing by significantly reducing the yield governments needed to pay on their debt. However, it does appear that capital-adequacy regulations — along with post-2008 liquidity regulation — concentrated sovereign risk in the European banking system, aggravating the sovereign-debt problem by requiring government bailouts that, in turn, required the issuance of more sovereign debt, further jeopardizing the governments' fiscal position and banks' solvency.

<p>Participating in EU crisis-management operations has affected institutional actors on various levels. As the main deliverers of civilian and military resources to EU operations, national ministries and agencies have been particularly confronted with the need for administrative adaptation. A big member state like Germany is expected to make substantial contributions, but it also faces a rigid administration. This article uses a combined hypothesis of historical institutionalism and organizational learning to explain administrative Europeanization in German government institutions involved in civilian and military crisis management deployments. The empirical data on the German administrative trajectories under G. Schröder and A. Merkel show an explanatory link between political learning and overcoming institutional path dependency. [R]</p>

<p>While a number of scholars have focused on the importance of partisan agenda control in the US House, few have examined its uneven consequences within the majority party. We explore “counterfactual” utility distributions within the majority party, by comparing policy outcomes under a party-less median voter model to policy outcomes under party-based positive and negative agenda control models. We show that the distribution of policy losses and benefits resulting from agenda control are quite similar for both the positive and negative varieties. In both cases, moderate majority-party members are made worse off by the exercise of partisan agenda control, while those to the extreme side of the majority-party median benefit disproportionately.

<p>A party ban of the NPD is not an imperative. Irrespective of its antidemocratic objectives which it pursues aggressively and militantly, the party is far from being a serious danger for constitutional democracy. Whatever its representatives declare wholeheartedly does not have anything to do with reality. To put it exaggeratedly: a non-ban is the imperative for two reasons: (1) the existence of such a party [gives] constitutional democracy the chance to observe it and interpret its results at the polls as a seismograph for the prevalence of right-wing extremist attitudes among the population. (2) Liberality forbids hauling out the big guns against a force of this kind which is thoroughly isolated. After all, party bans are a severe encroachment upon the openness of the formation of political will. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Theories of environmental outcomes have been developed mostly through large-<italic>N</italic> cross-national studies, which have a structuralist bias and rely heavily on correlations. Structured, focused case studies can help overcome those limitations by incorporating political processes and identifying causal mechanisms. Climate-policy outcomes in Germany vary greatly across policy areas such as emissions target setting, the economic transformation of eastern Germany, renewable energy, ecological tax reform, voluntary agreements with industry, emissions trading, and unregulated increases in the consumption of household heating, transportation, and electricity. Comparative analysis of nine case studies indicates that environmental outcome theories should more fully include external focusing events, advocacy coalition formation, multiple paths of influence for green parties, and the negative effects of neocorporatism and unregulated technological change and consumption.

<p>This note discusses aspects of the prize phenomenon and the opportunities and challenges related with the use of innovation prizes as a government policy instrument. Compared to other incentive mechanisms, prizes are likely to present advantages, for example, to accelerate the development and commercialization of technologies that are held back for diverse reasons and help to leverage public money with external ideas, collaborative efforts, and the participation of diverse individuals and organizations. Still, despite these advantages and other interesting features of prizes, there are key questions that policy-makers and scholars must address to better understand this kind of incentive and further improve prize designs and implementations before governments move forward to a more widespread use of innovation prizes in science and technology policies.

<p>This collection explores the idea that devolution in European states can provide “laboratories of democracy” as states experiment in different ways to address social and economic problems and engage their citizens. While there is a substantial literature on policy diffusion and learning among US states, and on transfer and learning between countries, there is not much on learning among European federated and devolved governments. This collection fills that gap with a series of studies based primarily on experiences in Germany, Spain and the UK (including a particular focus on Northern Ireland). The introduction sets up the analytical framework, discussing the concepts of learning and transfer, the direction of transfer (for example, from the center to the devolved territory), the mechanisms involved (from voluntary to coercive) and the degree of transfer.

<p>This paper explores the policy-transfer and learning process within the UK since 1999, examining the conditions in which transfer takes place among central and devolved governments. We distinguish among concurrent policies, policy competition, coercive transfer and policy-learning. Policy-transfer can be more or less coercive and constrained, while policy-learning is voluntary. Mechanisms for transfer include financial instruments, political parties, the civil service and policy communities. Transfer can take place from center to periphery, from periphery to center and across the periphery. There is also transfer at the European and international levels. As England has tended to break with older policies, notably on public service provision, the pressure has been to follow its lead, with the devolved administrations resisting or conforming.

<p>A growing body of work seeks to explain the lack of clear evidence for the diversionary use of force by casting doubt on such strategies' attractiveness for policy-makers: while domestic political and economic problems may provide incentives for diversion, such strategies involve political and military risks that frequently outweigh these incentives. Such theories correctly identify the objective risks involved in diversion but do not account for variation in leaders' risk-taking propensities. We develop a “first image” theory of diversion that suggests a key psychological variable (locus of control) shapes leaders' willingness to engage in risky diversionary strategies. A statistical analysis of the American use of force, 1953–2000, finds strong support for this model. The lack of clear evidence for diversion in general is a reflection of the contingent nature of the phenomenon. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Romania has among the most extensive and complicated arrangement of reserved seats, with 18 different ethnic minorities currently provided special parliamentary representation. This paper addresses two key political issues: how is it determined that there exists a valid ethnic minority deserving of recognition with a reserved seat? What are the political consequences from the broad allocation of reserved seats? The paper understands a reserved legislative seat as a distributive good over which rival claimants assert contested title. Incumbent interests have incentive to restrict competitive entry without appearing to violate the principles of open inclusion. As seen through the Romanian case, the regime consequence from this dynamic tends to be clientele politics, in which minority organizations emerge segmented, dependent, and relatively powerless.

<p>The appointment of ministers according to the chancellorship model, which excludes the Parliament from any voting on their appointment, i.e., also from the vote of investiture on the government, would undermine their legitimacy and disproportionally strengthen the constitutional position of the president of the government.

However, it will not be possible to form a stable government without changing the electoral system, which systematically causes party fragmentation of the National Assembly. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>In April 2009, the Chinese government unveiled a plan for a comprehensive overhaul of the country's medical system. This dramatic moment was preceded by public debate, as well as government introduction of forums for public participation, which allowed diverse social groups to provide feedback on the policy-making process. Tracing the origins and outcome of the debate and public participation, we ask whether this debate and participation go beyond consultation and could be regarded as deliberation. Finally, we evaluate whether this process could precipitate a democratic transition. We contend that the government introduced participatory forums for the purpose of conducting consultation, yet the design of the arenas for consultation created some space for limited deliberation. [Although] this process is not likely to produce a democratic transition, it may contribute to better governance. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This paper analyzes the changes of the Croatian citizenship regime [since] its independence. Over the last two decades, Croatia established a distinctive citizenship regime marked by stable citizenship legislation and changing boundaries of recognized rights for different categorizes of Croatian citizens. The stability of the status dimension of citizenship can be traced to the unchallenged primacy of the nationhood conceived as a transnational community of ethnic Croats. Still, within a largely culturally bounded citizenry established on such an understanding of nationhood, changes were possible due to external circumstances and incentives internal to Croatian politics.

<p>This paper examines the nascent citizenship regime in Kosovo since the country's declaration of independence in 2008.

In addition, it claims that the present legal, political and territorial dispute in Kosovo seriously undermines the consolidation of Kosovo's citizenship regime and has turned Kosovo into a territory of <italic>de facto</italic> shared sovereignties (condominium-like constellations).

<p>Three principal periods of state transformation can be distinguished in Venezuela: the period of formation of the centralized national state from C. Castro's and J.V. Gómez's government until the end of the military dictatorship in 1958; the stage of party democracy based on the Punto Fijo Pact; the neomilitarist age marked by the 1992 coup d'état and H. Chávez's rise to power in 1999. During these crucial periods of change in the political system of Venezuela, the Armed Forces were used to introduce and legitimize new political projects. As a result, they occupied a key position in the state, not only as an institution responsible for security and military tasks, but also as a political mediator, state administrator and supporter of development.</p>

It shows that the text of the Constitution abolishes neither democracy nor the rule of law, but contains — apart from “fashionable” developments such as a “sustainable development” — some potentially illiberal parts and certain rules that, due to their vagueness, may open ways for abuse.

<p>Relative social and economic well-being in the aftermath of a state's collapse is usually explained on the basis of a single case, Somalia, and with reference to the impact of endogenous factors such as the repressive nature of the state and the ability of civil society actors and institutions to fulfill those functions normally performed by a state. This article challenges this theoretical view. As [the case] of Lebanon [shows], relative well-being after state collapse is more common than it appears to be. Moreover, given the limited role that the Lebanese state played before the breakdown of state authority in 1975, the nature of the collapsed state cannot be the explanatory variable. Exogenous factors, such as remittances from abroad, international loans and “political money” from foreign powers, are the decisive factors generating such paradoxical developments. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article assumes that the BRICS form a heterogeneous coalition of often competing powers that share a common fundamental political objective: to erode Western hegemonic claims by protecting the principle which these claims are deemed to most threaten, namely the political sovereignty of states. The BRICS form a coalition of sovereign state defenders. While they do not seek to form an anti-Western political coalition based on a counter-proposal or radically different vision of the world, they are concerned with maintaining their independence of judgment and national action in an increasingly economically and socially interdependent world. They consider that state sovereignty trumps all, including the political nature of its underpinning regimes. Thus, the BRICS — even the democratic ones — fundamentally diverge from the liberal vision of Western countries. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>To investigate the “promiscuous history” of the efficiency of emissions trading markets, I draw from Actor Network Theory and specifically the work of B. Latour, highlighting how the commonly made claim to efficiency was constructed as a “fact”. I trace the processes, beginning in the early 1970s, that constructed first the inefficiency of command-and-control regulation through the distinction between the means and the ends of regulation, and the conversion of the specific 1970 [US] Clean Air Act regulations into the archetypal form of command-and-control. Alongside this, the efficiency of emissions trading was constructed through the provision of empirical, modeling evidence and the reconstruction of the Environmental Protection Agency's early Emissions Trading System as an “ad hoc” implementation of “pure” economic theory.

<p>Political scientists often study dollar-denominated outcomes that are zero for some observations. These zeros can arise because the observed outcome results from aggregation of a small number of discrete projects or grants, each of varying dollar size. This article describes the use of a compound distribution in which each observed outcome is the sum of a Poisson-distributed number of gamma-distributed quantities, a special case of the Tweedie distribution. Regression models based on this distribution estimate loglinear marginal effects without either the <italic>ad hoc</italic> treatment of zeros or the change in quantity of interest necessary to use a tobit or selection model. The compound Poisson-gamma regression is compared with commonly applied approaches in an application to data on high-speed rail grants from the US federal government to the states, and against simulated data from several data-generating processes.

<p>This essay focuses on the decision by senior NASA officials at the creation of the agency to focus its efforts on human spaceflight, Moon and Mars missions, and human settlement of the solar system. Its leaders made a conscious decision to downplay space applications projects, exclusive of technological research and development, and eschew operational activities. In favoring concentrating on the human exploration and development of space, NASA fell into the prestige trap that dominated this mission in the 1950s and early 1960s. At sum it was a tesseract, a four-dimensional object, which locked NASA into a quest for ever greater space spectaculars featuring human involvement. Power and prestige, therefore, has cast a long shadow on the space agency, forcing it into a series of programs that have been oversold and undervalued. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The Swedish Sami Assembly is both a representative body elected by the Indigenous Sami people and a government agency under the Swedish state. Since its inception, this construction has been critiqued by the Sami people and Swedish governmental commissions alike: the Sami Assembly's dual roles are seen to be in fundamental conflict with one another. This article provides the first empirical study of the political and practical consequences of these conflicting roles. We analyze the extent to which the Sami Parliament is able to perform its role as a government agency. We argue that the dual roles of the Sami Parliament create problems not only for the decision-making powers of the Assembly as a government agency, but also constitute a structural obstacle to Sami self-determination.

<p>When higher court judges attempt to assert control over lower-court decision making, do such hierarchical politics shape legal doctrine? Using a “case-space” model of choice between determinate doctrines (rules) and more flexible doctrines (standards), I argue that the structure of doctrine affects the application of and compliance with doctrine by lower courts, and this in turn affects choice among doctrinal structures. Doctrinal choice, legal complexity, lower court discretion, and the allocation of judicial resources are shown to depend on hierarchical conflict, the transparency of decisions, sensitivity to case facts, judicial expertise, salience of the issue area, and issue complexity. These incentives have counterintuitive effects on lower court discretion and on doctrinal specificity, and they create odd patterns of ideological and doctrinal alignment. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Amidst a nationwide crackdown on civil society, the Sudan Armed Forces and paramilitary Popular Defense Forces have repeatedly caused death, dislocation, and starvation in the provinces of South Kordofan and Blue Nile. Sudan is a signatory to many international agreements affirming human rights to all people regardless of religion, race, or ethnicity. Yet in these provinces bordering the recently independent South Sudan, Christians, non-Arab Muslims, ethnic Nubas, and people suspected of supporting the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North have been targeted for devastation and destruction. Led by President Bashir and the National Congress Party, the government in Khartoum has violated human rights and restricted humanitarian access to South Kordofan and Blue Nile. It is time for the world to confront them for their abusive, undemocratic governance. [R]</p>

<p>The [US District Court] <italic>Dover</italic> decision [2005] restricted the mention of Intelligent Design in a public school science classroom, yet the opinion offers an inadequate defensive position. Liberal democracy can exclude Intelligent Design based on the Establishment Clause, yet courts do not affirm the teaching of best available science or connect teaching science to other constitutional rights, duties, or institutions.

<p>An overwhelming body of literature concentrates on whether governments and representatives share congruent opinions with the general public. Though these are important questions of representation, this article proposes not to consider actual policy positions, but to study whether governments share similar issue priorities with citizens. I argue that this is an important feature of the link between government and citizens in a representative democracy and should in fact precede the study of policy positions. This study investigates the correspondence of issue priorities in the Netherlands between 1971 and 2008. Despite recent concerns about the manifestation of a gap between citizens and political elites, it seems that issue priorities of the government move hand-in-hand in public priorities. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>A new discourse in which culture is increasingly integrated into a policy agenda dealing with innovation policy, and the fostering of growth and economic competitiveness more generally, is currently gaining ground at the EU level. Surprisingly, it is the Directorate-General for Culture, Youth and Education (DG Culture) of the European Commission that has initiated and promoted this policy agenda in an attempt to gain control over policy. By identifying the factors that enabled a small, hardly influential DG to reframe culture as a key factor of economic competitiveness and to impose this programmatic solution both within the Commission and at the intergovernmental level, this article sheds light on the key dynamics of agenda-setting in the EU institutional context.

<p>This article deals with ICT policy activism on a national level and studies the case of Germany, where ICT policy activism became known to the public through its protest against the blocking of websites and data retention. Civil society is a political actor here, being invited to policy consultations. Drawing on the governance approach and resource-mobilization theory, we interviewed 20 leading ICT policy activists about their values and goals, and forms of organization and political protest. According to their different focuses we distinguished between four types of activism: privacy protection, free access to information, free software and open standards, and equal opportunities for women in ICT policy. These activists are particular in that their political claims focus on the tools they are using for mobilizing and organizing. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>In 2008, B. Obama pledged to transform not simply his nation's domestic orientation but also its foreign policy and its reception abroad; he would be the “un-Bush” president. The books under review each offer a preliminary assessment of how far he has departed from G.W. Bush and how far he has adapted and improved his predecessor's approach. For some, Obama has been compromised in his international agenda, like Bush before him, by domestic constraints that have afflicted every modern US president; for others, his lofty ambitions have been hobbled by the enduring realities of global politics. This review offers a typology of assessments of Obama's foreign policy and suggests which is more accurate and why. [R]</p>

<p>The Truth and Reconciliation Commission has been investigating the array of crimes committed in Canada's Indian Residential Schools. Genocide is being invoked with increasing regularity to describe the crimes inflicted within the IRS system, the intent behind those crimes, and the legacies that have flowed from them. Did Canada commit genocide against Aboriginal peoples by attempting to forcibly assimilate them in residential schools? How does the UN Genocide Convention help interpret genocide claims? If not genocide, what other descriptors are more appropriate? Our position might be described as “fence-sitting”: whether genocide was committed cannot be definitively settled at this time. This has to do with polyvalent interpretations of the term, coupled with the growing body of evidence the TRC is building up. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The conventional wisdom has been that the Canadian Citizenship Act and the British Nationality and Australian Citizenship Act demonstrated the growth of a local nationalism after the Second World War. In reality, the situation was more complicated. Both English-speaking Canada and Australia still regarded themselves as British nations. The passage of the Canadian Act illustrated the bicultural nature of that country, which developments during the war had brought to the fore. The Australian Act was simply a reaction to the Canadian Act, as the latter had undermined the common code of British subject status across the Commonwealth. Meanwhile, the British Nationality Act was primarily an attempt to preserve the common status of British subjects throughout the Commonwealth and maintain the integrity of this organization [while] it was being rapidly transformed.

Government and opposition form two camps, which both mainly shout over the government-opposition divide. No clear linear electoral cycle is apparent.

<p>In the 1990s, the Cuban government instituted a “dual economy”, creating a dollar economy parallel to the peso economy as part of the reform package designed to address economic crisis. Expansion of the tourism sector as a dollar industry was central to efforts to raise revenue, as Cuba began limited and regulated interaction with the global capitalist economy. In an effort to quarantine Cubans from capitalist inequities, citizens were prohibited from accessing tourist facilities other than as workers. Some have referred to this as “tourist apartheid”. [However,] “apartheid” is not an accurate classification of the system in Cuba; rather, the policy is comparable to an economic “firewall” designed to allow regulated engagement with the international capitalist community, while preventing ingress of capitalism domestically.

<p>We consider the place of the rule of law the constitution of the UK, in which supremacy rests not with the constitution as a document to be interpreted by a constitutional court, but with the legislature itself. While traditionally the supremacy of the Crown in Parliament has meant that British courts have had no right to set aside even the most oppressive legislation, recent extra-judicial writings and <italic>obiter dicta</italic> in case law have been indicative of a shift in the judicial mood.

I argue for a more empirical and comparative approach to hybrid governance that is capable of distinguishing between constructive and corrosive forms of non-state order, and sharpens rather than blurs the relationship between formal and informal regulation. A critique of the theoretical and methodological issues surrounding hybrid governance perspectives sets the scene for a comparative analysis of two contrasting situations of hybrid security systems: the RCD-ML of eastern DR Congo, and the Bakassi Boys vigilante group of eastern Nigeria.

Learning is then examined between NI and Ireland; between NI and Great Britain (GB); and between Ireland and GB. These sections involve private and public employers, as well as the public-sector duties, and touch on institutional design.

<p>Concerted support from business organizations for increased state welfare provision is unexpected in liberal capitalism, but in Britain this occurred prior to recent major reforms of pensions. Using Mares' micro-theory of employer behavior and studies of public/private mixes, this article shows that three umbrella organizations of employers and insurers supported higher state pensions because incremental state regulation of non-state provision over many decades and threats about even greater compulsion in the private sector had significantly reduced company control while increasing their costs. As a result, a higher state pension appeared more attractive to all business actors than further regulation of the private sphere. On this basis, we suggest that state regulation should be incorporated more firmly into theories of institutional development and interest formation in liberal regimes. [R]</p>

At the same time, the political and psychological sensibilities surrounding terrorism, in combination with public demands for action, may require democratic governments to respond. Any response, however, needs to be carefully calibrated to meet the requirements of proportionality and (potential) effectiveness. [R]</p>

<p>Nations in the Arab world are largely unitary states, yet Iraq has embarked on a seemingly ambitious agenda of decentralization and devolution mixed with federalism. While local elections have been delayed at least until 2012, and indeed may never take place, Iraq's constitutional commitment to decentralize and subsequent statutory enactments appear to be turning provincial governments into significant actors in Iraqi governance. Progress has taken place at a slower, more deliberate pace than both proponents and opponents feared in 2002–2006.

<p>This paper analyzes church-state relations from the perspective of democratic theory and practice in Western nation-states, at two levels. A more conceptual level involves the discussion of the relationship between religion and democracy, typologies of church-state relations in comparative research and the question whether a particular type of democracy corresponds with a particular pattern of church-state relations and religious governance. This is then applied to a medium range comparison of 19 Western democracies (EU-15, minus Greece and Luxembourg, plus Norway, Switzerland, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand). At an empirical and historical level, some country cases are considered in light of a historical delineation of the link between the genesis of church-state regimes and the emergence of modern democracy at the onset of globalization.

Launched in 2003, its objective is to bring development funds directly to rural people and to establish democratically elected local councils that will identify needs, and plan and manage the reconstruction. Although the NSP's political significance faded in the context of the presidential elections of 2009, the program illustrates how reconstruction funds are an integral part of Afghanistan's social and political landscape.

<p>Singapore's marketing strategy as a “gateway” between East and West, a project developed at the end of the 1990s, is based on the city-state's re-positioning in the knowledge-based economy between an emerging China and Western societies. This project targets elite populations — locals or migrants — to frame a citizenship design combining mobility and talent. I critically assess the impacts of Singapore's gateway strategies on the formation of citizens-subjects through the notion of un/desirability. By focusing on stories of desirable subjects, I stress the everyday tensions arising in the production of neo-liberal citizens. I argue that desirable subjects are struggling with the neo-liberal pressures to become “self-governed entrepreneurs” at the gateway, which is symptomatic of schisms between the city-state's citizenship project and their own practice.

<p>D. Fassin's <italic>La Force de l'ordre</italic> [Paris, 2011] produces an analysis of French anti-crime police units named BAC. The survey results, similar to those established for several years by police sociology, are linked to a triple ambition: to carry out an anthropology of public/social order in working-class districts and, ultimately, of the state; to conduct a comprehensive analysis of police action in order to make it possible to criticize this action; to generate a public debate on police practices. These three objectives are thwarted, respectively, by the poverty of the descriptions mobilized by the author, by the asymmetric treatment he reserves to the actors and, finally, by a misconception of the relationships between social sciences and society.

<p>Performance management techniques are presented as control mechanisms to save money and hold bureaucrats accountable, consistent with negative agency-theory assumptions of bureaucrats. We propose an alternative theory of performance management that rests on pro-social values. This theory argues that public servants who see the social impact of their work are more likely to use performance metrics. We operationalize performance information use in terms of purposeful use for internal organizational means, and political use for external legitimation. Those who perceive that their work has a strong social impact are likely to pursue both types of uses, to improve both the effectiveness of their services, and to maintain resources. The data come from a cross-sectional survey of US public and nonprofit employees. [R]</p>

<p>This article [examines] the interaction of institutions, interests and ideas as explanatory factors for change and continuity in welfare regimes. The case study of the politics of Irish social security (1986–2010) explores how and why the Irish social security system has diverged from the UK and liberal regimes. The argument favors a balanced explanation over institutional explanations, which stress corporatism as the explanatory factor for the Irish case. This more integrated approach enables a fuller consideration of the impact that seismic political change may have on Irish and UK social security reform and allows greater understanding about conditions underlying stability and change in social policy.

<p>The passage of electoral gender quotas raises questions about why male elites would support policies that seemingly go against their self-interests. Recent work on France suggests that quota adoption is self-interested because male legislators benefit from alleged voter bias against female candidates. This article evaluates this explanation as a means for understanding quota adoption globally. It argues that the key actors are not legislators but political parties. Developing an alternative causal story centered on “party pragmatism”, it finds that decisions to introduce quotas are rational and consistent once a range of incentives — ideological, electoral, and strategic — are taken into account.

<p>The adoption of new rules of procedure by the French National Assembly in 2009, following the constitutional revision of 2008, drew attention to the problem of parliamentary absenteeism and the issue of MPs' efficiency.

Drawing on an econometric analysis, we assess the impact of personal and political characteristics on MPs' performance. We highlight the effects of multiple-office holding and the majority-opposition cleavage on parliamentary efficiency. [R]</p>

<p>There are about 150 million migrant workers in China. Compared with their urban counterparts, migrant workers find it difficult to gain equal access to employment, social security and other public services. Providing public services to migrant workers poses a big challenge for both receiving and sending regions. Based on a survey of migrant workers and government officials conducted in 2009 in Guangzhou, one of the key receiving cities of migrant workers, this article examines migrant workers' needs for, and knowledge of, public services. It also reviews current policy responses and service provision mechanisms of both the receiving and sending regions, and evaluates the gap between the service needs of migrant workers and governments' provision of services, and explores more effective ways to satisfy needs through enhanced cooperation and coordination among government departments and NGOs.

<p>Throughout history, alcohol policy has been tied to ideas of cultural change. In 2000, the New Labour government proposed deregulatory legislation that was designed, in part, to change British drinking cultures. However, implementation of the subsequent 2003 Licensing Act coincided with developments in alcohol retail and drinking behaviors which created widespread public concern. Government alcohol policy was also criticized by public health advocates who rejected the model of cultural change which underpinned it. Focusing on England and Wales, this article considers how an emphasis on culture-change outcomes undermined the political success of New Labour's alcohol policy; how media responses reinforced problematic ideas around British drinking culture; and how public health policy lobbying on alcohol has exposed a marked political divide over the role of legislation in shaping public attitudes and behaviors.

<p>Despite the changing character of immigration and changing state strategies, all French governments throughout a 40-year period sought to maintain the national character by making full access to rights contingent on one's conformity to national values and moralities. [Thus], the legitimacy of immigrant activists seeking to expand their rights has depended on their abilities to conform to the rules of the national political game. Resisting marginalization therefore requires the assimilation of the immigrants into nationally specific political cultures, which contributes to reinforcing the national character of citizenship regimes. By examining the particular case of France, the paper shows how top-down and bottom-up processes by states and activists work in different ways to keep the nation at the center of citizenship regimes despite the ongoing and very real challenges presented by transnationalism and globalization.

<p>The IEA projects that solely China will account for 30 percent of global growth in energy demand until 2035 and its share of global energy consumption will increase to 23 percent. Since the turn of the millennium this immense rise of demand encounters increasingly tight resource markets and Beijing shows an extraordinary pragmatism to enforce its interests in terms of energy policy abroad. All political, economic and diplomatic capacities are utilized to diversify its supplies. Accordingly, the Chinese energy policy affects the world markets as well as the global supply security.

<p>This article argues that the political significance of the Coalition government's proposed changes to administrative justice, including the abolition of the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council, is in danger of passing unnoticed, despite its potential significance for the Big Society agenda. It suggests that a genuine perspective lies in paying closer attention both to the contemporary importance of administrative justice and to the political debates of the 1950s and 1960s, which set opposing views of administrative justice in broadly libertarian and egalitarian contexts respectively. The recovery in particular of an egalitarian account of administrative justice is necessary to animate, and rebalance, the debate. Administrative justice might then be perceived as an essential part of a broader political vision and a significant aspect of social justice more ambitiously conceived. [R]</p>

<p>While significant attention has been dedicated to explaining women's election to office, fewer studies have assessed female politicians' access to positions of power within legislatures. This latter topic became particularly salient in the British House of Commons following the 2010 general election, when recently adopted reforms introduced intracameral elections for select committee members and chairs. This article outlines three hypotheses concerning the influence of candidate sex on election outcomes: a gender bias against female candidates, a gender advantage favoring female candidates, and gender-neutral outcomes. Drawing on two original data-sets, the results not only fail to support the gender-bias hypothesis but also demonstrate that women were advantaged in the interparty elections for committee chairs.

<p>Which government agency should have primary responsibility for the internet? The US seems to have decided this question in favor of the military. Those in the legal community who support this development are divided as to the appropriate legal rules to guide the military in its oversight of the internet. Specialists on the international law on the use of force argue that with analogy and interpretation, current international law can be applied in a way that allows great freedom without sending the message that the US is acting lawlessly when it comes to the internet. The way forward is to follow the Cold War strategy of threatening enemies with overwhelming force and preparing to act on these threats.

<p>Six remarkable parallels in the histories of Iraq and Sudan suggest that analysts should have predicted that the Kurds and the South Sudanese would have been equally ardent secessionists in the early 21st c. Yet Kurdish nationalist leaders chose federalization in and after 2005, whereas South Sudanese nationalists eventually chose secession after a brief federal power-sharing experiment. The different choices of the respective nationalist leaders were therefore critical, but some plausible explanations of their different choices do not withstand scrutiny. [In addition to] the different geopolitical neighborhoods of Iraq and Sudan, I suggest that secessions are also driven by political parties who are willing to downsize their state rather than modify the existing regime, and by nationalists who calculate that they are unlikely to have political pivotality in a federal democracy.

<p>Over the past twenty years, the emphasis of reform attempts to improve efficiency within the English NHS has oscillated between markets and targets. Both strategies are informed by standard economic theory but thus far have achieved varying degrees of success. Behavioral economics is currently in vogue and offers an alternative (or, in some cases, a complement) to standard economic theory on what motivates human behavior. Three aspects of behavioral economics are considered here: identity, loss-aversion, and hyperbolic discounting. This article speculates on the extent to which these three concepts can explain the success or otherwise of the NHS market and target policies of the last two decades, and some suggestions are offered as to how policies might be usefully designed in the future.

[Résumé en français]</p>
<p>Institutional capacity-development is commonly conceptualized in an instrumental way; the concern is how to implement policy and realize project designs by aligning institutional realities with policy prescriptions. When assessed against project aims, capacity-development interventions are often partially successful and sometimes unsuccessful. Inspired by an actor-oriented approach to understanding the processes and outcomes of institutional capacity-development, this article argues that the real logics of actors are not in line with the formal ideas and assumptions of the project. This argument is based on a case study of a project to develop capacity for the Clean Development Mechanism in Uganda implemented over four years in the mid-2000s. The politics of processes of institutional change are largely ignored in an instrumental approach. [R, abr.]</p>

The eigenvalues produced by the scaling procedure indicate that during each electoral term Aduskunta is primarily one dimensional and only weak traces of a possible second dimension exist. The most important dimension regarding each electoral term turns out to be the government-opposition division, while it is hard to provide sensible interpretations for the second dimensions, which at best reflect a weak left-right division. The scaling method performs poorly in a case where political party groups' voting cohesion is extremely high. [R]</p>

<p>The role and powers of the President of the Italian Republic have too often been considered just ceremonial. This article compares the pre-1992 and the post-1993 periods. In the first, when Italian parties were entrenched and strong, they could prevent the presidents from autonomously playing all their powers, and did so quite successfully. In the second period, following the major crisis derived from the Clean Hands investigation and the reform of the electoral system, Italian parties have seen their political strength significantly curtailed. As a consequence, the three presidents from 1993 to now have used their full panoply of powers. This article documents the most important instances in which the presidents have resorted to their constitutional powers against the ill-founded and extra-constitutional protests of center-right and center-left prime Ministers and party leaders.

<p>The authors discuss the Israeli High Court of Justice 2009 decision that declared private incarceration unconstitutional. Addressing widespread concerns that the decision lacked adequate justification, they trace its weakness to the utilization of liberal arguments, none of which can fully denounce the transference or delegation of important public powers to private profit-making entities. Instead, they argue that adequate justification is available in civic republicanism, which demonstrates the continuing presence of the earlier values of Israeli politics. This presence, however, is tenuous at best. The country's “constitutional revolution” rooted in neoliberalism has not yet been fully reversed. The article attests to the uneasy relationship between constitutionalism and liberalism and the fact that fostering constitutionalism requires the development of other more political forms of justification.

<p>The Croatian “decentralization package” from mid-2001 has shown how multiple pressures for shifting power to the local level may actually result in relative failure. The central government has ceded control in particular policy sectors by shifting responsibilities for certain educational, welfare and health services to the counties and municipalities. However, the decentralization initiative was excessively marked as very limited and strongly labeled by the vertical policy dimension, expressing the dominance of top-down incentives of the central government in comparison to bottom-up initiatives stemming from the local government units. The 2001 decentralized package did not substantially increase the portion of local governments finance in total public finance, showing a failure to provide local government units with stronger fiscal capacity.

This is the first new case of judicial review of legislation issued by the Israeli Supreme Court, after a period of clashes between the powers of the state and of apparent self-restraint on part of the Court. It is easy to see, both from a historical analysis and from the reasoning given in the judgment, the importance of the new case's “systemic” consequences and its implications for the general constitutional architecture, in the context of a legal system that is still “in search” of a constitution.

We explore the implications of this case for more general “Kafkaesque organization”, that sometimes reproduce, in more benign forms, many of the practices found at S-21. [R]</p>

We test the impact of this new measure on candidates' reelection prospects and their vote share by analyzing senatorial elections from 1948 to 2008. We find that the share of the vote obtained by incumbents increases linearly with time spent in office. [R]</p>

<p>Within African legal communities, the dominant view blames the poor record of judicial review in post-colonial African states on judicial timidity and other judge-centered factors. According to the conventional narrative, Africa's judges have failed to play a credible countervailing role in national political and constitutional governance because they have been “timorous souls”, not “bold spirits”. This essay challenges this judge-centered explanation for the failure of judicial review in postcolonial Africa. In place of the conventional narrative, which views judicial review as a purely legal phenomenon, I offer an alternative thesis that highlights the primacy of political and social contexts. Judicial review has had a difficult time in post-colonial Africa primarily because the times and the politics have (at least until very recently) been inauspicious. [R, abr.]</p>

Furthermore, the negative effect of an oil-dependent economy does not hold in the subset of Muslim-majority states once Shari'a family law inclusion is accounted for. [R]</p>

<p>This paper explores the production of temporariness in Canada, and its implications for the citizenship rights of migrants. It investigates this production within three policy fields not typically examined together: security, work and settlement. Within these three fields, it considers public policies concerning: (1) security of presence; (2) access to paid employment for spouses of migrants; and (3) eligibility for settlement services. It argues that temporariness is being institutionalized in new ways, producing a hierarchy of categories of migrants ranging from the temporarily temporary to the permanently temporary and temporarily permanent, shaped by entry category, legal residency status and socially recognized skills. The paper advances a multidimensional conception of temporariness, and contends that the temporary-permanent divide is constructed through the enforcement of different entry categories and forms of legal residency status.

<p>Mixed-member legislative systems have proliferated in the last twenty years, and while our knowledge of the institutional impacts has grown, we have had difficulty in separating institutional and contextual (namely party) influences. Through an analysis of Taiwan before and after the implementation of a mixed member majoritarian (MMM) system, the level of contamination between tiers and variance between parties becomes clearer. Survey results show a marked shift in constituency focus for district candidates, moving from multimember to single-member districts, while party-list seats focus on district factors at higher rates post-reform. Variance between the two major parties further suggests differing levels of party pressure. [R]</p>

[Résumé en français]</p>
<p>The period prior to the 2007 downturn was characterized by growing weight of financial capital and a de-regulation process in the financial activity. When economies faced collapse, governments applied Keynesian measures to save capitalism from its own craziness. It seemed that a new equilibrium was arising between the market and the states, paving the way to a more sustainable growth. However, this sort of public support, has ended in a material rise in public deficit. Paradoxically, Europe rather that the US has approached this issue by applying restrictive expense rules, reducing national sovereignty. This economic federalism is not resulting into a real progression in the terms of economic governance. Rather, it moves the Eurozone away from democracy and European economic government. [R]</p>

<p>Since 2004, the Electoral Commission has become the principal body in the UK undertaking research into the electoral registers; we present the findings from a national study on the quality of Great Britain's electoral registers, which was funded by the Cabinet Office. We also consider what these findings tell us about how the plans to change the electoral registration system, from one of household registration to individual electoral registration, could affect the registers. The Electoral Commission supports the introduction of individual electoral registration (IER) because we believe it will address vulnerabilities in the current electoral registration process. However, this will be the biggest change to the voter registration process since the universal franchise and its implementation requires careful planning. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Risk-based policy-making is a form of reflexive policy-making that uses risk-analysis to address both the primary objects of policy interventions and their secondary adverse consequences. As such, it has become central to debates about efficiency, control and accountability in UK government. To better understand the factors shaping its emergence, this article studies the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs' (DEFRA) adoption of risk-based policy-making. In-depth interviews with DEFRA staff suggest that risk-based policy-making serves conflicting objectives and struggles to perform its extensive functions. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Under the Constitution of India, the Election Commission has responsibility to prepare the electoral rolls. Yet, the Commission's role has vacillated between playing the role of a protector and facilitator. This contradictory position [is shown] where the Commission [is involved] in disputes over citizenship. [Its] task of “superintending” the preparation of electoral rolls has translated into the power of the Election Commission to identify “legitimate” voters and to sift out for that purpose, the citizens from non-citizens. A stern adherence to procedures has also led the Election Commission on a collision course with specific state governments, following the Election Commission's initiative to check the validity of voters, emerging from what the Election Commission saw as a “suspicious” increase in the number of voters.

The drug cartels are waging an endless and extremely barbarous battle, and the 50,000 soldiers deployed by President Calderón have been unable to resolve the problem; the economy is stagnating; poverty is spreading; and millions of young people have neither jobs, nor education. It looks like radical reforms will be necessary. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This paper examines the complex citizenship regime in contemporary Bosnia and Herzegovina, its historical origin and social implications. It argues that the Bosnian citizenship regime, established in Dayton in 1995, actually implies existence of a plurality of regimes and conceptions of citizenship in this country, which frames political outcomes and affects the status of human rights. It analyzes the legal structure of Bosnian citizenship, its bifurcated nature and corresponding political effects. It also analyzes different visions and conceptions of citizenship and examines their relation to country's ethnic politics. In addition, this paper looks at not only Bosnian citizenship through the prism of post-conflict arrangements, but also regional influences and policies that determine citizenship's various dimensions.

<p>This paper analyzes how macro-societal conditions determine educational inequality between migrants and natives in the Western EU member states. The education system, with its ability to integrate young immigrants, is often seen as the foundation for successful integration in later curricular stages. By means of linear hierarchical models, this paper demonstrates that EU standards of good practice in integration policy are ineffective in producing equal educational opportunities for immigrant pupils. Educational inequality between migrants and natives is mainly a result of the political-institutional settings. The paper thus rejects the widely held belief that consensus democracies are in fact kinder and gentler. By contrast, the analyses reveal that majoritarian democracies are more effective in equalizing educational opportunities between immigrants and natives. [R]</p>

<p>This article analyzes recent regime developments in Ukraine in relation to semi-presidentialism. It asks: to what extent and in what ways are theoretical arguments against semi-presidentialism (premier-presidential and president-parliamentary systems) relevant for understanding the changing directions of the Ukrainian regime since the 1990s? It also reviews the overwhelming evidence suggesting that President V. Yanukovych is turning Ukraine into a more authoritarian hybrid regime and raises the question to what extent the president-parliamentary system might serve this end. The article argues that both kinds of semi-presidentialism have, in different ways, exacerbated rather than mitigated institutional conflict and political stalemate. The return to the president-parliamentary system in 2010 — the constitutional arrangement with the most dismal record of democratization — was a step in the wrong direction. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The Norwegian citizenship regime has gradually changed to accommodate demands voiced by the Sami. This article describes and analyzes these changes in terms of changing citizenship status for the Sami as a gradual move from “Norwegian citizens” via “citizens plus” to “dual citizens”. Sami who are registered in the electoral roster for Sami Parliament elections possess political rights connected to two different political systems in Norway: one with membership based on territoriality, the other with membership based on descent. The author argues that the “people-to-people” approach that currently seems to guide Sami aspirations for the political future ignores the condition of dual political membership and is thus ill-suited as a point of departure for discussions of the desirable scope of the future constitutional space of the Sami Parliament in Norway.

<p>This article focuses on the patterns of parliamentary representation and careers in post-communist Ukraine. The data include individual information from parliamentary elections, 1990 to 2007. Low chances for the social upward mobility of socio-demographic groups such as women and poorly educated people were identified, as well as the high impact of social status on inclusion in the political ruling strata, as exemplified by business elites. Furthermore, MPs with an entrepreneurial background have a greater chance of staying in parliament for three or more legislative terms. Experience in a political party is crucial. MPs with leading party experience prior to their recruitment are likely to obtain an incumbent status. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Two facts about Indian politics merit mention: (1) the number of MPs in the Lok Sabha (Lower House) with criminal records is striking; (2) a significant number of extremely wealthy MPs [sit] in Parliament. The criminal records of MPs and their financial worth are available in the public domain thanks to two landmark Supreme Court judgments in 2002 and 2003. I examine these two judgments and the reasoning behind the Court's efforts to inject some transparency into the political system. I argue that while the courts and commissions have had a positive impact in regulating elections in India, it is nowhere enough to restore confidence in politicians and stem electoral corruption.

<p>This article argues that the Blair government's policy of light-touch financial regulation both rested on and reflected its commitment to a financial growth model inherited from the Conservatives in which the key driver of UK economic expansion was a dynamic, fast-expanding and lightly regulated financial sector. The policy can also be seen as a “Faustian Pact” with the City whose earnings, it was calculated, would be a major source of the tax revenues needed to rebuild Britain's fading welfare state. The article examines the principles and precepts which underpinned the policy of light-touch financial regulation and then investigates the reasons for its adoption. It contends that these were as much ideological — a genuine commitment to key tenets of the liberal market variant of capitalism — as structural and institutional. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article offers an account of the peculiar phenomenon of social policy learning in China, and illustrates the situations in which local policy learning can either facilitate, or constrain, the capacity of the central government to monitor social policy development. Based on analyses of the urban pension reform and the introduction of the Minimum Living Standard Scheme, the article concludes that local activism has become an eclectic tool for policy learning and diffusion leading to subnationalization of social protection, which poses a challenge to the central government in its efforts of coherent social policy governance.

<p>This article reviews issues pertaining to representation in Kuwait with a focus on the tension between democratic representation and political exclusion.

We then discuss the issue of non-citizen Kuwaitis and the recent breakthrough regarding their status. Finally, we analyze the recent developments following the Arab Spring events and the ensuing power struggles between the ruling elite and its opposition in parliament and civil society over the role of the prime minister.

<p>Under what conditions and to what extent do external officeholders in parliamentary democracies constrain the cabinet's freedom of action? The article argues that we must analyze both institutional powers and officeholders' incentives to use them to obtain an unbiased estimate of the expected constraint. It measures the incentives dimension via the selection method of external officeholders and develops an index to capture the likelihood that such officeholders hold preferences deviant from those of the cabinet. Analyzing original data on four external constraint institutions in 25 European democracies, the article shows major variation in the incentives to constrain the cabinet across both offices and countries. Furthermore, it demonstrates that institutional powers and incentives for their use are empirically largely independent dimensions. [R]</p>

<p>The author [argues] for a form of deliberative democracy that neither subjects religious discourse to <italic>a priori</italic> exclusion from public conversations nor allows it only on the condition that it conform to secular values. Existing accounts tend to accommodate religion only as identity, not as truth, in Indian politics. Secular politics thus understood tends to calcify religion; it intensifies the problem of religious sectarianism; public space should be therefore open for substantive reflection and discussion about religion from religious perspectives. While the principle of religious neutrality ought to be maintained in select spheres of public life, the state should take measures to promote such activity in civil society, both within and between religious communities.

<p>This article argues that “reservations” in Indian legislatures — i.e., the policy that sets aside seats for the lowest castes and indigenous people in Parliament and state legislative assemblies — provide historically discriminated groups with a “seat at the table” of policy-making. This is a unique approach to achieving social justice in that it guarantees citizens who in India are considered politically, economically, and socially backward the right to air their interests in the legislatures and influence laws and policies. The article then demonstrates how this came to be, the implications it has on some relevant legislation and the desire of new claimants for these rights.

<p>The Model Code of Conduct framed in 1968 by the Election Commission in consultation with political parties and intended for voluntarily adherence, was the consummation of a progressively widening consensus over certain norms first drawn up before the general elections of 1960.

This article examines the contexts and modalities through which the Model Code of Conduct has emerged as an integral aspect of conducting fair and free elections.

Drawing on the literature linking rule of law with human rights, a preliminary evaluation of the extent to which Commonwealth States appear to respect this “thicker” rule of law is provided.

<p>There is little awareness that from the perspective of distributive justice, a transnational market society exercises a justice-disabling effect. No longer is society perceived to be a system of co-operation, the net product of which is to be distributed among all participants fairly, but rather viewed as a composite of uncoordinated templates for the individual pursuit of opportunities. A society of this type does no longer regard a centralized political effort at redistribution as its essential objective; rather, its most fundamental principle concerns equal access to opportunities without regard to nationality or local preference. Such a concern with inclusion appears to be at odds with the received vision of distributive justice whose realization presupposes bounded solidarity and, hence, closure.

<p>This article examines the rapid rise of labor market dualism and inequality in Japan and Korea. It argues that the path-dependent trajectories of labor market and social protection reforms biased in favor of labor market insiders explain recent institutional developments in the two countries. In Japan, political coalitions between conservative policy-makers, large firms, and core regular workers in reform politics consolidated labor market dualism and inequality during its protracted recession. Meanwhile, the organizational capacity of large <italic>chaebol</italic> unions deepened the inequality and the segmentation of the dualistic labor market in Korea.

<p>I analyze diverging political pathways of labor market reform with an empirical focus on the cases of Japan and Korea. Despite similar trends of regulatory reform toward the increase of labor market flexibility, the patterns of labor market reform differed in the two countries. Japan adopted labor market liberalization for nonregular workers with the persistence of employment protection for regular workers. In contrast, Korea opted for regulatory reform for all workers while simultaneously strengthening workers' basic rights and improving protections for nonregular workers. I argue that the institutional features of the employment protection system determine the diverging patterns of labor market reform in Japan and Korea. [R]</p>

<p>It may not be possible to define Rule of Law with scientific precision but it cannot be dismissed as an elusive notion or as an unruly horse. Rule of Law is the heritage of all mankind because its underlying rationale is belief in the human rights and human dignity of all individuals everywhere in the world. There is nothing western or eastern or northern or southern about the concept of Rule of Law. It has a global reach and dimension. Rule of Law symbolizes the quest of civilized democratic societies, be they eastern or western, to combine that degree of liberty without which law is tyranny with that degree of law without which liberty becomes license. It is entrenched in India to the extent that the Rule of Law cannot be abolished even by a constitutional amendment. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7468]</p>

By using the analytical lens of two competing conceptions of nationhood and citizenship (political vs. ethno-cultural), the article analyzes the phenomenon of “fractured citizenship”, as reflected in the apparent tension between an official, elite-driven discourse of the Macedonian model of multi-ethnic democracy on the one hand, and diverging ethno-culturally coded initiatives, ideologies and perceptions, on the other. The article concludes that in the future the fractures will either “heal” through a weakening of the ethnic dimension, or progress towards a new form of fragmented citizenship.

<p>In the 1990s, a regulative pattern that strongly mirrored the structure and basic functions of post-war European corporatism was formed and stabilized in Slovenia. The system enabled the country's relatively fast and smooth inclusion in the European monetary system. However, its former rise and recent tendency towards disorganization clearly overlap with the qualitatively different phases of Europeanization. At first glance, this overlap supports the thesis that there has been a decline of corporatist pacts in the post-EMU period, suggesting that the decline is caused by the more or less successful internalization of EMU demands and pressures during the accommodation process. In the Slovenian case, this interpretation is basically misleading. [Although] the decline of corporatism in Slovenia was connected with EMU pressures, the primary source of its disorganization lay in its specific micro-foundations. [R]</p>

The ways these concepts are used has political consequences for regulations and support of literature and book trade as a whole. Literature is throughout the period and by most speakers credited with a particular value and becomes a symbol of a better and more democratic world. This utopian vision of literature is significant as it is transformed into real-life politics and regulations. [R]</p>

<p>The four state-like entities on the territory of the former Soviet Union that emerged about twenty years ago have successfully defended their precarious independence. So far, most research has focused on the regional and international dimensions of the now “frozen” secessionist conflicts which brought them into being. It is time to [examine] the developments inside these de facto states. First, in order to understand whether there is mutual dependence between internal political structures and processes and the chances of international recognition. Second, the post-Soviet de facto states are model cases for internal transformation or even democratization efforts as a strategy of internal and/or external legitimacy building. The reluctance of academia to analyze the political systems of these entities for fear of legitimizing regimes that do not deserve it is not reasonable.

<p>Well-known tools of state coercion, such as administrative punishment, imprisonment, and violence, affect far fewer than 1% of Chinese journalists and lawyers. What, then, keeps the other 99% in line? Building on work detailing control strategies in illiberal states, the authors suggest that deep-rooted uncertainty about the boundaries of permissible political action magnifies the effect of each crackdown. Unsure of the limits of state tolerance, lawyers and journalists frequently self-censor, effectively controlling themselves. But self-censorship does not always mean total retreat from political concerns. Rather, didactic stories about transgression help the politically inclined map the gray zone between (relatively) safe and unacceptably risky choices. For all but the most optimistic risk-takers, these stories — “control parables” — harden limits on activism by illustrating a set of prescriptions designed to prevent future clashes with authority.

<p>Coase was curious about how commercial advertising fit into First Amendment jurisprudence. Noting that the First Amendment protects “the freedom of speech”, Coase puzzled over why most jurists and scholars assumed that commercial advertising was not entitled to the same constitutional protection as other forms of expression. Indeed, invoking the standard justifications for the constitutional protection of free speech, Coase could discern no principles basis for the lesser degree of protection traditionally accorded commercial advertising. Coase speculated that this doctrine was more likely the product of the particular values and biases of those who made the law. This article examines Coase's thinking about the First Amendment to test both the wisdom of the insights and how the [US Supreme] Court itself evolved over time in its understanding of First Amendment doctrine.

<p>The secular, pluralistic, ethnically diverse, and vibrant democracy that India has nurtured ever since its independence in 1947 has become the envy of many radical and extremist ideologies and religions that seek to bring in order through tools of fourth-generation warfare like Jihad and “Proxy War”. Typical examples of such conflicts facing India are the ones being waged against her by Jihadi organizations like the Lashkar-e-Taiba and other proxy factions supported by the Pakistan InterServices Intelligence Agency. Despite a few pro-active measures instituted by the government of India after the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, there is no clear counter-terrorism policy that has been articulated either in the form of a doctrine or white paper.

<p>This article traces the evolution of the corporate board gender-balance laws in Norway and France. Although it is often said that the presence of women in corporate leadership is “good for business” in Europe, I argue that the new private-sector gender quotas are best understood as mechanisms to improve the democratic legitimacy of the state. In France, the proposal to impose gender quotas on corporate boards emerged shortly after the law imposing similar quotas on candidates for elected office. However, the French constitution had to be amended before each law was ultimately adopted. The unique constitutional genesis of the corporate gender quotas laws in France illustrates the connection between the “business case for diversity” and foundational concerns about the legitimacy of democratic policy-making.

<p>The export of arms belongs to the most contested issues in democracies. We examine the economic repercussions of the recent easing of the Japanese arms-exports restrictions. We develop a rational expectations argument to understand why some political events increase the income of the arms manufacturers, while other ones reduce it or have no effect at all. Event studies suggest that investors closely observe relevant political developments since stock prices of the six arms manufacturers companies reacted consistently to the announcements and leaks as to whether the arms-export restrictions would be lifted or not.

<p>Given Norway's extensive integration within the EU, it is relevant and important to assess whether and, if so, how the Norwegian political system has changed as a result, and how these effects compare with the general patterns among EU member states. The article maps the effects of European integration for four central power relationships in the Norwegian political system: national-supranational authority, executive-legislative-judicial authority, political-administrative authority and national-regional authority. I demonstrate that integration within the EU to a large extent has had the same effects in Norway as in the member states of the EU, despite Norway's alternative form of affiliation: extensive delegation of power to the supranational level, strengthening of the government in relation to the parliament, an increasingly important role for national courts, etc. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>In an effort to discern the significance of Kenya's newly ratified constitution (2010) for its constitutional culture, the author surveys the country's constitutional history by focusing on persons and objects that have played a transcendent and ordering role as competing sites of constitutional order. He adopts as his framework an expanded version of M. Sahlins' notion of the “stranger king”, whereby authority is understood as operating through a combination of alterity and interiority, not only in “traditional” but also in “democratic” societies. He identifies the modes of abstraction and alienation operative in different moments of Kenyan history and sees the new constitution — influenced by Western donors and governments and ratified via popular referendum — as another effort to ground authority within this line of development.

<p>Morocco's new constitution of July 2011 brought very little change and hardly touches on the King's privileges. It continues with the same autocratic system of patronage and clientelism, long associated with those close to the King, ignoring what protesters had requested and the King promised. The revised constitution and subsequent formation of the new government after the elections of November 2011, was a missed opportunity to move Morocco towards real democracy and address some of the country's development needs. This article outlines Morocco's actions in revising its constitution and forming a new government in response to protests and those in handling the Western Sahara conflict. Real democracy in Morocco and the Western Sahara could help both the Kingdom and its adversaries in resolving the conflict. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>A striking feature of British economic and political development in the recent past has been the huge increase in employment reliant on state funding, especially in the less prosperous parts of the country. In many cities, direct public employment provides 30–40 per cent of all work, and private-sector employment has hardly grown at all in the last 10 years. Despite widespread claims about the predominance of “neo-liberalism” in recent British policy-making, the state now provides more employment directly and indirectly than ever before in peacetime. This policy of “local Keynesianism” has arisen from the combination of a national policy of seeking to expand welfare provision from the proceeds of economic growth, with the striking incapacity of the private sector to create employment across much of Britain.

<p>This study remedies the current lack of tax compliance research analyzing tax morale in 10 Eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 or 2007. By exploring tax morale differences between 1999 and 2008, we show that tax morale has decreased in 7 out of 10 Eastern European countries. This lack of sustainability may support the incentive-based conditionality hypothesis that EU has only a limited ability to influence tax morale over time. We observe that events and processes at the country level are crucial to understanding tax morale. Factors such as perceived government quality, trust in the justice system and the government are positively correlated with tax morale in 2008. [R]</p>

<p>Currently, there is an intense debate on the pressures facing public professionals during policy implementation. Frequently, professionals have difficulty identifying with new policies, resulting in diminished policy performance. The author examines this problem using the concept of “policy alienation” and develops and tests a scale for its measurement. Policy alienation is associated conceptually with five subdimensions: strategic powerlessness, tactical powerlessness, operational powerlessness, societal meaninglessness, and client meaninglessness. A policy alienation scale was using a survey of 478 Dutch health care professionals implementing a new financial policy, diagnosis-related groups. The resulting 23-item policy-alienation scale demonstrated good psychometric qualities. A reliable and valid policy-alienation scale can help in understanding and enhancing policy performance.

<p>This paper explores the most salient features of the reshaping of the state-territory-nation triangle in Serbia over the last 20 years, through the lenses of citizenship regime. It looks at the ways in which the dominant political narrative in Serbia has imagined political community and accordingly managed its members. During the period of violent Yugoslav break-up and Milosevic's rule, the Serbian citizenship regime was surprisingly “civic”, while post-2000 liberalization has introduced ethnic elements which are likely to be further strengthened. This apparent contradiction can be explained by the specific goals of Serbian political elites to maintain control over population and territory in changing political circumstances.

<p>[Although] Serbia is a multicultural state, [with] basic regulations which secure the rights of ethnic minorities, and a system of multiculturalism, only partial recognition of the identity and rights of ethnic minorities has been accomplished in Serbia. This has been carried out through introducing procedures, rules, institutions, mechanisms and instruments which guarantee the exercise of rights of ethnic minorities which live and develop their own identity alongside other minorities and the ethnic majority, with the actual effect that, [despite] multiculturalism, the minorities are still separated, mutually and with regard to the majority, i.e., “ghettoized”. This is caused by the established type of segregative multiculturalism, which contributes to the situation in which minorities are separated; they coexist, but are not intermixed in an integrated multicultural society.

Skocpol, successfully characterized neo-Marxism as hopelessly reductionist and functionalist. Despite successful rebuttals to Skocpol's arguments by M. Goldfield in particular, the discipline proved more than willing to continue to ignore what neo-Marxism had to offer. [R]</p>

<p>This paper critically interrogates the dominant Africanist discourse on African state forms and its relationship with pervasive state failure on the continent. Through an examination of the neo-patrimonialist literature on African states, this paper argues that what informs such problematic scholarship, inscribed on the conceptual and analytical landscape of the Weberian ideal-typical conception of state rationality is a vulgar universalism that tends to disregard specific historical experiences while subsuming them under the totalitarian grip of a Eurocentric unilinear evolutionist logic. When exactly does a state fail? Could what is defined as state failure actually be part of the processes of state-formation or reconfiguration, which are misrecognized or misinterpreted because of the poverty of Africanist social science and ethnocentric biases of the particular lenses used to understand them?

<p>Public sector agencies are an important front in the day-to-day battle for political supremacy between the executive and the legislature.

This article studies how these two roles arise and what implications they have for administrative policy-making. It highlights how intrinsically motivated bureaucrats combined with hierarchical control affect the ability of the political principals to control the execution of policy. I explore how this interaction shifts under alternative institutional forms, and how it leads appointees to “go native”. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>D. D. Eisenhower's contributions to the modern presidency are primarily institutional and to some extent, stylistic: his reliance on the professionalism of civil servants in the Bureau of the Budget, his continuation of the annual programming process as well as the procedures for coordinating the executive branch's legislative role, his creation of a White House office to represent him on Capitol Hill, and his respect for Congress as a legislative body. What Eisenhower did not do is equally significant: he did not reject the model of an activist presidency, reverse the New and Fair Deal policies of his Democratic predecessors, or pursue his centrist agenda in a blatantly partisan manner. The Eisenhower experience demonstrates that incivility, inhumanity, and inanity are not inevitable consequences of divided government. [R]</p>

<p>This article critically examines Rwanda's security-sector reform and disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (SSR-DDR) process through a theoretical framework outlining four different models of peace processes in order to identify the sort of peace that can emerge from Rwanda's SSR-DDR approach. I analyze how the Rwandan government has managed to keep the process “locally” owned, while largely financed by external actors. The Rwandan government's preference for national, rather than international solutions and its recent troop contribution to peace-building operations in the region are identified as the main reasons for this development. The peace emanating from the SSR-DDR process may be considered a hybrid form of state-formation and state-building. [R, abr.]</p>

I define a method for establishing bounds on the probability of incumbent defeat and find that it decreases significantly in the 1950s, before the rise of the incumbency advantage. Incumbency advantage does not have a direct relationship with incumbent defeat rates, raising questions about the use of the incumbency advantage as a means for making inferences about the electoral security of incumbents.

[Previous] research focused on partisan actors and public pensions, whereas this contribution extends the analysis to non-state actors (social partners) and to non-state social policy (occupational pensions). Only the extension and improvement of the theories concerning veto-players and veto points allow for the inclusion of the political-parliamentary arena and the collective arena in order to capture the overall power and role of social partners. Far-reaching pension reforms in Bismarckian countries with multiple veto possibilities can be observed if governments win social partners over with package deals and if social partners can expect new future (veto) power.

<p>Challenging mainstream accounts elaborated in the policy convergence literature, and drawing from sociological works in performance studies, this essay argues that the recent evolution of homeland security policies in Europe and North America can be understood as an instance of “practical learning”.

This argument is then applied to examine two cases of policy convergence in Europe and North America — the proposal for a “European Passenger Name Record” system and the project of a regional “Security Perimeter”.

<p>Creating local policy innovations and extending successful local experiences to other localities and provinces or even up to the national level has been a distinctive feature of China's policy-making process during the reform period.

This article explores the role of policy entrepreneurs in fostering local policy innovations, using the housing monetarization reform experience in Guizhou province as an example. I argue that the key decision-maker, being a policy entrepreneur, plays a central role in fostering policy innovations. An important aspect of the policy entrepreneur's strategy is to promote civic engagement and to strengthen legitimacy by leveraging the popularity of innovative policy.

<p>Why do party systems in longstanding democracies sometimes experience sudden change? Neither sociological nor institutional explanations can account for the swift increase in support for regional political parties in India in the 1990s. Instead, the shift from single-party majority to coalition government explains the rise of regional parties. The advent of coalition government increased the incentives associated with joining and establishing regional parties, prompting many already popular politicians to leave their national parties and take their supporters with them as they formed new regional parties in the 1990s. This finding reverses the causal arrow that usually links party systems and coalition government and illustrates how non-institutional elements of the political context can determine elite incentives and thereby shape party systems.

<p>While the position of Special Advisers (SpAds) in British government has become routinized, above all since 1997, we still know little about how they affect everyday life at the top of Whitehall departments. This paper, based on the first ever survey of SpAds, explores what they do and how they interact with policy-makers. SpAds fill a mix of “commissar” and “fixer” roles, and there is no evidence of a sharp division of labor between different types of SpAds. A variety of features of the special adviser's job appear to create incentives among both SpAds and civil servants to avoid conflict with each other. Since the influence of SpAds appears to depend on their relationship with the minister, claims that SpAds are a new, powerful group that shapes policy, are likely to be highly misleading.

<p>This study first describes the physical and institutional manifestations of decentralization in Tarlac, 100 km north of the capital, Metropolitan Manila. It then presents a qualitative analysis of characteristic aspects of governance that have enabled and impeded the implementation of decentralization in Tarlac province. The historical recipient of infrastructure and investment that have driven urbanization, Tarlac is currently poised to gain more, as decentralization, in the hands of its imaginative young leaders who have dared to experiment, often successfully, has transformed towns into hubs of activity. Moreover, decentralization has brought about a paradigm shift that encourages co-operation of non-state actors who wish to influence innovative development.

<p>The paper addresses three interrelated issues in policy-learning, based on survey data from a representative sample of all Norwegian councilors. What characterizes the policy-learning behavior of local councilors? This issue is addressed through data on what councilors find to be useful information sources in their capacities as decision-makers and agenda-setters. The paper documents three policy-learning profiles: cosmopolitans (who draw largely on external sources of information), locals (who draw on internal sources), and party loyalists (who draw on party sources). The authors also ask if policy-learning profiles make a difference to councilors as decision-makers and agenda-setters. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The article examines two dimensions of political representation in Iraqi Kurdistan: representation as presence and substantive representation. It is argued that the high proportionality of the electoral system enables representation as presence, of women, minorities and diverse geographical, linguistic and socio-economic interests and groups. However, the electoral system challenges representation in both dimensions, insofar as it hampers the development of effective opposition. The opposition is vital to confront clientelism and corruption that undermine democracy in the region. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7312]</p>

The fieldwork was carried out in 18 neighborhoods of six different European cities (Lisbon, Rotterdam, Bilbao, Thessaloniki, Vienna and Warsaw). [R, abr.]</p>

<p>In the past four decades, UK government policy-makers have sought to improve the performance of local government by trying to achieve organizational turnaround and bring laggards up to the standards achieved by the leaders. Both the Conservative Party and New Labour led new public management reforms aimed at modernizing and improving local government authorities by adopting standards from the private sector. Given the pressure to improve, failing local authorities have been pushed to adopt a unique set of strategies known as turnaround management strategies (TMS). However, this paper shows that TMS have been implemented to a high extent among both poor and excellent performers. Regardless of their objective performance ranking, English local authorities are characterized by a self-perception of underachievement. As a result, high performers continuously implement radical changes. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Policy-copying or -transfer has been identified as a significant feature of the operation of devolution in Scotland and Wales. Little attention has been paid to policy-copying in relation to the system of devolution in Northern Ireland, particularly since 1999. One of the most important areas of change and policy-implementation has been public-sector reform. This paper examines the three main areas of public-sector reform: the civil service, local government and the large quango/public bodies sector. Northern Ireland is compared to England, Scotland and Wales to identify examples of policy copying in changes to public-sector governance. Following this analysis a number of factors which have determined the extent of policy-copying are discussed. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7369]</p>

<p>Research emphasizes the uneven impact of Europeanization. While different mechanisms of Europeanization, including minimalist framing mechanisms based on identifying best practice and peer review, can place adaptational impulses on national governments, an institutionalist perspective suggests that such initiatives are typically mediated through domestic traditions and that domestic governance arrangements can be resilient to change. This article examines such claims empirically by drawing on research into central-local mechanisms to involve local government in domestic deliberations on new EU environmental proposals in three member states. It finds that despite impulses arising from European peer review initiatives, national governance arrangements remain robust, with actors preferring to rely on established domestic routines rather than adopting approaches used elsewhere.

<p>Since the end of the 1990s, the Italian government has adopted several reforms to grant more autonomy to sub-national authorities.

<p>This paper identifies the actors and factors which are important for effective and efficient functioning of local government. With a view to presenting the features of local government Japan has been selected as case for the study, in terms of legal authority, political parties, negotiation in budget process, government, authority and process of recruitment, training of personnel, financial autonomy and transparency and ratio of revenue to be spent by the local government. The problems of local government in Bangladesh are also identified in relation to the above factors and some policies are recommended to resolve them. [R]</p>

<p>Political realities in the capital cities of impoverished countries emerging from violent conflict illustrate how local actors can be hindered in conducting political affairs independently from the interests and influence of national governments as well as international agencies. This experience problematizes the argument that the main cause of political impasse in African cities governed by opposition parties is incomplete decentralization, whereby a devolution of responsibilities is not matched by a downward reallocation of resources. Although resulting competition constrains local governments' opportunities to deliver basic services, we need to look beyond the national scale to uncover the drivers of institutional change and gauge the promise of donor-driven local political empowerment. The case of Freetown, Sierra Leone illustrates such macro-level alignment and resulting local frictions. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The constitutions and legislative statutes of the fifty US states are given an exhaustive screening to identify legal language defining the linguistic obligations of the state and the language rights of individuals and groups. The author suggests that in the US, “hands-off” is good language policy not only nationwide but also statewide because states adopting a hands-off linguistic policy are consistent with the US Constitution while states adopting a “hands-on” policy are in conflict with it. States adopting hands-on language legislation in their constitutions or statutes are deemed to be “nativist” because they seem unfavorable toward speakers of minority languages, while states adopting a hands-off policy are “non-nativist” because they seem favorable (or at least neutral) toward speakers of minority languages.

<p>This article assesses the nature of partnerships through the research site of local governance in England and Scotland, engaging a range of debates and literature around governance and meta-governance. The research used secondary data of local authority partnership working in England and Scotland as well as primary qualitative data from participant observation and interviews with senior officials of local authorities and partner organizations. There is little to suggest that English and Scottish practices are significantly at variance and the article advances an argument of meta-bureaucracy to describe partnerships' activities: that is to say, partnerships do not represent a growth of autonomous networks and governance arrangements but rather an extension of bureaucratic controls. State actors remain pre-eminent within increasingly formalized systems of “partnership”. [R]</p>

<p>Immigration in the US is traditionally thought of as a federal-level policy, but in recent years, states have been exceedingly active in this domain. We analyze the context and discourse of immigration-related legislative resolutions from Southern border-states, recipients of the heaviest immigration flows, and find that states do not respond in the same way to immigration challenges, and these differences occur over time and space. Some states seek to federalize the issue and push Congress to take action, while others are slowly incorporating immigrants into domestic politics and have begun to treat them as yet another state constituency. These findings have significant implications both for federal-state relations in the immigration realm, and for immigrants themselves. [R]</p>

<p>In Spain, the debate about the relationship between decentralization and equity has been alive since the transition to democracy, as decentralization started and developed hand-in-hand with the construction of the welfare state. The question is what decentralization represents for the Spanish welfare system as a whole, or how future developments in this decentralized scenario condition the welfare role of the state. We analyze how devolution has resulted in different welfare policy options taken by the governments of the 17 Autonomous Communities, and how the emergence of different territorial welfare regimes has coexisted with a common structure of social benefits and rights for the state territory. We also show how citizens' perceptions on the evolution of inequalities across territories do not fit the data available on the strong redistribution effect of state policies.

<p>In recent years, a growing body of literature has documented the rise of citizen satisfaction surveys in assessing the performance of Chinese local government. Yet little is known about how Chinese local government responds to such surveys. This article addresses this gap. Based on a case study of Foshan City in Guangdong Province, this article shows that information in citizen satisfaction surveys is used in two major ways in this locality: the city's leadership officials use the information to support pre-existing policies while departmental officials use it to improve service delivery. This study shows that, with the rising power of the community, citizen satisfaction surveys can be an important intermediary between the Chinese state and its citizens and help local government to be more responsive to citizen needs.

<p>The enormous success of local independent lists and independent mayors in Poland suggests it is important to examine their distinctive features, analyze the place they occupy in local politics, and explore the model of local government they encourage. This paper investigates some extreme cases of non-partisanship at the local level, in three arbitrarily chosen Polish cities governed by independent mayors and dominated by independent lists in the local legislatures. Mixed quantitative and qualitative methods were used. Non-partisans appear to be a separate category of local politicians, different in terms of their views on politics. They explain their non-partisanship using anti-partisan, historical or tactical justifications. It seems that non-partisanship can be a means of institutionalizing a particular manner of understanding and engaging in politics. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Arguments for decentralization typically focus on the formal provision of services by sub-national government agencies that do not cater to the poor, particularly in developing countries, since the poor often do not have access to formal land and services. When national and local governments fail to provide urban services to the poor, other “intermediaries” (quasi-formal and informal institutions) step in to provide and mediate access to these services. These intermediaries offer more accessible, but often, less affordable and/or reliable services. This paper [examines] the role that local governments play in bridging the formal–informal service delivery gap, focusing, in particular, on whether stronger policies for decentralization lead to more innovation and/or involvement of the local government in the provision of services to informal communities.

<p>After over 20 years of fighting in Northern Ireland, the Belfast Agreement of 1998 has successfully implemented a power-sharing agreement. Why was it that politicians successfully negotiated the peace in 1998, while prior attempts failed? Drawing from social network theory, I argue that the Belfast Agreement succeeded, not because of a change of interests or disappearance of spoilers, but because of the presence of brokers at the bargaining table. Brokers, in particular, have the capacity to legitimize settlements — to frame settlements in such a way that they appear consistent with principles held by multiple coalitions. As a result, brokers are both more likely to build a winning coalition for a settlement, as well as marginalize spoilers who seek to undermine the peace. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This paper examines the problems and limitations of the privatization of federal and local disaster recovery policies and services following the Hurricane Katrina disaster. It discusses the significance of the [US] Homeland Security Act of 2002 in accelerating efforts to devolve and privatize emergency management functions; the reorganization of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as a service-purchaser and arranger; and the efforts by the New Orleans city government to contract out disaster recovery activities to private firms. I situate and explain these three developments in the context of recent trends toward the neoliberalization of state activities, including the privatization and devolution of policy implementation to private firms and NGOs.

<p>This paper examines Australian local government in terms of local council autonomy as set against the oversight exercised by state governments. In particular, we investigate “home rule” in the US and its potential relevance to the Australian milieu. We argue that <italic>prima facie</italic> the operation of home rule is problematic due to its litigious nature, and that while the implementation of home rule might be possible in an Australian local government jurisdiction, it is improbable. However, consideration of home rule as a principle by which state–local government relationships might be organized sheds light on the limits to the autonomy and independence of Australian local governments.

<p>Dominant narratives of neighborhood working in the UK accentuate the diversity and “messiness” of practices across local authorities. This paper questions such narratives. Deploying V.

Mintzberg's metaphor of organization as “structure in fives” [<italic>Structure in Fives: Designing Effective Organizations</italic>, Eaglewood Cliffs, N. J., 1983], we suggest that the practices of neighborhood working are currently best understood in terms of Mintzberg's decentralized divisional authority as a form of constrained decentralization in which semi-autonomous divisions are brought together under a central administration and given limited control over service-delivery in order to address the social and economic rationales for neighborhood working.

<p>This article links contemporary critiques of regional governance to the “crisis of the state” in the 1970s and 1980s. Using the example of the politics of sprawl, I explain why collaborative regional planning institutions in New Jersey [USA] and the East of England [UK] have received such low marks from government participants and local populations, despite their success in completing land-use plans. I argue that these new governance institutions inadvertently revive issues of power, accountability and democratic legitimacy stemming from the crisis of the state. British and American governments interpreted it as a crisis of ungovernability, and their subsequent reforms were aimed at freeing state and market from societal demands. Moreover, the “post-political” nature of the collaborative institutions prevents competing values from being debated and resolved. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article examines the question of European identity in Russian foreign policy through the notion of European norms. By considering attitudes towards the death penalty, it identifies different strands of thought in the Russian elite, and argues that an assertive Europeanism is now dominant as Russia seeks to be an equal participant in the development of common norms. However, there is a tendency for Russia's “Europeanness” to be questioned because of behavior that is considered out of step with EU standards. I argue that even in an area of significant controversy between Russia and other European states, self-determination for national minorities, there is potential for the delineation of common principles, but only as an inclusive process on the basis of consensus.

<p>The rate of turnover within parliaments remains an understudied area of research. This paper contributes to filling this gap by presenting the first comparable macro-level data on legislative turnover in the 26 Swiss cantonal legislatures. In examining the strikingly different levels of turnover in sub-national Swiss parliaments between 1993 and 2011, the focus is on politico-institutional features. Multilevel models reveal that two hitherto neglected institutional variables are correlated with legislative turnover. In addition to the reduction of parliamentary size, we find the strength of a cantonal parliament to affect turnover rates on the Swiss sub-national level. Moreover, we show that proportional representation significantly promotes parliamentary elite circulation. Among the non-institutional covariates, we find that electoral volatility is also relevant in explaining legislative turnover rates. [R]</p>

<p>A model seems to be emerging in China where local governments take the lead in generating and implementing new citizen-oriented products, processes, and services; the central government has embraced such local innovative activities as part of its high-profile “harmonious society” strategy, to promote and craft civil society initiatives. However, questions remain as to why governments have actively engineered such social innovations and how and to what extent they can be successful in balancing potential conflicts between their own pursuits and those initiated by citizens. We examine a hybrid form of social innovation combining government engineering and citizen participation as the Chinese government's most recent strategy to cope with the rise of nonprofit organizations. Empirically, we focus on a case of social innovation, the government-sponsored venture philanthropy program in Shanghai. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7763]</p>

<p>“Community bus” initiatives in Japan represent a major decentralization of public transport service-provision, whereby decision-making authority shifts to the local government at the city/ward level.

Reviewing legislative changes, the literature [and] various community bus schemes in and around Tokyo, it describes the roles assumed by main actors, the means adopted to mobilize community resources and the type and level of services provided by local authorities.

<p>I demonstrate that multimember districts form a basis for collaboration between two legislators. In order to maximize the limited incumbency advantages they possess, legislators from multimember districts form coalitions in an effort to generate greater credit-claiming opportunities and policy benefits for their district. In order to test this conception, I utilize a natural experiment and an opportunity to observe institutional change in North Carolina's elimination of multimember districts during the 2000–2002 redistricting cycle. Coupled with cross-sectional analysis of several states that use both single-member and multimember districts, empirical evidence strongly corroborates my conception of multimember districts as a basis for collaboration between representatives.

<p>Interjurisdictional pollution spillovers are a critical issue in US environmental policy. When policy responsibility is decentralized, state governmental agencies have incentives to promote these externalities in order to capture the benefits of economic activity within their borders while compelling neighbors to shoulder the resultant environmental costs. To test this free-riding hypothesis, prior studies have relied on crude proxies to delineate a regulated entity's proximity to a neighboring state. We develop a more refined set of measures using newly available data on facility location to isolate the conditions under which free-riding is theoretically more likely to occur. We then assess state enforcement of the federal Clean Water Act directed at major water polluters under these conditions to determine the extent to which US states engage in environmental free-riding behavior.

<p>This article addresses how government agencies allocate their program budgets in response to citizen dissatisfaction. It examines three unpopular public programs with varying budget allocations overseen by different government agencies in New Taipei City, Taiwan. The article argues that low levels of citizen satisfaction do not necessarily lead to budget cuts. Rather, budget allocation is mediated by the policy preference of the elected mayor and the intrinsic characteristics of a program. An unpopular program gets cut only if it is of less political priority and there is a lack of interest in the given agency. According to the bureau-shaping model, bureau heads only expand programs [that] give them primacy as policy-makers rather than program operators or fund distributers.

<p>Do term-limits impede the ability of legislators to effectively set fiscal policy? To address this question, I examine state bond ratings from 1996 to 2009. Bond ratings serve as a valuable indicator of a state's fiscal performance, gauging the risk and uncertainty that investors face when buying these bonds. In addition, bond ratings are important policy ends in themselves. High bond ratings make it easier for states to borrow and raise revenue, while lowering interest rates. Results from analyses of “Term-Limitedness” and legislator experience suggest that term-limits negatively impact a state's fiscal performance, leading to lower bond ratings. [R]</p>

<p>Decentralization is seen as a panacea for a host of problems of governance thrown up by economic globalization. Shortly after India embarked upon structural reforms in 1991, the Government [adopted] the 73rd and 74th (Constitutional) Amendment Acts of 1992, [which] aim at decentralization through vertical devolution of power to rural and urban local governments. While implementation of these acts has been uneven, the Government in 2005 launched an ambitious urban renewal program titled Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) in 65 cities nationwide. This paper examines the implementation of JNNURM in Andhra Pradesh, a south Indian state, to demonstrate that the state government remains the major stumbling block in the devolution of power. It argues that decentralization <italic>qua</italic> state restructuring in India is a top-down process of devolving fiscal deficit to the city scale.

<p>How does racial diversity affect public policy outcomes in the states? The policy backlash hypothesis suggests that the presence of blacks increases antagonistic attitudes toward minorities among whites and thus produces racially conservative policies. The electoral constraint hypothesis argues that the presence of blacks increases the size of population that supports policy liberalism and thus results in more liberal policies. The authors reconcile these competing explanations by arguing that the hypothesized negative impact of minority group size on policy liberalism varies across states in accordance with socioeconomic and institutional conditions that strengthen or weaken the impacts of electoral constraint or backlash.

<p>How responsive are [US] lawmakers to an abortion issue that is potentially less salient to the public or in the media? Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers (or TRAP) laws impose physical plant and personnel regulations and requirements on abortion-providers that exceed those imposed on other comparable healthcare-providers or outpatient medical facilities. Using event-history analysis, this article examines the determinants of the enactment by states of a TRAP law over the period 1974 to 2008. The empirical results find that the polarized ideological positions of the Republican Party and the Democratic Party on the issue of abortion, in conjunction with institutional control of state government, has a statistically significant impact on the enactment of a TRAP law in the expected direction.

<p>This paper identifies and discusses the under-scrutinized role of grants-revenue dependency and volatility in the demise of remote small councils in the Northern Territory. We analyze financial data to demonstrate the extreme volatility in year-on-year grants funding. With their high dependency on grants revenue, such volatility and unpredictability resulted in councils being hamstrung in their ability to strategically plan and ensure stability in service delivery, infrastructure management and employment provision. We argue that these fiscal dynamics, fuelled by hierarchical intergovernmental relations, contributed significantly to dysfunction in the sector, as well as mutually reinforcing pre-existing structural and endogenous weaknesses. This argument runs against the common conceptualization of the sector as requiring of externally imposed structural reform. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>In India, the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act (CAA) seeks to strengthen urban local bodies as units of local self-government through functional and financial empowerment. This paper, through the case study of the Bangalore Metropolitan Region (BMR), traces the impact of the decentralization agenda on the socio-spatial fabric of the region. It highlights how, in the absence of empowered local governments, the state government is increasingly vesting decision-making powers in non-elected task forces, the latter being more or less individuals patronized by ruling parties. Lacking legitimate planning bodies, growth continues to be investment-driven, with the metropolitan region emerging as a distorted spatial fabric. The paper argues that the reconciliation of planning scales and capacities renders decentralization incomplete. In parallel, contending socio-political challenges are an imperative.

<p>This article critically explores the intersection of peace operations and the francophone spaces. The argument is that there has been an increasing “francophone fact” or a “francophonization” of peace operations. The article explains this emergence and examines its implications that extend beyond the francophone space. The article suggests that the increasing importance of the “francophone fact” in peacekeeping is the result of three reinforcing dynamics: (1) the reality of UN deployments in the past decade with more than a half of the blue helmets deployed in francophone settings; (2) the consequent creation of specific needs for the “good functioning” of multidimensional peace operations; and (3) an incomplete but undeniable “appropriation” of peace operations by francophone states and organizations.

<p>This article investigates regional officials' use of blame-shifting rhetoric in times of heated public criticism of unpopular regional policy decisions. Based on a content coding of nearly 500 political accounts from elected regional officials it is shown that “it's the central government's fault” is the most frequently used excuse when regional officials publicly defend unpopular decisions to cut public health care. The article finds that this excuse is used more by regional leaders (mayors and chairmen of regional boards) than by other elected officials and that partisan competition affects how often this excuse is used.

<p>This article introduces a new method, qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), to the study of state policy-choice and the role of ideas in politics. The authors hypothesize an important role for normative beliefs in state policy-choice even for policies that go beyond traditional subjects of “morality” policy. Specifically, the authors find that “precautionary norms” are influential determinants of recent state environmental policies regulating chemicals, even in the face of significant economic impacts. They conclude that these results offer new theoretical ideas relevant to the state innovation and diffusion literature as well as the study of ideas in the policy process. [R]</p>

<p>China has been held up as a modern-day exemplar of “market-preserving federalism”. This article challenges this popular belief by showing that its local governments face soft budget constraints. Fiscal indiscipline among subnational governments, which risks national indebtedness and macroeconomic instability, can pose serious dangers to federations. A large body of literature which proposes solutions to fiscal indiscipline through electoral incentives and political party structure cannot be applied to China. The Chinese Communist Party's cadre-evaluation and dual accountability systems make it an imperative for local officials to augment fiscal revenue and allow them to tap resources at local credit institutions. This has resulted in mounting local government debt, the lion's share of which is unrepaid loans owed to local credit institutions. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Utilizing the concept of networked governance practices, this paper examines how local chief executives and allied officials in the Philippines have transformed local power structures through the mobilization of decentralization and democratization discourses/strategies within and across the government bureaucracies, civil society organizations (NGOs, people's organizations and private-sector or business groups). Their mobilization of such strategies is part of the overall governance framework of local government units to become locally/globally competitive amidst a weak metropolitan governance system in Metro Manila. The study describes how decentralization compels local governments and their officials to deal strategically with the competing demands of economic growth and social and environmental governance, by reconfiguring or recasting existing power structures/practices through democratization strategies/discourses, to respond to the needs of their constituencies, especially marginalized sectors like the urban poor.

<p>Based on the theory of sub-national governments' foreign affairs, this paper analyzes the role played by China's local governments at the time when China's central government was formulating polices to establish diplomatic relations with South Korea. China's local governments, with Shandong province in particular, made strong attempts to lobby the central government on the economic need for enlarging bilateral trade and drawing investment from South Korea. These efforts played an active role on Sino-South Korean diplomatic normalization and further advanced the realization of diplomatic contacts already underway. Handing the Province's case shows that sub-national governments have been playing ever more important roles in China's overall diplomacy since the reform and opening up of the economy, which began in 1978.

<p>The analysis of cultural policy usually classifies cultural organizations as public organizations or private non-for-profit cultural organizations.

<p>Local women's councils are strategic places to channel women's participation and demands in order to promote gender policies at the local level.

In this paper we try to show evidences about theses bias through a survey carry out among women's associations in five Spanish cities. results show that the participatory dynamic of local women's councils produces two kind of bias: an inclusiveness bias according to the traits of women's organizations, favoring those more oriented towards political activism; and a substantive bias according to the issues discusses, favoring those close to the local government agenda.

<p>This article examines recent local government reform in the Northern Territory from two perspectives. The first is a quantitative perspective on population and finances, which focuses on the mixing of diverse interests in the recent changes. The second is a more observational perspective gained from working with one pre-reform local government and the larger local government that has replaced it. The article argues that the recent changes are generational in nature in three distinct and significant ways. It also argues that the greater challenge for the new local governments may be their vast geographic scale, rather than their mixing of diverse interests. [R]</p>

<p>According to a widespread but empirically hitherto untested perception, assembly democracy is the ideal-typical form for direct democracy. This paper examines whether this perception coincides with empirical evidence by systematically comparing the actual extent of citizens' direct-democratic involvement in assembly democracies and in ballot-box democracies. A longitudinal and cross-sectional analysis of new data on the Swiss cantons reveals strikingly clear patterns: cantons with popular assemblies provide citizens with more and more easily accessible direct-democratic rights, and they hold popular votes more frequently. On the other hand, cantons with ballot-box voting are more successful in involving the citizens in direct-democratic decision-making with respect to turnout rates. [R]</p>

<p>Unlike some of its Western counterparts, where the first line of defense against corruption and unethical behavior has been a reliance on a public service ethos, the Hong Kong government has traditionally relied on strict compliance with rules and regulations in its successful drive against bureaucratic malpractices. Since 1997, however, a changing political, economic and administrative environment has also seen efforts to introduce a more value-based approach to integrity. This article examines the factors that have led to the modification of the Hong Kong government's strategy and evaluates its success in the wider theoretical context of the relationship between a predominantly rule-based and a value-based approach to integrity management.

<p>Hurricane Katrina and its effects are often talked about in terms of what has been made visible. Here, we focus instead on whom and what Katrina and its aftermath have rendered invisible. We are concerned with how the seen and the not-seen have influenced the ways the purported tabula rasa of New Orleans has been (re)constructed and marked since 2005. We engage with recent debates in political science about power, agency, structure, and culpability, arguing that efforts to prioritize the pursuit of culpability over critique in power analyses risk perpetuating structural violence. We employ the concepts of an ocular ethic and social triage to understand why the storm of the century that was supposed to reveal all has in the end left much concealed, with shocking levels of human devastation unaddressed.

<p>This paper [examines] how decentralization unfolds in the mega-city context of urban India as a result of shifts in policy and practice since the 1990s through a study of recent civil society organization partnerships with the urban local bodies in Mumbai [Bombay]. Using the cases of Advanced Locality Management (ALM) groups and Local Area Citizens' Groups (LACGs) as instances of parallel structures of decentralization, it argues that such civil society organizations have usually been spearheaded by the professional middle classes and have transformed the public sphere in mega cities. However, many of the features of these state–civil-society partnerships are inherently exclusionary of lower socio-economic city residents, going against the letter and spirit of democratic decentralization as envisaged in the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act 1992, which provides the framework for urban decentralization in India.

<p>Is there any variation in impact if different learning roles are played by people at different levels in organizational hierarchies? Through a comparative study of two frontline service systems and their performance-management mechanism in Taipei City of Taiwan, the author identifies two kinds of learning: policy learning and instrumental learning, and argues that if policy learning is taken by a policy-making/supervisory agency, it will strengthen upwards accountability of its subordinate executive agencies at the expense of outwards accountability, and will stimulate their instrumental learning for target-based performance measurement. On the other hand, if policy learning spurred by their own performance evaluation is taken by executive agencies, it will strengthen their outwards accountability without any negative impact on upwards accountability.

<p>This article examines the strong mayor form of local political management in Spain. Drawing on empirical research conducted with members and officers in a Spanish municipality, the system is analyzed according to leadership, representation and responsiveness, accountability, scrutiny, and decision-making. It finds that the model underpins concentrated individualized leadership exercised by the mayor. Representativeness and responsiveness in the system are hampered by the absence of electoral divisions within the municipality, meaning citizens do not have their own councilor, and by there being no institutionalized system of citizen participation or decentralization. It is argued that the security of tenure enjoyed by Spanish mayors is unlikely to be replicated in England, and that there is some concurrence in Spain with reform trends observed elsewhere.

<p>This research applies D. Beetham's theory of legitimacy to analyze the current decision-making procedures of public budgeting in mainland China. Specifically, it evaluates the impact of two forms of participatory budgeting (PB) on improving the legitimacy of public budgeting in two regional provinces/cities; Wuxi (near Shanghai) and Wenling (a coastal city some 400 km south of Shanghai). Comparative case studies are employed to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of PB in the two cities. The comparisons are made from all three aspects of legitimacy based on Beetham's framework, investigating in which aspects and to what extent PB has contributed to enhancing the legitimacy of budgetary decision-making. Difficulties and limitations in promoting PB in China are also discussed. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7763]</p>

The results showed: (1) all three governance modes — hierarchy, market, and network — existed in a combined form across all 96 departments; (2) although all three governance modes were present, hierarchy remained the dominant governance mode across all 96 departments; and (3) the three governance modes were situationally mixed contingent upon the distinct departmental tasks.
