<p><italic>The New York Times</italic> wrote in Betty Friedan’s obituary that “‘The Feminine Mystique,’ ignited the contemporary women’s movement in 1963 and as a result permanently transformed the social fabric.” Conversely, scholars of the women’s movement see <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic> as peripheral, arguing that the movement emerged because of structural and political changes already under way. Neither stance does much to help us understand the role of <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic>. Certainly, a book cannot single-handedly spark a social movement. But it can contribute to change. Stephanie Coontz’s <italic>A Strange Stirring</italic> helps us understand how.</p>
<p>Coontz’s book is a “biography” of <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic>, a creative way of tackling a familiar subject from a new angle. It is also a social history of the generation of women who came of age between the 1940s and the early 1960s. Chapters on the 1920s to the 1940s, the 1950s, and the 1960s depict the legal, political, social, and emotional limitations on women, from the backlash against working women during the Depression, to the critiques of working mothers that emerged during World War II despite women’s wartime employment. Coontz vividly shows how the postwar period was “particularly disorienting” (p. 76) for women who internalized societal ambivalence about their roles as mothers and workers and felt guilty for being discontented with material abundance. Coontz nicely highlights the contradictions between changes in women’s status (increases in workforce participation, education, media representation of successful women) and cultural emphasis on the key role of homemakers in ensuring their children’s happiness and, indeed, their own normality as women. Coontz shows that there were more “contradictions in the media’s depiction of the ideal feminine life than Friedan admitted in her book” (p. 74). But, she shows, while scholars can identify trends leading to improvements in women’s status during the 1950s, many women at the time could not.</p>
<p>While much of this ground has been covered by others, Coontz synthesizes it expertly and expands on it with 188 interviews with women about reading <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic>. They articulate their confinement within the feminine mystique and explain how reading the book affected them as “a revelation,” that “slammed me in the face,” “gave me the right to divorce,” and showed that “my problems were societal.” The impact went beyond actual readers; many women who thought they had read the book had not—including, ironically, Coontz herself. The women most influenced by <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic>—mostly white, educated, and middle-class—were profoundly and permanently affected. Their daughters, in turn, found that <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic> helped them understand their mothers.</p>
<p>Coontz argues that <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic> was a kind of self-help book because it changed how women felt about themselves and their lives. Some divorced, went back to school, sought employment, and negotiated more egalitarian marriages, and many saw their depression lift. She contrasts <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic> to more recent self-help books, however, arguing that it was the last self-help book women needed, because of its transformative effect. Implicit is a critique of self-help books that encourage women simply to feel better without changing their lives. Yet it was not simply the book, but the social context that encouraged women to make changes, and the feminist movement produced similar change in the lives of women who had not read it. These therapeutic effects on women foreshadowed later movements that fused emotional and political change, such as that against child sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Emotional transformation does not, of course, equate to movement mobilization. Coontz’s vivid articulation of the emotional “clicks” Friedan’s readers experienced raises interesting questions about how these changes relate to the rise of the women’s movement. We do not know how many of Coontz’s interviewees became activists (or even identified as feminists), nor the paths by which they did so. Indeed, we know little about them as a group—their age, race, professional or marital status.I hope that Coontz will work more with these interviews, which are tantalizing but underutilized here.</p>
<p>Coontz tackles the serious critiques of <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic> for taking the experience of white, middle-class housewives as the norm, arguing that, while correct, the critiques miss some nuance. She shows that African American women worked outside the home not just out of necessity but out of pride and interest, and already believed that meaningful work is important to good marriages. Friedan’s message sometimes resonated with working-class women across race. Interviews with white women from working-class backgrounds show that their mothers encouraged them to pursue education and work outside the home. In the end, Coontz argues, the ways that educated, middle-class housewives’ lives and emotions were constricted matter even if they are “the price of privilege” (p. 101).</p>
<p>Some important and interesting questions remain. Completely absent from the book is any consideration of lesbians, significant because of <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic>’s definition of women’s oppression in terms of marriage and motherhood and because of the centrality of lesbians in the feminist movement. I wondered also about the effect of the book on men and on marriage more generally. The longer life of <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic>, too, is left open. We know that women continued reading it and that the book—and Friedan herself—served as a foil against which other branches of feminism (radical, lesbian, African American, Latina) defined themselves. At some point, most readers ceased to find it electrifying and found it “repetitive and overblown” (p. xix), homophobic and historically bound. Despite the persistence of gender inequality, Friedan’s critique and her words themselves lost resonance. How was the book influential in different ways over time?</p>
<p>As the only book on <italic>The Feminine Mystique, A Strange Stirring</italic> adds to our understanding of the early women’s movement and, more importantly, of feminism’s influence on women who did not become activists. Because the book is highly readable and depicts women’s lives prior to the women’s movement with such clarity, it will be excellent for course use. It will also be a good resource for younger women and men seeking to understand their mothers and grandmothers. For scholars, its primary value lies in the juxtapositioning of everyday readers’ experiences with broader societal patterns, and the reminder that what we think we know about the conditions that lead to social change can diverge widely from lived experience. It is also a reminder of how fast consciousness and emotions can change when the conditions are right. Even if <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic> itself did not “pull the trigger on history” (p. xv), scholars of social movements would do well to take its impact seriously.</p>
