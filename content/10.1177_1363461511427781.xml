<abstract>
<p>Ethnography provides a method for psychiatric assessment to obtain an insight into the patient’s culture, context, and life situation. The Outline for a Cultural Formulation (CF) is an ethnography-based, idiographic formulation intended to complement the multiaxial assessment in DSM-IV. Its contribution to routine clinical praxis will be discussed with reference to a case of a Syrian-born woman in Sweden. Using the CF in the clinical diagnostic process shifted understanding of the patient’s suffering from a mainly somatic frame of reference to an emphasis on emotional and social aspects. The usefulness of ethnography in clinical psychiatric diagnostic practice is discussed.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1363461511427781" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Globalization and multicultural clinical milieus challenge current psychiatric diagnostic systems and practice. To make valid diagnostic categorizations and understand patients’ expression of distress, and to create trust, a working alliance, and meaningful treatment plans there is a need to take culture and context into account in an individualized way in routine clinical psychiatric assessment. The Outline for a Cultural Formulation (CF) in DSM-IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363461511427781">American Psychiatric Association, 2003</xref>), developed by the Group on Culture and Diagnosis of the National Institute of Mental Health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363461511427781">Mezzich, 1995</xref>), is a practical suggestion for a systematic review of culture and context in clinical psychiatric diagnosis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363461511427781">Lewis-Fernández (2009)</xref> characterizes the CF as the most substantive cultural contribution to the DSM series, intended to improve diagnostic validity and to enhance treatment satisfaction, adherence, and response.</p>
<p>The CF is described as a “mini-ethnographic” narrative assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363461511427781">Lewis-Fernández, 1996</xref>). Ethnography aims to describe life in a local world at a specific place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363461511427781">Kleinman &amp; Benson, 2006</xref>). Further, it emphasizes the importance of trying to understand the other’s point of view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363461511427781">Geertz, 1973</xref>). The narrative approach refers to the growing importance of the study of narrative in anthropology and social science, and a tradition in mental health assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363461511427781">Lewis-Fernandez &amp; Diaz, 2002</xref>). Using the CF means implementing an ethnographic approach, including conveying the methodology and theory into clinical praxis in mental health care, and doing so within the time limitations of clinical work.</p>
<p>In 1996 the journal <italic>Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry</italic> (CMP) started a series of CF case analyses. The editor at the time, J. B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363461511427781">Good (1996)</xref>, formulated the idea of developing new prototypes of psychiatric knowledge and disorders derived from work in community clinics serving the poor and disadvantaged. This was to counterbalance the fact that much knowledge has been derived from work with middle-class “majority” clients. The series of CF case formulations in CMP was followed by similar case reports in books and several journals. Most of these reports have concerned adult minority patients encountering mental health care in North America; however there is an increasing number of case reports on migrants and refugees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363461511427781">Bäärnhielm &amp; Scarpinati Rosso, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363461511427781">Dinh &amp; Groleau, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363461511427781">Groen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363461511427781">Lewis-Fernández, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363461511427781">Lim &amp; Lin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363461511427781">Starkey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363461511427781">Streit, Leblanc, &amp; Mekki-Berrada, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363461511427781">Yilmaz &amp; Weiss, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The present case study describes the use of the ethnographic approach of the CF in routine clinical psychiatric diagnostic practice to illustrate what it can contribute within the time and space constraints and traditions of clinical work. The case involves the assessment of a female patient from Syria with musculoskeletal pain who was referred to psychiatric care for evaluation of depression to a clinic located in a suburban community in Stockholm, Sweden. Details have been changed to ensure patient anonymity and patient’s consent for publication was obtained.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1363461511427781"><title>Migration to Sweden and the Syrian community</title>
<p>In 2007, 13.4% of the 9 million inhabitants in Sweden were foreign born and 3.5% were born in Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363461511427781">Statistic Sweden, 2009</xref>). Migration from the Middle East to Sweden involves a variety of ethnic and religious affiliations and reasons, including labour migration, economic advancement, seeking asylum, and escape from religious oppression.</p>
<p>One of the major migrant ethnic groups from the Middle East in Sweden is the Syrian/Assyrian people. Migration of Syrians/Assyrians to Sweden started in 1960 due to religious oppression in Turkey and continues today with refugees from the war in Iraq. In Sweden both the terms “Syrian” and “Assyrian” are used. The sociologist Fuat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363461511427781">Deniz (1999)</xref> suggests that the term “Assyrian” indicates a more nationalistic position, and “Syrian” a more religious one. Deniz has studied the transformation of identity in the Syrian/Assyrian community in Sweden, focusing on Assyrians from southeast Turkey. Deniz points to the Syriac language for maintaining ethnic identity. Further, Deniz describes how migration has involved a transformation of collective identity from a religious basis to one based on nationality, but that for many the clan and family are still important. He suggests that migration involves change from a collectivistic to an individualistic way of life. The Syrians/Assyrians in Sweden belong to several main churches, including Syrian-Orthodox, Nestorian, Chaldean, and Syrian-Catholic. People originate from the border area between Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon. There is little research on Syrians/Assyrians in Sweden (apart from that of Deniz) and no specific data on health, nor are there any medical anthropological studies.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1363461511427781"><title>Musculoskeletal pain conditions among immigrants to Sweden</title>
<p>There are studies on musculoskeletal pain conditions in immigrants in general and in migrants from Turkey in Sweden in particular. Migrants from Turkey include several ethnic affiliations, among them many Syrians from the southeastern part close to Syria. Studying primary health care utilization in a suburban area in the south of Sweden, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363461511427781">Sundquist, Rosén, and Johansson (1994)</xref> found that being born outside Sweden was associated with increased prevalence of musculoskeletal disease, compared with people born in Sweden. Looking at differences between immigrant and Swedish patients with musculoskeletal pain, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363461511427781">Soares and Grossi (1999)</xref> found that the immigrant patients lived under more strained psychosocial conditions and experienced a deeper impact of pain compared to their Swedish counterparts.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1363461511427781"><title>Case introduction</title>
<p>Meryem, a 41-year-old woman born in Syria, lives in Stockholm, Sweden. She was referred from a rehabilitation clinic to a psychiatric outpatient clinic in a multicultural suburban area of Stockholm for evaluation of symptoms of depression with anxiety and disturbed sleep. According to the referral, Meryem suffered from back pain, as well as pain in her shoulders and head. As the pain was shifting in nature, some days were better than others. She was given the diagnosis of fibromyalgia.</p>
<sec id="sec5-1363461511427781"><title>Psychiatric assessment</title>
<p>At the first contact with the clinic, a psychiatric assessment was made. A skilled interpreter, fluent in Swedish, Arabic, and Syriac and with a specialist qualification in medical interpretation was employed in this and all further contacts. In the first diagnostic interview, Meryem initially told the clinician about pain, sleeping problems, feeling tired, often being dizzy, drained of energy, and feeling little joy or pleasure. She answered questions but gave scant information spontaneously. Meryem said that she was married, unemployed, and the mother of six children between the ages of 4 and 17. She had come to Sweden from Syria 23 years earlier to reunite with her family. She speaks only a little Swedish but is fluent in Arabic and Syriac. She had 10 years of schooling in her country of origin.</p>
<p>During her first years in Sweden, Meryem stayed at home. Eight years ago she started to work in a family shop. The work was physically demanding, and included cleaning, lifting, and carrying. She spent her free time with her children and close family. She was proud and happy to be working. Today, however, Meryem has been on sick leave for 2 years due to pain. At home she often sits on a sofa, resting with her feet up; occasionally, she takes short walks. Sometimes she thinks about continuing her education. She is unhappy about not being able to work.</p>
<p>For Meryem, pain became a problem 4 years ago after her sixth child was born. She had pain in her back and in her shoulders, and initially did not pay it much attention. Starting to work again after having been at home with her youngest child, the pain became more problematic. A cousin, who worked at the same place, noticed her pain and tried to show her how to lift heavy objects. After 1 year with troubling pain, on the recommendation of a cousin, she asked for help at a primary care clinic. She was put on sick leave and referred to a physiotherapist at a rehabilitation clinic. The physiotherapist attributed the pain to nerves being trapped by muscles. Meryem found this explanation very strange and was scared. All the sessions with the physiotherapist took place without an interpreter. Meryem had hoped that physiotherapy would make her better, but when it did not help she had no ideas about what would be beneficial. The rehabilitation clinic referred Meryem to the local psychiatric outpatient clinic. She was prepared to try anything in order to get better; this included psychiatric care. She had no previous history of seeking psychiatric treatment.</p>
<p>In the diagnostic interview at the psychiatric outpatient clinic, the clinician perceived that there were language difficulties, despite the presence of a qualified interpreter. After the interview, the clinician noted in the medical record that Meryem looked weighed down and worried, showed little facial expression, was not easily distracted from her ruminations, and had depressed mood. From the medical records of the rehabilitation clinic, the clinician learned that Meryem had received the following treatments: physiotherapy, acupuncture, massage, warmth, water physiotherapy, and sauna. Medication for sleeping problems and pain had not led to any improvement. A psychologist at the rehabilitation clinic found Meryem depressed and with concentration difficulties.</p>
<p>When the clinician at the psychiatric outpatient clinic met Meryem the second time, the contact improved. However, she gave little information spontaneously, especially when they discussed her illness. When questioned, she said that since the previous encounter she had experienced difficulties in getting up from a chair, was often dizzy, and had low blood pressure. She said that over the past 2 years she had felt increased pain and had withdrawn from contacts outside the family. She expressed worry about the future and did not expect to be well again. She knew that she had been diagnosed with fibromyalgia but did not know what it meant or how it should be treated.</p>
<p>After the second psychiatric interview, the clinician made the evaluation that Meryem was suffering from depression. Meryem had no suicidal thoughts or psychotic symptoms. The clinician assumed the depressed mood to be secondary to pain and found no signs of a personality disorder. The clinician initially gave a diagnosis of depression, but, due to difficulties in evaluating the severity of her distress, was unsure whether Meryem was primarily depressed or whether her distress should have been labelled as an adjustment disorder with a depressive reaction. The following diagnosis was established:
<list id="list1-1363461511427781" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Axis I: Major depression, single episode, mild 296.22.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Axis II: None.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Axis III: Fibromyalgia.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Axis IV: Problems with work—unemployment; obsessive anxious thoughts.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Axis V: Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF) 63.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>The treatment suggested was antidepressant medication monitored by the primary care clinic. The clinician stressed the importance of Meryem receiving more information about her diagnosis of fibromyalgia to clarify what it meant and how to live with it.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1363461511427781"><title>Structured clinical interview for DSM-IV (SCID)</title>
<p>After the initial psychiatric assessment, Meryem agreed to participate in a CF interview. Before the CF interview, a structured SCID (CV)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1363461511427781">1</xref></sup> interview was carried out by the same clinician as previously. Meryem collaborated well and gained confidence in the interpreter. In the SCID interview, it was revealed that Meryem found it difficult to comprehend the meaning of several concepts, despite the interpreter using both Arabic and Syriac words. Probing for depression, Meryem could not understand the concepts of worthlessness and guilt. Further, she had difficulties understanding the question, “How do you feel about yourself?” In the Swedish translation of SCID, the concept “<italic>självkänsla</italic>” (“self-esteem”) is used. Meryem was unable to understand this concept. The rest of the questions about depression worked and a decreased level of functioning and the length of the depressive mood were clarified.</p>
<p>In the SCID interview, Meryem denied having any somatic illness and said that she was physically healthy. The clinician became confused and tried to find out what Meryem meant. Meryem explained that she did not consider pain as a physical illness. She did not give the term “pain” a distinct physical meaning; for her it meant suffering in general. This information shed new light on Meryem’s illness narrative.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1363461511427781"><title>Cultural formulation</title>
<p>After the initial psychiatric assessment and the SCID interview, a CF interview was performed by another clinician. A semistructured interview guide revealing the different sections of the CF and an additional section on migration and acculturation was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363461511427781">Bäärnhielm, Scarpinati Rosso, &amp; Pattyi, 2007</xref>). The interview started with asking about Meryem’s problems (“<italic>besvär</italic>”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1363461511427781">2</xref></sup>). Initially Meryem gave poor eye contact, looked down at the floor, and now and then sighed heavily.</p>
<sec id="sec8-1363461511427781"><title>Cultural identity</title>
<p>The important reference group for Meryem is her close and extended family, and the Syrian Orthodox Church. Her mother tongue is Syriac<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1363461511427781">3</xref></sup> and she labels herself as Syrian. Her narrative focus was on her close family and religion. Her narrative did not include any reference to the major Muslim community in Syria nor to Muslims living in Sweden.</p>
<p>Meryem’s education in Syria was in Arabic. She is fluent in both Syriac and Arabic, but lacks many abstract words in Syriac as she never had any education in this language. Her knowledge of Swedish is very limited; she has attended some courses in Swedish but never completed them. The CF interview was conducted in Arabic. Meryem wanted it in Arabic as she has more words available to her in Arabic than in Syriac. Occasionally, Meryem or the interpreter switched from Arabic to Syriac. Meryem says that it is difficult for her to find words to express what she thinks and feels, even using both Arabic and Syriac.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1363461511427781"><title>Migration and acculturation</title>
<p>Meryem grew up with six siblings in a small Christian village in Syria. She migrated to Sweden at the age of 18 and met her husband in Sweden. He originates from a village close to Meryem’s. Her family moved to Sweden over a period of years, starting with her oldest sister, who married a man living in Sweden. Her parents missed her sister greatly. The sister returned and visited her family in Syria and told them how beautiful Sweden was and how good it was to live there. Her parents could not live without their oldest daughter and decided to move to Sweden. After this, her family members started to migrate one after the other. Meryem and a younger brother were the last to leave, and lived on their own for 3 years in the village in order to complete their schooling. Meryem did not do well at school during these years as she missed her family, whereas earlier she had done very well. Growing up, she had dreamt of becoming a nurse.</p>
<p>Meryem never wanted to move to Sweden, nor did her brother. They both wanted to stay in their village, and had to migrate to join the family. Departing from Syria, Meryem knew little about Sweden. Upon arriving in Sweden, her brother became ill. He stopped talking, started to brood, did not eat, was constantly freezing, and was hospitalized. The family thought they were going to lose him. For a whole month they cried together. Meryem does not know what was wrong with him or what treatment he received or how he got better. Talking about the migration Meryem says, “I left something in Syria. I left something that I miss a great deal.”</p>
<p>Meryem has never felt as ill as her brother but found it very difficult to move to Sweden. She did not want to stay in Sweden but thought she had to as her parents and siblings were there. When talking about migration and her village of origin, she cries. She often dreams about the village; at night she is there. Sometimes she dreams that she has not done her homework well, or that she is running to school so as not to be late. In some dreams, a bucket has fallen down a well in their garden and she is not able to pull it up. She does not like these dreams but they recur. In her family, they often talk about the village and the life they had there. Meryem often talks about the village with her children. Her children long for the village. She has told the children how they slept on the roof beside each other in the summer. The children ask why they cannot do the same here in Sweden in the summer.</p>
<p>Meryem has not visited the village since moving to Sweden. She has no friends in Sweden except her family and those she meets at church. She has maintained contact by mail and telephone with family members in the village. The only relationship Meryem has with Swedes is with health professionals and people in contact with her children, like teachers and nurses. When the clinician asked Meryem about life in her village of origin, she became talkative, looked into the clinician’s eyes, smiled and became interactive and emotionally present, with lively facial expressions.</p>
<p>Meryem says that when one migrates one has to adapt to the new society. She thinks that there are many good traditions in Sweden and tries to learn these. However, she also finds that there are bad traditions that she does not want to learn and does not want her children to learn. She wants to be able to work but does not want to start to go out and enjoy herself the way Swedes do; she does not want to go to parties but to be able to do things together with her family.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec10-1363461511427781"><title>Cultural explanation of illness</title>
<p>Asked an open question about her problems, Meryem said that the pain started 4 years ago and had increased over the past 2. She is afraid that her distress will confine her to a wheelchair in the future. This worries her as she has six children to take care of. She does not want her children to see how worried she is about her condition. Expressing distress, Meryem uses words such as “pain,” “headache,” “dizzy,” and “tiredness.” Asked about understanding illness, Meryem talked about difficulties in expressing her feelings. She said, “I am bad at expressing my feelings. If I had been able to express my feelings, maybe I would not feel as I do.” She then said that she used to sing when she was a child, but no longer does.</p>
<p>Meryem’s immediate family does not have any specific words for her condition except “pain.” When Meryem is discussing this, the interpreter asks permission to add some information and comments. The interpreter says that because very few people originating from Syria have any school education in the Syriac language, they have access to few abstract words and that for many the term “pain” refers to many different conditions of suffering and distress. Meryem agrees with the interpreter and says:<disp-quote>
<p>How can an interpreter convey what I mean when I cannot find the rights words to express myself? How can a third person do it when I cannot do it myself? I am very glad to have the help of an interpreter, but I wish I did not have to use it. I wish I could speak Swedish well enough so I did not have to use it.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Seeing Meryem struggling with suffering and pain, a cousin advised her to seek primary health care, although the family does not talk about Meryem’s problems outside the family context as this might lead to gossip and misunderstanding. Meryem thinks that it is difficult to make sense of her illness. She does not understand why she became ill, what the illness is about or how to become better. Her family would like to know what illness she has and what makes her so sad. They have suggested that stress and too much hard work may have contributed to her condition. Her oldest daughter, 17 years old, thinks that the illness is due to hard physical work and says, “Mum you should not have worked; you should have stayed at home.” Sometimes Meryem thinks that perhaps her daughter is right, perhaps hard work and having many children has contributed to the pain. Her husband understands this as he also has physically demanding work.</p>
<p>When the pain started, Meryem had no knowledge about what could be helpful to her. She did not know where to go for help. After 2 years of increasing pain she went to the local primary care clinic, not knowing what to expect from them. Today she regrets that she did not ask for help earlier. Asked about help-seeking, Meryem says that she does not know much about illnesses in general or about treatment. For example, she did not know earlier that something such as a physiotherapist existed. She now wants to try all suggestions given to her. She does not know what help she can get at the psychiatric outpatient clinic and has no particular expectations.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1363461511427781"><title>Cultural factors related to psychosocial environment and levels of functioning</title>
<p>Meryem had six children within 13 years, and they are now all doing well. However, Meryem thinks it has been tough to have six children over a short period of time. She was active with the first three children but not with the last three. She feels bad about this and thinks that the children should get more support from her. She deeply wishes that she had more energy for them and is afraid that the children will make demands on her that she will not be able to respond to.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Meryem’s husband takes care of the children and the household. The children help him a lot, and they get some support from one of Meryem’s sisters. At home, Meryem tries to take part in the household and to do things with the children. She cannot do much due to lack of energy, easily feeling tired, and being in pain. Previously, Meryem took full responsibility for the household, worked and took care of the children. After the fourth child she started to lose energy and experience pain. Today, she has to force herself to be active. She can only shop for minor things and wash small dishes. She tries to help her husband with shopping, cooking, and washing. She feels like a burden to her family. Her family does not want her to become exhausted, but it is still Meryem who makes the plans for the family. Her children and husband ask her for advice and respect what she says.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-1363461511427781"><title>Cultural elements in the clinician–patient relationship</title>
<p>In the first session at the psychiatric outpatient clinic, Meryem initially gave an inhibited impression in her interaction but collaborated well on a formal level. At the second visit, the contact improved. At the third visit a structured SCID interview was performed and Meryem collaborated well. These first three interviews were carried out by the same clinician and interpreter and were followed by a CF interview. This was conducted by another clinician but with the same interpreter as in the previous encounters. In the CF interview, Meryem initially collaborated well on a formal level, but was emotionally restrained. When asked about migration to Sweden and her village of origin, however, the interaction suddenly changed. Meryem started to smile, gave eye contact, and became talkative. She was full of energy and so eager to narrate that the interpreter had difficulty translating fast enough.</p>
<p>The interviewing clinician felt emotionally affected, and Meryem’s way of talking made her interested in hearing more about the village. The clinician realized that Meryem had a lot of personal resources and strengths. The clinician felt a sense of joy and hope in relation to the patient and the contact gained emotional warmth and a feeling of shared interest. Both the clinicians interviewing Meryem were of Swedish background, and had for many years worked in the multicultural milieu of the outpatient clinic. The clinician conducting the CF interview had visited Syria and was able to use this as a point of reference for formulating questions about background and migration. Meryem took this as a sign of interest and respect for her background. For the interviewer, this prior knowledge contributed to an interest in the pre- and postmigration history, and a feeling of some familiarity with Meryem’s personal situation.</p>
<p>Despite the presence of an excellent interpreter, both the clinician who did the initial assessment and the clinician who did the CF experienced difficulties in communication. The interviewers were trained to use abstract language and Meryem was used to expressing herself in concrete terms. Identification of abstractions in the SCID and CF interviews led to discussions and elicited new reflections from Meryem. Meryem was eager to learn the meaning of the abstract terms.</p>
<p>When asked about her experience of the assessment at the end of the CF interview, Meryem said that she had never been asked about her village and her journey to Sweden before. She wished that someone had asked her about this a long time ago. She enjoyed talking about it and was very satisfied with the interpreter and thought they were doing a good job. The interpreter added that she was also surprised at these questions and said that doctors do not usually ask such things.</p></sec>

<p>The two clinicians involved in the diagnostic process collaborated in the overall assessment. The focus of presenting distress by Meryem shifted during this process. Initially, pain was in focus. In the structured SCID interview, when probing for specific symptoms, there was a clear difference between the meanings of words Meryem used and the general medical language. In the CF interview, the current life situation and migration history were in focus. Further, Meryem put suffering into more nuanced expressions than words such as “pain.” The CF interview revealed resources, capacities, and emotional strengths. The consensus diagnosis was:
<list id="list2-1363461511427781" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Axis I: Major depression, single episode, mild 296.22.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Axis II: None.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Axis III: The need to reexamine the somatic diagnosis fibromyalgia given at the rehabilitation clinic was confirmed, as the concept of pain for Meryem obviously had many meanings.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Axis IV: Problems related to the social environment—difficulty with acculturation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Axis V: GAF 65.</p></list-item></list></p></sec>
<sec id="sec14-1363461511427781"><title>Treatment suggestions</title>
<p>With the additional information from the CF, the two clinicians involved decided that Meryem should be given antidepressant treatment at the psychiatric outpatient clinic. Further, they determined that Meryem needed psychotherapeutic help in order to look at her present life situation as an immigrant and not be stuck in a position of nostalgia. Support was needed to improve her capacity to express herself emotionally. Further, the central role of the family should be considered in all further treatment planning.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec15-1363461511427781" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="sec16-1363461511427781"><title>On identity</title>
<p>For Meryem, identity is religion- and family-based. Her contacts with Swedes, Syrians, and other people outside the family and the church are restricted. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363461511427781">Deniz (1999)</xref> takes the view that it is often impossible to distinguish religion from ethnic identity and that the term “religion” should be understood in a broad sense; in the Assyrian (Syrian) context embracing the whole of life. To maintain ethnic identity, Deniz emphasizes the importance of religion, language, and the community functioning as a compensatory mechanism for the loss of the homeland.</p>
<p>Meryem described herself as a person in relation to her family. Her identity can be understood more in terms of a sociocentric perspective than an individualistic one. Knowing something of Meryem’s identity is important in order to understand and help her and to see the central importance of her family. Healing systems in sociocentric cultures typically include engaging the whole family, clan or community, and aim to repair or reorder relations with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363461511427781">Kirmayer, 2007</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec17-1363461511427781"><title>On symptom expression and interpretation</title>
<p>For symptom interpretation in the diagnostic process, it was initially taken for granted that Meryem’s concept of “pain” was bodily distress. In the SCID interview, it became evident that she gave pain a broader meaning than a sign of bodily sensations. In the CF interview, when Meryem was given the opportunity to express her distress in an open and personal frame, somatic symptoms were not in focus. Instead, she talked about emotional difficulties, suffering, and of shortcomings in expressing herself, in finding words and how this might affect her. Further, the CF interview helped the clinician obtain information about Meryem’s health, situation, resources, and strengths.</p>
<p>Hinton, Howes, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363461511427781">Kirmayer (2008)</xref> use the concept “sensation metaphor” to describe how sensations may be communicated, and point to the importance of culturally affected schemas for interpretation. Patients may complain of sensations, which physicians classify as symptoms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363461511427781">Kirmayer (2008)</xref> points out that the translation of physiological processes into sensory experiences and their verbal reports is deeply embedded in cultural systems of meaning. In the CF interview, Meryem verbalized her difficulties in expressing her feelings and distress. Some of the words that she had access to like “pain,““tired,” “dizzy,” and “high blood pressure” were readily interpreted by clinicians in Sweden as having mainly a somatic meaning, but they were used by Meryem to convey a wider predicament of suffering. Clinical praxis that does not interest itself in understanding the meaning patients give to distress and what lies behind their words easily leads to misunderstandings, poor care, and conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363461511427781">Bäärnhielm &amp; Ekblad, 2008</xref>). Discussing research on expressed emotions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363461511427781">Jadhav (2009)</xref> emphasizes the importance of cultural validity and contextualizing this within the specific community.</p>
<p>The CF interview gave Meryem an opportunity to talk about suffering in other ways and with other words than in previous clinical assessments. The information from the interview was not enough to discard the diagnosis of fibromyalgia given earlier, but was sufficient to challenge it and to question how well previous communication had worked. Further, the interview raised the importance of improving communication between the medical language of the clinicians and Meryem’s lay language. It also illustrated how suffering expressed in terms of somatic symptoms and pain can be located in different systems of meanings.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec18-1363461511427781"><title>Migration and acculturative stress</title>
<p>An increasing body of research points to migration as a potentially stressful process of change that includes the challenge of culture change and loss. Acculturation refers to the culture changes that groups and individuals undergo when they come into contact with a different culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363461511427781">Berry &amp; Kim, 1988</xref>). Acculturative stress relates to the negative consequences of acculturation. Migration is an identified risk factor for schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363461511427781">Cantor-Graae &amp; Selten, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363461511427781">Cantor-Graae, Zolkowska, &amp; McNeil, 2005</xref>). In a Swedish national cohort study, certain immigrant groups exhibited a higher risk than the Swedish majority population of being hospitalized for psychotic disorders, after adjustment for income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363461511427781">Leão et al., 2006</xref>). For the second generation of immigrants, having one parent born in Sweden was not a protective factor regarding the risk of being hospitalized for psychotic disorders. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363461511427781">Leão et al. (2006)</xref> point to the lack of support for many immigrant groups, and suggest that a conflict between traditional and western culture and cultural identity is likely to contribute to the disparity with the Swedish majority population.</p>
<p>Migration experiences can contribute to depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363461511427781">Lassetter &amp; Callister, 2009</xref>)<bold>.</bold> The clinical presentation of depression may vary significantly, although it is recognizable across different cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363461511427781">Bhugra &amp; Mastrogianni, 2004</xref>). Acculturative stress is associated with depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363461511427781">Crocett et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363461511427781">Hovey, 2000</xref>). In a large, diverse sample of first-generation Latino and Asian immigrants in the USA there was a positive association between downward social mobility and reports of a major depressive episode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363461511427781">Nicklett &amp; Burgard, 2009</xref>). The importance of societal stress and downward social mobility was found in an American national survey on mental health of Black Caribbean immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363461511427781">Williams et al., 2007</xref>). Meryem experienced migration as a stressful life situation that she had not talked much about, except memories of her village with her close family. The CF interview was the first time the situation was given attention in a health care setting beyond basic facts such as country of origin, ethnicity, religious belonging, and year of arrival in Sweden. Her migration narrative revealed suffering, longing, losses, conflicts in norms and traditions, conflicts in the family, and a quite isolated and marginalized situation in her new context.</p>
<p>Meryem’s migration narrative mirrored the theoretical knowledge about acculturative stress and risk factors such as marginalization, cultural change and loss, the challenge of changing cultural identity and social position, and loss of language and social network. Meryem expressed her gratitude for the opportunity to talk about these things. For the interviewer, the migration narrative revealed difficulties, capacity, and was a gate to a trustful contact that contributed to improved information about the patient’s life, suffering, and concerns. Further, her migration narrative reflected the intertwined relations between expressing suffering in emotional, somatic, and social terms and the problems with clinical expectations of clear entities for differentiated experiences of distress. The narrative did not change the psychiatric categorization of suffering but contributed to an improved overall understanding of the person and her suffering as well as influencing treatment plans.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec19-1363461511427781"><title>Ethnography in the clinic</title>
<p>Ethnography offers a new and interesting set of methods to enhance the clinical capacity to respond to cultural variety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363461511427781">Atkinson, Coffey, Delamont, Lofland, &amp; Lofland, 2001</xref>). Ethnographic fieldwork allows the researcher to attend to everyday interpretation of sensations as they are happening and offers insights into the process of transformation of sensations into symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363461511427781">Hay, 2008</xref>). An ethnography-based interview, such as the CF, is not as close to the life situation as fieldwork, but provides clinicians with a practical tool to include culture from an individualized emic perspective in the diagnostic process.</p>
<p>Applying ethnography in clinical psychiatric diagnostic practice is different from using it in anthropological and social science research. The clinician is in the dual position of knowing (medical expert) and not knowing (using ethnography). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363461511427781">Brody (1981)</xref> has pointed out that, unlike an ethnographer, clinicians are not required to use the information gathered to accomplish a community-requested task. Further, the context of care may be threatening since the healer requires access for therapeutic purposes to the mind and body of the other.</p>
<p>This case is an example of how the CF functioned as a culturally focused idiographic formulation. For the patient, Meryem, the initial clinical Axis I diagnosis was not changed but confirmed, and treatment suggested with more knowledge about the patient, her resources and strengths, and with improved understanding of her communication. The CF interview took 1.5 hours (using an interpreter) and was conducted early in the diagnostic process. It gave new information valuable for diagnosing, planning treatment, and creating an alliance. This case presentation includes only assessment. It has the shortcoming of being based on only the patient’s narrative and not including information from family members or important others. This mirrors the general situation for psychiatric assessment in psychiatric care in Stockholm. Despite these shortcomings, the case exemplifies the value of using the CF in everyday clinical psychiatric diagnostic practice, how it can contribute to an increased understanding of the patient’s point of view and way of communicating, and shows that it is possible to complete a CF within the time constraints of regular clinical care. Further, the case demonstrates the importance of using an ethnographic approach after the initial assessment in order to enhance understanding of the patient.</p></sec></sec>
