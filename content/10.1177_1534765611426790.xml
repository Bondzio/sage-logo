<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to explore the narratives of members of Kibbutz Mishmar Haemek regarding their experience during Israel’s War of Independence in 1948, when they were children or young adolescents. The main focus of the study was to examine the meaning they have ascribed to this experience along their life cycle. The study was conducted using qualitative methodology. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews with 13 people. Data analysis revealed five main themes: (a) fear; (b) the adults: trust versus sense of abandonment; (c) evacuation; (d) talk versus action: working through the traumatic event; and (e) the collective myth. The discussion centers on the main finding, which shows that, in spite of the traumatic potential of exposure to war, none of the participants described it as a traumatic experience.</p>

<p>All wars are traumatic, but they have always been part of human society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765611426790">DeWolfe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765611426790">Halpern &amp; Tramontin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534765611426790">Norris et al., 2002</xref>). In some areas of the world, such as the Middle East, the conflict has lasted for more than one hundred years, with ongoing tension that escalates every few years, resulting in war. The purpose of this study was to explore the narratives of members of Kibbutz Mishmar-Haemek in Israel regarding the War of Independence in 1948, 61 years ago, while they were children or young adolescents. The main focus of the study was to examine the meaning ascribed to this experience along their life cycle, which included further wars, either as adolescents or as combat or noncombat adults. As a basis for understanding the narrative and its meaning, it is important to examine (a) the specific context of the war, (b) existing knowledge regarding impact of wars on adolescents, and (c) memory construction of traumatic events.</p>
<sec id="section1-1534765611426790">
<title>The Study Context</title>
<p>To understand the unique context of the study, it is important to describe this unique type of community. The kibbutz is a form of communal living in Israel that combines socialism and Zionism, traditionally designed as a village based on agriculture. Kibbutzim [plural] began as utopian communities but have gradually embraced a more practical socialist approach. Over the years, farming has been partially supplanted by other economic branches, including industrial plants and high tech. A major part of kibbutz ideology was the “collective education” of the children, which began in the 1920s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534765611426790">Rabin &amp; Hazan, 1973</xref>). Child rearing responsibility was transferred from the parents to the community as a whole, and the children were cared for by specially trained caregivers, or nannies [singular <italic>metapelet</italic>, plural <italic>metaplot</italic>] and teachers, to allow the busy parents to work undisturbed. Moreover, it was believed that children and parents would have better relationships because parents would not have to be disciplinarians. Thus, each age group lived in a communal building called a <italic>children’s house</italic>, which was operated by a <italic>metapelet</italic> and a teacher. Both these figures were defined as <italic>educators</italic> and were dominant in the children’s daily life. Every afternoon, the children spent 4 to 5 hr at their parents’ homes. The parents’ apartments had one room that served as living room and bedroom. Several families shared a bathroom, and one collective shower served the entire kibbutz. The children’s houses had much better physical conditions than the parents’ homes and included bedrooms, toilets, bathrooms, dining room, and classroom or kindergarten. This “collective education” system was operated on Kibbutz Mishmar-Haemek.</p>
<p>Kibbutz Mishmar-Haemek was founded in 1922 by pioneers who immigrated to Israel from Poland, including significant leaders of the Zionist-Socialist movement, including a leading psychoanalyst who contributed to the development of collective education. The members of Kibbutz Mishmar-Haemek believed in coexistence with the Arabs in Israel. Thus, the kibbutz supplied medical aid to people from the surrounding Arab villages and organized many joint sport activities for the Arab and kibbutz children. Many friendships developed and they would visit each others’ homes.</p>
<p>In 1948, the Arab Liberation Army, under the command of <italic>Fauzi</italic> el-Kaukji, was advancing from Jenin to Haifa in the north of Israel. Kibbutz Mishmar-Haemek was an obstacle in its path along this road, and overpowering the kibbutz was necessary to achieve its aims. Joined by the surrounding Arab village population, the Arab Liberation Army began its attack on Mishmar Ha’Emek in the early evening hours of April 4, 1948, a month before the declaration of the State of Israel. The attacking force was composed of two infantry battalions and nine artillery units. It was the first time in the War of Independence that the Arabs used 75-mm and 105-mm cannons. The initial shelling killed three people, including a mother and baby, caused injuries to people and animals and heavy damage to buildings. The Arabs reached the perimeter fence of the kibbutz but were repelled by small-arms fire. At the end of the following day (April 5), the British, who were still ruling the country under the mandate, imposed a truce to evacuate the wounded and the children from Mishmar-Haemek. The defenders of the kibbutz had managed to withstand a vastly superior enemy with little reinforcement, until the Palmach<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1534765611426790">1</xref></sup> brought assistance. On April 12, the underground forces conquered the Arab villages, the Arab Liberation Army retreated and the population fled the villages. The defeat of el-Kaukji at Mishmar-Haemek marked the turning point in the War of Independence. This convinced the White House that the Jews would be able to hold their own against the Arabs, despite the views of the CIA and the State Department (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534765611426790">Herzog &amp; Gazit, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534765611426790">Morris, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The children who had been evacuated with their educators returned to Mishmar-Haemek about 3 months after the end of the attack, when the damaged children’s houses had been repaired. On the first night of Hannukah<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1534765611426790">2</xref></sup> in December 1948, an Iraqi airplane bombed one of the kibbutz children’s houses. Three 9-year-old children and one woman were killed. The members of Mishmar-Haemek refer to the war in April as “the attack” and to the December bombing as “the bombing.”</p>

<title>Effects of War on Children and Teenagers</title>
<p>The mental health literature in general has described populations living in war and terror situations as being at high risk for developing distress symptoms. These include generalized fear and anxiety, recurrent thoughts of terror attacks, avoidance behavior, physiological symptoms, depression, and problems in daily functioning and shatter basic human assumptions that the world is benevolent, which includes difficulties in relating to and trusting others, and, in severe cases, even PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534765611426790">Gidron, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534765611426790">Hobfoll, Canetti-Nisim, &amp; Johnson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534765611426790">Janoff-Bulman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534765611426790">Solomon, Mikulincer, Waysman, &amp; Marlowe, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Children and teenagers are considered victims of war and terror not only if they are killed or wounded but also if they suffer from psychosocial distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765611426790">Garbarino, Kostelny, &amp; Dubrow, 1991</xref>). Exposure to uncertainty, militaristic socialization or inhumane behavior affects children’s psychosocial development and their ability to love, care, and feel solidarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534765611426790">Jensen, 1996</xref>). Furthermore, war and the threat of terror often create difficult circumstances in which parents may be pushed beyond their stress-absorption capacities. As such, they may become psychologically unavailable as a resource of social support that is needed during childhood and adolescence for different developmental tasks in general, and in stress situations in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534765611426790">Garbarino &amp; Kostelny, 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765611426790">Garbarino et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534765611426790">Osofsky, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the findings of studies that have explored children’s reactions to the stress of war and terror are somewhat mixed. On one hand, studies have reported a prevalence rate of 26.5% of PTSD among children and teenagers living in refugee camps compared with 2% of PTSD among teenagers living in areas not exposed to political violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534765611426790">Sack, Clarke, &amp; Seeley, 1996</xref>). In some studies, however, children and teenagers reported a low level of trauma in reaction to longitudinal exposure to political violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765611426790">Cairns &amp; Dawes, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534765611426790">Miller, 1996</xref>). There are two possible explanations for this: The first one refers may be habituation to the political violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534765611426790">Miller, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534765611426790">Punamaki, Qouta, &amp; Sarraj, 1997</xref>). On the other hand, results of several studies showing that the majority of the population exposed to potential traumatic events does not develop posttraumatic symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534765611426790">Bonanno, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534765611426790">Norris, 1992</xref>). These studies examined mainly adults; however, their results might be somewhat similar to studies in which children and teenagers reported a low level of trauma as result of exposure to political violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534765611426790">Sack et al., 1996</xref>).</p>

<title>Social Systems as Resources of Coping With Stress</title>
<p>The literature on stress suggests various theories for conceptualizing the impact of stressor events on human beings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765611426790">Hobfoll, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534765611426790">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984</xref>). Whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534765611426790">Lazarus and Folkman (1984)</xref> emphasize personal traits, such as cognitive appraisal, which serves as mediator between the stressor and its immediate and long-term effects, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765611426790">Hobfoll (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765611426790">Bronfenbrenner (2005)</xref> focused on the importance of resources, especially those that include social variables, as affecting both the reactions to stress and healthy development. They claim that family and community are considered the basic resources affecting human beings’ ability to cope with stressful situations. Individuals, especially children and adolescents, are nested within a family context, and the family is nested within a social community. Therefore, thoughts, perceptions, behaviors, and emotions evolve and develop from the ecological context in which the individual, family, and community exist.</p>
<p>Knowledge regarding the role of families and peer groups during wars is limited. Most of the existing knowledge describes the disruption in family routine due to the war-related situation and its effect on increasing children’s and teenagers’ distress. These studies identified the family as a core element of children’s and adolescents’ resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765611426790">Cairns &amp; Dawes, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534765611426790">Gabarino &amp; Kostelny, 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534765611426790">1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765611426790">Garbarino et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1534765611426790">Shamai, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534765611426790">2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534765611426790">Garbarino and Kostelny (1996a)</xref> argue that children and teenagers can cope with political violence faced in the context of a functioning family system. However, they raised the question of whether adults, and particularly parents, can still function adequately when the entire community is under threat created by political violence. Based on the specific study context, it is important to look beyond the family system at other meaningful system for children and adolescents in Mishmar-Haemek and to equate the entire community with the family system, especially the educators who worked with the children and spent most of the day with them.</p>
<p>It is unclear which specific characteristics cause the children to perceive a family, or the community in the present study, as resilient. Based on existing knowledge, we assume that two aspects contribute to children’s perception of family and community resilience: (a) supportive atmosphere, characterized by open communication, where the children can share their concerns regarding the stressful situation and have confidence in the adults’ ability to cope with the resulting difficulties and (b) the level of stress each child attributes to his or her own parents or educators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765611426790">Garbarino et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534765611426790">Shamai, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Existing knowledge regarding the effects of other social systems surrounding children and teenagers is even more limited than that of the family. When exploring the effect of social systems on adolescents, it is important to consider the influence of the surrounding peer group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765611426790">Hartup, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534765611426790">Maxwell, 2002</xref>). The two aspects through which family resilience is perceived can be used to explain the peer group role: (a) friends’ support, characterized by their presence and willingness to share feelings and thoughts about the stressful situation, as well as to encourage their peers, and (b) the level of stress each teenager attributes to his or her friends and others in the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765611426790">Cairns &amp; Dawes, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765611426790">Hartup, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Regarding the specific context of this study, it is important to point on the place of ideology that was shared by the community as a potential resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765611426790">Hobfoll, 2001</xref>). The educational process in Mishmar Haemek as in other kibbutzim was based on Zionist and socialist ideologies. Thus, issues related to the Zionist ideology, including the need and the right of the Jews to have a “safe home” in their original land, received a significant place in the messages transmitted by the adults to the children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534765611426790">Rabin &amp; Hazan, 1973</xref>). Thus, it is possible to assume that the children interpreted the attack on Mishmar Haemek as part of the belief in Zionist ideology; therefore, the ideology might be considered as an additional resource. In the present study, we attempted to explore how the children and adolescents experienced the traumatic event of war and evacuation and how they constructed it throughout their life. As the study explores an experience that occurred 61 years ago, it is necessary to understand how an event with potentially traumatic impacts is remembered.</p>
<p>Constructing memories of traumatic events: The past three decades have seen a change in the study of memory processes. This change focused on the impact of the social context on the way events are remembered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765611426790">Bruner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765611426790">Fivush, Haden, &amp; Reese, 1996</xref>). It is important to indicate that the new focus is often identical to concepts of narrative theories and analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534765611426790">Gergen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1534765611426790">White &amp; Epston, 1990</xref>). According to these theories, the memory is not static but in a constant process of construction and reconstruction, depending on the context of the occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534765611426790">Schank &amp; Abelson, 1995</xref>). One explanation of this process is that individuals preserve memories as stories that they tell themselves and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534765611426790">Schank &amp; Abelson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1534765611426790">White &amp; Epston, 1990</xref>). These stories often include only a small part of an event; and this part creates one or more themes around which the frame of the story is constructed. The theme and the frame of the story depend on the context in which the story was created, including the age, physical and psychological conditions of the individuals telling the story, the set of beliefs the narrators hold about themselves and others, and the message they wish to convey to the listener (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534765611426790">Schank &amp; Abelson, 1995</xref>). In the present study, the social context plays a significant role; the war was experienced by the entire community, which is nested in a society with accumulated experience of wars up to the present day. Considering this special context, we aimed to investigate the adults’ constructed narratives of the experience of war that occurred 61 years ago while they were children or young teenagers.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The study was conducted using qualitative methodology. This assumes that reality is based on the meaning people assign to life experiences; thus, no single objective reality exists but multiple subjective realities of those who participated in a given situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534765611426790">Guba &amp; Lincoln, 1994</xref>). Under-standing is always limited by language, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. As a result, the researcher abandons the goal of generalization and accepts that data are always imperfect and are dependent on the context of the event as experienced by the participants, the impact of life experiences on the specific experience of the war, the context of the interview, the dialogue between researcher and participants, and the way in which the researcher perceives this dialogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1534765611426790">Shamai, 2003</xref>). It is important to note that the researcher is a member of Kibbutz Mishmar-Haemek and is emotionally involved with the local heroic narrative. However, she did not personally experience the attack on the kibbutz during the War of Independence, as she was born after the war.</p>
<sec id="section5-1534765611426790">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The sample of 15 participants was selected using purposive sampling principles, often used in qualitative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534765611426790">Patton, 1990</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534765611426790">Patton (1990)</xref>, in purposive sampling, participants are selected because of some characteristic. This study used criterion, maximum variation and opportunistic sampling, the three types enumerated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534765611426790">Patton (1990)</xref> in his proposed purposive sampling process. The one sampling criterion in this study was people who were children or young adolescents (aged 5-14 years) living in Mishmar-Haemek during the War of Independence. Maximum variation was achieved by choosing (a) participants of different gender, (b) participants of different age, and (c) participants who are still members of Kibbutz Mishmar-Haemek and participants who left the kibbutz.</p>
<p>The researcher advertised the proposed study in the kibbutz newsletter, asking members who met the criteria to contact her. Four participants called her, and, after interviewing them, she approached other people according to age group and gender. Everyone who was approached agreed to participate in the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1534765611426790">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data were collected using in-depth, unstructured interviews conducted by the researcher, who was experienced in qualitative interviewing. The interviews were conducted in individual settings. Each interview lasted approximately 1.5 hr and was tape-recorded and transcribed. Following a brief explanation of the general research aims, the participants were asked whether they voluntarily agreed to participate in the study. They signed an informed consent form describing the main objective of the study, ensured protection of the participants’ anonymity and specified their ethical rights, including the right to stop the interview at any time and for any reason. In addition, they were told that the study was conducted according to the rules of the University of Haifa Ethics Committee. The unstructured interview started with a request to recount their experience of the war from the beginning. After they told the story, the researcher requested certain clarifications and an expansion of issues that had been described in brief. This was followed by one additional question regarding the impact of the war along the life cycle and the meaning ascribed to it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1534765611426790">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis was performed by the researcher according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534765611426790">Strauss and Corbin (1998)</xref> and consisted of the following stages:</p>
<list id="list1-1534765611426790" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Open coding</italic>: The researcher read each interview transcript several times, making notes to the text to identify the initial units of meaning (categories) that emerged from the data (e.g., role of educators, perception of parents, relationships between peers).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Axial coding</italic>: In the second stage, the researcher read the entire list of first-stage categories of the whole interview, identified context and content relationships between categories, and organized them into themes (e.g., theme: The adults—trust vs. sense of abandonment).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Integration</italic>: In this stage, the researcher sought interrelations between the themes. She reread the interview transcripts to find out whether the themes and interrelations between them captured the participants’ narratives.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>It is important to note that in qualitative research, the basic assumption is that the researcher’s subjective perspectives inevitably shape the research findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765611426790">Denzin, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534765611426790">Patton, 2002</xref>). Due to the researcher’s aforementioned involvement with the collective history of the kibbutz, bracketing was required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534765611426790">Padgett, 1998</xref>). Bracketing is the researchers’ effort to suspend their own assumptions, belief, and feelings to better understand the participants’ experience. The researcher is not required to repress her feelings and beliefs but rather to identify them and try to prevent their interference with the issue under study. In addition, there is no expectation of replicability because of the idiosyncratic influence of the research context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765611426790">Creswell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534765611426790">Kvale, 1996</xref>). Although this study does not allow generalizations, it enables a better and more in-depth understanding of the way war experienced by children affects their life cycle.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>The data were organized into five main themes that seemed to permeate the narratives of the participants: (a) Fear, (b) The adults: trust vs. sense of abandonment, (c) Evacuation: away from home and from the family, (d) Talking vs. action: working through the traumatic event, and (e) The collective myth.</p>
<sec id="section9-1534765611426790">
<title>Fear</title>
<p>Fear colored most of the descriptions regarding the first 2 days of the attack on Mishmar-Haemek, prior to the children’s evacuation. Mr. A, who was around 13 years old, described,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>. . . we were told to lie under the beds. We were told that our house was built from reinforced concrete and that the bullets and catapult shells could not destroy it, but no-one knew that they had cannons, whose shells destroyed the part of the house where our group was living. We stayed quiet; we were so afraid, no-one spoke. We heard crying from the younger group of children (around age 12) who lived on the second floor, but we kept quiet. After two or three rooms were destroyed, all the children congregated in the two remaining rooms. Suddenly, there was a boom, something came through the wall and landed next to E. It was so dark and we couldn’t see what it was and than E. said it was an unexploded shell. It was frightening. We understood that this was a real war and not some scouting game . . . on the next night, the shelling was worse and it was decided to move us to a cave close to the kibbutz. We were asked to take our blankets and walk in the direction of the cave. The problem was that about 100 meters of the way was exposed to Abu-Shoosha (one of the Arab villages surrounding Mishmar Haemek). There were no houses or trees and they could easily shoot us. We had to run very fast . . . I remember one of the educators telling me to run in Biblical Hebrew . . . luckily none of the children were hurt, but one educator was severely injured . . . when I came to the cave it was very quiet again, the fear . . . We realized how afraid we were only three days later, after we were evacuated to Kibbutz Mizrah and while we were in the shower, we felt a boom . . . and we immediately lay down on the floor, and then realized that it was a wooden-soled shoe . . . and we started laughing, hysterical laughter, releasing the fear . . .</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the descriptions of fear took a larger and more significant place in the narratives of those who were high school age, compared with children who were in kindergarten or elementary school. This may be explained by the absence of adults and the fact that the high school building was one of the main targets for the attack. This is illustrated in Mr. R’s story, who was about 12 at the time of the attack:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>. . . we were lying under the bed and suddenly G. yelled: I can see the sky! A shell entered the house. There were no adults with us. Well, there might have been someone, I guess it was Z. our <italic>metapelet</italic>, but I don’t remember and I don’t know where she was just then. Anyway, if she was there, she was insignificant . . . it was only us children. We began to understand the danger and someone said that we should go to the lower floor. I was among the first children who went down, either because I was a coward, or because that was my place in the line, I don’t know. The moment we arrived on the first floor, where the central office was, a shell exploded and everywhere filled with smoke. It was impossible to breathe, we couldn’t see anything. It was so quiet that I started yelling: “K!” [one of the educators] What should I do? No one answered, but all the children heard me yelling and laughed at me afterwards. . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Fear was emphasized less in the younger children’s descriptions. They mentioned other factors that helped them cope with fear. This is illustrated in the narratives of Ms. N, (aged 10), Ms. R (aged 9), and Ms. Na (aged 5):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>. . . I don’t remember being afraid, neither before the attack, when people talked about “something” that might happen, nor during the attack. We were told to stay under the beds, and at first, it was so cold that our <italic>metapelet</italic>, who was a very special, wonderful woman, by the way, put our mattresses on the floor under the beds . . . and we felt safe, although we could hear bullets and shells whistling . . . the only expression of fear that I still remember today was by a mother of a boy in our group, who joined Mishmar-Haemek after surviving the Holocaust. She stayed with her son and hugged him, and her whole body trembled with fear . . .</p>
<p>. . . I was lying under the bed and my friend, Z. lay next to me. We hugged each other and felt secure. I think the physical closeness helped us deal with the fear . . . and our <italic>metapelet</italic> started telling us stories in her quiet voice. I don’t remember whether we listened, but her voice was so calming.</p>
<p>. . . we were lying under the beds, on which lay mothers of some kibbutz members. They lived in wooden sheds and had come to our children’s house, as it was built of concrete, and was therefore safer. M’s mother was on my bed. She was so nice. She talked to me and petted me and I don’t remember being afraid.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, the younger children experienced fear 8 months later, following the aerial bombing of a children’s house in Mishmar-Haemek, killing three 9-year-olds:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>. . . we heard a “boom” and suddenly it was dark and quiet. We ran directly to the bomb shelter, which was close to our children’s house and all I remember was the darkness . . . I have hated dark ever since . . . I need to sleep with some light and all my children’s names are connected with the word “Or” [“light” in Hebrew].</p>
<p>. . . our children’s house was bombed and three children were killed . . . I lived in the room next door and remember searching blindly for the bomb shelter. I found my way there somehow . . . but the problems started a few days or weeks later. I became very aggressive and started throwing things on the floor. I guess that it was a reenactment of the bomb thrown at us. I remember being sent for psychological tests, but there was no follow-up. I didn’t receive any therapy.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As seen from the participants’ narratives, the children’s reactions to the attack on the kibbutz and to the aerial bombing were different. During the attack, children who felt “protected” by adults did not recall feeling frightened, in spite of the heavy explosions around them. It seems that the adults’ role was crucial also immediately after the bombing, as described by Mr. Sh:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>. . . our children’s house was very close to the one that was bombed . . . I don’t remember whether I was still awake or just falling asleep. No, I heard the boom and the windows shatter . . . Some adults came immediately and took us to a bomb shelter very close to the children’s house. We stayed there all night with our <italic>metapelet</italic> and teacher and some other kibbutz members. I don’t remember whether I slept or not, but I don’t remember being afraid . . . we heard about the children’s deaths only the following day.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, in spite of being so close to the target, the immediate presence of adults had a significant impact on the children’s sense of security, which might have resulted in reducing or even preventing fear and anxiety. Only one participant described experiencing some symptoms arising from the war. None of the others described any of the symptoms or behavioral and emotional difficulties often characteristic of children and teenagers who experience war.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1534765611426790">
<title>The Adults—Trust Versus Sense of Abandonment</title>
<p>The adults’ role was a significant issue in the narratives, which refer to three different groups: (a) the most significant group was the educators (<italic>metapelet</italic> and teachers), who stayed with the children most of the time; (b) parents, who were either fighting or were educators of other children and therefore separated from their own children during the attack and the evacuation; and (c) the entire kibbutz adult population, as a collective group.</p>
<sec id="section11-1534765611426790">
<title>The educators</title>
<p>Due to the way the communal education system was operated at this time on kibbutzim, the educators played a significant role in the children’s life. During the war, they stayed with them 24 hr a day and were supposed to take care of all their physiological and psychological needs. In the descriptions of the attack, the children and teenagers perceived the educators differently. While the children mentioned the educators’ presence and the sense of security they conveyed to the children, the teenagers spoke about the educators’ absence, sometimes almost with the sense of abandonment, as in E’s story:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>. . . I don’t remember any adult being with us. I think they were so afraid that they were the first to leave to the floor below . . . we mentioned this frequently over the years, when talking about the attack on Mishmar-Haemek. We wondered how they could have left us alone. Many members in my group were angry with them, but I wasn’t . . . I even remember Ms. M. She was the <italic>metapelet</italic> of another group and she was fat, so when we went to the floor below, where the shower was, she was sitting in the bath and I didn’t have anywhere to go. But I was very skinny, so I lay on the edge of the bath tub all night long . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other teenagers shared E’s perception of the adults. Although they all stated that they themselves felt no anger toward the educators, they indicated that the “others” were angry. It is possible that they had mellowed over the years and, once they had reached their 70s, had already worked through and diminished the anger. The negative perception of the educators was intensified in comparison with the children’s descriptions. Statements such as: “Y, the greatest, told us to stay in the children house . . .” or “Our <italic>metapelet</italic> was P, the most kindhearted person in the world,” characterized the descriptions of the educators during the 2 days the children were under fire.</p>
<p>When referring to the evacuation period, both children and teenagers described the educators as present and caring. In many narratives, the statement, “they really took care of us and wanted us to feel as though life was normal,” was repeatedly paraphrased by most participants. Both children and teenagers mentioned their trust in the educators in their descriptions. Even when the educators were perceived as absent during the first 2 days of the attack, the teenagers still accepted them as significant. This is reflected by Mr. R, who shouted for the educator in the dark, as mentioned above. Thus, it can be assumed that the prewar trust was not completely destroyed, and the teenagers continued to perceive them as significant others. It is also unclear when the participants began to feel angry with the educators. E said, “. . . we mentioned this frequently when talking about the attack . . .” Thus, it may be that the anger, or the awareness of it, was experienced later.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1534765611426790">
<title>The parents</title>
<p>Most children did not see their parents during the first 2 days of the attacks. All the fathers and some of the mothers were fighting to defend the kibbutz. Others were educators and stayed with their groups of children or were responsible for supplying basic needs, such as food. None of the participants mentioned their parents when describing the first 2 days under fire but only when describing the evacuation. Mr. A described the meeting with his parents just before he was evacuated:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>. . . we were there waiting. The British soldiers who were supposed to take us out were already there . . . I remember standing next to my mother and my youngest brother and my father arrived. He kissed my little brother; you must remember that parents hardly ever hugged and kissed their children in those days. And then he turned to me, put his hand on my shoulder and gave me the book, “A White Sail Gleams” . . . I read it during the evacuation period, and many more times throughout my life.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In later life, Mr. A became the CEO of a large publishing company. Some participants were worried about their parents, as illustrated by Mr. R:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>. . . on our way to hide in the cave, we passed through my mother’s defense outpost. We saw each other and said hello. We were in a hurry and didn’t have time to talk. I remember worrying that something could happen to her; especially after Ms. B (one of the educators) was injured.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>When Ms. S talked about her mother, she mentioned her sense of pride: “My mother was among the fighters and I remember being very proud of her and telling the other children.”</p>
<p>It is interesting that pride was mentioned in relation to both fathers and mothers who were fighting, but the worry was directed toward the mothers only. It could be assumed that frontline fighting was gender related, and unusual for women, although many of the female kibbutz members fulfilled this role.</p>
<p>Almost all the children mentioned the relationships with their parents during the evacuation period, whereas the teenagers hardly mentioned this at all. Many participants mentioned longing for their parents. This was expressed also in letters that were written by the children and stored in the Kibbutz Mishmar-Haemek archive (although we did not analyze the content of these letters in the present study). Ms. N and Ms. I’s stories illustrate the sense of longing:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>My mother was staying with us in Haifa, well, not with my group but I could see her every day. When parents started visiting the children, my father wasn’t allowed to come. As there wasn’t room for everyone, only children who were separated from both parents received visits. One day, I was walking next to my mother and pushed her into the road. She asked me what I was doing. I told her that if she died, then Dad would be allowed to visit me. I missed him so much . . .</p>
<p>I was afraid that if my mother would come to visit me with the other mothers and I called her Mom, she might confuse me with the other children and not recognize me, so I used her name . . . since that day I have used her name and not called her Mom . . .</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>One participant mentioned the benefit of having her parents with her:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>My mother was with another group staying on the same kibbutz as us and my aunt was our <italic>metapelet</italic>, so I had one parent with me all the time and an aunt to whom I was very close. Since my father was the treasurer of the kibbutz education system, he visited us many times, so I didn’t miss my parents as much as most children.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It is possible that the teenagers did not miss their parents because of their developmental stage. It may be that even if they did, they preferred not to admit it to their peers and constructed their stories according to these social norms. However, the parents were included also in some of the descriptions of the attack. Ms. S, who was in the bombed children’s house, said,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>. . . many years later, I was told that my mother was looking for me and had started to dig under the ruins, until the father of one of the girls who was killed came and told her that “the girl is in the bomb shelter.”</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Ms. N described her experience:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>The <italic>metapelet</italic> told me that my sister had been killed . . . and later I saw my parents, I guess they were on their way to the funeral. My father was walking, holding up my mother who could hardly walk. I was so happy to see them that I ran towards them. My father told me to go back, quickly, to the kindergarten. It was the first and only time that I was rejected by my parents . . .</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In sum, the narrative constructions show that the children experienced their parents as warm and loving. They longed for them, were worried about them and were proud of them. They described them as caring, as in Ms. S’s story, and the only case of rejection was in the terrible context of the loss of a child.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1534765611426790">
<title>The entire kibbutz adult population, as a collective group</title>
<p>Almost all the stories describe the participants’ sense of trust in the adult kibbutz members as a whole. Such statements as, “I was not afraid since we were told that . . . and we really trusted them,” or when referring to the evacuation period, “. . . they tried to do everything to make us feel good” were repeatedly made. Even when criticizing the adults, their behavior was justified in hindsight: “They didn’t know that the Arabs would use cannons, and even reinforced concrete couldn’t withstand the explosion,” or “they didn’t know how to deal with traumatic experiences in those days.” All the descriptions convey an underlying sense of respect toward the kibbutz members: “They really defended our home [the kibbutz].” “We were so proud of them.”</p>
<p>It can be concluded from the data that, excepting the descriptions of the high school educators, the participants expressed complete trust in the adults (educators, parents, and kibbutz members as a collective group), perceiving them as capable of defending the kibbutz, caring, and with a strong desire to make a difficult situation bearable.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1534765611426790">
<title>Evacuation—Away From Home and the Family</title>
<p>The evacuation had a significant place in all the narratives. Most participants described it in detail without questioning their memory, as opposed to other parts of their narratives, which included such remarks as, “I am not sure whether I remember things really as they were, or whether I was told about them, and they became part of the memory.” The narratives about the evacuation included three parts: (a) being evacuated, (b) being away from home, and (c) coming back home.</p>
<sec id="section15-1534765611426790">
<title>Being evacuated</title>
<p>All the descriptions of the evacuation included two main elements: The parents who came to say goodbye and the British soldiers with their armored vehicles who came to take the children either to other kibbutzim on the other side of the valley or to Haifa. The following stories illustrate these events:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>When we arrived, the British soldiers were already there. They impressed me; they were very nice and kind to us . . . my parents came to say goodbye to me and my younger sister . . . my mother was a <italic>metapelet</italic> of a younger group and she was going with them and my sister to Haifa. I don’t remember what exactly what she or my dad said, as I was so busy looking at the soldiers and the armored vehicles.</p>
<p>My mother was allowed to leave the defense outpost to come and see me and my brother before we left; my father had not yet arrived at Mishmar-Haemek. He was in Tel Aviv when the attack started and managed to sneak back to the kibbutz only 2 days later. So I didn’t see him before we left . . . The strongest memory was of the armored vehicles. I couldn’t breathe and there were very small air inlet openings, but they were very high up and I couldn’t reach them. We drove through fields and there was lots of dust . . . I guess I was also very anxious.</p>
<p>My parents came to say goodbye . . . only as an adult I found out that did not know if she would ever see me again . . . she was staying at Mishmar-Haemek and didn’t know how the fighting would end.</p>
<p>. . . Only years later, I read in my mother’s diary how anxious they were when we were evacuated . . . they didn’t know whether we would have a home [the kibbutz] to come back to.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The last two stories illustrate the parents’ hidden anxiety, which was not conveyed to the children at that time. Furthermore, Mr. A described in the previous section how his father kissed his youngest brother, although this was unusual in those days. He was the only participant to describe a significant communication with the parents in this special situation, with the gift of the book, but all participants mentioned their parents in connection with the evacuation. They all described the armored vehicles, some including specific details. It is interesting that the armored vehicles received such attention. It could be that the children had never seen them before and were therefore the focus of attention. It is also possible that as armored vehicles symbolized the military forces, they were more deeply engraved in the children’s consciousness than the interaction with their parents, which was not new or special to the war situation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1534765611426790">
<title>Away from home</title>
<p>The participants’ descriptions of the period away from home reflected their homesickness for Mishmar-Haemek, alongside their warm reception by the hosting kibbutzim, and the daily routine created by the educators from Mishmar-Haemek. The following descriptions illustrate these experiences:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>We were sent to Kibbutz Mizra and everyone received us so nicely. I still have some good friends from back then. It’s the type of relationship that lasts, even if we don’t see each other very often. (Ms. R)</p>
<p>People in Kibbutz Merchavia were very nice to us . . . it was a few days before Passover and they invited us to take part in the <italic>Seder</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1534765611426790">3</xref></sup> We didn’t want to be part of it, as it wasn’t the custom on Mishmar-Haemek. So they tried to convince us, by saying that we would be able to see Meir Ya’ari (a leader of the Socialist party to which Mishmar-Haemek and the hosting kibbutzim belonged). We immediately said that we were not impressed, as we had Hazan (another leader of the same party). But they managed to convince us . . . they really did every thing to make us to feel welcome. (Ms. E)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Mr. A and Ms. Na described the significant role of the educators from Mishmar-Haemek who escorted the children:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>. . . the adults who accompanied us organized a daily routine very quickly . . . we studied with our teachers, went to work after school hours, well of course, not on Mishmar-Haemek, but on the hosting kibbutz, and we had all the regular social activities.</p>
<p>. . . when we arrived in Haifa, the beds were already made. I guess our <italic>metaplot</italic> had done that. . . . they were with us 24 hr a day, in very difficult physical conditions and they were so committed. I still wonder where they got all this energy . . . they were like parents.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In spite of the warm hospitality and the daily routine, the children were worried and longed for their parents and for home. The following illustration appeared in almost all the narratives: “Every day, we used to look across the valley, to see what was happening. We could see the smoke above Mishmar-Haemek.”</p>
<p>The children expressed their longing for Mishmar-Haemek in their letters home. Besides the yearning and worry, they were very proud of their kibbutz, as Ms. N describes:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>One day, there was some shooting close to Mizra, where we were staying. The Mizra children were very excited . . . we talked about it and told them that we had experienced a direct attack, which dampened their excitement . . . well, as you know, Mishmar-Haemek has always been a very proud and arrogant kibbutz . . .</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The attack on Mishmar-Haemek lasted for about 10 days, but as the kibbutz was destroyed and most of the children’s houses had to be rebuilt, the children remained evacuated for up to 3 months.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1534765611426790">
<title>Coming back home</title>
<p>Almost all participants described the excitement of returning to Mishmar-Haemek, or as they put it, “coming back home.” Ms. R described,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I don’t know why exactly, but we were the first group to come home, and we were very proud and happy about it. We were so glad. I can’t even describe the joy and the happiness . . . we started to run around the kibbutz like crazy, from one place to another, shouting and laughing. We were very curious to see what remained and what was destroyed . . . my parents’ house was destroyed and we moved to a different children’s house. My mother was still in Haifa with the youngest children, but all this didn’t affect our joy.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Along with the joy and happiness of coming home, the participants described the destruction:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>We came to the kibbutz and I was walking with M and we were both shocked. So many places were completely ruined, and there were tunnels all over the place. M, who had survived the Holocaust, was also shocked, although he had already seen the destructiveness of war . . .</p>
<p>There was a nice tree next to the dining hall and when we came back I saw that it had been destroyed.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Mr. A was the only participant who mentioned a change that occurred during the evacuation period:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>When we left Mishmar-Haemek, we were children. When we returned, we were mature . . . we stopped playing childish games and became more serious. We held many discussions and debates among ourselves on various topics related to the kibbutz, Zionism, and socialism.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Mr. A wrote a short story for one of his peers’ birthdays, 60 years later, titled, “Childhood Suddenly Truncated.”</p>
<p>He described visiting the empty Arab villages and feeling sad about what had happened to the people who used to live there, yet was convinced that the people of Mishmar-Haemek had to protect their home.</p>
<p>Overall, descriptions of the evacuation highlighted certain elements that can explain why the participants did not perceive this period as traumatic: (a) the children received a warm welcome from the hosting communities; (b) their significant others—the educators and peer group—stayed with them; (c) the educators were committed to the children’s needs; (d) the daily routine was maintained; (e) they could see what was going on in Mishmar-Haemek (besides the information they received from the educators); and (f) their pride in belonging to Mishmar-Haemek, in addition to the children’s deep trust in the significant others who represented the kibbutz, such as the educators, as well as trust in the peer group, which represented the most significant structure in the collective education. It seems that a combination of these elements formed their resilience, enabling them to cope with the war experience.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section18-1534765611426790">
<title>Talking Versus Action: Working Through the Traumatic Event</title>
<p>Nearly all the participants mentioned the means through which the adults helped the children work through the war. However, they were divided in how they accepted those means. All participants mentioned that besides the information and daily routine immediately following the evacuation and after the aerial bombing, there were no further discussions about the emotional impact of these traumatic experiences. Ms. Na and Ms. Sh illustrate this in their stories:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>. . . the following morning, the kindergarten teacher told me that my sister had been killed in the bombing, that she was dead, and that was all . . . I didn’t really understood what it meant to be dead, but I felt very special, unique . . . my parents didn’t talk about it either . . . My sister had a special box of children’s jewelry, and when she was alive, I wasn’t allowed to touch it. One day, I don’t remember exactly how long afterward, my mother gave me the box to play with. But they never mentioned Y again . . . The only time was when my first daughter was born. My father came to the hospital. It was a very rainy day and he was all wet and asked me to name the baby after Y. I agreed, but we didn’t discuss it further. (Ms. Na)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Ms. Na did not accept the silence: “I think we had repressed all our emotions and it is so deep that we can’t even touch it. I don’t know how, but I am sure that it has impacted all of us who went through the war.”</p>
<p>Ms. S, who was lived in the group from which the children were killed, also referred to the silence but with less criticism of the adults:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>We were told that Y, E, and A were killed. E had some physical problems; her legs were paralyzed and I used to take care of her. When I heard that she had been killed, I felt somewhat guilty for not being able to defend her, but I didn’t talk about it and no one talked to me or to any of our group about it. We returned to our regular activities as if nothing had happened. We just moved somewhere else, since our children’s house was ruined . . . about a month later, the father of a child in our group brought us a beautiful plant and we put it in the classroom. A few day later, our teacher and <italic>metapelet</italic>, who was a very special woman, by the way, and we adored her, told us that we would go to the cemetery and put the plant by our friends’ graves. They didn’t explain anything. I wouldn’t agree and said that the plant belonged in our classroom. No one explained why it was important to take it to the graveyard . . . I was a very mischievous girl and enjoyed horseback riding. Since I rode very well and knew how to handle the horses, the person responsible for the stables let me take the horse and I rode to the cemetery. I found the plant and it was dry. I don’t know how I climbed back on the horse with the plant, but I brought it back . . . in the evening when we were going to sleep, the <italic>metapelet</italic> asked who had brought the plant back, and I said that it was me. No one said anything, but I felt that I had done something wrong. I didn’t know what; it was just a feeling. . . . 30 years later, I wrote a children’s story about it, which was published in Mishmar Leyeladim [an Israeli journal for children] and I gave the story to my mother and to the woman who had been our <italic>metapelet</italic>. They said that they couldn’t understand how they had left me like this . . . I guess they weren’t aware of other ways and thought that returning to the routine was the best way to deal with all these difficult events . . . As an adult, I lived for many years on a kibbutz below the Golan Heights, where we spent a lot of time in bomb shelters. As I was an educator, I stayed with my group and when I started to inform the children about what was happening, other educators said that I would frighten them. I guess they also wanted to protect the children and thought that their silence would help, but from my own experience, I knew that this was a mistake.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>However, most participants supported the Mishmar-Haemek adults’ decision to return to the routine without repeatedly discussing the war, such as Ms. Ni and Mr. E:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>. . . they [the educators and parents] didn’t discuss the war with us, or about the children who were killed, and we very quickly returned to normal life and I think that was right. I don’t like this “excessive talking,” to allow people to overcome loss or trauma . . . even if they try to return to normal, they are pushed back into the traumatic event by the media or a psychologist or the society’s demands. I saw it with my mom, after my brother was killed in the Six Day War [in 1967]. She never went to the theater or other ceremonies, as she was afraid of what other people would say . . .</p>
<p>. . . we didn’t have any formal discussion about the impact of the war and immediately returned to normal activities. The adults tried to protect us from the difficult memories and they were right. Returning to routine was the best way to recover. As far as I know, none of the children suffered from post traumatic difficulties . . . the times that we talked about it were on Memorial Days and in later years, at reunions.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The dichotomy between talking and silence characterized most participants’ descriptions. Some totally accepted their parents’ and educators’ “silent” behavior, whereas others criticized. However, the criticism was without blame, justifying the behavior by explaining the limited knowledge of traumatic events in those days, and the adults’ desire to protect them from “bad things.” Yet the attack and the bombing were central to the collective heroic narrative of Mishmar-Haemek.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1534765611426790">
<title>Living With the Collective Myth</title>
<p>As the participants described, the victory of Mishmar-Haemek became part of the collective narrative: “. . . our teacher used to read to us from the book written by K [member of Mishmar-Haemek]: “The Battle of Mishmar Haemek.” The all felt the importance of memorializing the event. As Mr. R said, “A community needs to memorialize such an event. The members were fighting for their home and they weren’t soldiers! This should be remembered.”</p>
<p>Ms. I added,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I think we should give more attention to the event. It is mentioned only twice a year, at the anniversary of the attack and on Remembrance Day.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1534765611426790">4</xref></sup> Only in recent years did we start to mention the bombing as part of the Hannukah activities. It’s not enough. Imagine civilian men and women protecting their home . . .</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Almost all the participants highlighted the relationship with their Arab neighbors before and after the attack. Mr. A said,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>The children from Abu-Shoosha used to come and play with us and use the sport equipment. Many women and children came to our medical clinic, as they had neither sport equipment nor medical services. We used to visit their villages and they came to us. The kibbutz members believed in coexistence . . . and continued to believe in it after the war.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Thus, the heroic story is reinforced by the sense of justice. The kibbutz members supplied some of their Arab neighbors’ needs, attempting to create coexistence, but the neighbors attacked nevertheless. What is more, they continued to believe in coexistence even after the attack.</p>
<p>All the participants said that they were not traumatized by the war. Some said that the victory, the members’ heroic behavior, and the heroic myth might have helped them cope with the traumatic event. Most felt unharmed by the war experience and some even indicated that it strengthened them in other situations in later life. Ms. R said,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we had to be in bomb shelters on many occasions since that war. In 1967 and 1973, when I was a young mother and <italic>metapelet</italic> and A [her husband] was recruited, I felt experienced enough to deal with the situation. Two years ago, during the Second Lebanon War, I was in the shelter with my daughter-in-law and my grandchildren and I was able to calm them. I’ve done it before. . . . You know, even at my brother’s funeral [killed during his army service], it all felt very familiar. Although we did not attend the funeral of the kids who were killed, I saw the adults walking through the tree-lined walk on their way to the cemetery.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Mr. Sh said,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know whether it has anything to do with that war or not, but I have been working with widows and orphans of Paratrooper soldiers who were killed during wars or army service. I feel obliged to do this for many reasons.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mr. Sh was not sure whether this volunteer work was directly affected by his childhood war experience or by his sense of obligation to two of his good friends who were killed. However, he chose to raise this issue when he telling the story of the battle of Mishmar Haemek.</p>
<p>Only Mr. E mentioned an ongoing sense of fear since the bombing:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>. . . whenever we were attacked from the air by plane or missiles in subsequent wars, I would never stay inside the house. When I was called up to fight as a reservist, I looked for natural cover and during the First Gulf War,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1534765611426790">5</xref></sup> I didn’t stay in the sealed room. But apart from war situations, my childhood experience of the attack doesn’t have an impact on me. I also don’t perceive it as the most meaningful experience in my childhood, as some of my friends do.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In sum, based on the participants’ descriptions, we can conclude that the attack on Mishmar-Haemek resonates throughout their life. However, this is not manifest in the traumatic aspects of the experience, but in the aspects transmitted through the collective myth, including commitment to the kibbutz, belief in the right to build a home in Israel and readiness to fight for this belief.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings of this research support studies showing that the majority of the population exposed to potential traumatic events does not develop posttraumatic symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534765611426790">Bonnano, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534765611426790">Norris, 1992</xref>); and if some PTS symptoms are developed, they tend to be very low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534765611426790">Dekel &amp; Nuttman-Shwartz, 2009</xref>). The present study contradicts other studies, which found different levels of traumatic symptoms among children exposed to war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534765611426790">Belsky, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765611426790">Garbarino et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534765611426790">Jensen, 1996</xref>; Macksound, 1992). These differences can be explained by the following reasons:</p>
<list id="list2-1534765611426790" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Most studies regarding children and teenagers exposed to war were conducted during or immediately after the war, while the participants were still children or teenagers, and not 60 years on. It is possible that the outcomes of the war and its heroic myth affected the construction of the memory.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The participants in this study claimed that they experienced almost no trauma<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1534765611426790">6</xref></sup> as a result of the war along the life cycle. Most research on the impact of war along life cycle focused on Holocaust survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534765611426790">Buhl-Nielsen, 2004</xref>). However, the war situation in Mishmar-Haemek was completely different than the Holocaust. The children did not lose family members; did not suffer from hunger, cold, and humiliation; and were protected by their significant others; and the war lasted a relatively short time.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The study context is unique. The structure of the community and the way the educational system operated cannot be found anywhere else in the world, not even on present-day kibbutzim. Yet, a unique context can sometimes highlight certain elements of a specific phenomenon, such as exposure to war in childhood.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Thus, the findings of the present study may shed light on the way the experience of war is constructed along the life cycle. The main finding of this study was that the war experience in childhood remained meaningful throughout the participants’ lives, even though they did not describe or define it as a traumatic experience. Based on this finding, it is interesting to understand how the war experience did not result in traumatic symptoms or even traumatic memories. Three main elements connected to the ability to cope can be identified in the narrative construction:</p>
<list id="list3-1534765611426790" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>The sense of trust in the significant others</italic>: The findings showed that the participants’ narratives included descriptions in which they directly and indirectly expressed deep trust in educators and other adults in the community. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534765611426790">Klein (1946)</xref> explained that higher traumatic stress among children evacuated from London during the Second War world, compared with those who remained in London during the Blitz, was due to parental absence. As seen in our study, the presence of significant others, not necessarily the parents,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1534765611426790">7</xref></sup> can suffice if they are attuned to the children, as experienced by most participants. One potential outcome of war is that the difficult circumstances may go beyond the capacities of parents or significant others, rendering them psychologically unavailable as a resource of social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534765611426790">Garbarino &amp; Kostelny, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765611426790">Garbarino et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534765611426790">Osofsky, 1997</xref>). It is possible that significant others’ supportive behavior conveyed the sense of a functioning social community and the sense of no danger of losing such a fundamental resource, especially in a community such as a kibbutz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765611426790">Hobfoll, 2001</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Creating routine</italic>: All the participants’ descriptions included the daily routine created for them immediately after the evacuation and after the bombing of the children’s house. They mentioned that neither the parents nor the educators discussed the events with them. Although some criticized the adults’ behavior, most justified it, stating that they lacked awareness of the importance of talking as a method of working through painful events, stressing that the adults believed that returning to the routine was in the children’s best interest. Most participants accepted this attitude. The role of routine as an empowering coping tool could be explained by various approaches and theories that deal with health and stress. Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534765611426790">Klein (1946)</xref>, it is possible to assume that the “routine” might represent the “whole object” that was not destroyed, in spite of the external and internal aggressiveness. Furthermore, the routine symbolized the ability to contain the aggressiveness without being afraid of it. Based on specific studies of the impact of war on children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765611426790">Garbarino et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534765611426790">Garbarino &amp; Kostelny, 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534765611426790">Osofsky, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1534765611426790">Shamai &amp; Kimhi, 2006</xref>), organizing a routine also conveys to the children that the adults are still dependable figures and able to offer support, even if partially damaged. Another explanation of the impact of the routine is based on the conservation of resources theory (COR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765611426790">Hobfoll, 2001</xref>). The ability to create routine is proof of preservation of resources, in spite of the stressful situation, therefore preventing escalation of stress. Thus, the creation of a partial routine, although different from usual, can reduce some of the chaos resulting from war. In addition, some routine activities, such as playing, painting, and so forth, might help the children to activate and work through some of the traumatic experiences.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Strengthen collective memory and rituals</italic>: All participants said that the collective memory and rituals might have affected the way they constructed their narrative. The collective memory has been activated through collective rituals on the kibbutz, and nearly all participants perceived this as strengthening both the individual and collective experience. These rituals also provide an opportunity for expressing their respect for the kibbutz members who fought for their home and for the people from the Palmach who came to help them. Sociologists and anthropologists often perceive collective memory as a way to view ritualization and commemoration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1534765611426790">Wilson, 2005</xref>). Collective rituals were found to be useful in the process of working through a collective traumatic event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534765611426790">Bohleber, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534765611426790">Paez, Basabe, Ubillos, &amp; Gonzales-Castro, 2007</xref>). Thus, creating opportunity for collective commemoration, which might include small groups, such as families, peers, classmates, and so on, or larger groups, such as school or community, might be useful for children and teenagers in the process of coping with the trauma. It is important to organize specific rituals for children, using specific, child-friendly means, such as arts and crafts, and stories.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Collective memory and rituals are often connected with the set of beliefs regarding the specific war. As children and teenagers are part of society, they might be exposed to these beliefs. These issues should, therefore, be discussed in an understandable and bearable manner. One challenge is how to go about this without increasing aggression, which immediately increases anxiety and detracts from the healing process.</p>
<p>In sum, besides the limitations of this study, which relate mainly to the uniqueness of the study context, we can conclude that specific activities within communities that experience traumatic events might be helpful in overcoming traumatic stress of children and teenagers. Thus, mental health professional may channel their interventions into searching for and/or creating significant others for the children, developing some type of routine and if possible within the natural social group of the children and teenagers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1534765611426790">Weiss &amp; Shilkret, 2010</xref>), and using collective commemoration rituals. Although the experience might still be remembered as traumatic, it will include elements of hope of overcoming the trauma.</p>
