<abstract>
<p>Discursive psychology is used to study the gendering of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in UK national newspapers in the period of 2009–2011. The analysis examines how gendering is embedded in causal attributions and identity constructions. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is portrayed as a predominantly male phenomenon with representations of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder being gendered through extreme stories about victims, villains or heroes that depict boys and men as marginalised, exceptional or dangerous. There is also a focus on mothers as the spokespersons and caretakers for parenting and family health while fathers are rendered more invisible. This contributes to our understanding of how attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is constructed in the media using a range of gendered representations that draw on cultural stereotypes familiar in Western societies.</p>

<p>The history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is contentious and since 1900, the behaviours included in a diagnosis of ADHD have been described using more than 20 different labels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105312456326">Mayes and Rafalovich, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1359105312456326">Singh (2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1359105312456326">2002b</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312456326">Conrad and Potter (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105312456326">Mayes and Rafalovich (2007)</xref> have each suggested that socio-cultural representations of ADHD were developed alongside the development of scientific and medical diagnostic categories, and these social processes in turn feed into the process of identifying and diagnosing ADHD. In their discussion of the social processes that drive the expansion of medical categories such as ADHD, the label of ADHD was arrived at through incremental changes to <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (DSM) over several decades. DSM-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105312456326">American Psychiatric Association (APA), 1968</xref>) included a childhood disorder labelled ‘hyperkinetic reaction’, and DSM-III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105312456326">APA, 1980</xref>) divided sub-types of attention deficit disorder (ADD) into ‘with hyperactivity’ and ‘without hyperactivity’, the latter being associated with inattentiveness and deemed less serious. DSM-III-Revised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312456326">APA, 1987</xref>) used ADHD to describe children who were hyperactive and impulsive but not inattentive. DSM-IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105312456326">APA, 1994</xref>) expanded the clinical diagnosis of ADHD to specifically include adults, providing for symptoms and dysfunction in settings other than school. In Europe, the label ‘hyperkinetic syndrome’ has more often been used and is defined in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1359105312456326">World Health Organization (WHO) (1994)</xref>; however, both DSM-IV and ICD describe similar symptoms of impulsivity, hyperactivity and inattention.</p>
<p>The clinical diagnosis of ADHD varies globally with a variation in prevalence rates in the United Kingdom between 0.5 per cent–26 per cent and 2 per cent–18 per cent in the United States (UK, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105312456326">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2009</xref>: 514). The UK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105312456326">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (2009</xref>: 28) reports a global average of prevalence studies at 5.3 per cent with the incidence of children receiving medication for ADHD rising from 0.5 per 1000 children in the late 1970s to more than 3 per 1000 in the late 1990s. They report a dramatic increase in global averages in the consumption of psycho-stimulant medication between 1999 and 2003, arguing that such variations in global prevalence and stimulant drug prescription suggest that there are socio-cultural influences on the definition, diagnosis and treatment of ADHD worldwide.</p>
<sec id="section1-1359105312456326">
<title>ADHD and gender</title>
<p>A significant aspect of ADHD has been the recurring finding of gender bias in the incidence of ADHD showing that boys with ADHD outnumber girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105312456326">Laufer and Denhoff, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105312456326">Lloyd and Norris, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105312456326">Ohan and Visser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1359105312456326">Still, 1902</xref>). Some have noted that girls are less likely to receive ADHD services than boys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1359105312456326">Swanson et al., 1998</xref>). This, it is argued, could be partly explained by a ‘disruptive hypothesis’ because boys with ADHD are more disruptive than girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105312456326">Ohan and Visser, 2009</xref>), and more boys have the impulsive–hyperactive sub-type of ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359105312456326">Quinn, 2005</xref>), which DSM-III identified as more serious. This type of ADHD was argued to be more noticeable to teachers who refer more boys than girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359105312456326">Quinn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1359105312456326">Sciutto et al., 2004</xref>). This gendered symptomology and referral bias lend support to Conrad’s sociological argument that ADHD diagnostic labels and medication may be used as a form of ‘social control’ for deviance and the unruly behaviour of boys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105312456326">Conrad, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>This relationship between ADHD and gender is an important and complex phenomenon. The bias towards a focus on boys is coupled with a bias towards ‘mother blame’ in relation to children with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105312456326">Blum, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105312456326">Malacrida, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105312456326">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105312456326">2004</xref>). A focus on mothers is a persistent feature underpinning much research on ADHD and also clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105312456326">Malacrida, 2002</xref>). Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105312456326">Blum (2007</xref>: 202) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105312456326">Malacrida (2002)</xref> have observed how mothers are held responsible for the health of children, families and nations, and Blum links this to a ‘mother/valor – mother/blame binary’ that is entrenched in Western culture. Malacrida argues that motherhood has become the site of medical, social and educational interventions that are designed to regulate mothering. An increased range of childhood and family problems has been defined as risk and brought into the domain of expert intervention, and it is mothers who are held increasingly accountable for obtaining the right kind of expert help and guidance for their children and putting it into practice. As Malacrida puts it, ‘the medicalized child becomes a mirrored surface on which the medical/professional gaze is reflected, creating maternal guilt by association’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105312456326">Malacrida, 2002</xref>: 367). Links between mothering and ADHD date back as far as the 1950s, when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105312456326">Laufer and Denhoff (1957</xref>: 464) recommended Freudian psychotherapy for childhood neuroses and ‘mother issues’. The legacy of psychodynamic and behaviourist approaches in this early research led to the closeness of the mother–child relationship being placed under medical scrutiny. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1359105312456326">Singh (2002b)</xref> since argued that brain explanations have now replaced psychodynamic explanations and early behaviourist theories that depicted problem boys as the victims of ‘toxic motherhood’, but she claims that the link between ‘a problem boy and his problematic mother’ remains entrenched in the public imagination (p. 579). Singh argues that the pathologising of motherhood has laid the groundwork for pressure on families to accept medication to manage unruly boys.</p>

<title>ADHD in the media</title>
<p>The debate on ADHD has polarised around biomedical and psychosocial explanations that mirror the nature–nurture debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1359105312456326">Singh, 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1359105312456326">2002b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1359105312456326">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1359105312456326">2004</xref>). In the United Kingdom, biological and psychosocial explanations were recently brought together in an official report describing ADHD as the result of a complex interaction between genes and environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105312456326">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2009</xref>). However, polarised arguments are still common in the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105312456326">Horton-Salway, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>ADHD has been the topic of media debate for a number of decades. A large body of research demonstrates how public understanding of disability and illness is influenced by media representations and can have social consequences (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105312456326">Allen and Nairn, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105312456326">Auslander and Gold, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105312456326">Jones and Harwood, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359105312456326">Phillips, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105312456326">Philo, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312456326">Pointon and Davies, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1359105312456326">Shakespeare, 1994</xref>). A smaller number of studies have described how ADHD has been represented in the media. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105312456326">Lloyd and Norris (1999</xref>: 506) described the role of the UK press in providing information to parents and professionals, and contributing to the ADHD debate. Similarly, the debate on ADHD and drug treatment has been fuelled by the US media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1359105312456326">Rafalovich, 2004</xref>: 1) and by parenting guides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1359105312456326">Rafalovich, 2001</xref>), while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1359105312456326">Ray and Hinnant (2009</xref>: 1) observed how ADHD was transformed into ‘a cultural phenomenon’ in the United States by normalising Ritalin medication or by stigmatising unruly children with ADHD as a danger to others. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105312456326">Clarke (2011)</xref> described media portrayal of risks associated with ADHD, and media coverage in the United States led to cultural scepticism about the medical category of ADHD according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105312456326">Englandkennedy (2008)</xref>, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1359105312456326">Schmitz et al. (2003)</xref> found that media representations of ADHD were typically combined with a medicalised solution. Three studies have also indicated that there may be a consistently gendered focus in the media that mirrors the clinical bias in those cultures towards the referral, diagnosis and medication of boys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105312456326">Horton-Salway, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1359105312456326">Schmitz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1359105312456326">Singh, 2002b</xref>). In the United Kingdom, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105312456326">Lloyd and Norris (1999</xref>: 508) linked the rise in prescription of Ritalin since the 1990s with school referrals that attract extra classroom funding. They identified UK parents’ organisations campaigning in the press to promote biological explanations and medicalised solutions for behavioural problems, although a more recent study of the UK national newspapers indicated greater emphasis on psychosocial representations of ADHD with more emphasis placed on better parenting solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105312456326">Horton-Salway, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The gendered nature of ADHD has thus been apparent for decades in the research literature that identifies more boys than girls with ADHD and through a gender divide in symptoms and referrals. However, there are few studies that focus on how ADHD is gendered and how that links to the socio-cultural influences that underpin ADHD as a category. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1359105312456326">Singh’s (2002a)</xref> study of how mothers and sons have been linked together in media representations about ADHD in US magazines is one notable exception.</p>
<p>The analysis given in the following examines how ADHD was gendered in UK national newspapers between March 2009 and March 2011. The aim of the analysis is to examine the discourse of stories about ADHD, identifying what kinds of gender categories are used and how these are related to attributions of cause and blame.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1359105312456326" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The method is qualitative, applying discursive psychology (DP) to extracts of media stories. The focus is UK national newspapers between the years 2009 and 2011 that was the most recent at the time of the data collection and produced a manageable amount of data for this type of DP analysis. The study follows a similar methodological rationale to a previous study of repertoires of ADHD in UK newspapers between 2000 and 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105312456326">Horton-Salway, 2011</xref>). The current study develops this area of study into a greater focus on the discourse of gender and ADHD.</p>
<p>A search of Nexis UK covered the period March 2009 and March 2011 using key term ‘ADHD’ with more than three references to ADHD in the article. Other terms such as ‘ADD’ and ‘hyperactivity’ produced repeat articles. The initial search identified 162 articles with 44 articles selected for further analysis after identifying gender-relevant stories using terms such as boy, girl, mother, father, son and daughter. A limitation was that more subtle forms of gendering in discourse could be missed using gendered search terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1359105312456326">Sheriff and Weatherall, 2009</xref>). Forty-four articles identified by gender-relevant search terms were analysed in detail to categorise different types of stories and representation. This was narrowed down to 10 extracts presented in the following that are used to show the main types of gendering that were identified in this sample. DP was applied to analyse how representations were constructed and their performative function. DP is based on the premise that discourse is a form of social action and draws on the principles of the ‘Discursive Action Model’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105312456326">Edwards and Potter, 1992</xref>: 154–155). This is concerned with how reports are constructed as factual, and how they are organised as explanations, reportings, blamings or defences. The main topics of interest for DP here are social psychological phenomena such as cultural categories, social identities and attributions, and these are treated as discursive rather than cognitive phenomena. The aim of the analysis is to show how these social psychological phenomena are actively constituted through discourse. When versions of social reality are produced in discourse, this entails the construction of socio-cultural categories and the juxtaposition of causal relations and social identities. DP therefore treats cultural categories, attributions and social identities as the discursive nuts and bolts of different versions of social reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105312456326">Edwards, 1997</xref>). It is assumed that accounts and descriptions are organised rhetorically to construct arguments such that versioned descriptions are positioned against counter representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105312456326">Billig, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105312456326">1991</xref>). For these reasons, there is an analytic focus on how representations of ADHD are built; what kinds of discursive resources are used to version accounts and what social actions are accomplished by these representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359105312456326">Potter, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The following analysis is organised in two main areas to show how the category of ADHD is produced in media reports alongside the social psychological phenomena of attributions and gendered social identities: Two related issues are explored: (1) How attributions of cause or accountability are constructed in newspaper stories about ADHD and how gendered social identities are implicated in that process to support attributions of cause, blame or accountability. (2) How representations of ADHD and gender identities are co-produced and thereby contribute to the production and re-production of ADHD as a debated cultural phenomenon that depends on gender stereotypes.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<sec id="section5-1359105312456326">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>In total, 162 articles were identified by the search term ADHD in UK national newspapers (2009–2011). Only 27 per cent (44 extracts) were gendered, and 20 per cent (10 extracts) were used for a detailed analysis of the dominant gender representations given in the following. For practical purposes, the 10 extracts focus only on aspects of the stories that referred in some way to gender.</p>
<p>In all, 25 (56%) articles referred to males with ADHD (18 boys and 7 men) compared with 4 (9%) articles that referred to females with ADHD (3 women and 1 girl) and 3 (7%) articles referred to fathers of children with ADHD, while 12 (27%) articles focussed on mothers of children with ADHD. However, 9 (20%) of the articles that referred to sons also referred to mothers; therefore, it is more meaningful to say that a total of 21 (48%) articles on children with ADHD referred to mothers compared with only 3 (7%) articles referring to fathers.</p>
<p>First, the dominant gender representations given in the following demonstrate how mothers and fathers are implicated differently in attributional stories about ADHD; second, how boys and men are represented as victims, villains and heroes; third, how girls and women with ADHD are rarely represented. The analysis considers how socio-cultural stereotyping and the construction of ADHD are linked together and co-produced to support rhetorical positions in discourse.</p>

<sec id="section6-1359105312456326">
<title>ADHD and genes: fathers and sons</title>
<p>Gene research is a common theme in newspaper stories on ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105312456326">Horton-Salway, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1359105312456326">Schmitz et al., 2003</xref>). In the period 2009–2011, several articles in the UK national newspapers reported a research study published in the <italic>Lancet</italic> in 2010 that gave rise to much debate about the genetic versus environmental causes of ADHD. Both Extracts 1 and 2 show how attributions of the causes of ADHD and gendered identities were co-constructed in stories about genetic inheritance:
<disp-quote>
<p>Extract 1:</p>
<p>It’s not my fault, Sir, it’s in my genes …</p>
<p>… We are now being asked to believe, thanks to a study in <italic>The Lancet</italic>, that children who are disobedient and defiant, who rush around and scream and break things, are primarily the victims of their genetic inheritance. […] The tragedy of yesterday’s report is that the rumour of a genetic causation of inattention will spread through the population, and let it off the hook as far as its own responsibility is concerned. It wasn’t Johnny who didn’t do his homework; it was his genes. (<italic>The Daily Telegraph</italic> (London) October 1, 2010 Friday Edition 2; National Edition)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The story represented by Extract 1 describes a research study as misleading. The phrase, ‘we are now being asked to believe’ advises scepticism about the latest findings of research linking ADHD and genes. This is partly accomplished through a normalising description of ‘children who are disobedient and defiant’ using a three-part list of behaviours that are recognisable as characteristics of an ordinary naughty child, ‘rush around and scream and break things’. The discursive function of three-part lists is to construct individually listed items as part of a more general set that defines an inclusive category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105312456326">Jefferson, 1990</xref>). Such lists are common in everyday discourse and perform social actions such as constructing the list of typical behaviours that are characteristic of a naughty child. Here, the social identity and the behaviours that define it are co-produced in the description. The identity construction of normal child is used as a critique of genetic explanations for ADHD, referred to in Extract 1 as the ‘rumour of genetic causation’. This term ‘rumour’ works to downgrade the research by mocking hypothetical parents who are likely to be easily influenced to use ADHD to make excuses for boys’ behaviour. Such parents are represented as a category of pretenders who jump on the bandwagon, adopting ADHD as a medical explanation to avoid taking the blame. Bandwagon arguments function in discourse both to discredit false claims and also to produce categories as true and factual by juxtaposition to the bandwagon. Such arguments are a common feature of the discourse in debates about controversial conditions such as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105312456326">Horton-Salway, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Although much of the news report given earlier is written in ‘gender-neutral’ language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1359105312456326">Sheriff and Weatherall, 2009</xref>), referring elsewhere in the article to ‘children’ rather than boys, it is the single reference to ‘Johnny’ that suggests to the reader that the ‘children’ whose parents might latch on to ADHD should be heard as ‘boys’, and that their naughty behaviour should be treated as ordinary rather than ADHD. The illocutionary force of this argument is rooted in a shared cultural assumption that naughtiness is ordinary behaviour for children and characteristic of boys. The upshot of the story is to promote public scepticism about the possible influence of the research in encouraging ‘the population’ to jump on the bandwagon of genetic explanations as an excuse for the naughty behaviour of boys, and by implication, their poor parenting.</p>

<p>Over the past week more battles have been raging over attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), after a paper published by a group of Cardiff researchers found evidence for a genetic association with the condition. […] More interesting were the moral and cultural interpretations heaped on to this finding, not least by the authors. ‘Now we can say with confidence that ADHD is a genetic disease and that the brains of children with this condition develop differently to those of other children’, said Professor Anita Thapar. ‘We hope that these findings will help overcome the stigma associated with ADHD’. Does the belief that such problems have a biological cause really help to reduce stigma? […] Jo Phelan, in her paper ‘Genetic bases of mental illness – a cure for stigma?’, said that a story about genetic causes may lead to people being conceived of as ‘defective’ or ‘physically distinct’. It can create an associative stigma for the whole family, who receive labels such as ‘at risk’ or ‘carrier’. […] Perhaps it will go further: your children will experience an anticipatory stigma. Do they have this condition, like their father? ‘It’s genetic you know’. (<italic>The Guardian</italic> (London) – Final Edition October 9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Extract 2 describes a different consequence arising from the same research findings that are condemned as ‘Bad science’ in the title. The story does not describe the research findings in any detail but gives the gist, trading more on an argument put forward by the researchers about the possible ‘moral and cultural interpretations’ of the findings. In fact, the article itself does not use the term stigma and makes a modest one line statement to the effect that ‘the findings allow us to refute the hypothesis that ADHD is purely a social construct which has important clinical and social implications for affected children and their families’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1359105312456326">Williams et al., 2010</xref>). However, the critique foregrounds the moral and social consequences of the research in order to set up a critique based on a list of other research studies. This highlights a link between genetic explanations of mental illness and social stigma found by the previous research exemplified by the reference to Phelan’s research in the extract here. This example refers to the risk of ‘anticipatory stigma’, which means that the research could actually lead to stigma rather than avoid it.</p>
<p>An interesting aspect of Extracts 1 and 2 is the practical necessity for science findings to be simplified for the purposes of a media report or indeed for any other publication that describes it, including this one. However, the arguments in the two articles in Extracts 1 and 2 given earlier do not cover the findings of the original research in any detail at all. On the contrary, in Extract 2, the argument about the social implications of the research is appropriated to enable a cautionary comment to the public to warn them against the implications of research on genetic inheritance. It is interesting that since the media backlash following the publication of the Cardiff research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105312456326">Gonon et al. (2011)</xref> have published a critical analysis of how neuroscience data on ADHD are frequently represented in the media through summaries and abstracts that are sometimes oversimplified and misleading than the articles themselves. However, the articles represented by the two extracts given earlier showed little evidence of summarising the findings of the research itself, instead focussing on an angle that could be worked up into a moral panic.</p>
<p>But what does this have to do with gendering ADHD? It is apparent that the terms used in the media story in Extract 2, ‘children’ and ‘whole family’, do initially imply a ‘gender-neutral’ stance, which suggests that any ‘anticipatory stigma’ would be shared between the genders. However, it is ultimately the father who is identified as the gene carrier by the rhetorical question, ‘Do they have this condition, like their father?’ Paradoxically, the report in Extract 2 works to set up an anticipation of a naive public reaction of ‘anticipatory stigma’, but in doing this, it actively produces an oversimplified, popularised and gendered view of the relationship between ADHD and genes, making this available in public discourse. This has the effect of re-producing ADHD as a male phenomenon by implication, foregrounding boys as the natural recipients of inherited ADHD and fathers as passing it on.</p>

<title>ADHD and pregnancy risks: mothers</title>
<p>Media stories on ADHD regularly follow up research on pregnancy and risk factors for ADHD. Inevitably, the focus is on mothers and the stories give advice or caution pregnant women about the need to follow the advice provided by research findings that are presented uncritically in the stories given in the following as factual statements:
<disp-quote>
<p>Extract 3:</p>
<p>Drug peril to babies</p>
<p>Blood pressure drugs used in pregnancy may affect a baby’s development, experts warned last night. They examined 4,000 patient records and followed 202 children. […] They were also around four times more likely to have ADHD than children whose mothers had only been prescribed rest. <bold>(</bold><italic>The Sun</italic> (England) May 19, 2010 Wednesday Edition 1; Scotland)</p>
<p>Extract 4:</p>
<p>Smoking is linked to hyperactive children</p>
<p>Mothers who smoke during pregnancy more than double the chances of having hyperactive children, researchers claim. It estimates that one-fifth of ADHD – attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder – cases could be eliminated if pregnant women stopped smoking. (<italic>Daily Mail</italic> (London) November 23, 2009 Monday)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Extracts 3 and 4 represent events in pregnancy as risk factors for ADHD in children. Extract 3 refers to the risk of pregnant mothers taking blood pressure medication. This is not overtly mother blame since prescription depends on medical diagnosis so mothers could be seen as victims. However, the story does suggest rest as a viable alternative to medical treatment so this makes mothers more accountable for avoiding illness during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Extract 4 makes statistical links between ADHD and maternal smoking. Although this extract implicates smoking as a risk factor, elsewhere, the story refers briefly to lead contamination. Maternal smoking is foregrounded through the title and the attribution of blame for ADHD to mothers who smoke. Research statistics are used here as a powerful validating device in combination with story headings that foreground only one aspect of risk factors. The attribution of cause and blame is co-implicated in accounts and descriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105312456326">Edwards and Potter, 1992</xref>), and here, the rhetorical message is clear, ‘cases could be eliminated if pregnant women stopped smoking’. The stories in both Extracts 3 and 4 have the effect of attributing the cause of ADHD to lifestyle and health issues that pregnant women could change if they followed medical advice. The attributions for ADHD are also gendering through ‘women-specific’ topics of staying healthy during pregnancy and the risks to the unborn child (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1359105312456326">Sunderland, 2006</xref>: 504).</p>
<p>In the previous extracts, while attributions of cause in ADHD are made in relation to both genders, the genetic explanation linked to fathers does not hold them morally accountable as agents in the same way as do the attributional stories of risk in pregnancy for mothers. For fathers, ADHD is determined through passing on genes, although the media stories in both Extracts 1 and 2 strongly criticise this research, while in the stories on ADHD and pregnancy, the research findings are uncritically presented as factual, making mothers accountable as agents through the discourse of risk management.</p>

<title>Identity constructions and ADHD</title>
<p>Only four stories represented females, three women and one girl. The women were adult celebrities narrating career and success stories despite ADHD or tongue-in-cheek accounts of busy lives resembling hyperactivity. These few female ‘adult hyperactives’ were self-diagnoses based on biographical re-interpretation (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312456326">Conrad and Potter, 2000</xref>). There is a hint of the ‘bandwagon’ about these self-diagnostic and tongue-in-cheek accounts. While one type describes ordinary busy-ness as hyperactivity to trivialise ADHD, the other kind is a self-report that could function in two ways. The examples of female adult celebrities with ADHD identified here were heroic stories of overcoming adversity, using ADHD to make sense of the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105312456326">Gergen, in Wetherell et al., 2001</xref>). However, ADHD can also be used by self-reported ‘adult hyperactives’ to account for past failures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312456326">Conrad and Potter, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>There was one exceptional example of a young girl with ADHD (<italic>The Times</italic> (London), 7 January 2010, <italic>‘</italic>Calm voices that turn unruly children into model pupils: Counsellors bring reason to troubled young lives’). This described a disruptive 8-year-old girl who was counselled rather than excluded or medicated. The girl’s behaviour ‘was so disruptive that her teacher was forced to clear the classroom to calm her down’, but after the counselling she is described as ‘happier, more attentive and making friends with her classmates’. The ‘before and after’ story here indicates how her ADHD was managed but the main upshot is the success story for a school counselling service. ‘Before and after’ structures in narrative storytelling are designed to position an intervening event or intervention as significant and pivotal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105312456326">Horton-Salway, 2001</xref>). Although the description of this girl’s behaviour is represented as extreme in the same way as some reports of boys with ADHD, the pivotal event (counselling) and the reported outcome (successful treatment without medication or exclusion) are in marked contrast to many stories of boys being excluded from school and demonised or medicated. In the following, further extracts represent ADHD mainly as a male phenomenon, populated with extreme formulations of social exclusion, or valourised and demonised identities.</p>

<sec id="section9-1359105312456326">
<title>Victims, villains and heroes</title>
<p>These examples show how dominant representations of boys and men are accomplished through identity constructions that describe them as victims, villains or heroes.</p>
<sec id="section10-1359105312456326">
<title>Victims</title>
<p>Victimhood is one representation of boys with ADHD in the media. These stories focus on educational and social exclusion and often take the form of reports by campaigning mothers (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105312456326">Lloyd and Norris, 1999</xref>). Extract 5 is an example of how accounts of boys with ADHD are paired with representations of mothers as the visible parent who speak for the family. Stories of victims are often descriptions of boys with learning difficulties relating to ADHD or boys with challenging behavioural problems who have been excluded from school:
<disp-quote>
<p>Extract 5:</p>
<p>Forced out of school because he has ADHD …</p>
<p>Exclusion from school is something every parent dreads. […] Dan was starting his second year at an exclusive independent boys’ school and he had behavioural problems. In fact, he had Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), although this had not been formally diagnosed at the time. We knew all along that there was more to his behaviour than simply being ‘bad’. The school chose to ignore this. They were, in my opinion, prepared to cast him aside simply to protect their position in the league tables. <bold>(</bold><italic>The Daily Telegraph</italic> (London) October 25, 2010 Monday Edition 1; National Edition)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The socially excluded, misunderstood or stigmatised boy with ADHD is one of the most common victim stories on ADHD reported in the media that confirm a finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105312456326">Lloyd and Norris (1999</xref>: 506) who noted coverage of ‘excluded’ children and ‘campaigning’ parents. Extract 5 describes a boy with ‘behavioural problems’ as a victim of injustice in contrast with the school as the callous and uncaring perpetrator who excluded him. The campaigning mother is the source of the report that is constructed using the device of progressively accomplished fact construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105312456326">Latour, 1987</xref>). The description of ‘behavioural problems’ is incrementally modified to ‘in fact he had ADHD’. The phrase ‘this had not been formally diagnosed at the time’ suggests that ADHD has since become a diagnostic fact. This is strengthened by an experiential claim, ‘we knew all along that his behaviour was more than just “bad”’. The term ‘we’ includes both parents whose credible status is supported by a retrospective formal diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359105312456326">Potter, 1996</xref>). The truth is established by incremental fact construction that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105312456326">Latour (1987)</xref> refers to as a hierarchy of modalisation made up of incrementally externalising statements. Claims based on internal and individual processes, such as thoughts and beliefs (‘we knew’), are transformed into objective facts through the construction of consensus and corroboration between the experience of the parents and medical opinion. The construction of the boy’s ‘victim’ identity is coupled with a description of the school’s disregard in excluding him despite his ADHD, ‘they chose to ignore this’. The upshot of the story is to construct a victim identity for the boy with ADHD, a valourised representation of the mother and a construction of the school as perpetrator of injustice and more concerned with competitive status than the welfare of a student with a disability.</p>
<p>Victimhood was one representation of boys with ADHD identified in the sample for this study; however, the previous research also identified dominant representations of ‘Dennis the Menace’ stereotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1359105312456326">Schmitz et al., 2003</xref>: 395) and stereotypical representations of ‘boisterous boys’ with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105312456326">Horton-Salway, 2011</xref>: 543).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1359105312456326">
<title>Villains</title>
<p>The following extracts show how men and boys with ADHD are demonised through extreme stories linking ADHD and serious crime:
<disp-quote>
<p>Extract 6:</p>
<p>Cab knife nut jailed</p>
<p>A thug got ten years’ jail yesterday for stabbing a cabbie over an £8 fare. […] ADHD sufferer […] was high on cocaine and booze during the 2007 attack. He denied wounding with intent but was found guilty in April. Dad-of-three David said: ‘He’s scum. One day he’ll kill someone’. (<italic>The Sun</italic> (England) August 8, 2009 Saturday Edition 1; National Edition.)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This story constructs the identity of man in relation to a violent crime. Although ADHD is not directly attributed as the cause of the attack, the phrase ‘an ADHD sufferer’ constructs an inferential link between ADHD, violent criminal behaviour and substance abuse. The social identity of the perpetrator is constructed through the choice of terms ‘nut’ implying a mental illness and ‘thug’ and ‘scum’, which place him in a recognisable social category associated with social problems such as violence and drugs. The link to mental illness in the title serves to reinforce the position that the man belongs to a social category that is associated with stigma and dangerousness.</p>
<p>The next example establishes a more credentialed link between ADHD and serious crime as a male phenomenon:
<disp-quote>
<p>Extract 7:</p>
<p>Half of all prisoners had ADHD as a child</p>
<p>A leading psychiatrist at Broadmoor has said that almost half the prison population could have avoided a life of crime if treated as children for the behavioural disorder ADHD. Susan Young […], best known for her work with Barry George, who was acquitted of the murder of television presenter Jill Dando, believes early diagnosis of the disorder could cut crime and save millions of pounds. Research carried out by Dr Young, who specialises in working with murderers at the high security Berkshire hospital where inmates include serial killer Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, reveals that up to 45 per cent of youth offenders and 30 per cent of adult criminals have the condition that causes hyperactivity or inattentiveness. […] (<italic>Sunday Express</italic> November 28, 2010 Edition 1; National Edition)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This story reports a scientific research study of prisoners and ADHD by ‘a leading psychiatrist’. The term ‘prisoners’ is ‘gender-neutral’, but the context of the research narrows the focus onto male prisoners in a high-security hospital, Broadmoor. This is a more subtle form of gendering that establishes a retrospective link between males, ADHD and a ‘life of crime’. The upshot of the story is that young boys with ADHD could grow up to become dangerous criminals such as serial killers. The threat of violence and criminal careers represented here links to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105312456326">Gibbs and Jobson (2011)</xref> refer to as a ‘global narrative of masculinity’, associated with crime and violence where men can be represented variably as both perpetrators and victims. In the previous extract, extreme cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359105312456326">Pomerantz, 1986</xref>) such as the serial killer are used to justify an assessment of boys with ADHD as a potential danger to society. The previous research has shown how media stories link ADHD and male sex crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1359105312456326">Ray and Hinnant, 2009</xref>), and the above-mentioned example contributes to a moral tale of risk avoidance if children with ADHD were to receive treatment. The need for improved public protection together with an appeal to financial reason to ‘cut crime and save millions of pounds’ is used as structuring devices common in many media stories that address public outrage and fear of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1359105312456326">Seale, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1359105312456326">
<title>Heroes</title>
<p>The ‘hero’ is another extreme identity, regularly constructed in media stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1359105312456326">Seale, 2003</xref>) and typically represented as male. Extracts 8–10 have in common a focus on men or boys with ADHD, who are described as successful role models, geniuses or superheroes:
<disp-quote>
<p>Extract 8:</p>
<p>Geniuses boosted by ADHD says prof</p>
<p>Many of the world’s geniuses were helped by having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, it will be claimed today. Prof Michael Fitzgerald believes that Picasso, Byron, James Dean and Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain all had it. Other famous sufferers include Che Guevara, Oscar Wilde, Mark Twain, Clark Gable and Jules Verne, according to the academic. (<italic>The Sun</italic> (England) February 4, 2010 Thursday Edition 1; National Edition)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The gender-neutral headline ‘Geniuses boosted by ADHD says prof’ makes an extravagant claim that ‘Many of the world’s geniuses’ have ADHD, and that ADHD contributed to their genius. This is attributed to a credible source and represents ADHD as a positive attribute linked to outstanding achievement. Although the term ‘genius’ is ‘gender-neutral’, the famous geniuses with ADHD are all male artists, writers, performers, actors and a political leader. This gallery of famous men is in sharp contrast to the representation of ‘deviant’ or ‘dangerous criminal’, but neither have much resemblance to mundane experience. They do however conform to dominant forms of masculinity identified in the previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105312456326">Kahn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105312456326">Kahn and Holmes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1359105312456326">Wetherell and Edley, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Extract 9, given in the following, is one of the few examples of fathers in stories on ADHD:
<disp-quote>
<p>Extract 9:</p>
<p>Ritalin tore my son and our family apart</p>
<p>From a best-selling children’s author, a damning indictment of the ADHD drug […] I hit on the idea of turning Percy Jackson into a story about Haley. So Percy has ADHD and dyslexia, but realises they are not a weakness, but signs of greatness – an indicator he is a demi-god. He struggles with words on the page because his mind is hard-wired for Ancient Greece and he needs to be hyper-alert to survive the battlefield. I wanted to show Haley – and the rest of the world – that dyslexia and ADHD are nothing to be ashamed of. (<italic>Daily Mail</italic> (London) February 1, 2011)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This story informs the reader that <italic>Percy Jackson</italic> was written to provide a positive role model for the author’s son and for other children with ADHD. The fictional character <italic>Percy Jackson</italic> is a superhero whose ADHD is ‘an indicator that he is a demi-god’. Although the fiction itself might also provide role models for girls, the press coverage here focuses on a male superhero describing symptoms of ADHD as an asset and the boy as ‘hard-wired’ for battle. This representation draws on a stereotype of inherited male traits for ‘hard-wired’ toughness.</p>
<p>Finally, Extract 10 is a hero representation that functions as a critique of medicalisation:
<disp-quote>
<p>Extract 10:</p>
<p>Did our greatest PM have ADHD?</p>
<p>ADHD makes kids quarrelsome, inattentive, impulsive and bloody rude, which is a pretty good description of young Winston. […] he got up the noses of everyone around him. ‘Very bad – is a constant trouble to everybody’, his headmaster thundered in one report. ‘He cannot be trusted to behave himself anywhere’. […] We know him as an indefatigable warrior but some of his toughest battles were in private, with his torments and depression. It was dealing with his demons that gave him the personal tools to become the extraordinary man who was voted the Greatest Briton. Yet today young Winston might be stuck at the back of the class in the naughty corner, dosed up to his eyeballs with Ritalin, on the one hand being told it’s not really his fault while on the other being largely ignored. That would have been a terrible mistake in Winston’s time and it would be a terrible mistake today. […] I often use the story of young Winston and his ADHD. I search out those kids lurking at the back of the class and remind them that they too can become great men and women, and even perhaps as great as Winston Churchill. (<italic>The Express</italic> October 2, 2010 Saturday Edition 1; National Edition)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Extract 10 describes Winston Churchill as displaying the typical behaviours of ADHD such as ‘quarrelsome, inattentive, impulsive and bloody rude’. By contrast, the adult Churchill is described as ‘an indefatigable warrior’ and ‘an extraordinary man who was voted the Greatest Briton’. The metaphor of the warrior echoes the aspirational role model described in Extract 9. Here, in Extract 10, a contrast structure allows for a transformation from problem child with ADHD to prime minister. Although this story suggests that ‘great men and women’ might be role models for children with ADHD, the description of Churchill is gendered. In contrast to accounts of ADHD villains used to promote the medication of young boys who might grow up to be criminals, the valourised representation of an ADHD hero in Extract 10 is rhetorically positioned against medication. A hypothetical image of a subdued young Winston, ‘stuck at the back of the class in the naughty corner, dosed up to his eyeballs with Ritalin’ is designed to support the argument that medicating naughty boys is likely to deprive society of its most successful male highflyers.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This snapshot of how ADHD and gender intersect in UK national newspapers over a 2-year period supports the previous observations that gendering is deeply embedded in media discourse on ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105312456326">Horton-Salway, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1359105312456326">Schmitz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1359105312456326">Singh, 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1359105312456326">2002b</xref>). Gender stereotypes were treated in this study as categories, constructed in discourse and co-dependent with versions of ADHD.</p>
<p>ADHD is represented as a predominantly male phenomenon with the focus on boys and men. However, stories referring to fathers are rare while stories representing mothers are more common (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1359105312456326">Sunderland, 2006</xref>). The focus on mothers exists in the media alongside a bias towards boys and men with ADHD rather than girls. This mirrors a similar gendered bias in the research literature and clinical practice and shows how the media debate draws on gendered cultural stereotypes common in Western societies. Mothers are more visible as parents who speak for the family while fathers are more frequently ‘back-grounded’ or rendered invisible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1359105312456326">Sunderland, 2006</xref>: 504). Mothers are subjected to moral regulation and implicated in blame for ADHD through stories that follow up research on ADHD and pregnancy risks, while stories implicating fathers in genetic aspects of ADHD do not have the same effect in making them accountable to moral or medical regulation. Apart from passing on genes for ADHD, the father’s role and influence are rendered more invisible. The relative absence of representations that depict fathers as parents is unlikely to reflect the experience of everyday lives, but nonetheless it denies fathers a voice and contributes to a stereotype of mothers as the responsible and accountable parent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105312456326">Blum, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1359105312456326">Singh, 2002a</xref>)</p>
<p>The gender bias is however reversed in the dominant representation of ADHD as a condition mainly affecting males. This supports the ‘disruptive hypothesis’ that identifies a perceptual focus on the behaviour of boys in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105312456326">Ohan and Visser, 2009</xref>). This is reproduced in the media as a focus on boys and men along with the idea that male social behaviour needs to be a site of moral and medical regulation. The issue of medicalisation is persistently linked to extreme negative representations of boys and men as disruptive, deviant or dangerous, and these demonising stereotypes link to a traditional dominant form of aggressive masculinity commonly depicted in the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105312456326">Kahn et al., 2011</xref>). The use of atypical examples such as these can bias the public imagination, stigmatising those who have ADHD and re-producing this as a masculine phenomenon (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105312456326">Dixon-Woods et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1359105312456326">Ray and Hinnant, 2009</xref>). Although such extreme examples are unlikely to mirror the lives of most ordinary families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105312456326">Dixon-Woods et al., 2003</xref>), the use of extreme cases produces stories that both valourise and demonise.</p>
<p>‘Heroes and villains’ and ‘safety and danger’ are two binary oppositions among others that are often used to construct newsworthy narratives that attract public attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1359105312456326">Seale, 2003</xref>: 518). ADHD ‘heroes and villains’ approximate to two commonly used discourses of masculinity, the ‘heroic’ and the ‘rebellious’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1359105312456326">Wetherell and Edley, 1999</xref>). A third representation identified by Wetherell and Edley is that of ‘ordinary’ masculinity, which is based on traditional masculinity and approximates to the depiction of ordinary naughty boys represented both in the above-mentioned study and also in the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105312456326">Horton-Salway, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1359105312456326">Schmitz et al., 2003</xref>). All three forms of masculinity, the superhero, the ordinary naughty boy and the disruptive or deviant male, are fluid social identity categories that are drawn on variably in media discourse about ADHD to construct different positions in the ADHD debate. Extreme polarised representations of ADHD are used to construct moral panics about public safety and the risks presented by dangerous adult males with ADHD, warning of the dire consequences of neglecting to medicate boys with ADHD. Alternatively, they warn of the social consequences and dangers of labelling and medicating naughty boys. Perhaps, the most worrying aspect of this is those stories that draw on scientific research to construct arguments that bear very little reference to the work accomplished by the science itself. The latest addition to the ADHD debate is the emerging category of the ‘adult hyperactive’, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312456326">Conrad and Potter (2000)</xref> trace to DSM-111R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312456326">APA, 1987</xref>). This relatively new category is clearly visible in the retrospective labelling of prison populations or in stories about men of outstanding achievement. Female ‘adult hyperactives’ are fewer and often based on self-referral and self-reports, suggesting that women are beginning to position themselves in relation to ADHD through retrospective ADHD biographies. Research has previously suggested that ADHD is a ‘hidden disorder’ in both girls and women, and that diagnosis itself needs to be more ‘gender-sensitive’ since more girls have the ‘inattentive’ type of ADHD and their symptoms can be confused with other mental conditions or do not emerge until puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359105312456326">Quinn, 2005</xref>: 579). Space is limited here, but further research on how ‘adult hyperactives’ are being constructed both in clinical settings and in the public sphere and how these are gendered would be instructive.</p>
<p>The forms of ADHD identity that are most commonly depicted in the media however describe boys and men and are limiting in the sense that they draw on more traditional or extreme forms of masculinity. Despite the inclusion of counter representations that have attempted to transform ADHD into an attribute of heroes and exceptional men rather than of deviance, criminality or victimhood, none of these are representative of ordinary experience. Diversity and complexity of male (and female) experience in ADHD are all too often neglected in favour of dominant extreme forms of masculinity (or femininity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105312456326">Kahn, 2009</xref>), and these forms are apparent and used variably in the media in the process of perpetuating the opposing arguments and positions in the ADHD debate.</p>
