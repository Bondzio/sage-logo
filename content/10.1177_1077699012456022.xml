<abstract>
<p>This research examines mass media depictions of major American natural disasters that occurred between 2000 and 2010. Results indicate that mass media cover natural disasters for shorter periods of time than they do other issues; that media coverage tends to focus on the current impact of disasters on humans, the built environment, and the natural environment; that disaster economics is an important topic; that disaster media coverage generally focuses on the state and region related to the event; and that disaster news is largely about what is happening now.</p>

<p>For the past several decades, news coverage of natural and manmade disasters has captured the American public’s attention more than any other issue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077699012456022">2</xref></sup> Given the scope of death, injury, and destruction resulting from major disasters such as the September 11 terrorist attacks, Hurricane Katrina, the Indian Ocean tsunami, the Great East Japan Earthquake, and the 2011 Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and Joplin, Missouri, tornadoes, it is not surprising that many Americans turn frequently to the mass media to gain information about catastrophic events that occur across the United States and around the world. When a disaster occurs, the role of the mass media is understood to include communicating whatever warning is available (if any), providing a description of what occurred, keeping the public informed post event, and even contributing to individual and community recovery and to community resilience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077699012456022">3</xref></sup> Considering the frequency with which the public turns to the media for information about disasters, the potential impact of disasters on individuals and communities, and the normative role of the mass media in keeping the public informed, ongoing study is needed to understand how disasters are depicted in the media.</p>
<p>The current study examines how eleven of the most severe U.S. natural disasters occurring between 2000 and 2010 were framed in mass media news coverage (national newspapers and broadcast television news). The study takes the broadest view of disaster news, by focusing on <italic>mass</italic> media (news sources with the largest audiences) coverage of <italic>major</italic> disasters in the United States. This project utilizes several media framing schemes, some specific to disasters and some generalizable across news events, thus advancing the framing literature by integrating and extending these schemes. In addition, this research examines how disaster news frames change over time,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077699012456022">4</xref></sup> exploring natural disaster media coverage across a variety of significant events.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077699012456022">
<title>Media Coverage of Disasters</title>
<p>A disaster is “a potentially traumatic event that is collectively experienced, has an acute onset, and is time-delimited.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077699012456022">5</xref></sup> Disasters may have natural, technological, or human causes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077699012456022">6</xref></sup> Natural disasters include events such as a hurricane, tornado, or earthquake; technological disasters are nonintentional events such as a chemical spill or meltdown at a nuclear power plant; and human-caused disasters include intentional events like a terrorist attack or other acts of mass violence. Disasters can have physical, social, psychosocial, sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and political consequences,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077699012456022">7</xref></sup> and the severity of disaster effects is seemingly increasing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077699012456022">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>From a communication or mass media perspective, much of the academic literature on disasters concerns crisis and risk communication. Crisis communication stems from the study of organizational communication or public relations and is generally concerned with how to protect an organization’s image relative to a crisis,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077699012456022">9</xref></sup> while risk communication primarily explores how to influence individual understanding of and behavior related to risk.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077699012456022">10</xref></sup> Both these lines of research generally take a persuasive or strategic approach to communication. Understanding news depictions of disasters and the effects of those depictions is relevant to both crisis and risk communication but has not been central to either line of study.</p>
<p>While communication or mass media research focusing directly on media coverage of natural disasters is limited,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077699012456022">11</xref></sup> it has used a variety of approaches. For example, previous disaster news research has examined depictions of authority in natural disasters,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077699012456022">12</xref></sup> the use of images in newspaper coverage of disasters,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077699012456022">13</xref></sup> and qualitative explorations of one or more disasters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077699012456022">14</xref></sup> A few broadly applicable results have emerged, including the finding that the news media generally rely on official sources for disaster information,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077699012456022">15</xref></sup> that news coverage of a disaster is not sustained for long,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077699012456022">16</xref></sup> and that the news media focus on “dramatic descriptive qualities of the events rather than upon causal explanations.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077699012456022">17</xref></sup> In addition, three stages of disaster news have been documented through previous research: normalcy tragically disrupted, people escaping and helping, and officials working to restore order and find cause.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077699012456022">18</xref></sup> Using these findings as a starting point, the current project examines media frames specific to disasters, as well as frames that have been found to be more broadly applicable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1077699012456022">
<title>Disaster Frames</title>
<p>Framing involves the selection of “some aspects of a perceived reality” that makes those aspects more salient to a media consumer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077699012456022">19</xref></sup> Gitlin wrote that framing is unavoidable because, at the institutional and individual journalist level, framing is necessary to interpret, organize, and understand large amounts of information.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077699012456022">20</xref></sup> Entman suggested that framing functions to define problems, diagnose causes, make moral judgments, and suggest remedies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1077699012456022">21</xref></sup> Because disasters can impact individuals and communities in a variety of ways,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1077699012456022">22</xref></sup> this project first examines news depictions of disaster effects and descriptions of who or what is affected by a disaster. This framing scheme measures aspects of a disaster that are emphasized in disaster news coverage, thus assessing how a disaster is defined for the audience. The disaster-specific frames are addressed in the following research questions:</p>
<list id="list1-1077699012456022" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>RQ1:</bold> What disaster effects are featured in disaster news stories?</p></list-item> <list-item><p><bold>RQ2:</bold> Who or what is depicted as being affected in disaster news stories?</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1077699012456022">
<title>Viewing Disaster through General Frames</title>
<p>The current study also investigates the use of general framing schemes in disaster news stories. First, we employed Li’s coverage frame,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1077699012456022">23</xref></sup> which is based on Entman’s argument that frames involve aspects of perceived reality that are emphasized in a news story.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1077699012456022">24</xref></sup> Li utilized the coverage frame in a study of the September 11 terrorist attacks (an intentional, human-caused disaster).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1077699012456022">25</xref></sup> However, because this framing scheme addresses broad categories of news emphasis (e.g., political, economic, criminal), it is applicable to a variety of issues and events, including natural disasters.</p>
<p>In addition, the current study uses Chyi and McCombs’s space- and time-framing scheme.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1077699012456022">26</xref></sup> This scheme was originally used in a study of media coverage of the Columbine school shootings, but is intended to be generalizable to a variety of news issues and events because it addresses two fundamental components: the space in which news is happening and the time in which it occurs. As Chyi and McCombs explain, “as ‘time’ corresponds to the ‘when’ in the five W’s of journalism, ‘space’ refers to the ‘where’ and may also include the ‘who,’ the ‘what,’ and even the ‘why.’”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1077699012456022">27</xref></sup> The space and time frames allow researchers to compare how different types of issues and events are framed (e.g., how economic crises are framed compared to military conflicts) and also how similar types of issues and events are framed (e.g., how natural disasters and terrorist attacks are framed). In addition, because these general frames address fundamental characteristics of news issues and events in media content, they provide an opportunity to explore how frames change over the life span of an issue or event.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1077699012456022">
<title>Frame Changing</title>
<p>When issues and events are covered in the news, the frames used generally change so that different aspects of the issues or events are emphasized at different points in time,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1077699012456022">28</xref></sup> a process known as “frame changing.” Frames tend to change because there are different orientations toward public issues and events depending on how well those issues and events are known. Downs addressed these differences in his five-stage “issue-attention cycle” that proposed (1) a preproblem stage, (2) alarmed discovery and euphoric enthusiasm, (3) realizing the cost of significant progress, (4) gradual decline of intense public interest, and (5) a post-problem stage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1077699012456022">29</xref></sup> According to this model, new issues or events receive a great deal of attention at first and then attention to or interest eventually fades, thus resulting in a cycle of “waxing” and “waning” news coverage and public attention to specific news issues or events.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1077699012456022">30</xref></sup> Agenda-setting research supports this notion and has found that the average time span an issue is salient in the American public’s issue agenda is 18.5 months.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1077699012456022">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>From a news production perspective, then, understanding how frames change over time is important. Time is also an important factor in the unfolding of disasters. From a disaster management perspective, different activities (mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery) occur depending on the disaster phase (before a disaster, during a disaster, and following a disaster).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1077699012456022">32</xref></sup> Therefore, what happens and is needed in the first few days of a disaster may not be what happens or is needed several months later. Moreover, the psychological impact of a disaster can be expected to differ relative to how much time has passed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1077699012456022">33</xref></sup> Overall then, the amount of time since a disaster occurred will influence the current needs, activities, and concerns of individuals and a community experiencing a disaster. Thus, while news coverage changes over time, so do the “on the ground” realities of a disaster. This means that in the case of disasters it is particularly important to understand how news frames change over time. Thus,</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>A content analysis of newspapers and television news coverage of major U.S. disasters that occurred between 2000 and 2010 was conducted.</p>
<sec id="section6-1077699012456022">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>The content analysis examined articles from the three U.S. newspapers with the highest daily circulations (the <italic>Wall Street Journal, USA Today</italic>, the <italic>New York Times</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1077699012456022">34</xref></sup> and two U.S. network evening news broadcasts (<italic>ABC World News</italic> and <italic>CBS Evening News</italic>). Articles on eleven of the costliest and deadliest natural disasters in the United States between 2000 and 2010 were included in the analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1077699012456022">35</xref></sup> Hurricanes were generally the most costly and deadly natural disaster to strike the United States during this time period; therefore, to extend the current study beyond media coverage of hurricanes, the final list of disasters included not only hurricanes, but other types of natural disasters as well (e.g., flood, tornado, wildfire).</p>
<p>The unit of analysis for this study was the news story. The LexisNexis database was used to search each of the content analysis sources for any stories that included the name of the eleven selected disasters between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2010. For newspapers, only stories that appeared on the front page were included in the sample. Using these requirements, 927 stories were identified, with 387 stories appearing in newspapers and 540 stories appearing in television news. The number of stories per individual source was as follows: the <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 70), <italic>USA Today</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 105), the <italic>New York Times</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 212), <italic>ABC World News</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 197), and <italic>CBS Evening News</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 343).

<title>Coding Variables</title>
<p>The date the story was published or broadcast, the source, and the name of the disaster were coded for each disaster news story. The day that the news story appeared was calculated, and five additional variables were coded: disaster effects, disaster affected, coverage frame, event phase, and event time.</p>
<sec id="section8-1077699012456022">
<title>Day the news story appeared</title>
<p>The day the news story appeared was calculated by taking the date each news story was published or broadcast minus the date the disaster occurred.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1077699012456022">36</xref></sup> For all of the disaster news stories in this study, the earliest story appeared 10 days before the disaster occurred (Hurricane Ivan) and the last story appeared 1,915 days after the disaster (Hurricane Katrina). The average time a disaster was covered in the news was 340 days (almost one year), with the shortest time span being 3 days (Arkansas floods) and the longest being 1,920 days (Hurricane Katrina).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1077699012456022">
<title>Disaster effects</title>
<p>The effect of the disaster on persons or objects was coded. Prior to coding, news stories about several major U.S. disasters that were not included in the current study were retrieved via LexisNexis. A preliminary list of possible disaster effects was developed by reviewing these stories, as well as the academic literature on disasters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1077699012456022">37</xref></sup> Then, as part of the coder training process (see below), coders independently coded several nonstudy articles using this list and met to compare their results and discuss disagreements. The list of disaster effects was revised as a result of this process, and then the entire process was repeated several times, leading to the finalization of disaster effects categories that were used for coding of the study’s articles. Up to seven different disaster effects were coded per story.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1077699012456022">
<title>Disaster-affected</title>
<p>The persons, objects, or entities affected by the disaster were coded. The process used to develop the coding list for the “disaster-affected” variable was the same as described for the disaster effects variable. Up to seven different instances of disaster-affected were coded per story.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1077699012456022">
<title>Coverage frame</title>
<p>Each story was coded for the primary coverage frame. Possible coverage frames were adapted from Li’s analysis of television coverage of the September 11 terrorist attacks and included the following:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1077699012456022">38</xref></sup> (1) political—government leaders and issues, policies, and politicians; (2) economic—economic impact or cost of event, business issues; (3) environment—human, built environment, and natural environmental impact, hazard, health, damage, and safety; (4) human interest—human disaster stories, human well-being; (5) criminal—crime, investigations; and (6) other—coverage frames that do not fit in previous categories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1077699012456022">39</xref></sup> Following Li’s guidance, the appropriate coverage frame for each article was coded based on the story focus in the article’s headline and lead. If an examination of the headline and lead did not identify a clear coverage frame, then the rest of the article was examined until the frame was identified.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1077699012456022">
<title>Event space and time</title>
<p>Each disaster news story was coded using Chyi and McCombs’s space and time variables.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1077699012456022">40</xref></sup> The space variable addressed the primary level that the news story focused on, and coding categories included (1) individual, (2) community, (3) state/regional, (4) national/societal, and (5) international. The time variable concerned the primary time period that the news story addressed and included (1) past, (2) present, and (3) future.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1077699012456022">
<title>Coding and Data Analysis</title>
<p>Five coders analyzed all news stories. A preliminary coding instrument was developed on which the coders were trained. Following training, the coders separately coded multiple practice news stories about disasters that were not included in this analysis, checked reliability of that coding, discussed disagreements, and made revisions to the coding instrument based on that discussion. This process was repeated several times until there was good intercoder reliability for the practice news stories. The coders then separately coded 10% of all study news content, and reliability was calculated for each variable using Krippendorff’s alpha.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1077699012456022">41</xref></sup> All variables were found to be reliable: disaster effects, α = .80;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1077699012456022">42</xref></sup> disaster affected, α = .82; coverage frame, α = .79; space, α = .87; and time, α = .94. Following the successful reliability check, the coders coded the remainder of disaster news stories independently.</p>

<p>The average time span a disaster was covered in the current analysis was about 12 months, a time period shorter than the average life span of 18.5 months found for public issues in agenda-setting research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1077699012456022">43</xref></sup> The current study examined only mass media with the largest audiences, so it is possible that coverage of these disasters continued in local news sources or further back in print editions of national newspapers beyond the average 12-month time period documented here. For example, it would be expected that Hurricane Katrina was still covered in New Orleans, Louisiana, news sources, such as the <italic>Times-Picayune</italic>, long after coverage ended in national news sources. Future research should examine local media coverage of disasters that occur in the local community. The limitations of the current study notwithstanding, the finding that mass media coverage of major American disasters is sustained for shorter period of times than other news issues is important and fits with previous research that has found news coverage of disasters is not sustained for long.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1077699012456022">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Additionally, for all disasters the vast majority of news stories occurred within the immediate aftermath of the event. Even if the average time span for news coverage of a disaster is approximately twelve months, the overall pattern of coverage involves significant media coverage right after the event, followed by a rapid decline. For example, 62.8% (<italic>n</italic> = 582) of all disaster news stories appeared within 30 days after the event. There was also great variability in the time span disasters were covered, with the shortest being 3 days of coverage of the Arkansas floods and the longest being 1,920 days of Hurricane Katrina coverage. In fact, had Hurricane Katrina not been included in this sample, the average time span of disaster news coverage would have been only 178 days. The variability of coverage indicates how characteristics of specific disasters influence news coverage. Disaster characteristics that are likely to drive news coverage include the number of people killed by the disaster, number of people injured, number of people affected in other ways, and amount of destruction and damage. Future research should attempt to clarify exactly what disaster characteristics precipitate disaster news coverage.</p>

<title>RQ1 and RQ2: Disaster Effects and Disaster-Affected Frames</title>
<p>Each disaster news story was coded for up to seven disaster effects and seven disaster-affected variables. On average, each disaster news story featured <italic>M</italic> = 2.95 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.43) disaster effects and <italic>M</italic> = 3.26 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.56) disaster-affected variables. The number of disaster effects (<italic>r</italic> = .09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and disaster-affected (<italic>r</italic> = .15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) variables described in news stories increased as time passed following the disaster. In other words, stories that appeared later after a disaster tended to feature more instances of disaster effects and disaster-affected than did disaster news stories that occurred sooner after the disaster.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077699012456022">Table 2</xref> shows frequencies of the disaster effects variables across all disaster news stories. Destruction of or damage to buildings, homes, or other structures was the most frequent disaster effect, appearing in 72.82% of all disaster news stories. Next, just over one-half of all disaster news stories addressed the disaster cost or business issues resulting from the disaster (52.24%), while almost one-half of stories mentioned evacuation or transportation issues (44.66%). After these, the most frequent disaster effect was death or injury, which appeared in just over one-third of all disaster news stories (36.79%), and political implications of the event, which was found in almost one-fourth of all stories (22.65%). Finally, a few other disaster effects appeared in at least 10% of all news stories. These included mental health issues related to the disaster (including panic, worry, distress; 17.15%), crime related to the disaster (15.32%), and new outlook or growth resulting from the event (10.25%). Therefore, the main disaster effects that emerged from our analysis fit with concerns articulated in the disaster management literature, which recommends that issues related to destruction and damage of buildings; economic costs; logistics; human survival, health, and mental health; crime; and politics be considered and addressed in disaster planning and response.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1077699012456022">45</xref></sup></p>

<p>These disaster effects and disaster-affected results indicate that, first, while many disaster effects are related to physical or economic capital (e.g., damage to physical structures, problems with businesses), the most frequent entity to be affected by disasters is people. Second, the economic implications of a disaster are a major issue in disaster news coverage, in that the cost of the disaster or related business problems or closings was the second most frequent disaster effect and businesses or the economy were the second most frequent entity to be affected by the disaster.

<sec id="section17-1077699012456022">
<title>Coverage frame</title>
<p>Environment was the most common coverage frame to appear in disaster media stories (<italic>n</italic> = 368, 39.7%), followed by human interest (<italic>n</italic> = 250, 27.0%), political (<italic>n</italic> = 135, 14.6%), economic (<italic>n</italic> = 128, 13.8%), criminal (<italic>n</italic> = 31, 3.3%), and other (<italic>n</italic> = 15, 1.6%). As time passed following the disaster, news stories were more likely to employ a human interest (<italic>r</italic> = .07, <italic>p</italic> = .02), economic (<italic>r</italic> = .07, <italic>p</italic> = .02), criminal (<italic>r</italic> = .15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and other (<italic>r</italic> = .12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) frame and were less likely to use an environment frame (<italic>r</italic> = –.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077699012456022">Figure 1</xref> graphs coverage frames during the first 240 days after a disaster and illustrates that the environment frame—which captured the death and destruction resulting from the disaster—constituted the vast majority of all coverage frames in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, but quickly declined during the first two months after the disaster. Meanwhile, the human interest frame increased in prevalence at around two months post-event, and then the political frame also increased at approximately five to six months post-event. Further out from the disaster, the human interest and political frames remained most popular.</p>

<p>Disasters have often been argued to have significant political implications,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1077699012456022">46</xref></sup> and so the focus on political coverage, particularly after the initial danger of the event has passed, fits with that understanding. In addition, the human interest frame fits with the mass media’s tendency to humanize disasters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1077699012456022">47</xref></sup> At the same time, given the significant impact that disasters can have on the human, built, and natural environments, the media’s tendency to move away from an environment frame is worthy of further examination. Future research might examine whether the media’s lessening emphasis on the environmental impact reflects actual recovery of the environment or simply a waning in coverage of this frame.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1077699012456022">
<title>Event space</title>
<p>The majority of disaster new stories centered on the state/regional impact of the event (<italic>n</italic> = 553, 59.7%), followed by national/societal (<italic>n</italic> = 148, 16.0%), community (<italic>n</italic> = 123, 13.3%), individual (<italic>n</italic> = 83, 9.0%), and international (<italic>n</italic> = 20, 2.2%). For all the disaster news stories, use of the state/regional frame increased in frequency over time (<italic>r</italic> = .12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), while use of the national/societal (<italic>r</italic> = –.07, <italic>p</italic> = .01) and international (<italic>r</italic> = –.07, <italic>p</italic> = .02) frames decreased. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077699012456022">Figure 2</xref> shows the event space frames over the first 240 days following the disaster, and illustrates that for most of this time, the state/regional frame was the most common frame used in disaster news stories, appearing in approximately 60% to 80% of all disaster news stories at multiple time periods after the disaster. However, at approximately 3 to 6 months following the event, the graph indicates a dip in the use of the state/regional frame, and a corresponding increase in national/societal and, to a lesser extent, the community and then the individual space frames.</p>

<p>This result is different from previous studies of media coverage of school shootings,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1077699012456022">48</xref></sup> which found the most common space framing to be societal. Therefore, while school shootings and natural disasters are both potentially traumatic events, the coverage of these events is centered in different spaces, with school shootings depicted as having social causes and implications and disasters having mostly state/regional implications. Thus, while school shootings are often depicted as having implications for all of society, disasters are more likely to be depicted as being bound to the regional area. These divergent findings for events that could both be considered “disasters”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1077699012456022">49</xref></sup> illustrate the power of applying a general framing scheme across similar issues and events to identify key differences in news coverage.</p>

The present frame was also the most common frame in previous studies of coverage of school shootings,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1077699012456022">50</xref></sup> but for school shooting coverage there was a spike in the future frame a few weeks after the event. No corresponding spike in future framing was found in disaster coverage, though we did find a small spike in past framing several months after the disaster. Overall, the time framing of disasters in news coverage did not change to the extent that it did in media coverage of school shootings. Disaster news stayed largely in the present.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>As with all research, this study has several limitations. First, we examined only mass media news sources (national newspapers and broadcast television news). Local media coverage of disasters is likely different from national coverage, and future research should examine these differences. Also, our analysis included only the textual components of newspapers and broadcast television news. The visual dimension of photographs and videos may convey additional or different information about disasters in news coverage, and future research should examine this visual dimension of news. In addition, we sampled only newspaper and television news sources for this study. Future research should examine disaster coverage in other sources, such as radio, cable television, and the Internet. And within these media, many research possibilities exist. For example, research could examine how disasters are depicted in local Internet blogs, on video Internet sites like YouTube, and on social media such as Facebook and Twitter. The framing schemes described in our current study could be utilized, thus providing for a more comprehensive cross-study understanding of how disasters are depicted in the media.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Implications</title>
<p>Using content analysis to examine mass media depictions of major American natural disasters that occurred between 2000 and 2010, we found that, on average, mass media covered natural disasters for shorter periods of time than other issues; that media coverage tended to focus on the current impact of disasters on humans, the built environment, and the natural environment (i.e., who was hurt or killed and what was destroyed); that disaster economics was an important topic; that disaster media coverage generally focused on the state and region related to the event; and that disaster news was largely about what was happening now.</p>
<p>If the media’s role in disasters is understood only as communicating warning to the public, describing what occurred, and keeping the public informed post-event,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1077699012456022">52</xref></sup> then the results described here are satisfactory. However, if the media also have a role in contributing to individual and community preparedness, recovery, and resilience,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1077699012456022">53</xref></sup> then these results are somewhat disappointing.</p>
<p>From a preparedness perspective, media coverage can help communities identify potential threats, advocate for needed changes in the built environment, and inform personal and family disaster readiness. Regarding disaster recovery, media coverage could inform citizens of available post-disaster services and provide a forum for community planning about post-disaster rebuilding. From a resilience perspective, “responsible” media could play a key role in creating a narrative about the disaster for the community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1077699012456022">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, disaster news that includes little coverage of what caused the disaster or what influenced responses to the disaster (the past) and what the disaster will mean for the people and communities experiencing the disaster (the future) ultimately provides for a weaker disaster narrative than if these time perspectives were considered. Community resilience requires that a community be able to both critically reflect on what has occurred and also develop a vision for the future, and without media coverage that explores the past and the future, fostering a resilient community may be difficult.<sup>55</sup> It may be that this consideration of past and future takes place in local media coverage of events, and future research should examine this possibility.</p>
<p>In addition, there is reason for concern about the effects of disaster news coverage on the nation or society as a whole. If, as Quarantelli suggests, most of what people know about disasters they learn through the media,<sup>56</sup> and if individuals are most likely to use mass media sources of the sort that were included in this study, then it would seem individuals are mostly learning about the disaster-related death, injury, and damage that occurs in the present and is largely bound to the state and region in which the disaster occurred, without national or societal implications. It is unclear whether such a temporally and geographically bound form of disaster news would be beneficial to individuals in terms of improving the preparedness or resilience of individuals or communities located outside of the current disaster area. In addition, our results raise questions about the implications of such disaster coverage on wider political conversations about disaster-related issues such as disaster aid, environmental protection, global climate change, or the costs of human development in areas prone to natural disasters. Future research should examine these issues further to expand understanding of the normative function of media in the context of disasters, and the broader impact that media framing of disasters has on our society.</p>

<p>As a result of this calculation, news stories published or broadcast on the day the disaster occurred received a value of zero. For hurricanes, the date the disaster occurred was considered to be the date the hurricane made landfall. Therefore, for some hurricane news stories in this study the value of the day the news story appeared variable is negative because a news story warning of an impending hurricane appeared before the storm made landfall.</p>

<p>Up to seven instances of the disaster effects and disaster affected variables could be coded for each news article, and coders were not instructed to code these instances in order. Therefore, reliability for the disaster effects and disaster affected variables was calculated based on the number of instances that each news story was coded for. The specific values of these variables for each news story were then examined to ensure there was general agreement between coders overall.</p>
