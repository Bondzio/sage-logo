<p>What is criminology, and where is it heading as a field of scholarship and teaching? In commissioning this collection of 34 essays from leading researchers, Mary Bosworth and Carolyn Hoyle were motivated by a concern that criminology might be ‘fragmenting’ due to ever greater scholarly specialization. Ironically, they see this happening just as criminology is reaching new heights of success, judged in terms of student numbers, university departments and the range and influence of scholarship. At this interesting moment, Bosworth and Hoyle aspired to stimulate a critical discussion of the state of the discipline.</p>
<p>Setting out from a broad conception of criminology as embracing not only criminal conduct and its social construction but also the issues of crime control and punishment which are the concern of readers of this journal, the collection is organized in three broad sections reflecting on, respectively, criminology’s varying conceptual, political and methodological allegiances; the limits and reach of criminology as a discipline; and the impact of criminology beyond the academy. Notwithstanding the sceptical reactions of some invited scholars, which the editors wryly report in the Introduction, the quality and range of the essays in this collection means that they have succeeded in opening up a very useful space for reflection on the field; though the fact that, as they mention, a high proportion of those declining their invitation worked with quantitative methods inevitably somewhat skews the way in which the field is reflected in the volume. This is not to say that quantitative approaches are absent: they are represented in chapters by Blumstein and by Sherman, while a variety of empirical and experimental methods are pondered or deployed in the chapters such as those by Gottfredson and Hough. But it would be fair to say that the greater part of the collection is preoccupied with theoretical paradigms and qualitative methods.</p>
<p>In the spirit of reflexivity which characterizes the collection, I will frame my review with a word or two about my own perspective. Twenty-three years ago, Stanley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1462474511408849">Cohen (1988</xref>: iii) prefaced his reflections on the state of the field with Adorno’s comment that ‘One must belong to a tradition to hate it properly.’ This exactly describes my own situation vis-à-vis criminology – or rather, its opposite. Trained as a lawyer, I have never managed to hate criminology in the least: indeed I’m deeply fond of it. On the other hand, I have to confess a certain complication, in that, while I’m attached to criminology – hey, some of my best friends are criminologists – I have never been able to bring myself quite to <italic>believe in it</italic> as a discipline. Its subject matter is so fluid; its methods are so various. Without ever thinking about the matter very deeply, I have never really been able to figure out how the field could be unified in a world in which positivist ideas of criminality had been (largely) abandoned and in which mechanisms of control and the institutions which define and deliver them are ever more diverse.</p>
<p>So I was intrigued by the debate which happens in this book about whether criminology is indeed an autonomous discipline. In what follows, I will first offer some reflections on that debate. Second, I will identify a number of themes which emerge across the essays and which bear on the question of how the field is characterized. And finally, I will comment briefly on a number of issues which struck me as, as it were, significantly absent from, or thinly represented in the book.</p>
<p>Is criminology a discipline? If not, what other disciplines are its ‘base’ or ‘mother’ disciplines (as, respectively, David Garland and Bosworth and Hoyle put it)? Does it matter whether we think of our field as a discipline or not? What difference, if any, does this make to our practice as criminologists, as scholars of punishment and society, as teachers, or as consumers of research in these fields?</p>
<p>The contributors’ positions on this matter range from confident assertion of criminology’s disciplinary status, through quiet assumption of that status, to ambivalence about the matter and, finally, to vigorous denial. I confess myself very much persuaded by the arguments put by John Braithwaite in his Preface, and by David Brown and David Garland in their chapters, for resisting the idea of criminology as an autonomous discipline. In particular, Garland’s arguments about the danger of criminology becoming a narrow and self-referential field – reinforced by Bosworth’s and Hoyle’s argument about the risks of fragmentation through ever greater specialization – is a very real one. But probably the key issue here is that of training. So many of the great works in the field are informed by large theoretical paradigms – primarily but not exclusively in sociology and social theory. If a move to undergraduate criminology would threaten the grounding of future generations of criminological research in the ‘mother disciplines’, that is surely a real problem. This does not militate against institutional structures such as Centres, which can help to protect criminology in the struggle for resources, and which can bring together the critical mass of scholars and students whose dialogue is key to the health of the field. But however strong the case for such arrangements, there is an overwhelming case for keeping a structure in which future criminologists have a strong training in a ‘mother discipline’. Without those theoretical resources to generate arguments which reach beyond the particular, the conversations on which the field depends would dry up very quickly.</p>
<p>But what are the ‘mother disciplines’? Here again, the collection gives us an interesting window on the field. The social sciences, the humanities and the natural sciences are all represented. Consistent with the history of the field, sociology, in both qualitative and quantitative forms, and social theories such as those of Durkheim and Foucault are most prominent, along with more recent movements in critical social theory including feminism, intersectionality, postcolonialism (for example in chapters by McLaughlin, Carlen, Daly, Mills, Sokoloff and Burgess-Proctor and Cunneen). Law also has some priority, being represented not only in Zedner’s and Ashworth’s pointers to debates about law’s role in criminalization and the constitution of criminal justice processes, but also in the prominence of human rights in the emergence of transnational forms of crime control, for example in Parmentier’s chapter. Of note here is the radical divergence of views about how far legal constructions of crime should organize the discipline – probably the sharpest division in the collection. Political science, economics (in both mathematically driven and political economy modes) and statistical analysis are present, but patchily so (see the chapters by Brown and by Paternoster and Bushway); anthropology leaves its mark via ethnography (as in the chapter by Stenning and Marks), but does not make a strong appearance independently; psychiatry and psychology are present but problematized (notably by Maruna and Barber); philosophy and political theory hover around the edges of human rights, the critical social theory themes, and normative debates about criminalization (e.g. in the essays by Loader and Sparks and by Schabas). History makes brief appearances, notably in Rafter’s essay. Interesting absences include geography, genetics (mentioned briefly by Felson) and neuroscience.</p>
<p>I would like to linger for a moment on these absences, because they point to an interesting feature of the criminological field as reflected in the collection. None of the contributors appears particularly concerned about the issues which recent research in genetics and neuroscience may put on the agenda of criminology. It seems to me that developments in both computer-enabled profiling techniques (often within a geographical frame), and the natural sciences, promise – or threaten – a nightmarish 21st-century revival of criminological positivism based on dubious conceptions of bad character dressed up in the trappings of science. In their chapter, Maruna and Barber provide an exemplary cautionary tale about the medical model of research. But I was struck that no one was worrying about a possible future for criminology arising from new theories of genetic and/or social determinism.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is not only the nightmare of a return to positivism, but also offenders themselves who are, if not absent, curiously shadowy presences in the collection. As Felson puts it, the focus is on crime not criminals. Liebling’s and Shearing and Marks’s essays are partial exceptions. But in terms of balance, if we think about what this collection would have looked like had it been commissioned in the era which produced David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1462474511408849">Downes’ (1966)</xref> <italic>The Delinquent Solution</italic> or David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1462474511408849">Matza’s (1969)</xref> <italic>Becoming Deviant</italic> – or even Dick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1462474511408849">Hobbs’ (1988)</xref> <italic>Doing the Business</italic> – the lifeworld of offending and offenders seems to be very much to the side of the contemporary criminological frame as represented here: indeed the sociology of deviance seems to be gradually retreating to the margins of the field, with the broad preoccupations of ‘punishment and society scholarship’ increasingly colonizing the criminological enterprise.</p>
<p>But along with such exits, we have some significant new entrants. Notable among these is the burgeoning scholarship on international crime and criminal justice, represented by chapters by Bowling, Parmentier and Aas. The international focus is giving a new spin to older criminological themes about the crimes of the powerful, and reviving important methodological questions about how we can understand and theorize the criminal behaviour of what, for the sake of a concise label, we might call collective actors. This new area has also contributed to the debate about how far the field can and should roam beyond the boundaries of the state, in analysing both crime and responses to it. Criminology is in good shape here, having adapted itself seamlessly to the insight that practices and institutions beyond the state are key to understanding criminalization, while retaining a healthy respect for the importance of the nation state. Whatever the importance of ‘globalization’ – I confess to being a little sceptical to just how useful it is as an overall concept – no one who studies criminal justice can be in any doubt that the nation state remains alive, well and very powerful.</p>
<p>There is, perhaps, one slight worry about the flourishing diversity which this excellent collection exhibits. On the whole the field is a tolerant one, with many researchers attentive to work using different methodologies from their own. This must be the basis for the continuing conversations which the editors are surely correct to identify as the key to a strong field in the future. Yet it is worth noting that this sort of cross-disciplinary conversation does entail some conception of borders as things not to be regretted or even broken down, but rather used to construct alternative ways of looking at the phenomena in which we are interested. Here I agree with David Garland that work carried forward within the boundaries which are intrinsic to the ‘mother disciplines’ is essential to the quality of the field, and to the development of generalizable arguments. So my worry is that generalizable arguments do sometimes get a bad name, and – so it seems to me – for insufficient reason.</p>
<p>A suspicion of generalization has long been central to critical traditions like feminist and postcolonial theory, and in criminological research this is sometimes combined with a celebration of localism, along with a suspicion of distance and a persistent worry about ethnocentrism. It is of course important to be reflexive about the danger of imposing a particular explanatory model, or world view, or set of assumptions, inappropriately on one’s material; or about adopting too narrow a research canvass, whether in geographical, gender, cultural or other terms. But there is a risk that appropriate caution can shade into intellectual paralysis, in which sensitivity about inappropriate generalization renders us reluctant to venture the sorts of arguments which can advance the field by generating engagement and productive disagreement. Again, my worry here connects with Bosworth’s and Hoyle’s introductory question about the consequences of fragmentation.</p>
<p>In short, <italic>What Is Criminology?</italic> provides a fascinating window on the field. For scholars, it provides a useful stimulus to reflection on what we are doing under the criminological umbrella, how we are doing it, and why. And for students, it provides a wide-ranging introduction to the many approaches and preoccupations which constitute the criminological field. Bosworth and Hoyle’s collection merits an attentive audience.</p>
