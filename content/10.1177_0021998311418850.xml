<p>A new method for the development (design, fabrication, and characterization) of asbestos-free rubbers for use as rocket motor insulators is presented. Such insulation is based on chopped carbon fiber (CCF) and aramid fiber in pulp form asreinforcement for ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) along with ammonium polyphosphate (AP) flame retardant agent. Six millimeters long CCFs and/or Kevlar pulp (KP) are dispersed in the EPDM polymeric matrix to obtain a homogenous master batch for curing. The new method involves the development of two types of prepregs andthe lamination of these types of prepregs. The first one consists of CCF/EPDM/AP (50 phr CCF) and the second type of prepreg KP/EPDM/AP (30 phr KP). Laminates composed of six alternative layers of these prepregs have been shown to exhibit better thermal, mechanical, physical, and ablative properties than their non-laminated counterparts.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311418850" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Solid rocket motors typically include an outer case or shell that houses solid propellant grains. The rocket motor case is conventionally manufactured from a rigid, yet durable, material such as steel or filament-wound composite. The propellant is housed within the case and is formulated from a composition designed to undergo combustion and thereby produces the requisite thrust for attaining rocket motor propulsion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311418850">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311418850">2</xref></sup> Internal insulation in a solid rocket motor is a layer ofheat-barrier material placed between the internal surface of the case and the propellant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311418850">3</xref></sup> The primary function of internal insulation is to prevent the rocket motor case from reaching temperatures that may endanger its structural integrity. Typically, the insulation is bonded to the inner surface of the case and is generally fabricated from a composition capable of withstanding high-temperature gases produced when the propellant grains burn. The combustion of solid rocket propellant generates extreme conditions within the case of the rocket motor. For example, temperatures inside the rocket motor case typically reach 2760°C (5000°F) and interior pressures may exceed 10.35 MPa (1500 psi). These factors combine to create a high degree of turbulence within the rocket motor case. In addition, particles are typically entrained in the gases produced during propellant combustion. Under a turbulent environment, these entrained particles can erode the rocket motor insulation. If the insulating layer and liner are pierced during rocket motor operation, the casing is susceptible to melting or degradation, which can result in failure of the rocket motor. Thus, it is crucial that insulation compositions withstand the extreme conditions experienced during propellant combustion and protect the case from the burning propellant.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0021998311418850"><title>Necessity for development of new materials</title>
<p>The development of new materials consists of two parts. First are the ingredients for the material and second the method of processing the ingredients to provide the configuration of the new material. While the ingredients for making the material are not different from current practice, the novel part of this study is the method of processing the ingredients.</p>
<p>The importance of the ingredients and method of processing can be revealed by considering the primary requirements for solid rocket motor insulation:
<list id="list1-0021998311418850" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>excellent bonding of the insulator with propellant and motor case over the entire range of working temperature;</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>good electrical conductivity (to avoid accumulation of static electricity).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Commonly used insulators usually consist of more than one phase. The matrix is usually made of either phenolic or some type of rubber and the reinforcement has been carbon black, asbestos, chopped carbon fiber (CCF) of Kevlar staples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311418850">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311418850">9</xref></sup> Many of these materials have deficiency in at least one of the primary requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311418850">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311418850">9</xref></sup> Reinforced thermosets, such as phenolic, crack and/or blister as a result of the rapid temperature and pressure fluctuations experienced during combustion. Although phenolic-based insulation is much more erosion resistant than many insulators due to the strongchar formed during decomposition, it does not exhibit a high strain capability and cannot survive high aeroheating loads. For elastomers filled with carbon black, the ablation resistance of the whole insulation is inadequate to withstand the high stresses and erosion rates resulting from the combustion gases. In addition, the International Agency for Research on Cancer evaluates that carbon black is possibly carcinogenic to humans. For insulators based on elastomers filled with asbestos, the mechanical properties and the ablation resistance of the whole insulation are adequate to withstand the high stresses and erosion rates resulting from combustion gases. However, asbestos are prevented from use due to its health hazards.</p>
<p>Materials used often are ethylene propylene dienemonomer (EPDM) rubbers reinforced with CCF and/or aramid fiber in pulp form (Kevlar pulp; KP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311418850">10</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311418850">20</xref></sup> Liquid EPDM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311418850">17</xref></sup> is cured using peroxide (PCA; peroxide cross-linking agent). It also contains ammonium polyphosphate (AP) which is a flame retardant agent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311418850">14</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311418850">16</xref></sup> EPDM is flexible and thus enables the insulator to conform the complex geometry of the wall of the motor. To increase the ablation resistance caused by flowing gases at high temperature and high velocity, CCFs are used. However, due to their high thermal conductivity, CCFs increase the thermal conductivity of the material, which is undesirable. To counter this effect, KP is used to reduce the thermal conductivity of the insulant. AP is always used to increase the flammability resistance.</p>
<p>A synopsis of the current technology is summarized asfollows: To satisfy the requirements of flexibility (toconform to the complex geometry of the structure) and light weight, rubber (EPDM) is used. In addition, itsthickness is about 3 mm. It should have low thermal conductivity to be able to maintain the steep thermal gradient. To do this, KP is added. The thermal conductivity of EPDM is0.36 W/m-K while that of KP is 0.04 W/m-K. On top of this, due to the very high temperature at the inside surface, abalation of the material can take place. As such, it is essential to increase the ablation resistance of the material. For this purpose, CCFs are added. An indication ofthe ablation resistance of thematerial can be obtained bythe thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) test. From TGA tests, EPDM starts to decompose at around 410°C and the final decomposition is at 547°C. KP starts to decompose at 580°C and it completely decomposes at 1450°C. CCFs are stable up to a final decomposition temperature of 3445°C. Adding CCFs enhances the ablation resistance of the material. However, this in turn increases the thermal conductivity of the composite material since CCF has thermal conductivity of 6.4 W/m-K. As such, it is essential to obtain an optimal combination of the three types of materials to achieve the desired performance. In addition to the threeingredients, aluminum polyphosphate is added to enhance the flammability resistance. The ingredients need to be mix together well to obtain good dispersion.</p>
<p>The method used to prepare these samples is mixing. If uniform dispersion of the fillers can be achieved, insulators with desirable properties may be obtained. In order to compare the results obtained from samples processed using the new method, samples made using the current method were prepared and their properties measured. These are presented below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0021998311418850"><title>Properties of samples made using the current method</title>
<p>The normal way to prepare samples is to mix and curethem. Different formulations (19 samples) of CCF and/or KP with EPDM polymer were prepared. All the formulations contain 100 phr EPDM, 60 phr AP, and 6 phr PCA. The formulations were mixed using a CW Brabender mixer equipped with two sigma blades to attain uniform dispersion of the reinforcement inside EPDM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311418850">21</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311418850">23</xref></sup> The formulations were cured under a press using compression molding.</p>
<p>The samples were tested for physical, mechanical, thermal, and ablative properties.</p>
<sec id="sec4-0021998311418850"><title>Physical and mechanical properties</title>
<p>ASTM cutting die (type C) was used to cut samples from the cured sheet of the insulation. MTS machine and laser extensometer were used for the determination of the tensile strength and elongation according to ASTM D 412-92. Shore A hardness was used to measure the hardness of rubber. Density of solid rubber sheets was determined using the rule of mixture.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0021998311418850"><title>Thermal properties and thermal degradation</title>
<p>The determination of the thermal diffusivities of the cured thermal insulation compositions was done using the Nanoflash technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998311418850">24</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311418850">26</xref></sup> The determination of the specific heat capacities was done by performing differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) measurement.

</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0021998311418850"><title>Ablation test</title>
<p>The ablation test (ASTM-E-285-80) was done using samples of the insulation material with thickness of 3 mm, length 20 cm, and width 20 cm. The sample was bonded to a steel plate with the same dimensions usingthe special adhesives Epon 828 and Epicure. Athermocouple was bonded to the back of steel plate to measure temperature. The other face of the insulation material was exposed to a high-temperature torch (2010°C). The temperature at the back of the steel plate during the 60 s ablation test was recorded. The rate ofdecrease of sample thickness due to ablation is determined to be the ablation rate.</p>

Composition of CCF was varied from 30 to 50 phr, while that of KP from 10 to 30 phr. Samples containing a mixture of CCF and KP were also prepared and tested. Coefficient of thermal conductivity is calculated using the equation: <inline-formula id="ilm1-0021998311418850"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math1-0021998311418850"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>p</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.

<p>From the results, it can be seen that increasing CCFwould increase the tensile strength, reduce the elongation, and increase the thermal conductivity. Increasing the amount of KP also increases the tensile strength, reduces the elongation, but decreases the thermal conductivity.

<p>Samples containing a mixture of 25 phr CCF + 25 phr KP gives the best ablation rate of 0.005 mm/s. Samples containing 30 KP give the lowest temperature at the back steel plate of 79°C. All samples given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311418850">Table 2</xref> would meet the ablation requirement. If only CCF is used, then the temperature at the back of the steel plate may be too high. This temperature is not high for steel, but can be too high for the adhesive used to bond the insulant to the steel plate. If only KP is used, the ablation rate is dangerously close to the allowed limit. Using a combination of CCF and KP gives the best performance in terms of ablation resistance and back plate temperature.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0021998311418850"><title>Shortcoming of the current method of processing the materials</title>
<p>The current method of processing the ingredients to make the insulants seems to be able to provide samples that meet the requirements. However, this is under the assumption that the fillers are uniformly dispersed and that there are no points of convergence of the highly conductive constituents (CCF). The requirement that the back plate temperature should not exceed 150°C applies to every point on the back plate at any time during the operating period. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311418850">Figure 1</xref> shows the microstructure of a sample containing CCF. The CCF fibers have random orientation. In most cases, this is the situation. However, there is no guarantee that this is always the case. The situation that one wants to avoidis that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311418850">Figure 2</xref>(a) or (b). In the rare but not unprobable scenario where many CCF fibers converge to the one point (point A) or several points (B,C, D) on the adhesive layers, due the high thermal conductivity of the CCF fibers (6.4 W/m-K), heat can be conducted quickly from the high-temperature side of the insulant to the adhesive layer. Temperature in the adhesive layer can be increased quickly, leading to softening or melting of this layer. This in turn may lead to delamination of the insulant layer from the back steel plate, which may result in catastrophic failure. Due to the high stake involved in the application, one would make sure that this scenario does not happen.

<sec id="sec8-0021998311418850"><title>Alternate configuration for the insulating material</title>
<p>In order to derive the alternate configuration for theinsulating material, some modeling for the thermal conductivity and ablation of the insulant can be useful. Thermal conductivity models are first considered, followed by ablation modeling.</p>

Many (if not most) effective thermal conductivity models found in literature are based on one or more of the four basic structural models; specifically, the series, parallel, Maxwell–Eucken, and effective medium theory (EMT) models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311418850">Figure 3</xref>). In these models, any effective property of filled polymer composites is defined by properties of individual components and their volume fractions. In the series and parallel models, layers of the components are aligned either perpendicular or parallel to the heat flow, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311418850">Figure 3</xref>(a) and (b), respectively. The Maxwell–Eucken model assumes a dispersion of small spheres within a continuous matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311418850">Figure 3</xref>(c)). The EMT model assumes a completely random distribution of all the components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311418850">Figure 3</xref>(d)).

</p>
<p>It can be seen that the series model gives the lowest thermal conductivity. Experimental values also agree better with this model. The fact that the series model gives the lowest thermal conductivity implies that any effective configuration for the insulation material should have the phases arranged in series.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0021998311418850"><title>Ablation modeling</title>
<p>The ablation model was done by considering the heattransfer across the thickness of the insulation material as a one-dimensional problem. The thickness of the insulant material is discretized into segments. The thermal conductivity of each segment is assumed to stay constant within an increment of time. The temperature on the hot side is assumed to stay constant at 2010°C. The bottom surface of steel is subjected to convection heat transfer by air with a coefficient of heat convection 10 W/m<sup>2</sup> -K. When the temperature of a certain segment exceeds the ablation temperature of the material (800°C for CCF based layer and 600°C for KP based layer, as determined from TGA tests), the material within that segment is allowed to ablate, andthe thickness of the sample is reduced by the disappearance of that segment. Once a segment has been ablated, its thermal conductivity can be assumed to stay the same as before, or it can bereduced down to 50% of the initial value. Two sets ofresults are obtained from the two different scenarios. The problem marches along increments of time. A total of 60 s is allowed forthe operation. The model was doneby considering a sample of the insulation material with known properties (based on CCF and/or KP reinforcement) with a thickness of 3 mm and width 20 cm. The sample is bonded to a steel piece with the same dimensions. The numerical solution was done using MatLab PDE tool.</p>
<p>Considering that the series model provides the lowest thermal conductivity, several configurations of the thickness arrangement were examined. The geometry was changed from single layer of CCF/EPDM or KP/EPDM, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311418850">Figure 5</xref>, to two alternative layers of CCF/EPDM and KP/EPDM, then to four alternative layers of CCF/EPDM and KP/EPDM, and finally to six alternative layers of CCF/EPDM and KP/EPDM, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311418850">Figure 6</xref>.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311418850">Figure 7</xref> shows the temperature distribution across the thickness of the insulation material for different configurations. Using alternative layers of 50 phr CCF and 30 phr KP based insulation will show improvement in lowering the temperature in the back steel plate over using only one layer of 50 phr CCF based insulation, 30 phr KP based insulation, and the hybrid 25 phr CCF + 25 phr KP based insulation. Also, the larger the number of layers (which means that the thinner the thickness of the sub-layers), the better the result (the smaller the thermal conductivity). These results show that the best arrangement is to have alternate layers connected in series.

<sec id="sec11-0021998311418850"><title>Development of the insulation material in prepreg form</title>
<p>The thermo-conductivity models show that the series model gives the lowest thermal conductivity. The ablation simulation also shows that the best configuration would be to alternate layers containing CCF with those containing KP. The alternation of layers containing CCF with layers containing KP has one additional advantage. This can be seen by comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311418850">Figure 2</xref> with 8. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311418850">Figure 2</xref>, if there are convergences of CCF fibers to a point at an interface, fast heat conduction takes place and the temperature of the adhesive can increase rapidly. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311418850">Figure 8</xref>, even if there are convergences of CCF fibers in a sub-layer, only the next layercontaining KP is heated quickly, but the adhesive layer is protected. The alternate layers arrangement in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311418850">Figure 8</xref>, therefore, can be much safer.
<fig id="fig8-0021998311418850" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Alternate layout of layers containing CCF and KP helping to prevent direct fast thermal connection from front face (2010°C) to back face.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311418850-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The challenge now is to how to fabricate the insulation material into the configuration shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311418850">Figure 8</xref>. To do this, the sub-layers (layers with small thickness containing CCF only and layers containing KP only, inaddition to the flame retardant and curing agent) need to be prepared in the prepreg form (similar to the prepreg used in epoxy-based composites). This means that the EPDM needs to be partially cured. The prepregs need to be rigid enough to be handlable, and they should have sufficient degree of uncureness to allow for bonding with the other sub-layers during thefinal manufacturing stage. EPDM cures by cross-linking process.</p>
<p>Experimentation was carried out to determine the appropriate amount of cross-linking agent to prepare the EPDM prepregs. Another set of experimentation was carried out to determine the appropriate curing parameters and molding parameters to fabricate the final laminate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021998311418850">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021998311418850">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Different curing cycles were experimented to get the minimum degree of cure for the resulting prepreg. Different thicknesses of the prepregs were also attempted. The thickness of prepreg has influence on the ease (or difficulty) in removing the prepregs from the mold. It was found that curing temperature (170°C), curing pressure (2.5 MPa), curing time (6 min), and a thickness of 0.5 mm are the satisfactory conditions.The prepregs have partially cured skins (about 20 µm) with an uncured core of about 0.46 mm, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311418850">Figure 9</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311418850">Figure 10</xref> shows CCF/EPDM and KP/EPDM prepregs, respectively.

<p>Six layers of prepregs (three containing CCF + PCA + AP and three KP + PCA + AP) were stacked and molded to make the final laminate.

<p>Values for the hybrid sample (one layer made of 25 phr CCF + 25 phr KP) are extracted from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311418850">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311418850">2</xref> are also presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998311418850">Table 3</xref> for comparison. It can be seen that the laminated samples (composed of six alternative layers of 50 phr CCF based prepreg and 30 phr KP based prepreg) have smaller tensile strength, larger elongation, and smaller hardness than the hybrid sample. Most other properties are about the same between the two types of samples. The significant difference, however, is in the temperature of the back plate. The temperature at the back plate for the hybrid sample is 82°C while that for the laminated sample 39°C. This significant difference, in conjunction with the better assurance of no fast direct heat conduction from the front fact to the back face (in comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311418850">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311418850">7</xref>) gives the laminated sample a clear advantage over samples made using this method.</p>
