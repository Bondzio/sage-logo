<p>Steven M. Hallock, an assistant professor of journalism at Point Park University in Pittsburgh, looks at fifty years of American history through the words and memories of ten journalists who covered it.</p>
<p>For each decade, Hallock has selected two journalists with a wide range of experiences and backgrounds. They include men and women who were print editors and reporters, syndicated columnists, and broadcasters. Hallock weaves together personal interviews as well excerpts from their memoirs and stories to tell about the most important events of the late twentieth century.</p>
<p>Although the book is titled <italic>Reporters Who Made History</italic>, not all of those featured made history themselves and not all were reporters when they made their mark. For example, Ben Bradlee was an editor, and Ellen Goodman, Georgie Anne Geyer, and David Broder were columnists writing about the political and social upheavals of their time.</p>
<p>Hallock asked each journalist to name the most important events of the late twentieth century in the areas of crime, politics, society, law, entertainment, sports, medicine, and foreign affairs. He also asked them to comment on changes they saw in the journalism profession. Their answers are not too surprising: the Civil Rights movement, the Cold War, the Red Scare, the ascendancy of television, and the fall of communism top the journalists’ list of important developments.</p>
<p>More interesting are the journalists’ reflections on their careers. While much of it has been previously published in biographies and memoirs, pulled together in this study themes emerge that are instructive to today’s young journalists: the men and women in this book exhibited a passion for reporting the truth, a willingness to work hard and take risks, and enjoyed a fair amount of luck. Hallock tries to situate each journalist within his or her time period by reporting the news headlines on the day each was born. Although at times this device feels a bit tedious, it does serve to remind the reader that even journalists are shaped by their times.</p>
<p>After an overview chapter, Hallock starts his decade-by-decade study in the 1950s with former <italic>New York Times</italic> columnist Anthony Lewis and White House correspondent Helen Thomas. Lewis discusses the nascent Civil Rights movement and his coverage of the Red Scare, including his Pulitzer Prize–winning series about a Maryland man who lost his job after being deemed a security risk. Thomas, meanwhile, describes her start as a political reporter during World War II and the advent of the Cold War and offers her views on the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations. Hallock’s book predates her retirement following controversial remarks on Jews and Palestinians.</p>
<p>CBS correspondent Morley Safer and <italic>New York Times</italic> reporter Earl Caldwell represent the 1960s. Safer came to fame with his controversial coverage of the Vietnam War when he showed American soldiers burning Vietnamese villages. Although some historians credit television coverage with helping end the war, Safer dismisses that idea. Caldwell, who later became a columnist for <italic>The New York Daily News</italic>, discusses his coverage of the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and of the Black Panthers. In one of the most interesting sections of the book, he recalls the conflicting feelings he had as a black man covering the militant Civil Rights group.</p>
<p>The 1970s chapter features <italic>Washington Post</italic> editor Ben Bradlee, who oversaw the coverage of the Watergate scandal and the resignation of President Richard Nixon. Young journalists will find comfort in Bradlee’s recollection that he was not a natural writer when he came to the <italic>Post</italic>. Foreign correspondent and syndicated columnist Georgie Anne Geyer offers insights into the international stories of the decade, including the 1978 Camp David Peace Accords, the death of Anwar Sadat, and the fall of the Shah of Iran. Geyer, the first Western journalist to interview Saddam Hussein, covered uprisings in the Middle East, Central America, and Africa, where she was taken captive by Angolan revolutionaries.</p>
<p><italic>Washington Post</italic> reporter Juan Williams (who later worked at NPR and Fox News) and columnist Ellen Goodman represent the 1980s, offering insights into the Regan Administration. Williams, who covered the president, reported on the shortcomings of Reaganomics, the Iran-Contra scandal, and the controversial Star Wars defense program. Goodman’s coverage of the decade included insights into women, families, and changing lifestyles as well as the ravages of the AIDS epidemic.</p>
<p>Political columnist David Broder and TV news correspondent Judy Woodruff provide the closing remarks on the century, discussing the Clinton Administration, the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and the growing rift between Democrats and Republicans over the economy and social programs.</p>
<p>In the final chapter, Hallock turns to the field of journalism itself, asking these celebrity journalists to reflect on how the profession has changed. Not surprisingly, they note the impact of technological innovations such as the Internet, the twenty-four-hour news cycle, and the economic pressures on newspapers and television news operations.</p>
<p>Hallock, who worked for twenty-five years as a columnist and editorial writer for <italic>The New York Times</italic> and <italic>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</italic>, has a direct, readable style. Undergraduates contemplating careers in journalism will find the stories of these important figures compelling reading.</p>
