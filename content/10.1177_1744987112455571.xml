<p>As an issue, teenage pregnancy has been the focus of public health agendas, research proposals and preventative programmes across many cultures for decades. While some studies have brought to light the positive rewards of teen parenthood, such as giving and receiving love, and motherhood as a motivation for making better choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987112455571">Herman, 2008</xref>), the overwhelming perception is that becoming a parent under the age of 20 years will have negative health and social consequences for both the young parent and their child. Hence, teenage pregnancy is associated with poor educational and employment attainment for the mother, lower birth weight, increased risk of poverty, poorer housing and nutrition.</p>
<p>Mary Ann Osuchowski-Sanchez and colleagues' study certainly falls into the latter category, providing qualitative insights into the perceptions of 10 teenage Hispanic mothers and some key adults who work with young people. For me, the most striking, and quite frankly depressing, finding of this small qualitative study was the pervading cyclical nature of teenage pregnancy. While echoing previous studies which have found that the daughters and sisters of teenage mothers are more likely to become teenage parents themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987112455571">East et al., 2007</xref>), this study explores the cultural context of teenage pregnancy among Hispanic communities across the United States. However, as the authors point out, in doing so it also contradicts previous literature which has suggested that Hispanic culture supports early motherhood and the importance of family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987112455571">Russell and Lee, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall the young women felt that ‘it was too hard’ to be a teen and a parent which is perhaps not surprising given that they describe an environment lacking in support or a positive parenting role model against a backdrop of disappointment and disapproval attached to their pregnancy experience. In addition, as the authors highlight, the community under study suffers disproportionately from poverty which in itself increases the vulnerability of families. While their desire to break the cycle of teenage pregnancy for future generations is admirable, the authors eloquently point out it can be a struggle to ‘undo the script’. One gets the feeling that to do so they will have to forge a cultural sea change that acknowledges that pregnancy and sex are inextricably linked, and therefore that any solution requires more open and honest communication between young people and adults regarding sex and relationships. In particular, I found it interesting that while the authors' intention was to add to the knowledge base relating to the factors influencing ‘sexual decisions and behaviours’ among Hispanic youth, the only insight we get is that some of the young women were prepared to forego condom use as a sign of commitment within their relationship. In addition, while they clearly state that females were the focus of their study the, all too often, absence of young men from teenage pregnancy studies excludes ‘half of the problem’ and therefore ‘half of the solution’ from our understanding.</p>
<p>Given that the young people in this study focused on the failures of the adults in their lives, the authors provide many practical recommendations as to how nurses could facilitate young people to rewrite their life script, through providing education, accessible services and acting as positive role models. The young people in this study clearly advocated prevention and, I would argue that to do so, we need to shift our thinking away from the starting point of adolescent sexuality as a problem and aim to enhance young people’s ability to become sexually healthy adults.</p>
<p>However, the cycle of negative impact associated with teenage pregnancy will only be broken if, in addition to preventive efforts, we support young parents to positively change their life course and that of their child. One such model is the Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP). NFP, developed in the USA but also currently being embraced in the UK, is a nurse home-visiting programme involving weekly or fortnightly structured home visits from a specially trained nurse from early pregnancy until children are 24 months old. Aimed at low-income first-time mothers under the age of 20 years, the programme importantly recognises that it is not teenage pregnancy per se that increases the risk of negative outcomes for mother and baby but pregnancy in the context of an additional vulnerability such as low income, few educational qualifications or living alone without a partner or parent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987112455571">Barnes et al., 2011</xref>) In this way the programme aims to break cycles of disadvantage and social exclusion which was also the overwhelming desire of the young people who took part in this study.</p>
