<p>Although dominant approaches in organizational theory emphasize certain basic similarities across sectors—all organizations require some degree of legitimacy, resources, formalization, goal specification, and the like—much of the literature on advocacy and social movement organizations continues to highlight the uniqueness of groups motivated to generate social change. Such distinctiveness is often linked to the centrality of principled action in the founding, structuring, coalition building, and strategy development of advocacy groups. Accordingly, the notion that organizations in different sectors negotiate contradictory or even incommensurable institutional logics is a quite familiar one and is imprinted on much of the scholarship on organized advocacy.</p>
<p>But in a context of fuzzy sectoral boundaries—in which social movements are becoming a routine aspect of governance in many policy domains, and in which firms have come to adopt certain social movement strategies—a rethinking of this framework may be in order. Prakash and Gugerty rise to this challenge in their edited volume, <italic>Advocacy Organizations and Collective Action</italic>. Returning to the ideas of Olson’s classic <italic>Logic of Collective Action</italic> and its adaptation to resource mobilization theory, Prakash and Gugerty, both political scientists, press for an understanding of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as “firms” operating in competitive “policy markets.” The contributions, first assembled for a conference at the University of Washington in 2008, offer insights into how best to understand the place of advocacy in contemporary policy environments.</p>
<p>Although much contemporary scholarship at the intersection of social movements and organizational theory uses the lens of social movement theory in studies of the firm, this volume reverses perspectives once again by returning to the original questions of resource mobilization theory. The assembled contributors ask, then, how the workings of advocacy groups can be understood through economic and organizational theories typically applied to firms. Prakash and Gugerty therefore focus attention on both the supply and demand of advocacy; for example, demand involves government failures and preference heterogeneities among citizens (a nod toward median voter theories), while supply is associated with transaction costs and principle-agent problems. Once established, NGOs create excludable benefits and make efforts to protect rents flowing to members (p. 5).</p>
<p>The volume is organized into four sections, respectively, on the emergence and structures of advocacy groups, empirical studies of advocacy tactics, the role of advocacy groups in a transnational context, and a concluding section focused on setting a new agenda for studies of political organizations in civil society.</p>
<p>McGee Young’s opening chapter—one of the more interesting in the volume—tells the story of the development of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), offering some highlights of the group’s development as one of the first environmental organizations to focus primarily on professionalized advocacy through the courts; the emphasis here is on the influence of the political environment on the supply of advocacy resulting from such entrepreneurship. In this case, the Ford Foundation emerges as a key “purchaser” of NRDC’s advocacy “product,” and it also served as a political influence pressuring the group to merge with the Yale-based Environmental Legal Defense Fund. Also on the topic of emergence and structure, Gill and Pfaff’s chapter considers religious traditions as advocacy groups, adapting the sociological “religious markets” framework of scholars like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0001839212462540">Finke and Stark (2006)</xref> to the collective action framework of the volume; similarly, Elizabeth Bloodgood’s contribution examines how variation in the regulation of NGOs across OECD nations affects population density. In both of the latter chapters, the implication is that lighter regulation of the advocacy market may encourage NGO entrepreneurship, although both reach this conclusion somewhat tentatively.</p>
<p>Advocacy tactics are also responsive to concerns of the NGO “marketplace.” Clifford Bob’s contribution highlights how human rights advocacy is often driven more by the pressures of elite foundations, governments in developed nations, and wealthy donors than the severity of violations. Maryann Barakso notes that advocacy groups face branding concerns that may lead to inertial tactical preferences. Sarah Pralle’s piece suggests that advocacy groups engage in an endogenous process of shopping for effective venues of policy influence.</p>
<p>Considering global advocacy, Prakash and Gugerty’s volume marshals evidence that incentives of resources and status often prevail at the expense of organizations’ moral principles, especially under circumstances of competition. Examining the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Bosnia, Alexander Cooley and James Ron find that human rights NGOs were often highly competitive in contracting with the UN High Commission Refugees in the DRC and that groups seeking to monitor conditions for prisoners of war in Bosnia struggled with multiple-principles problems, leading to the unintended consequence of “empowering local military commanders” (p. 222). A contradictory perspective is offered by Lecy and colleagues, who remind us that transnational organizations operate in relatively open and flexible networks. These networks, they argue, are structured in ways that “defy conventional notions of bounded firms operating in markets” (p. 248); given this finding, they are much more agnostic about the firm analogy than the other contributors. Sarah Henderson, in contrast, returns to earlier ideas in the volume with her finding that the funding strategies of Western donors often diverted NGOs in post-transition Russia away from the interests of local actors.</p>
<p>I found the concluding chapters to be among the most worthwhile, especially in the debate between Thomas Risse and the editors in, respectively, the penultimate and concluding chapters. Risse suggests that the editors and contributors to the volume may be attacking a straw man to some extent, as much scholarship on advocacy organizations already accepts the notion that NGOs are driven both by instrumental and normative concerns. As Risse correctly points out, there are serious risks to the legitimacy of NGOs that appear to be driven primarily by the interests of donors and political elites (pp. 289–290).</p>
<p>One concern with the volume is that Olsonian collective action problems are often grouped closely together with the application of the analogy of the firm to advocacy organizations. Although both offer an alternative view to the (perhaps slightly caricatured) notion of advocacy organizations as entirely value-rational actors, these two need not be coupled quite so tightly. One may safely accept the claim that advocacy organizations are driven partially by instrumental concerns without accepting the analogy to business firms.</p>
<p>Despite this minor quibble, the case studies in <italic>Advocacy Organizations and Collective Action</italic> offer insights that I expect will make the volume useful for courses in political science, political sociology, and for organizational behavior courses on advocacy and the global nonprofit sector. The volume makes an important contribution for those seeking to advance organizational research on advocacy groups in a context of blurring sectoral boundaries.</p>
