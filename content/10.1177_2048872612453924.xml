<title>Aims:</title>
<p>Haemorrhagic complications are strongly linked with adverse outcomes in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. Various risk scores (RS) are available to predict bleeding risk in these patients. We compared the performance of three contemporary bleeding RS in ACS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-2048872612453924">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>We studied 4500 consecutive patients with ACS. We calculated the ACTION, CRUSADE, and Mehran et al. (2010) bleeding RS, and evaluated their performance for predicting their own major bleeding events and TIMI serious (major or minor) bleeding episodes, in patients with either non-ST-elevation ACS (NSTEACS) or ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Calibration (Hosmer–Lemeshow test, HL) and discrimination (<italic>c</italic>-statistic) for the three RS were computed and compared.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2048872612453924">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>For RS-specific major bleeding, ACTION and CRUSADE showed the best prognostic discrimination in STEMI (<italic>c</italic>=0.734 and 0.791, respectively; <italic>p</italic>=0.04), and in NSTEACS (<italic>c</italic>=0.791 and 0.810; <italic>p</italic>=0.4); being CRUSADE significantly superior to Mehran et al. in both ACS types (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). All RS performed well in patients undergoing coronary arteriography using either a radial or femoral approach (all <italic>c</italic>≥0.718); however, their discriminative capacity was modest in patients not undergoing coronary arteriography and in those previously on oral anticoagulant (all <italic>c</italic>&lt;0.70). For TIMI serious bleeding, ACTION and CRUSADE displayed the highest <italic>c</italic>-index values in both STEMI (0.724 and 0.703, respectively; <italic>p</italic>=0.3) and NSTEACS (<italic>c</italic>=0.733 and 0.744, respectively; <italic>p</italic>=0.6); however, calibration of ACTION was poor in both ACS types (HL <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In patients with acute coronary syndromes [ACS; ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation ACS (NSTEACS)], bleeding complications have been associated with an increased risk of subsequent serious adverse outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2048872612453924">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2048872612453924"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2048872612453924"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2048872612453924"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2048872612453924"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2048872612453924"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2048872612453924"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2048872612453924">8</xref></sup> Similarly to ischaemic risk, risk of bleeding is not homogeneous, and various predictive models have been developed to stratify bleeding risk in ACS patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2048872612453924">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2048872612453924"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2048872612453924"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2048872612453924"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2048872612453924">8</xref></sup> Contemporary bleeding risk scores (RS) in the setting of ACS comprise: CRUSADE (Can Rapid risk stratification of Unstable angina patients Suppress ADverse outcomes with Early implementation of the ACC/AHA Guidelines),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2048872612453924">6</xref></sup> ACTION (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2048872612453924">7</xref></sup> and that derived by Mehran et al. from the combined dataset of ACUITY/HORIZONS-AMI trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2048872612453924">8</xref></sup> While many clinical variables overlap among all these RS, the CRUSADE model was developed to help clinicians estimate a patient’s baseline risk of in-hospital major bleeding during NSTEMI,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2048872612453924">6</xref></sup> whereas the ACTION and Mehran et al. models were derived from NSTEMI and STEMI patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2048872612453924">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2048872612453924">8</xref></sup> and thus offer quantitative tools for assessing bleeding risk in a broader spectrum of patients.</p>
<p>In the ACS scenario, there is a current consensus about the need for bleeding risk stratification,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2048872612453924">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2048872612453924">10</xref></sup> but it is not clear which of the available bleeding RS provides the best option as a complementary clinical tool in bleeding risk assessment.</p>
<p>We therefore investigated the performance of the CRUSADE, ACTION, and Mehran et al. scores, aiming to obtain evidence of which provides the most accurate and reliable quantitative clinical tool for predicting haemorrhagic complications in ACS patients.</p>

<sec id="section6-2048872612453924" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section7-2048872612453924">
<title>Patient population</title>
<p>This was a retrospective study in which the study subjects were all patients admitted consecutively between January 2004 and December 2010 to the cardiology department of our institution and having a final diagnosis of ACS. The demographic, clinical, and angiographic data, as well as those relating to management and in-hospital complications, were collected prospectively and recorded on a computer database for ACS patients admitted to our institution. Data were gathered by the department’s cardiologists in the hospitalization ward and coronary care unit. Diagnosis of ACS was therefore validated if the patient had new onset symptoms consistent with cardiac ischaemia and at least one of the following: cardiac biomarkers above the higher normal laboratory limit, electrocardiogram changes consistent with ACS, in-hospital stress testing showing ischaemia, or documented history of coronary vessel disease. Patients were classified as having STEMI or NSTEACS (unstable angina and NSTEMI). The diagnosis of unstable angina required the presence of suggestive symptoms together with objective evidence of myocardial ischaemia on stress testing or detection of a culprit lesion of ≥50% on coronary angiography, in addition to cardiac biomarkers below the higher normal laboratory limit.</p>
<p>The initial cohort of the present study comprised 4729 patients. Patients whose ACS was precipitated in the context of surgery, sepsis, trauma, or cocaine consumption (<italic>n</italic>=61) were excluded. Furthermore, 105 patients were excluded due to missing data for some variable in the RS (including 19 patients with missing data regarding bleeding events). Finally, we excluded patients who died within 24 hours of hospital admission (<italic>n</italic>=63), due to their not having sufficient time to develop bleeding. Thus, 4500 patients constituted the final study cohort. The study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of our institution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-2048872612453924">
<title>End points and definitions</title>
<p>Our primary end point focused on the predictive accuracy of the three contemporary RS available for classifying the risk of bleeding in ACS patients. Only haemorrhagic events that occurred during hospitalization but before cardiac surgery were taken into account. For bleeding patients, source documentation was available and it was re-evaluated. We had information on localization, imaging tests, admission and nadir haemoglobin/haematocrit levels, and blood transfusion. The lowest haemoglobin and haematocrit values, and the white blood cell count at admission, were collected retrospectively from the central laboratory database of our centre. In 19 patients, bleeding events could not be adjudicated (mainly due to missing values on admission and/or nadir haemoglobin/haematocrit levels). These patients were excluded jointly with the 86 patients with missing data to calculate the RS. In the 105 excluded patients, secondary analyses were performed to assess the impact of missing data on the results.</p>
<p>Bleeding episodes were assessed in line with bleeding criteria used in ACTION,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2048872612453924">7</xref></sup> CRUSADE,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2048872612453924">8</xref></sup> and Mehran et al. scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2048872612453924">9</xref></sup> (Supplementary Table 1). Because each of these definitions is a composite of several events of different clinical relevance, we also used the TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) bleeding definition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2048872612453924">11</xref></sup> as a ‘gold standard’ to compare the predictive ability of all scores. TIMI major bleeding was defined as intracranial haemorrhage, fatal bleeding (bleeding that directly results in death within 7 days), or clinically overt bleeding (including on imaging) associated with a drop in haemoglobin of ≥5 g/dl. The diagnosis of intracranial bleeding required confirmation by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the head. TIMI minor bleeding was defined as any clinically overt bleeding (including on imaging), resulting in haemoglobin drop of 3–5 g/dl. In this study, TIMI serious bleeding was defined as TIMI major or TIMI minor bleeding.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Continuous variables are presented as the median (25th and 75th percentiles) and categorical variables are presented as counts (%) and were compared by the χ<sup>2</sup> test of Fisher Exact test, as appropriate.</p>
<sec id="section10-2048872612453924">
<title>Risk score calculation and categorization</title>
<p>RS were calculated in each patient from the corresponding prognostic variables scores (Supplementary Table 2). Both CRUSADE and ACTION RS were constructed to assign patient into five risk strata (very low, low, moderate, high, and very high risk), whereas the Mehran’s score categorize patients into four risk groups (low, moderate, high, and very high). For our study, patients were categorized into three bleeding risk strata for all scores by considering the very high and high risk categories as a unique category (high risk) and the very low and low risk categories as a low-risk category.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-2048872612453924">
<title>Prognostic accuracy of the risk scores</title>
<p>Discrimination and calibration were evaluated for each of the three scores for the prediction of its own major bleeding events and, in a separate analysis, for the prediction of TIMI serious bleeding. Discrimination, a measure of how well the model can separate cases from controls,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2048872612453924">12</xref></sup> was evaluated by receiver operating characteristics curves and expressed by the <italic>c-</italic>statistic. The discriminatory abilities of the three RS for TIMI serious bleeding were computed and compared according to the non-parametric method described by DeLong.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2048872612453924">13</xref></sup> Calibration, a measure of the agreement between observed and predicted outcomes, was assessed using the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2048872612453924">14</xref></sup> A significant <italic>p</italic>-value indicates a lack of fit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-2048872612453924">
<title>Missing data management</title>
<p>Risk scores could not be calculated in 105 (2.3%) patients. The main reason was the lack of records of heart rate at admission. These patients were excluded from the main analyses. To assess the impact of excluding these patients, we did a missing value analysis imputing the missing data. Little’s test was used to determine whether values were missing completely at random (Supplementary Table 5).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-2048872612453924">
<title>Sensitivity analysis</title>
<p>Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted after including patients who had died within 24 hours of admission, in order to evaluate overall performance of each RS in predicting TIMI bleeding events. For all analyses, a 2-sided <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. All data were processed using the SPSS 17.0 (Chicago, Illinois, USA) and MedCalc software (Mariakerke, Belgium).</p>

<title>Major bleeding rates</title>
<p>Major bleeding rates, according to ACTION and CRUSADE definitions, were 8.7% and 8.1%, respectively. In contrast, 10.3% experienced major bleeding as defined by the Mehran et al. score. Few patients received thrombolysis (2.2%) and coronary artery bypass grafting (4.9%). The rates of individual criteria of the bleeding definitions used in each RS are represented in Supplementary Table 3 – only a third of bleeding events were classed as having been at a vascular access site; most originated from gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or other sites.</p>

<title>Comparative performance of scoring systems using RS-specific major bleeding definitions</title>
<p>The observed bleeding rates in all RS increased monotonically from low- to high-risk categories.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the unselected and contemporary sample of ACS studied, ACTION, CRUSADE, and Mehran et al. bleeding RS performed well in the prediction of major bleeding as defined by each RS, although the greatest accuracy was obtained with the CRUSADE method. This was true not only for the population as a whole but also when considering STEMI and NSTEACS patients. In contrast, when using the neutral definition of TIMI serious bleeding, only the CRUSADE model, followed by the ACTION score, was able to discriminate patients with and without bleeding events well; however, the ACTION model was poorly calibrated. In addition, the observed CRUSADE and TIMI bleeding rates in patients classified as low risk using the CRUSADE system were the lowest in both the overall patient population and in both ACS types, suggesting that the CRUSADE system has the ability to classify as low risk only patients who are truly at low risk, with few events in such patients.</p>
<p>In this study, all RS performed equally well with regard to vascular access site used for coronary arteriography. This is an important finding since all RS were originally developed in patient cohorts in whom the femoral approach was principally used, and none has previously been validated for the radial approach which is now recommended in both coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2048872612453924">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2048872612453924">10</xref></sup> In our study, only a third of bleeding events were classed as having been at a vascular access site; most originated from gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or other sites. Because bleeds at these sites would not be expected to be altered by the method of angiography, it is not surprising that the three RS have performed well regardless of the method of angiography.</p>
<p>However, all RS showed a modest discrimination capacity (all c&lt;0.70) in patients who did not undergo coronary arteriography as well as in those patients previously on oral anticoagulant.</p>
<p>The present study is the first to compare predictive value in the three contemporary bleeding RS, using an independent dataset of ACS patients. Previously, the CRUSADE model was shown to perform well in a cohort of patients with NSTEMI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2048872612453924">15</xref></sup> However, the external validity of the CRUSADE score for STEMI had not previously been evaluated. Moreover, the comparative validity of CRUSADE with respect to the more recently developed ACTION and Mehran et al. bleeding RS was conspicuous by its absence.</p>
<p>The CRUSADE model is the preferred method for bleeding risk stratification which current European NSTEACS guidelines recommend to apply before initiating a management strategy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2048872612453924">9</xref></sup> However, both of the more recently developed ACTION and Mehran et al. RS offer the advantage of providing quantitative tools for assessing bleeding risk in a broader spectrum of ACS patients with acceptable discriminative abilities as was shown in their validation cohorts (c=0.71 and 0.74 for ACTION and Mehran et al., respectively). Because the CRUSADE score was developed in NSTEMI patients, with no data available for its performance in STEMI patients, it would have been difficult to convince a busy physician to use CRUSADE for NSTEMI patients while still using a different RS for STEMI patients. In our analysis, we found that the predictive ability of CRUSADE is not exclusively confined to NSTEMI patients. Recently, good stratification of bleeding risk in STEMI patients using the CRUSADE system has been also found by Kodakia et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2048872612453924">16</xref></sup> which is not surprising given that all the clinical variables used in the CRUSADE model are also potent prognosticators of bleeding development in the STEMI scenario.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2048872612453924">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2048872612453924">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The relative performance of the different RS can be explained by their respective composition. Both CRUSADE and ACTION RS outperformed Mehran et al. in our study, which is not surprising given that, in addition to the clinical variables in the Mehran et al. model,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2048872612453924">8</xref></sup> CRUSADE and ACTION also include several other variables, such as heart rate and systolic blood pressure at admission, history of vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure at presentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2048872612453924">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2048872612453924">7</xref></sup> All these variables have been demonstrated to be independent predictors of in-hospital bleeding occurrence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2048872612453924">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2048872612453924"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2048872612453924"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2048872612453924"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2048872612453924"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2048872612453924"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2048872612453924"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2048872612453924"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2048872612453924"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2048872612453924">10</xref></sup> Moreover, the CRUSADE and ACTION models are derived from ‘real-world’ population, in contrast to the more selected derivation population of the Mehran et al. model which might limit its generalizability. However, the differences in performance found in our study between the CRUSADE and ACTION scores might be attributable to how specific variables are coded, combined, and weighted in each RS.</p>
<p>Each of the three scores performed modestly in patients who did not undergo cardiac catheterization. This finding may be attributable to the underrepresentation, in the derivation populations of the three scores, of the subgroup of patients managed medically (without cardiac catheterization). Similarly, none of the three RS performed well in the subgroup of patients on home oral anticoagulant. The CRUSADE and Mehran et al. models excluded patients previously on oral anticoagulant, and it is therefore not surprising that the two scores have not performed well in these patients. However, the modest discrimination of the ACTION score – which includes the variable ‘home oral anticoagulant use’ – could be explained, at least partly, due to the fact that bleeding complications in patients on home oral anticoagulant depend also largely on management patterns (antithrombotic agents and invasive procedures) used according to the patient’s INR (international normalized ratio) levels at admission, not only on receiving or not home oral anticoagulant therapy.</p>

<title>Clinical implications</title>
<p>In the current era of risk-tailored and personalized cardiovascular care, studies on prediction models have been proliferated leading to multiple, overlapping, and competing RS. Authorities on clinical prediction rules advocate independent testing before their general clinical application.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2048872612453924">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2048872612453924">18</xref></sup> This is important since models with insufficient accuracy increase the likelihood that patients’ bleeding risks may be misclassified being particularly problematic, in prognostic terms, if high-risk patients are presumed to be low risk and vice versa. The superiority that we found of CRUSADE over the other RS suggests that CRUSADE could be better at stratifying global baseline bleeding risk in contemporary patients with ACS. Notably, such stratification becomes especially important in patients at high bleeding risk who are often at highest risk of thrombotic complications and who hence need a more careful treatment approach to maximize the efficacy of therapy to reduce thrombotic risk while reducing bleeding risk. In this regard, CRUSADE could help clinicians to identify those patients at increased risk of haemorrhagic complications who would potentially benefit from the use of effective treatments with lower risk of bleeding, e.g. low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, fondaparinux,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2048872612453924">19</xref></sup> and bivalirudin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2048872612453924">20</xref></sup> and from those strategies which have been shown to reduce the risk of bleeding, such as the use of the radial approach, and minimize the duration of the antithrombotic treatment exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2048872612453924">21</xref></sup> Because bleeding is associated with substantial risk of mortality and morbidity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2048872612453924">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2048872612453924"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2048872612453924"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2048872612453924"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2048872612453924"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2048872612453924">6</xref></sup> longer hospital stay,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2048872612453924">22</xref></sup> and increased economic costs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2048872612453924">23</xref></sup> all efforts should be made to reduce bleeding whenever possible. Although any score cannot replace the clinical evaluation, data from our study suggests that CRUSADE score represents an objective clinical tool which could lead to improvements in ACS care, including those with STEMI, by helping clinicians to make judicious treatment selections, prescribe appropriate doses of antithrombotic medications, and choose strategies that are most likely to reduce bleeding risk,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2048872612453924">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2048872612453924"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2048872612453924">21</xref></sup> thus optimizing patient-centred care and increasing the net clinical benefit.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>One limitation of this study is that which is inherent to retrospective studies. A further limitation of the study is its single-institution nature, as the management of patients is relatively homogenous which reduces the generalizability of our findings to populations with different therapeutic management patterns. Additionally, in this study the performance of the Mehran et al. score was assessed regarding in-hospital bleeding events while it was originally designed to predict 30-day bleeding. Finally, RS could not be calculated in 105 patients from our initial cohort, because of the absence of data for heart rate on admission. Although this fact could theoretically result in selection bias, missing data analysis showed that values were missing completely at random.</p>
<p>In conclusion, among patients hospitalized either for NSTEACS or STEMI who undergo coronary angiography, the CRUSADE bleeding risk index constitutes an accurate, robust, and well-calibrated risk-stratification tool for predicting haemorrhagic complications. However, the performance of the three existing bleeding RS in ACS is modest in patients managed medically as well as in those patients previously on oral anticoagulants.</p>
