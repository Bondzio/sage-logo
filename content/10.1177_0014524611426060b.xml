<p>High Moments</p>
<p>Some scholars believe that the Transfiguration story was originally about a post-resurrection experience, an appearance of the Risen Christ to the three disciples, Peter, James and John. But Mark places it in the life of Jesus, and weaves a strong thread through his gospel to hold it there securely. His weaving begins with the story of Jesus’s baptism, a high moment with its vision of a heavenly dove and God’s voice proclaiming Jesus “my Son, the Beloved” (1:10b-11).</p>
<p>Mark’s thread catches up Peter’s Confession of Jesus as Messiah (8:29), and Jesus’s disclosure that being Messiah means suffering. Then this scene: Jesus in dazzling white robes, the prophets Moses and Elijah nearby, and again the call of God “This is my Son, the Beloved; listen to him!” (9:7b). Mark weaves on through Jesus’s appearance before Caiaphas, the priests and elders. More voices, though not divine. “Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?” they demanded and Jesus replied, “I am” (14:61-62). On the thread runs to the crucifixion where Mark knots it off with the pagan Roman centurion staring at the dying Jesus just feet above him on the cross. Awed. Saying, ‘Truly this man was God’s son!’ (15:39). Scene after scene, image after image, of power and glory but also of betrayal and suffering–the lot of the Messiah, the Christ.</p>
<p>No matter when it happened, for Mark, the Transfiguration is God’s revelation of Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah of Jewish tradition. Mark wove the story into his account of Jesus’s life to convince his community that Jesus was the Messiah despite their understanding that the Messiah would come in glory, not die in disgrace. After Jesus’s ignominious death early Christians were anxious that sufferings for their new faith were justified. They wanted assurance that Jesus was The Real Thing, not just another prophet like Moses and Elijah.</p>
<p>For Peter, James and John the Transfiguration experience was a high moment though they didn’t recognise that. Mark shows us them afraid and confused. They hadn’t understood Jesus’s teaching of discipleship as suffering servanthood. Peter had enthusiastically acknowledged Jesus as the Messiah but tried to silence talk of suffering and death; Peter rebuked Jesus and was rebuked in turn (8:32-33). Mark later describes James and John, not discussing how as disciples they would serve the people, but wrangling over who would be the greatest in the expected glorious Messiah’s kingdom (10:35-37). And, finally, Mark tells us, all three fell asleep in the garden at Gethsemane, oblivious to the agony of their friend and teacher while he awaited arrest and execution (14:3-41). And yet these are the three who witnessed the extraordinary high moment of Jesus’s Transfiguration, who heard a voice telling them, “This is my Son, the Beloved; listen to him!”</p>
<p>High moments and lost opportunities for insight. They are there in all our lives. It is, I think, a rare soul who does not miss these moments, who can look into the face of God in a glimpse of time and be transfigured. There’s an old story of such a soul, a venerable old monk near the end of his days. Death hovered by his bed waiting to gather up the last breath. A young novice sat with the dying man, watching the peace of him. Would he have the strength and courage to live such a life? Or would such commitment be too much for him, bringing him bitterness not grace, denying him peace? Leaning close, he whispered, “Father, what is the secret of your peace?” The old man heard the anxiety of youth and a smile drifted across his dim old eyes. “I met God once,” he said. “I’ve been waiting for another meeting ever since.”</p>
<p>This wise old man had lived his life out of the grace of what some poetic soul called “the shining of remembered days.” Peter, God love him, was not such a rare insightful soul. A high moment of glimpsing the face of God did not transfigure him. He was undone by fear, not transformed by awe. And so he burbled on about how jolly it all was. “Let’s make ourselves comfortable, with tents for you three and so on.” Poor silly Peter. He might have been organising a picnic! “He did not know what to say,” Mark says apologetically, “for they were terrified” (9:6).</p>
<p>Peter was trying to make the shining moment permanent! But when we do that we are not transfigured. We are transfixed. The Transfiguration story reminds me of a favourite childhood game with my much-loved kaleidoscope. I spent hours gazing into it, captivated by the patterns the coloured glass made. With enormous care I would try to recapture patterns. Gently and minutely I’d turn the kaleidoscope back to catch the beauty I had just seen. My child’s mind thought that with time and patience I could recreate a pattern I had particularly loved. Of course I never did but I kept trying.</p>
<p>There are two ways we can react to the high moments. We can live in them. Or we can live out of them. When we live in them we are like Peter and the child-that-was-me experimenting with my kaleidoscope. We hold the image, transfixed by its beauty, trying to control it to make the high moment permanent. That was what Peter’s talk of tents was all about. And it destroyed the moment’s potential and the hope within the vision. On the other hand, when we live out of the high moments we are not enslaved. We can move on to the next moment because of the hope that shone from the first. Then we are like the old monk living out of “the shining of the remembered day” when he had encountered God. Or, like the child-that-was-me when I forgot the game and simply enjoyed each new pattern my kaleidoscope formed.</p>
<p>When we get stuck in the memory of the high moments it isn’t that we are not stirred by God. Often we are and want to shout of it. We speak of wanting to crystallise moments in time but in fact we bury them in blind cement where the flashing lights of crystal do not shine. Then we are frozen like ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. There is a huge danger of this frozenness for Christians. The whole story of who we are is grounded in “the shining of remembered days”–the days of Jesus. Whenever we say “this is our tradition”, or “this is what we believe”, or “this is who we are”, or “this is the way it’s always been done” we are in danger. In danger of locking ourselves into ideas or patterns descended from the shining high moments of remembered days but which might now be outmoded or irrelevant. We stunt ourselves spiritually if fights to retain favoured rituals or practices mean we miss the potential of the future, or fail to hear in the Transfiguration story God’s call to life: This is my Son, the Beloved; listen to him!”</p>
<p>Part of the problem is fear, as it was for Peter. Part is trying to avoid suffering. As it was for the young novice monk. But we can escape neither fear nor suffering. My kaleidoscope has a darkened side these days. I see through a glass darkly, as Paul would say (1 Cor 13:12, AV), although the shapes and colours of the glass are still visible through the shadow. So it is with the cross and its shadow across the world. Mark’s Transfiguration story doesn’t allow us to forget that the glory of the Easter Christ and the suffering of the Good Friday Jesus are inseparable.</p>
<p>It is easy for us to see the face of God in the glory stories of the Risen Christ. Easy to be transfixed. Much tougher to be transfigured by facing the cross’s reminder of how we so often encounter God’s face in the world. As the crucified suffering one in the faces of the lost, despised, homeless and helpless ones. Peter, James and John didn’t want to see that; neither do we. But that’s the task: to gaze on the suffering face of God, the man Jesus, who died on a dark Friday 2000 odd years ago that we might live out of the hope of the high moments. May God’s call “This is my Son, the Beloved; listen to him!” come to us from the shining of both a remembered dark day of death and a remembered Easter day of glory. And, like the old monk and the Roman centurion, may we be transfigured.</p>
