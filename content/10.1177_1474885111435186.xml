<p><bold>Ayten Gündoğdu</bold> is an assistant professor in the Department of Political Science at Barnard College, Columbia University. Her current research centers on critical approaches to human rights, contemporary problems of citizenship, political and ethical dilemmas of international migration. She is working on a book manuscript that draws on the work of Hannah Arendt and analyzes the paradoxes of human rights for the purposes of understanding the contemporary problems and rights struggles of asylum-seekers, refugees, and undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p><bold>Dustin Ells Howes</bold> is Assistant Professor of Political Science at Louisiana State University. His research spans ancient, modern and contemporary political theory but the organizing theme of his work is the problem of violence and the possibilities of nonviolence. He has published on the life and death of states in International Studies Quarterly, the politics of Auschwitz in Holocaust and Genocide Studies and conservative democratic thought and torture in Human Rights Review. His first book, Toward a Credible Pacifism (SUNY Press, 2009) argues that violence is no more reliable than other methods of conducting politics and develops a distinctive conception of political power and action drawing on Hannah Arendt, Mahatma Gandhi and Socrates. His next book length project will explore the relationship between freedom and violence.</p>
<p><bold>Guido Parietti</bold> has recently completed is Ph.D. in political philosophy, with a dissertation on deliberative democracy, at the Department of Philosophy of Sapienza - University of Rome. He is currently working on a research project concerning the tension between democracy and the rule of law.</p>
