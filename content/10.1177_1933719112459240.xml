Considering that inflammasomes are involved in sensing pathogens and in triggering inflammatory and immune response, we hypothesized that they could also act in the placenta as an efficient innate mechanism during pregnancy infections. For this reason the activation of inflammasome was tested in 3 human placental cell populations in the presence of a common gram-negative compound (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]).

Moreover, LPS induced secretion of IL-1β from CTBs and DSCs. These results suggest the involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome in the placental innate response.
