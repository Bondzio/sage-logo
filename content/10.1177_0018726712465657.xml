<abstract>
<p>In western economies with aging populations, organizations are increasingly challenged to understand and manage employees’ retirement expectations. At the same time, employees’ relationships to retirement decisions and the age at which they expect to retire are likely to change as their careers unfold. This article seeks to inform the careers and management literatures on factors contributing to retirement intentions at different career stages. Using a sample of mid- and late career professionals with MBAs, we find that mid-career professionals expect to retire three years earlier than those in late career (age 62 versus age 65.) Work centrality is associated with intentions to retire later, while positive retirement attitudes and higher income are associated with intentions to retire earlier. Furthermore, the expected retirement age is more sensitive to income at mid-career (than at late career) and is more sensitive to work centrality at late career (than at mid-career). We discuss implications for careers research and for human resource management practice.</p>

<p>An aging labor force and the expected retirement of large numbers of older workers presage changes in existing workplace arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712465657">Feldman, 2007</xref>). In light of long-term demographic trends, improving health among older workers, and the 2008–9 economic crisis, human resource (HR) experts see weaknesses in their approach to retirement planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0018726712465657">Society for Human Resource Management, 2009</xref>). Careers researchers, too, have noted inadequacies in viewing retirement as the final transition out of continuous and upwardly mobile occupational histories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726712465657">Moen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0018726712465657">Reitman and Schneer, 2008</xref>). Retirement, particularly early retirement, has been recast as ‘adulthood’s great project of deferred gratification’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726712465657">Eckerdt, 2004</xref>: 3) rather than disengagement. Policy makers in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, confronted with shifting demographics, growing public expenditures, and shrinking workforces are looking for ways to delay retirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0018726712465657">Phillipson, 2011</xref>). Given these circumstances, it has become urgent not only to re-examine the factors affecting retirement age expectations, but also to identify the respective strengths of traditional predictors of retirement among late career employees as well as among those at mid-career.</p>
<p>The nascent body of management research on retirement has focused primarily on the decision to retire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726712465657">Feldman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018726712465657">Mollica and Dewitt, 2000</xref>), retirement age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726712465657">Beehr et al., 2000</xref>), and retirees’ choice of partial or full retirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726712465657">Kim and DeVaney, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726712465657">Kim and Feldman, 2000</xref>). This research tends to focus on older workers. However, the increasing variability in retirement patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726712465657">Han and Moen, 1999</xref>) suggests that retirement expectations are shaped throughout the life course, not just late in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726712465657">Eckerdt et al., 2000</xref>). The active aging paradigm also argues that aging and retirement questions concern a larger population than just older workers. In the USA, the active aging paradigm emerged in the 1960s as an alternate paradigm to that of ‘retirement as decline.’ Early active aging policies aimed at prolonging the careers of older workers by focusing narrowly on delaying the moment of retirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0018726712465657">Salomon and Hilsen, 2011</xref>). However, modern models for managing older workers are more holistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0018726712465657">Phillipson, 2011</xref>). For example, the World Health Organization’s approach to aging has been characterized as ‘a general lifestyle strategy for the preservation of physical and mental health as people age rather than just trying to make them work longer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0018726712465657">Walker, 2006</xref>: 84). Thus, holistic models of workforce management require an understanding of the predictors of retirement intentions not only for late career employees but also for employees at mid-career.</p>
<p>In contrast to the retirement literature’s focus on late career, careers research has focused more on individuals in early and mid-career stages to explain how psychological states and tasks affect employment decisions at different career stages. We propose that this research should also incorporate late career employees. The demographic changes underway in many developed economies mean not only that the number of older, late career workers is increasing, but, more radically, that the median age of the labor force is climbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726712465657">Davey, 2002</xref>). Consequently, the number of workers at mid- and at late career stage is increasing. If organizations want to capitalize on their workforce investments and prevent skills shortages, they must adequately respond to this demographic change. Yet, career theories have not considered how different career stages and their psychological tasks, values, and preoccupations affect the strength of traditional predictors of retirement. This study contributes to both the retirement and the careers literatures by including mid-career workers in retirement research and late career workers in careers research.</p>
<p>We draw on rational choice theory, career stage theories, image theory, role theory, and personal control theory, in developing our hypotheses around retirement predictors. Rational choice theory, a prominent theory in the retirement literature, posits that wealth and health are the key drivers of individual retirement decisions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726712465657">Hatcher, 2003</xref>). Other theoretical frameworks in the retirement literature suggest additional mechanisms in the retirement decision process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726712465657">Barnes-Farrell, 2003</xref>). For example, image theory proponents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726712465657">Beach and Frederickson, 1989</xref>) argue that individuals draw on their past and present circumstances and on their future goals and expectations to make decisions about future courses of action, such as retirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726712465657">Feldman, 1994</xref>). Image theory suggests that maintaining one’s self-image is an important objective in individual decision making. Similarly, role theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726712465657">Ashforth and Mael, 1989</xref>) proposes that self-worth derived from performing a particular role is contingent on one’s investment in that role. For example, individuals for whom work is highly central in their lives will find it more difficult to abandon their work role. Retirement attitudes, that is, the extent to which one perceives retirement as the relinquishing of personal control, also influence retirement decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726712465657">Barnes-Farrell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726712465657">Heckhausen and Schulz, 1995</xref>). Career stage theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726712465657">Dalton et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726712465657">Levinson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0018726712465657">Super, 1980</xref>) propose that psychological tasks, values, preoccupations, and relational responsibilities change as individuals move through career stages, raising the question of how career stage may relate to the decision to retire.</p>
<p>Drawing on retirement research, career stage theories, rational choice theory, image theory, role theory, and personal control theory, we contribute to careers and retirement research by seeking to determine: (1) how career stages affect retirement age expectations; (2) how individual characteristics (gender, work centrality, retirement attitudes, and health) and job-specific attributes (income, job satisfaction, discrimination) also shape the age at which workers expect to retire; and finally (3) how career stage moderates the relationships between individual characteristics, job attributes, and expected retirement age. The retirement literature also contemplates organizational factors (e.g. flexible job options, financial incentives), and socio-economic factors (social norms about retirement, national social security system, government policies and programs, tax laws, national economic growth) as predictors of retirement intentions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726712465657">Feldman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0018726712465657">Wang and Shultz, 2010</xref>). In this study, we use company size as a proxy to control for organizational factors. National environmental factors are controlled because our study is US-based.</p>
<p>We utilize a sample of mid- and late career MBA alumni from three northeastern US universities to examine the relationship between career stage, individual characteristics, job attributes, and expected retirement age. We expect the findings from this study to have implications for workforce planning and making productive use of employees throughout their life course.</p>

<title>Career stages and expected retirement age</title>
<p>Career stages are conceptualized as distinct periods of psychological and behavioral exploration, adaptation, and stabilization following pivotal work and non-work-related events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0018726712465657">Super, 1980</xref>), age-related transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726712465657">Levinson, 1978</xref>), or professional development stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712465657">Dalton and Thompson, 1986</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0018726712465657">Super (1957)</xref> proposes four career stages: establishment, advancement, maintenance, and decline. While Super defines career stages as psychological stages characterized by specific career attitudes, in practice, research has usually used age to delineate them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018726712465657">Ornstein and Isabella, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726712465657">Levinson (1978)</xref> offers three 20-year life stages: early adulthood, middle adulthood, and late adulthood, each subdivided into four five-year stages. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712465657">Dalton and Thompson (1986)</xref> propose four stages of professional development: apprentice, colleague, mentor, and sponsor. Stage-based career models have now incorporated protean and boundaryless career views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0018726712465657">Reitman and Schneer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0018726712465657">Sullivan, 1999</xref>), arguing that the career stage cycle may be negotiated multiple times over the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726712465657">Hall and Mirvis, 1996</xref>). We consider here how career stages may affect retirement age expectations.</p>
<p>The focal psychological task in mid-career is the advancement and maintenance of one’s work-related image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0018726712465657">Super, 1957</xref>), which involves the enhancement and affirmation of the work-related self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726712465657">Gibson, 2003</xref>). The values that dominate the mid-career stage are instrumental (e.g. financial stability, promotion, status) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0018726712465657">Ryff and Baltes, 1976</xref>). In contrast, late career is considered a period of decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0018726712465657">Super, 1957</xref>) and work disengagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726712465657">Greller and Simpson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0018726712465657">Robson et al., 2006</xref>). Late career psychological tasks include developing a self-image independent from work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0018726712465657">Super, 1957</xref>), finding new ways of engaging oneself with society, and questioning the life structure adopted in earlier life stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726712465657">Levinson, 1978</xref>). The values emphasized in late career tend to be terminal (e.g. world peace, the end of poverty) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0018726712465657">Ryff and Baltes, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>Differences in psychological tasks, values, and preoccupations proposed by career stage models suggest that individuals at mid-career, who are heavily invested in their work roles, expect to retire later than those at late career who are separating themselves psychologically from their work role and exploring alternate, non-work-related self-concepts. Hence the following hypothesis:</p>
<list id="list1-0018726712465657" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>H1a</italic>: The expected retirement age will be lower at late career than at mid-career.</p></list-item></list>
<p>However, the professional development career stage theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712465657">Dalton and Thompson, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726712465657">Dalton et al., 1977</xref>) suggests a competing hypothesis. This career model identifies dominant professional relationships that develop at different career stages and suggests that the primary professional relationship at mid-career is that of mentoring and assuming responsibility for others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712465657">Dalton and Thompson, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726712465657">Dalton et al., 1977</xref>) and, at the same time, managing upward relationships. In late career, in contrast, the primary professional relationship is that of sponsor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712465657">Dalton and Thompson, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726712465657">Dalton et al., 1977</xref>), which involves providing direction for the organization and developing relationships outside the organization. The late career sponsor role may be a less stressful role than mentoring and assuming responsibility for others. In addition, the mid-life crisis, identified as a critical psychological task and life transition is a defining moment in the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726712465657">Levinson, 1978</xref>). The mid-life crisis leads individuals at mid-career (but not late career) to question their self-concept and consider alternate work and non-work roles. The conceptualization of late career as decline and disengagement has also been questioned, notably by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712465657">Hall (2002)</xref>, who suggests that the traditional notion of a career as a single linear trajectory has been replaced by a series of career cycles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712465657">Hall’s (2002)</xref> reconceptualization of careers suggests that individuals may experience personal and professional growth in the later stages of their careers and engage in a new learning cycle, rather than disengage altogether. Hence, a competing hypothesis:</p>
<list id="list2-0018726712465657" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>H 1b</italic>: The expected retirement age will be higher at late career than at mid-career.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The competing hypothesized relationships between expected retirement age and career stage (H1a, H1b) are shown in the model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018726712465657">Figure 1</xref>. H1a and H1b both relate to the relationship between career stage and expected retirement age. The negative sign for H1a illustrates the hypothesis that late career stage is associated with lower expected retirement age. The positive sign for H1b illustrates the hypothesis that late career stage is associated with higher expected retirement age.</p>

<title>Individual characteristics</title>
<p><italic>Gender</italic> Three important theoretical considerations undergird the empirical research on women’s retirement decisions: the relational emphasis in women’s careers, women’s caregiving roles, and structural and economic constraints that diminish women’s earnings. The relational emphasis suggests that women think of their careers as embedded in a web of relationships, have a more fluid view of the boundaries between work and non-work, and develop a sense of self that is tied both to their work and non-work roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712465657">O’Neil and Bilimoria, 2005</xref>). This may be why women appear more likely than men to think of retirement as an opportunity to fulfill roles that they neglected during their work years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726712465657">Anson et al., 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Role theory suggests that women’s caregiving roles impact their expected retirement age. Multiple roles lead to role strain, because they make competing demands on time, deplete energy, and require incompatible behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726712465657">Greenhaus and Beutell, 1985</xref>). For working women, one of the consequences of their role as primary caregivers is that they often find themselves working a second shift regardless of their income level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726712465657">Hays, 1996</xref>). Given the various strains involved with their dual roles as workers and caregivers, women seem to perceive more gains than men in exiting the workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726712465657">Anson et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726712465657">Frieze et al., 2011</xref>). Role theory also proposes that self-worth derived from performing a particular role is contingent on one’s investment in that role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726712465657">Ashforth and Mael, 1989</xref>). Employees heavily involved in multiple roles (e.g. work, family) tend to view retirement more positively than those invested only in their work role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0018726712465657">Wheaton, 1990</xref>), because the prospect of identity loss is less threatening when multiple roles define one’s identity.</p>
<p>There are also structural and economic constraints that contribute to women having lower earnings than men. Due to labor market interruptions and periods of part-time employment (often associated with childcare) and the fact that women tend to hold jobs that are less well-paid and offer fewer benefits than those men hold (even at similar educational attainment levels), women have established less wealth than men over the life course (including lower pension benefits) and may therefore seek to delay retirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726712465657">Kim and DeVaney, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the three considerations underlying the research on women’s retirement decisions, the first two suggest that women will expect to retire earlier than men. In contrast, the earnings consideration would predict that women anticipate retiring later than men. However, economic differences may be blunted when women rely on spousal income, wealth, or benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0018726712465657">Szinovacz and Deviney, 2000</xref>). Hence, we posit:</p>
<list id="list3-0018726712465657" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>H2</italic>: Women will expect to retire earlier than men.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Research on women’s careers suggests that their interests and needs shift as they progress through their career. At mid-career, women tend to engage in ‘pragmatic career endurance,’ a stage where they are realistic about their careers, doing what needs to be done to produce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712465657">O’Neil and Bilimoria, 2005</xref>), and are more likely to seek balance among their work and family responsibilities than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726712465657">Mainiero and Sullivan, 2005</xref>). In contrast, in late career stages, women can finally focus on their careers since their children are grown, and thus they prize reinvention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712465657">O’Neil and Bilimoria, 2005</xref>) and seek authenticity in their careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726712465657">Mainiero and Sullivan, 2005</xref>). Men in late career stages seem to take stock of their lives and seek more balance between their work and non-work roles. Taken together, this suggests:</p>

<p><italic>Work centrality in life</italic> Work centrality, the extent to which work or working is important to an individual’s self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0018726712465657">Super, 1953</xref>), shapes work-related behaviors. Among lottery winners, for example, those with high work centrality are more likely to continue working after winning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726712465657">Arvey et al., 2004</xref>). Because individuals derive self-worth from performing roles in which they are most heavily invested, they are reluctant to abandon roles central to their identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726712465657">Ashforth and Mael, 1989</xref>). We posit that individuals for whom work is central in life intend to retire later than those for whom work is less central.</p>

<p>Work centrality tends to decline from mid- to late career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726712465657">Lorence and Mortimer, 1985</xref>). In addition, the relationship between work centrality and expected retirement age may be stronger at late career than at mid-career, because low work centrality may amplify late career work disengagement. When late career workers also have low work centrality, they may be much more likely to think about retiring compared with workers at mid-career. Thus:</p>

<p><italic>Retirement attitudes</italic> Retirement attitudes are cognitive evaluations of retirement shaped by factors such as social background, self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726712465657">Mutran et al., 1997</xref>), work conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0018726712465657">Sutinena et al., 2005</xref>), social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726712465657">Barnes-Farrell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726712465657">Heckhausen and Schulz, 1995</xref>), and pension expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726712465657">Mutran et al., 1997</xref>). These cognitive evaluations reflect a general orientation toward retirement and help predict expected retirement age independently of material or health circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726712465657">Morrow, 1982</xref>). Positive attitudes toward retirement are associated with more retirement planning activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726712465657">Kim and Moen, 2001</xref>), thereby increasing the likelihood that retirement occurs earlier rather than later in life. Hence:</p>

<p>Research on the relationship between attitudes and behaviors suggests two reasons for expecting a stronger relationship between retirement attitudes and retirement age at late career compared with mid-career. First, the relationship between attitudes and behaviors is strongest when the attitudes are easily accessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0018726712465657">Tversky and Kahneman, 1974</xref>), that is, when the amount of thought about the attitude object is greater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726712465657">Glasman and Albarracín, 2006</xref>). Late career psychological processes such as work disengagement and the development of a late career self-concept independent from work are likely to correspond to an increase in the amount of thought about retirement. Second, the attitude-behavior relationship is strengthened when the object of the attitude is personally and continuously relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712465657">Ajzen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726712465657">Glasman and Albarracín, 2006</xref>). At mid-career, when employees are still focused on maintaining their work-related self-concept, retirement is less likely to be personally and continuously relevant than in late career, when employees have more direct and indirect experience with retirement-related issues. For both of these reasons, we expect:</p>
<list id="list8-0018726712465657" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>H4m</italic>: The relationship between retirement attitudes and expected retirement age will be stronger at late career than at mid-career.</p></list-item></list>
<p><italic>Health</italic> Health greatly influences the retirement decisions of older workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0018726712465657">Topa et al., 2009</xref>). Typically, individuals who self-report health problems also expect to retire earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726712465657">Dwyer and Mitchell, 1999</xref>). Because poor health may impair work performance and because poor health may be a consequence of work demands, we anticipate poor health to be associated with earlier expectations of retirement. Conversely, we anticipate that individuals who perceive themselves to be healthy expect to retire later than those who perceive themselves to be in poor health,</p>
<list id="list9-0018726712465657" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>H5</italic>: Good health will be positively associated with expected retirement age.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Feeling in good health, relative to one’s peers, has different meanings at different career stages. Social comparisons appear to be more self-enhancing at late career stages than at earlier career stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726712465657">Gibson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0018726712465657">Sargent-Cox et al., 2010</xref>). At early and mid-career, comparison is often with similar others. At later career stages, individuals prefer to compare themselves with dissimilar others and, in particular, with others who display more negative attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726712465657">Gibson, 2003</xref>). This difference in comparison other at mid- and late career may lead to an overestimation of one’s health compared with others at late career and, in turn, to expectations of retiring later. In addition, individuals tend to adjust their job situation to their health, so that they can perform within the limits of their abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726712465657">McGarry, 2004</xref>). When the fit between health and job demands is acceptable, health becomes less of a consideration in retirement decisions. Older workers are more likely than younger workers to accommodate a loss (e.g. diminished health) by adjusting themselves to, rather than changing, their work situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0018726712465657">Robson et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, the health-job fit may be better among older workers, making health a less salient consideration in late career retirement expectations than it may be at mid-career. For all of those reasons we hypothesize the following:</p>
<list id="list10-0018726712465657" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>H5m</italic>: The relationship between good health and expected retirement age will be stronger at mid-career than at late career.</p></list-item></list>

<sec id="section4-0018726712465657">
<title>Job attributes</title>
<p><italic>Income</italic> Financial considerations are instrumental in retirement decisions. Rational choice theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726712465657">Hatcher, 2003</xref>) argues that the retirement decision involves the decision of whether to allocate time, a scarce resource, to paid work (and increase savings) or leisure (and consume savings). Given these considerations, wealthy individuals typically decide to retire earlier than less wealthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726712465657">Hatcher, 2003</xref>). While yearly income is just one indicator of overall wealth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0018726712465657">Zhan et al., 2009</xref>), it is one of the few available to organizations as a lever in managing employee retirement decisions, and hence was chosen in this study. Individuals with lower incomes may need to work longer in order to maintain their lifestyle than those with higher incomes. In addition, those with lower incomes will have smaller pensions and will have had less opportunity to save for retirement than those with higher incomes. Hence, we anticipate that individuals with higher incomes expect to retire earlier than those with lower incomes.</p>
<list id="list11-0018726712465657" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>H6</italic>: Income will be negatively associated with expected retirement age.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The strength of the negative relationship between income and expected retirement age will vary by career stage due to shifts in values and finances. Instrumental values (e.g. financial stability) are most prominent in mid-career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0018726712465657">Ryff and Baltes, 1976</xref>), thus the relationship between income and expected retirement age will likely be stronger at mid-career than at late career. In addition, in late career, income is just one of multiple financial indicators, as personal savings, individual retirement savings plans, or employer pensions are likely to be larger among late career individuals compared with those at mid-career. Social security benefits in the USA are expected to account for a smaller percentage of retirement income in the future. Therefore, mid-career individuals may anticipate having to rely much more on savings, which will seem more feasible for those with higher incomes. Thus, the expectation is:</p>
<list id="list12-0018726712465657" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>H6m</italic>: The negative relationship between income and expected retirement age will be stronger at mid-career than at late career.</p></list-item></list>
<p><italic>Job satisfaction</italic> Because job satisfaction is prominently associated with employment decisions, it has received considerable attention in retirement research. The majority of empirical evidence suggests that the more satisfied people are with their jobs, the less likely they are to retire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0018726712465657">Topa et al., 2009</xref>) or to plan for retirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726712465657">Kosloski et al., 2001</xref>). A recent meta-analysis found job satisfaction to be negatively associated with retirement attitudes, but not to be associated with retirement decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0018726712465657">Zhan et al., 2009</xref>). Because expected retirement age is a behavioral intention and is related to retirement planning, and because it also has an attitudinal component, we anticipate a positive relationship between job satisfaction and expected retirement age.</p>
<list id="list13-0018726712465657" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>H7</italic>: Job satisfaction will be positively associated with expected retirement age.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Because it is more difficult for a dissatisfied employee to change jobs at late career than it is at mid-career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726712465657">Cohen, 1993</xref>), we expect retirement to be a more likely response to dissatisfaction at late career than at mid-career. Another reason why the influence of job satisfaction on expected retirement age may be less pronounced at mid-career is that individuals’ feelings about their current job are more likely to affect decisions about their next career step (e.g. changing jobs), rather than a career step further in the future (e.g. retirement).</p>

<p><italic>Perceived discrimination</italic> Similar to other stressors, perceived discrimination creates strains that lead to higher turnover intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0018726712465657">Perrewé et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0018726712465657">Podsakoff et al., 2007</xref>). Retirement intentions, like turnover intentions, are a form of organizational withdrawal. Therefore, we anticipate a negative relationship between perceived discrimination and expected retirement age. Individuals who feel discriminated against in their career may experience lower work-related self-esteem, perceive a narrower range of work options, devalue the domain in which they are being negatively perceived by others (e.g. work), and develop positive feelings toward retirement as a coping strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726712465657">Desmette and Gaillard, 2008</xref>). Hence, one would expect that individuals who report having experienced discrimination at work plan to retire earlier than those who do not report having experienced discrimination at work.</p>
<list id="list15-0018726712465657" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>H8</italic>: Perceived discrimination will be negatively associated with expected retirement age.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Research on socio-emotional selectivity indicates that social networks shrink as individuals move into late career stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726712465657">Greller and Simpson, 1999</xref>). Instrumental ties, especially, lose prominence. The shrinking of social networks and the loss of instrumental ties make it especially difficult to handle work discrimination. Furthermore, perceived discrimination, which may be associated with fewer mobility opportunities and unfavorable work conditions, may lead to a more positive appeal of retiring among those at late career, for whom structural limitations to finding another job are greatest.</p>

<p>This research is part of the Managerial Career Path Project conducted by the authors over more than 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726712465657">Reitman and Schneer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0018726712465657">Schneer and Reitman, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0018726712465657">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0018726712465657">2006</xref>). This article draws on the fourth wave of data collection, in which we asked several questions relating to retirement. We surveyed alumni from the MBA programs of three northeastern US universities in 2007. The response rate was 59 percent (56% for the late career respondents and 60% for mid-career respondents). Because retirement decisions for the self-employed differ considerably from those of employees, we constrained our sample to MBAs who were full-time employees (not self-employed) at the time of the survey, resulting in a sample size of 441. Thirty-nine percent of respondents were women. On average, respondents reported expecting to retire at age 63. Their average income was US$185,700. We refer to the respondents in our study as ‘professionals,’ as they are MBAs with careers as accountants, managers, lawyers, bankers, consultants, IT professionals, educators, advertising/marketing professionals, finance professionals, HR professionals, and top executives.</p>

<p><italic>Career stages</italic> Our operationalization of career stages draws on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0018726712465657">Super’s (1980)</xref> insight that individual career decisions (e.g. pursuing and completing an MBA) mark career transitions. This perspective is also held by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712465657">Dalton and Thompson (1986)</xref>, who define career stages in terms of professional tenure (e.g. time since MBA degree). Our operationalization also considers age-based psychological adjustments that mark the transition between life stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726712465657">Levinson, 1978</xref>), notably turning 50, which signals the beginning of late career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726712465657">Greller and Simpson, 1999</xref>). We operationalized career stages using years since completion of the MBA as well as age. Late career respondents (<italic>n</italic> = 174) received their MBA on average 30 years prior to the survey and were 50–78 years old (mean age = 56). Mid-career respondents (<italic>n</italic> = 267) received their MBA on average 15 years prior to the survey and were 36 to 49 years old (mean age = 43). Career stage is dummy coded with 0 = mid-career and 1 = late career.</p>
<p><italic>Individual characteristics</italic> Gender was self-reported and dummy coded (0 = male and 1 = female). Work Centrality was measured with the meaning of work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018726712465657">Meaning of Working [MOW] International Research Team, 1987</xref>) item: ‘How important and significant is working in your total life?’ (1 = one of the least important things, to 5 = one of the most important things). Retirement attitudes were measured as the extent of agreement on a five-point scale with five statements about retirement. Respondents indicated whether they saw retirement as something to be avoided, something to be enjoyed, an opportunity to do new things, a time to relax, or a period of frustration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726712465657">Gee and Baillie, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018726712465657">Goudy et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726712465657">Goudy et al., 1980</xref>). The five items (reverse coded where appropriate) loaded onto one factor (α = 0.82) and were averaged into a scale with higher scores indicating more positive attitudes toward retirement. The self-rated, age-comparative measure of Health consists of a single item: ‘How do you rate your health compared with other people your age?’ (1 = poor to 4 = excellent) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726712465657">Kim and Feldman, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Job attributes</italic> Our measure of Income included salary plus bonus. To record their yearly income (i.e. salary and bonus), respondents were provided with 23 income range options, in increments of 10 thousand US dollars, starting at 40 thousand and ending at 260 thousand dollars. An open-ended response field was provided for those whose salary plus bonus was below or above the provided ranges. We performed a logarithmic transformation for the income measure and used the natural log of income in our analyses. We measured Job Satisfaction with three questions that capture how often respondents feel satisfied about their jobs, how much they like their job, and how they believe their satisfaction compares with that of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726712465657">McNichols et al., 1978</xref>). The three items loaded on a single factor and were averaged into a scale of satisfaction (α = 0.89) ranging from 1 = low to 7 = high.</p>
<p>Perceived Discrimination was assessed with a measure adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726712465657">Curran (1977)</xref> by asking respondents to report if they believed that they have been denied a position or a promotion because of discrimination in recent years (type of discrimination was purposefully left unspecified because it is the perceived experience of discrimination, rather than the specific type of discrimination, that is expected to affect behavioral intentions of retirement). Three response options were provided. We ordered them to measure the intensity of perceived discrimination (1 = no, 2 = not sure, and 3 = yes). Because the discrimination variable was skewed toward ‘no discrimination,’ we used the natural log of discrimination in our analyses.</p>
<p><italic>Control variable</italic> Company size is an important proxy for organizational factors affecting retirement decisions. For example, larger firms are more likely than smaller ones to offer early retirement incentives, defined benefit plans, and defined contribution plans, all of which seem to increase the propensity to retire and lower the expected retirement age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726712465657">Gruber and Madrian, 1995</xref>). Therefore, we control for company size in all the analyses. Respondents self-reported their Company Size in terms of the number of employees. Eight company size ranges were offered (from 1 = 1–9 employees to 8 = 25,000 or more.)</p>

<p>Career stage is statistically significantly correlated with expected retirement age (<italic>r</italic> = .21, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01), company size (<italic>r</italic> = -.13, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01), gender (<italic>r</italic> = .12, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05), work centrality (<italic>r</italic> = .17, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01), retirement attitude (<italic>r</italic> = -.17, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01), and health (<italic>r</italic> = .11, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05). Further examination utilizing <italic>t</italic>-tests to compare the variable means by career stage revealed a number of statistically significant career stage differences. Late career MBAs expect to retire three years later than those at mid-career (age 64.8 versus age 61.8, respectively; <italic>p ≤</italic> 0.001). The MBAs in late career work at smaller companies (5.73 versus 6.26; <italic>p ≤</italic> 0.01), are more likely to be female (46% versus 35%; <italic>p ≤</italic> 0.05), report greater work centrality (4.01 versus 3.76; <italic>p ≤</italic> 0.001), more negative retirement attitudes (3.94 versus 4.16; <italic>p ≤</italic> 0.001), and better health (3.33 versus 3.17; <italic>p ≤</italic> 0.05) than those in mid-career.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018726712465657">Table 2</xref> displays the results of four hierarchical regression models for expected retirement age. Results for the first regression model that only considers the relationship with career stage, while controlling for company size (step 1), indicate that the expected retirement age is higher at late career than at mid-career. This result provides support for H1b. Career stage and company size explain a statistically significant amount of variance in expected retirement age (adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.07; <italic>p ≤</italic> 0.001). In the second step, we add the individual characteristics to the model. Including these factors led to a large change in the explained variance of expected retirement age (change in <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.14; <italic>p ≤</italic> 0.001), while the coefficient for career stage remains statistically significant. Consistent with H4, individuals with more positive retirement attitudes expect to retire earlier than those who have negative views about retirement. Gender, work centrality, and health did not significantly contribute to the model.

</table-wrap>
<p>Including job attributes in the third step of our model yielded a statistically significant change in <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> and an overall adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of 0.25 (<italic>p ≤</italic> 0.001). The career stage difference in expected retirement age decreases, but remains statistically significant even after accounting for job attributes. Our data lend support to H6: individuals with higher income expected to retire earlier than individuals earning less. In addition, when job attributes are accounted for, work centrality gains statistical significance. That is, when all things are equal in terms of job attributes, greater work centrality is associated with higher expected retirement age, supporting H3. Finally, job satisfaction and perceived discrimination were not associated with expected retirement age with any statistical significance in step 3. Retirement attitudes continue to be a statistically significant predictor of expected retirement age.</p>
<p>The fourth and last step in our model was the inclusion of the interaction terms to test for the moderating effect of career stage on the relationship between the individual and job attributes and expected retirement age. Including the interaction terms yielded a statistically significant change in <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of 0.03 (<italic>p ≤</italic> 0.01). This regression model (step 4) accounted for 27 percent of the variance in expected retirement age. Only one interaction term is significant. The relationship between income and expected retirement age is moderated by career stage. Because the sample size limits the statistical power in the analyses, the seven interaction effects were also tested with separate models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726712465657">Aguinis et al., 2005</xref>). Regression results for the models assessing the interaction effects independently from each other are reported in the last two columns of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018726712465657">Table 2</xref> for the interaction terms that are statistically significant. As expected, the interaction between career stage and income was statistically significant in predicting expected retirement age (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05). Furthermore, the additional analyses also revealed that the interaction between career stage and work centrality was marginally statistically significant in predicting expected retirement age (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.10) as shown in the last column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018726712465657">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>Both of these interactions were plotted following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726712465657">Aiken and West (1996)</xref> and are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018726712465657">Figure 2</xref>. The relationship between income and retirement age is negative at both mid-career and late career but the relationship is stronger at mid-career, supporting H6m. The relationship between work centrality and retirement age is positive at both mid-career and late career but the relationship is stronger at late career, supporting H3m.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study indicate that mid-career MBAs expect to retire three years earlier than those in late career (age 62 versus 65). These results broadly support the model of active aging as an alternate paradigm to the notion of late career as a period of decline. In addition, the finding that, except for work centrality and income, the relationships between retirement predictors and retirement intentions are of similar strength at mid- and late career suggests that levers used to delay the retirement age of late career MBAs may similarly help delay the age at which mid-career MBAs consider retiring.</p>
<sec id="section11-0018726712465657">
<title>Career stages and expected retirement age</title>
<p>This study informs the careers theory of the need, moving forward, to consider not just late career but also mid-career employees in models of retirement decisions. Our finding that mid-career MBAs seem to consider retiring earlier than late career MBAs also helps resolve contradictory expectations from different career theories about the relationship between career stage and retirement intentions. The results call into question traditional career stage theory, which anticipates late career individuals to more readily disengage from work than those at mid-career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0018726712465657">Robson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0018726712465657">Super, 1957</xref>). However, this finding is consistent with the professional development career stage theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712465657">Dalton and Thompson, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726712465657">Dalton et al., 1977</xref>). It is conceivable that the relational responsibilities required in mid-career (mentoring and managing upwards) may be associated with thoughts of retiring more so than the relational roles at late career. For example, the late career sponsor role is more detached and therefore requires less intense and less frequent interactions than the mid-career mentor role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712465657">Dalton and Thompson, 1986</xref>). Also, the late career role of providing direction for the organization requires taking a broad perspective and lengthening one’s time horizon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726712465657">Dalton et al., 1977</xref>), which imply stepping back from the day-to-day operations of the organization and its associated chronic stress. This finding that mid-career MBAs seem to consider retiring earlier than late career MBAs also aligns with life stage theory: the process of managing the mid-life crisis (i.e. turning 40), identified as a critical psychological task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726712465657">Levinson, 1978</xref>), may be especially likely to lead individuals at mid-career to consider alternate roles to their current work situation.</p>
<p>Because of the difficulty of distinguishing career stages from age and generational differences, it is possible that our finding reflects a more positive view of retirement and aging among younger generations (mid-career) for whom work is less central in life than it is for older generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0018726712465657">Twenge, 2010</xref>). In our sample, the retirement attitudes of the mid-career MBAs were more positive than the attitudes of the late career MBAs. Compared with their counterparts in mid-career, late career MBAs in our sample anticipate retirement to be unpleasant, perceive it as something to avoid, and expect it to be a disruption rather than a transition to rest. It is also conceivable that retiring earlier rather than later has become a status goal that younger, mid-career individuals seem more interested in achieving than older, late career individuals, because the message sent to this younger generation is that retirement is a time of active leisure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726712465657">Eckerdt and Clark, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0018726712465657">Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>). Another possible interpretation of our results comes from the observation that individuals’ subjective perception of their age is not always the same as their physical age. Indeed, evidence suggests that the discrepancy between subjective and physical age increases as people grow older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712465657">Kotter-Grühn et al., 2009</xref>) and, presumably, as they move into later career stages. As individuals get closer to normative retirement age, they may feel younger than they are, and hence see themselves retiring later.</p>

<title>Individual characteristics, job attributes, and expected retirement age</title>
<p>To understand retirement intentions at mid- and late career, we identified individual and job-related predictors of retirement intentions, evaluated their relationship with expected retirement age, and assessed whether career stage affected the strength of those relationships. As a group, individual characteristics seemed to explain a larger proportion of the variability in expected retirement age among MBAs than did job attributes.</p>
<p><italic>Individual characteristics</italic> As image theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726712465657">Beach and Frederickson, 1989</xref>) and role theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726712465657">Ashforth and Mael, 1989</xref>) would predict, and consistent with our hypothesis, we find that when other individual characteristics and job attributes are held constant, higher work centrality is associated with expectations to retire later in life. Our analyses also corroborate findings from other studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726712465657">Kim and Moen, 2001</xref>) that individuals with positive attitudes toward retirement expect to retire earlier. The MBAs’ gender and perceived health (relative to their age group) appear to have no bearing on their expected retirement age. Considering image theory, which states that individuals draw on their past and present circumstances, as well as on their expectations of the future, to make future-oriented decisions, our findings suggest that future-oriented expectations (retirement attitudes) more so than present circumstances (gender, health) shape MBAs’ retirement expectations.</p>
<p>Our findings provide some evidence that relationships between individual characteristics and expected retirement age differ at mid- versus late career stage. In particular, the expected retirement age seems to be more sensitive to work centrality at late career. According to role theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726712465657">Ashforth and Mael, 1989</xref>), this suggests that, among individuals with a higher level of work centrality, the reluctance to abandon their work-role is stronger at late career than at mid-career. Drawing on image theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726712465657">Beach and Frederickson, 1989</xref>), one might therefore conclude that putting off retirement provides a stronger self-concept confirmation to MBAs at late career than it does to those at mid-career. These conclusions, however, should be tempered by the marginal statistical significance of these findings.</p>
<p><italic>Job attributes</italic> Consistent with rational choice theory and with prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726712465657">Hatcher, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0018726712465657">Zhan et al., 2009</xref>), higher earners expect to retire earlier. However, our results do not support the contention that workers who have greater job satisfaction expect to retire at a later age. That is, when both individual characteristics and work attributes are included in the model, work centrality, an internal disposition, appears to be a better predictor of expected retirement age than job satisfaction. Finally, our results provide no support for a direct relationship between experienced discrimination and expected retirement age. So, as it relates to image theory, our findings suggest that income best captures the job-related circumstance that shapes MBAs’ retirement expectations.</p>
<p>Our findings provide some evidence that relationships between job attributes and expected retirement age differ at mid- versus late career stage. The expected retirement age is significantly more sensitive to income at mid-career. The results suggest that, in late career, the expected retirement age is minimally responsive to income. At late career, income may be perceived as just one of multiple financial indicators, and savings, retirement, or pension plans may have a larger influence than income on expected retirement age. At mid-career, in contrast, higher income may lead to higher expectations of the feasibility of early retirement.</p>
<p>Organization size, used as a control in the study, appears to be a consistently strong predictor of expected age of retirement, independent of individual characteristics and job attributes. Employees in larger organizations expected to retire earlier than those in smaller organizations, presumably in part because larger firms offer more retirement incentives. Federal law in the USA also mandates that employers with more than 20 employees allow employees to continue purchasing medical insurance for a given number of months after leaving or retiring. Conversely, smaller organizations may be more flexible and thus able to meet the needs of their employees as they age, which allows them to continue working.</p>

<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>The data for our study are all self reported, thus there is the risk of multicollinearity. However, the variance inflation factors revealed no problematic linear dependencies between the predictor variables and the constant, suggesting that multicollinearity is not degrading the coefficients of interest or the model fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0018726712465657">Pedhazur and Schmelkin, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>The respondents are all MBAs and are primarily from the northeastern United States. Our findings may therefore not be representative for employees without advanced business education. There may also be some variability compared with other areas of the USA, particularly regions with very different economic conditions. More importantly, considering that a country’s pension system affects the average retirement age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712465657">Gruber and Wise, 1998</xref>) and, presumably, retirement age expectations, our findings may not generalize outside the USA. For example, government-funded pensions (e.g. social security) replace approximately 40 percent of pre-retirement income in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0018726712465657">Social Security Administration, 2012</xref>). In comparison, the replacement rate ranges from 34 percent in Japan to 68 percent in Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726712465657">OECD, 2009</xref>). In the USA, the retirement age is not fixed and full retirement benefits are currently available at age 66 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0018726712465657">Social Security Administration, 2012</xref>). Our results may also fail to generalize to countries where the state or employers can legally mandate employees to retire (e.g. China, Japan) or where the age at which one can begin to receive social security payments differs for men and women (e.g. Switzerland, Argentina).</p>
<p>Given the length of our survey and the target sample, we had to limit the retirement-related predictors in our model to the most salient individual-level (i.e. gender, work centrality, retirement attitudes, and health) and job-level (income, job satisfaction, perceived discrimination) characteristics, and we used organization size as a proxy to control for organizational characteristics related to retirement (e.g. provision of pensions, benefits, continued coverage). Other factors that we did not measure may be important predictors of retirement expectations such as additional wealth indicators (e.g. personal wealth, retirement savings, pension plans), job attributes (e.g. autonomy, skill variety, physical demands) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726712465657">Filer and Petri, 1988</xref>), and occupational norms (e.g. opportunities for self-employment or part-time employment associated with different career paths) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726712465657">Feldman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0018726712465657">Wang and Shultz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0018726712465657">Zhan et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Because we asked individuals to indicate when they expected to retire, broadly speaking, rather than their intention to retire from their current job, our study assumes any bridge employment (i.e. retirement from current position and transition into a different one) to occur before the reported expected retirement age. Hence, our study may understate the relationship between job satisfaction and the expected retirement age, because individuals who are unhappy with their job may consider engaging in bridge employment before retiring.</p>

<title>Implications for future research</title>
<p>Our study – which finds that mid-career professionals expect to retire three years earlier than those in late career – shows the value in (a) clearly distinguishing between career stages when studying retirement expectations and (b) including mid-career employees in retirement research. Because both the meaning of retirement itself and the way in which individuals navigate late career are still in the process of shifting, additional predictors, yet to be explored, may help further explain retirement age expectations and may reconcile competing predictions from different career models. Given the importance of retirement attitudes in shaping the expected retirement age, a fruitful avenue for future research would be the development of a comprehensive model of retirement attitudes that would bring to light the factors shaping them and at the same time provide more fine-grained predictors of retirement intentions. Our study also highlights the difficulty in telling career stage apart from age (i.e. individuals at mid-career are also younger than those at late career) and generational differences. This suggests the need for future career models to acknowledge the role of age and generational norms regarding an appropriate retirement age.</p>
<p>While this study draws on traditional career stage research, future work on retirement expectations could be informed by other career models. For example, the boundaryless career model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726712465657">Arthur and Rousseau, 1996</xref>) brings to light the role of mobility across a range of physical (firm, occupation, industry) and psychological boundaries (e.g. validation found outside employer, reliance on external networks or information, subjective career interpretations, rejection of career opportunities for relational reasons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0018726712465657">Sullivan and Arthur, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0018726712465657">Sullivan and Arthur (2006)</xref> note that the bulk of boundaryless careers research focuses on physical boundaries and that research questions usually revolve around how different types of mobility affect subjective or objective career outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712465657">Feldman, 2007</xref>). Exploring how physical and psychological mobility affect the expected retirement age would enhance retirement research and extend the boundaryless career model.</p>

<sec id="section15-0018726712465657">
<title>Implications for practice</title>
<p>HR professionals concerned about a possible brain drain of older workers may be encouraged by the finding from our study that workers in late career expect to retire later than those at mid-career, independently of how well they are paid. However, they should be concerned about the expectations of earlier retirement among mid-career professionals, as this may signal an acceleration of the anticipated talent crisis. Our study also suggests that large companies should be more concerned about earlier retirement among their mid- and late career employees than smaller firms should be. Conventional wisdom among HR professionals suggests that job satisfaction is the most actionable lever for delaying retirement among employees. Our findings, however, suggest that job satisfaction does not influence the expected age of retirement and thus improving job satisfaction will not be particularly helpful in retaining mid- and late career employees. In contrast, enhancing employee work centrality may delay the expected retirement age, and especially so among late career workers. Improving job autonomy, interest, variety, and responsibility are some potential mechanisms through which HR may maintain, if not enhance, work centrality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0018726712465657">Sharabi and Harpaz, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, we contribute to careers and retirement research in three specific ways. First, we show that career stage affects retirement age expectations, such that mid-career professionals expect to retire earlier than those in late career. Our findings also suggest that – for mid- and late career professionals – work centrality, retirement attitudes, and income are the most robust predictors of expected retirement age. Finally, we show that career stage moderates the relationships between income and expected retirement age and between work centrality and expected retirement age: expected retirement age is more sensitive to income at mid-career and more sensitive to work centrality at late career. Overall, our findings provide evidence that the interplay between career stages and retirement expectations is more nuanced than found in previous research. Based on our findings, we recommend that mid-career workers be included in retirement research and late career workers in careers research. The findings from this study have implications for workforce planning and making productive use of employees throughout their life course.</p>
