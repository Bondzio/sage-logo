<p>This volume lives up to its title, providing a useful summary of the current understanding of the history of early medieval Britain and Ireland, and it advances scholarship by approaching familiar material with a fresh perspective. Historiography is one of the main themes of the book, with emphasis not only on summarising research to date but also presenting a critical analysis of previous interpretations. The volume covers all of the familiar topics of this period, including conversion to Christianity and the Vikings. For these issues, coverage is comprehensive and thorough, and discussion concentrates on synthesising traditional interpretations with new developments. Thus, the recently accepted notion that native British Christians contributed to the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons is acknowledged in Paul Fouracre’s chapter on Britain, Ireland and Europe, c. 500–750. Scholars seeking a succinct description of the ‘minster-model’ of pastoral care might be well served consulting Catherine Cubitt’s chapter on pastoral care in addition to the quintessential volume on the topic edited by John Blair and Richard Sharpe, <italic>Pastoral Care Before the Parish</italic>.</p>
<p>This volume is not only a valuable summary of the current state of scholarship, but it also advances historical discussion by reframing old questions in ways that avoid some long held assumptions. It asks if there were fundamental differences in society across Britain and Ireland, rather than presuming divergence. It responds to this query with a comparative and inclusive approach, giving equal attention to all of the various regions and polities of the Atlantic Archipelago, to use the volume’s preferred designation. The volume is structured to avoid giving priority to any specific historical explanations for change, providing room for interactions and long-term continuities. This approach successfully fulfils one of the stated aims of this volume, to avoid teleological assumptions and understand Britain and Ireland in the early Middle Ages as they developed rather from the perspective of present political boundaries and the traditional Anglo-centric narrative that explains their origin. For example, William M. Aird, in his chapter on Northumbria, successfully emphasises the distinctive features of this region’s history and challenges the notion that it was destined to be united with the kingdom Wessex to form England. The book also examines the relationship between Britain, Ireland and the Continent. The three chapters dedicated to this topic successfully demonstrate that the three were intricately linked throughout the early medieval period, an idea that has not always been widely accepted.</p>
<p>The structure and presentation suggest that this volume is primarily aimed at undergraduate and postgraduate students. It is comprised of short, easily digestible chapters, with endnotes rather than footnotes, and sections for further reading and bibliographies following every chapter. The book is divided into four parts, the first comprising introductory matter, and the rest consisting of chronological divisions, c. 500–c. 750, c. 750–c. 900 and c. 900–c. 1100. Although the book follows a roughly chronological order, the approach is thematic rather than narrative. There are 28 chapters in all, covering topics as diverse as communities and kinship, kings and kingship, queens and queenship, and localities. Several maps illustrating all the locations mentioned throughout the book are included at the beginning of the text.</p>
<p>Overall, the volume is well presented, although it is not without its faults. The first three chapters consist of introductory matter written by the editor, Pauline Stafford, with a general introduction, a chapter on historiography and another on sources. Although such emphasis on introductory material might be explained by the book being aimed at students, there is a lot of repetition here, and the three chapters could have been condensed into a single chapter. The emphasis on introductory material also seems imbalanced considering that there is no corresponding concluding chapter to pull it all together. The final chapter, also by Pauline Stafford, on queens and queenship, is repetitious. Within the span of two paragraphs, we are unnecessarily told three times that Irish queen Medb is a symbol of the transfer of kingship through marriage. Occasionally, the text devolves into descriptive passages that consist of little more than listing one king after another. However, such passages are normally qualified with explanations that the sources do not allow us to say more than this with any confidence. As Alex Woolf states in his chapter on Scotland, c. 900–c. 1100, ‘the history of the kingdom of Scots in the later tenth century can be fairly characterised as a catalogue of men with strange names killing each other’ (p. 260).</p>
<p>The main contribution of this volume to historical discussion is a useful, concise and accessible summary of the present state of scholarship on early medieval Britain and Ireland. Although this book would be most useful for the student or general reader, it would be a good addition to the bookshelves of any scholar of the early Middle Ages.</p>
