<abstract>
<p>The present study is premised on Anderson’s ACT model that proposes declarative knowledge is automatizable through practice (1982). The research examined the extent to which declarative knowledge of one morphosyntactic structure, namely present perfect, can be automatized 2 days after practice and can be retained 2 weeks after practice. Twenty intermediate students participated in the study. They were randomly assigned to experimental (G1) and comparison (G2) groups. G1 received rule explanation, mechanical practice, meaningful practice, and planned communicative practice. G2, however, received rule explanation, mechanical practice, and meaningful practice. Overall, the results indicated more automatization measured in terms of reduction in error rate and reaction time on the part of G1than G2. The results obtained two weeks later showed the superiority of G1, too. The findings can be insightful for teachers who wish to have a communicative class not at the expense of discarding a focus on grammar.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>FonF refers to a type of formal instruction in which without any deviation from meaning attention is drawn to formal features. A body of research confirms the effectiveness of FonF, either explicit or implicit, in SL/FL development (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0033688212450497">de Graaff, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0033688212450497">Dekeyser, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0033688212450497">Loewen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0033688212450497">Mackey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0033688212450497">Abu Radwan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0033688212450497">Williams, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0033688212450497">Ziemer Andrews, 2007</xref>). Nonetheless, studies carried out in this line do not agree on the most effective and efficient approach to grammar instruction. This study is, in fact, an investigation of FonF where form complements meaning and is based on Anderson’s adaptive control of thought (ACT) model of skill acquisition theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0033688212450497">1982</xref>; see Anderson et al. for a recent version of ACT and ACT-R, 2004). Summarizing Anderson’s ACT model, Dekeyser pointed out that knowledge starts as factual information, i.e. ‘knowledge that’, turns into procedural knowledge, i.e. ‘knowledge how’, through practising instances of behaviour, and finally becomes ‘fine-tuned’ or ‘automatised’ gradually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212450497">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0033688212450497">2007</xref>). Ellis has referred to this kind of FonF that is an attempt to operationalize ACT model of skill acquisition theory as <italic>planned FonF</italic> where certain forms are pre-selected to be presented and practised to be automatized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0033688212450497">2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Practice and Second Language (L2) Automatization</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212450497">Dekeyser (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0033688212450497">2007)</xref> claimed that there was little empirical evidence on the usefulness of practice. What Dekeyser meant by practice is not the notorious notion of practice identified with audiolingualism but practice in a communicative sense. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0033688212450497">Ellis (2009b)</xref>, too, stated that there is controversy on the type of practice, mechanical or communicative, which can be useful for interlanguage development.</p>
<p>Dekeyser argued that good practice, whether comprehension or production practice, encourages L2 learners to focus on form/function relations rather than form alone, and takes into account L2 learners’ individual differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0033688212450497">2007</xref>). In line with Dekeyser, on the basis of cognitive-interactionist theories of SLA, Ortega (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0033688212450497">2007</xref>) argued that good practice should be <italic>interactive, meaningful, and task essential</italic>. Second, good practice should be interactive in the sense that it triggers negotiation of meaning, feedback, and pushed output by challenging learners’ interlanguage system. Furthermore, good practice should encourage learners to focus on the relationship between form and meaning rather than on either. Finally, good practice should be purposeful. That is to say, tasks should be designed in a way that necessitates the use of specific features. In this way, learners are especially likely to notice the targeted features, and teachers are aware of what forms should receive feedback if need be. In fact, good practice fulfils skill acquisition theory’s ultimate goal which is to develop behaviours that are built upon form-function relations rather than formal behaviours.</p>
<p>Drawing on ACT model of skill acquisition theory, Dekeyser argued that the ultimate goal of practice activities is to develop automatic knowledge of a second/foreign language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0033688212450497">2007</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0033688212450497">Anderson et al. (2004)</xref> proposed, automatization is achieved by the process of ‘production compilation’. In this gradual process, via practice, successive production rules developed at procedural stage merge to form new productions that take less time and less attention to perform because there are fewer productions to be fired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0033688212450497">Anderson et al., 2004</xref>). In addition to speed, accuracy and complexity increase because there are more free attentional resources to attend to the ‘uncompiled’ productions. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0033688212450497">Dekeyser (2007)</xref>, rarely has ACT model of skill acquisition theory been put into practice in a communicative context. The <italic>Present, Practise, Produce</italic> (P-P-P) <italic>model</italic> of L2 teaching, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0033688212450497">Dekeyser (2007)</xref>, can be used to practicalize ACT model of skill acquisition theory in second language acquisition.</p>
<p>In the P-P-P model (Byrne, 1986, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0033688212450497">Dekeyser, 2007</xref>), the first <italic>P</italic> signifies the presentation of the new material, the second <italic>P</italic> the practice of the new material, specifically <italic>mechanical</italic> and <italic>meaningful</italic> practice (Paulston and Bruder, 1976, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0033688212450497">Dekeyser, 2007</xref>), and the third <italic>P</italic> the production of the presented and subsequently practised material, specifically <italic>communicative</italic> practice (Paulston and Bruder, 1976). Considering the P-P-P model of teaching and ACT model of skill acquisition theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0033688212450497">Dekeyser (2007)</xref> pointed out that the second <italic>P</italic> results in Anderson’s procedural knowledge and the third <italic>P</italic> results in Anderson’s automatic knowledge.</p>
<p>The present study is, in fact, an attempt to apply skill acquisition theory in a <italic>task-supported</italic> context which is based on the principles of communicative teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0033688212450497">Ellis, 2003</xref>). In other words, the potential effects of communicative practice in comparison to those of mechanical and meaningful practice on the extent to which a morphosyntactic feature, namely present perfect, can be automatized, automatization being operationalized as reduction in reaction time and in error rate, have been investigated. To this end, the P-P-P model of L2 teaching has been juxtaposed with a ‘Present, Practise’ (P-P) model of L2 teaching to show whether communicative practice (i.e. the third ‘P’ in the P-P-P model) makes any difference in the automatization of the targeted form or not.</p>

<title>Empirical Evidence of Automatization</title>
<p>In a pilot study putting ACT model into practice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0033688212450497">Dekeyser (1996)</xref> used a created miniature language in order to demonstrate whether or not the automatization (i.e. drop-off in reaction time and error rate in his study) of four grammar rules and 36 vocabulary items transpires through practice. After eight weeks of practising the targeted forms, he observed some progress in the learners’ production and comprehension of the targeted forms in terms of reduction in reaction time and in error rate. He also found that practice effect was <italic>skill-specific</italic>. That is, production practice improved their performance on the production tasks, and comprehension practice improved their performance on the comprehension tasks.</p>
<p>In another study with an artificial language, on the basis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0033688212450497">Dekeyser’s (1996)</xref> pilot study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0033688212450497">Dekeyser (1997)</xref> observed some effects of practice on the automatization of four morphosyntactic rules and 32 vocabulary items. In this study he considered interference from a second task as well as drop-off in reaction time and in error rate as criteria for operationalizing the automatization of the targeted features. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0033688212450497">Dekeyser (1997)</xref> also found that the effects of the practice activities were skill-specific. The participants in his study were provided with equal production and comprehension practice. However, the rules practised in production in one group were practised in comprehension in the other group and vice versa. For production practice, the participants were given four pictures with a sentence corresponding to one of them, and for production practice, the participants had to complete a sentence about a given picture. The same tasks were also used for testing. It was found that the participants who received comprehension practice with certain rules performed better on comprehension tests in terms of reduction in error rate and in reaction time than those who received production practice on those rules and vice versa. In fact, this study advocated skill-specificity of practice. Nonetheless, skill specificity does not always hold true. Skill specificity exists only at a procedural level not at a declarative level. In other words, procedural knowledge is not as flexible as declarative knowledge in using a specific skill in different directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0033688212450497">Anderson and Fincham, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0033688212450497">Dekeyser, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0033688212450497">Robinson (1997)</xref>, too, could demonstrate automatization (i.e. reduction in reaction time and error rate) of items practised during the training sessions among four groups, namely instructed, enhanced, implicit, and incidental. However, on new items (i.e. not practised during the training sessions) it was the instructed group that succeeded in showing more automatization than the other groups and second to the instructed group was the enhanced group. Robinson attributed this to the resources available to the instructed and to some extent to the enhanced groups that the other groups were deprived of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0033688212450497">1997</xref>).</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>For about a week a notice was put in five language schools in Tehran calling upon students who were at intermediate level to participate in this study. Because the students were required not to take part in other English classes during the study, only 30 agreed to participate. To add insult to injury, 10 students gave up gradually and just 20 remained loyal until the end of the study. Hence, only the data obtained from the remaining students were used. Each participant was paid three dollars’ worth of a book at the end of the treatment. All of the participants were speakers of Persian as first language. Their age range was between 16 and 26 years old, and their average previous experience with English was 4.35 years. One of the participants was a post-graduate student, one was a university graduate student, two were university students, two were high school graduate students, and the rest were senior high school students. They were randomly assigned to an experimental group (G1) and a comparison group (G2).</p>

<title>Morphosyntactic-Feature</title>
<p>The inclusion of <italic>present perfect</italic> in this study can only be subjectively justified as it was selected on the basis of the personal experience of the researchers and their colleagues. Teaching English for 25 years for one of the researchers and seven years for the other, the researchers both agreed that one of the most problematic structures Iranian students of English, especially students of intermediate level, had to tackle was <italic>present perfect.</italic> Besides, interviewing a number of colleagues regarding this issue, the researchers could fortify their consensus.</p>

<title>Test of declarative knowledge</title>
<p>In order to measure the participants’ level of awareness of the targeted form (i.e. their level of the declarative knowledge of the targeted form), the participants took a test of metalinguistic knowledge. On this test they were required to write the application and to provide the structure (i.e. formulation) of the targeted form. Because the participants’ ability to write their knowledge of the rule and to use their lexicon of grammatical terms were likely to influence their performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0033688212450497">Ellis, 2009a</xref>), the participants were not required to use jargons in explaining the applications, and the accuracy of their explanations was not a criterion for marking their response. A mark of ‘1’ was assigned to an accurate definition of the application and a mark of ‘1’ was assigned to an accurate formulation of the targeted feature.</p>
<p>Regarding the construct validity of tests of metalinguistic knowledge, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0033688212450497">Ellis (2009a)</xref> demonstrated that such tests are the best measure of explicit knowledge as they require the use of the knowledge of rules and the ability to verbalize/write that knowledge. Note that in this study explicit knowledge and declarative knowledge are used interchangeably.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0033688212450497">
<title>Test of automatized procedural knowledge</title>
<p>Six present perfect questions, three ‘wh’ and three ‘yes/no’, were delivered on a computer screen one by one. The test was carried out in one-to-one meetings between each participant and one of the researchers. There was no time limit for answering the questions but the participants were alerted that their response time would be recorded. With ‘yes/no’ questions the participants were supposed to give complete responses. For example, if they were asked: ‘Have you ever flown an aeroplane?’, they were expected to respond: ‘Yes, I have flown an aeroplane’ or ‘No, I have never flown an aeroplane’ and not to give a short answer. In addition, they were instructed to provide complete <italic>‘yes/no’</italic> responses not specific ones. For example, in response to the question: ‘Have you ever been to the US?’, they were not expected to respond: ‘Yes, I was there five years ago.’ but to answer, ‘Yes, I have been there.’ This example was included in the instruction section of this test.</p>
<p>Four criteria were set for marking this test. They included correct verb form (i.e. correct auxiliary + correct past participle), correct time expression (i.e. indefinite time expression), correct use of <italic>since</italic> and <italic>for</italic> (i.e. since + a point in time &amp; for + a duration of time), and relevance of the answer (i.e. answering only what the question asked). The marking of present perfect items was very strict. A mark of ‘1’ was assigned to a response that had not violated any of these criteria, if applicable, and a mark of ‘0’ was assigned to a response that had violated even one of the criteria.</p>
<p>The prerequisite for a test to have construct validity is congruence between the feature(s) of the test and of the construct to be measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0033688212450497">Douglas, 2001</xref>). In SLA literature the degree of the automatization of procedural knowledge has been operationalized as the decline in error rate, decline in reaction time, decline in interference from another task, or a combination of these traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212450497">Dekeyser, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0033688212450497">Robinson, 1997</xref>). Thus, the present test can be claimed to have construct validity because it was designed in a way that the participants’ reaction time and error rate could be recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0033688212450497">
<title>Untimed grammaticality judgement test</title>
<p>An untimed grammaticality judgement test (UGJT) containing four grammatical items for the targeted structure was used as a measure of automatized procedural knowledge. The items were all grammatical to make the test more a measure of implicit knowledge rather than explicit knowledge as automatized procedural knowledge is a means of achieving implicit knowledge. This was done on the basis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0033688212450497">Ellis’s (2009a)</xref> finding that grammatical items in a UGJT correlated more with the tests of implicit knowledge than with the tests of explicit knowledge.</p>
<p>Eight items on four other grammatical features, for each feature one grammatical and one ungrammatical, were added to the items to militate against the participants’ finding a pattern since all of the items on the targeted feature were grammatical. The non-target features were reported speech, subject-verb agreement, present wish clauses, and position of frequency adverbs. All of the items were randomly ordered and were computer-delivered in one-to-one meetings between the individual participants and the researcher. Although the participants were not pressed for time, they were alerted that their response time would be recorded. A mark of ‘1’ was assigned to the items that were judged grammatical and a mark of ‘0’ was assigned to the items that were judged ungrammatical. This test, too, is expected to have construct validity as it measures two features of automatized procedural knowledge, namely drop-off in reaction time and in error rate.</p>

<sec id="section12-0033688212450497">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The present study is a quasi-experimental one based on a pre-test/post-test design. Two days prior to the start of the treatment, the participants took a pre-test of the automatized procedural knowledge of the targeted feature and following that the test of metalinguistic knowledge. One day prior to the pre-test phase, the participants were given a list of all of the verbs included in all of the tests besides 50 other verbs not included in the test with their past and past participle forms and their Persian equivalents. They were asked to study them before the first testing phase, and to review them throughout the programme. It was done to make sure that the verbs included in the test were not unknown to the participants; thus, controlling for the effect of the participants’ prior familiarity with the verbs on their accuracy and response time. Being randomly assigned to the experimental and comparison groups, they started practising. The treatment lasted for 3 sessions, 5 hours, spread over a week. Two days after finishing the treatment, the participants took an immediate post-test, and two weeks after the treatment they took a delayed post-test.</p>
<sec id="section13-0033688212450497">
<title>Testing sessions</title>
<p>Three versions of the test of automatized procedural knowledge were designed. One was for the pre-test phase, one for the immediate post-test phase, and one for the delayed post-test phase. The difficulty and the length of the items in each version, however, were not equal. Items in each version, in fact, contained different words with different lengths that were likely to impact on the participants’ fluency and accuracy. Considering this issue, it was decided to counterbalance the test versions and administer a different sequence to each participant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0033688212450497">Dekeyser and Sokalski, 1996</xref>). For the pre-test, the participants’ names in each group were listed and the test versions (version 1, 2, or 3) were assigned to the names in order. For the immediate post-test, one of the versions not taken by the participants on the previous testing session was randomly assigned to the participants. Finally, the remaining test version was assigned to the participants for the delayed post-test.</p>
<p>The data on the measure of automatized procedural knowledge were collected via one-to-one meetings between one of the researchers and individual participants. Each meeting took between 15 and 20 minutes.</p>
<p>After taking the pre-test, each participant was given the test of metalinguistic knowledge to see if the participants started from scratch or with some prior explicit knowledge of the targeted feature. The reason why the test of automatic procedural knowledge was administered before the test of declarative knowledge was to avoid the learning effects of the declarative measure on the automatic procedural measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0033688212450497">Webb, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0033688212450497">
<title>Treatment sessions</title>
<p>At the outset of session 1, lasting for 120 minutes, both groups were given the same handout on present perfect. Both groups self-studied their handouts and discussed the main points in class. This was the presentation phase. For the rest of the session, both groups did some mechanical and meaningful practice. At the end of the session G1 did one dyadic controlled communicative task whereas G2 was deprived of this task.</p>
<p>During sessions 2 and 3, G1 and G2 practised present perfect in different ways. Whereas G1 did free communicative tasks, G2 continued doing mechanical and meaningful activities. Session 2 lasted for 120 minutes and session 3 lasted for 60 minutes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0033688212450497">
<title>Data Collection and Transcription</title>
<p>Data collection on the pre-test, immediate post-test and delayed post-test phases was carried out via <italic>Windows Vista’s Sound Recorder</italic>. On the test of automatized procedural knowledge the participants saw the items one by one on a computer screen and as they responded their voice was recorded on another computer controlled by an assistant. The participants were supposed to say ‘pass’ as they answered each item to mark that they had finished answering the item. On the UGJT, however, the participants did not say ‘pass’. They just said ‘yes’ or ‘no’ for grammatical and ungrammatical sentences, respectively. The assistant stopped the sound recorder as soon as he heard the word ‘pass’ (‘yes’ or ‘no’ in the case of the UGJT).</p>
<p>Data transcription was conducted by a piece of software named <italic>AVS Audio Editor.</italic> Because reaction time was an essential component of automatized procedural knowledge, this software was used to be able to record tenths of a second. Another issue regarding the participants’ reaction time that needed to be taken into account was an inevitable gap between the participants’ saying ‘pass’ (‘yes’ or ‘no’ in the case of the UGJT) and the assistant’s stopping the recording. It was decided to ignore the gap provided that it was less than one second. Whenever the gap was greater than a second, however, the recorded reaction time was exactly when the word ‘pass’ (‘yes’ or ‘no’ in the case of the UGJT) was said. Thanks to <italic>AVS Audio Editor</italic>, it was possible to find when the word ‘pass’ (‘yes’ or ‘no’ in the case of the UGJT) was completely expressed. Fortunately, on each testing session only a few ‘more-than-one-second’ gaps were observed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0033688212450497">
<title>Statistical Procedure</title>
<p>Test of distributional normality revealed that the data distribution was not normal obviously owing to the small samples. Hence, nonparametric tests were applied. For all between-groups comparisons Mann-Whitney U test and for all within-groups comparisons Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks test were used. Comparisons showing a significant difference was followed by an analysis of the strength of association (eta<sup>2</sup>) to find out how much of the difference was attributable to the treatment. All of the statistical tests were conducted using <italic>SPSS 18.</italic></p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>Initially, the participants took a test of metalinguistic knowledge (described previously) as a measure of their metalinguistic knowledge of the targeted form. Having another rater, as well as the researcher himself, mark this test, an inter-rater reliability of 71% was obtained using <italic>Pearson Product Moment</italic> correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient is significant at the probability level of 0.01.</p>
<p>Mann-Whitney U test was applied to compare the mean ranks of the groups to establish whether there was a significant difference between the groups’ level of declarative knowledge. In cases where there was a disagreement between the raters about a participant’s mark, the mean of the raters’ marks was calculated and used. Comparison of the mean ranks of G1 and G2 indicated a nonsignificant difference between the groups on their declarative knowledge at the probability level of .05 (Z = –.601, p &lt; .631). The results of the comparison are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0033688212450497">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>After taking the test of metalinguistic knowledge, G1 and G2 took the test of automatized procedural knowledge and the UGJT. To compare the groups’ initial automatized procedural knowledge to find out if they were at (almost) the same level of knowledge before receiving the treatment, the mean performance of the groups on the tests was compared via the Mann-Whitney U test. Note that the mean performance in this study had two aspects – one was the mean reaction time and the other was the mean error rate. To save space, the results of reaction time and error rate comparisons in the pre-test phase are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0033688212450497">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Research Question 1</title>
<p>The first research question was a search for the effect of practice on the participants’ ability to automatize their declarative knowledge of present perfect two days after the treatment by juxtaposing the Present, Practise, Produce (P-P-P) model and the Present, Practise (P-P) model. To this end, it was hypothesized that the models did not differ in terms of effects on the participants’ ability to automatize their declarative knowledge of the targeted feature.</p>
<p>Post-treatment between-groups comparison of G1 and G2’s reaction times (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0033688212450497">Table 3</xref>) showed a significant difference on the test of automatized procedural knowledge of present perfect in the immediate post-test phase with G1 having lower reaction time than G2 (Z = −2.041, p &lt; .043). The observed eta<sup>2</sup> value (h<sup>2</sup> = .21) indicated that 21% of the observed difference in reaction time on the test of automatized procedural knowledge of present perfect could be attributed to the method applied to G1. Note that G1 had lower reaction time on this test in the pre-test phase; however, that difference was not significant at p &lt; .05 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0033688212450497">Table 3</xref>). On the same test in the immediate post-test phase G1 outperformed G2 in terms of error rate in the immediate post-test phase (Z = –.389) as it did in the pre-test phase (Z = –.787). The Z value dropped from the pre-test to the immediate post-test phase suggesting some progress (i.e. automatization) on the side of G2. In both phases the differences were nonsignificant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0033688212450497">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0033688212450497">3</xref>).</p>
<p>On the UGJT of present perfect G1 and G2’s reaction time difference, like that of the pre-test phase, was not significant at p &lt; .05. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0033688212450497">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0033688212450497">3</xref>, although in both phases G1 outperformed G2 on this test, the Z value in the immediate post-test phase (Z = −1.361) was larger than that in the pre-test phase (Z = −1.058). On the same test G1 outperformed G2 in the immediate post-test phase as it did in the pre-test phase in terms of error rate. On this test the Z value rises from the pre-test phase (Z = –.163) to the immediate post-test phase (Z = −2.063) suggesting some progress by G1. Nonetheless, in neither phase was the difference significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0033688212450497">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0033688212450497">3</xref>).</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0033688212450497">Table 4</xref>, within-groups comparisons suggested that on the test automatized procedural knowledge G1 had a drop-off in reaction time from the pre-test phase to the immediate post-test phase though not significant (Z = −1.376, p &lt; .169). G2, on the contrary, showed a rise in reaction time on the same test (Z = .358, p &lt; .721) though the rise was not significant at .05 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0033688212450497">Table 5</xref>). In terms of error rate, on the test of automatized procedural knowledge both groups were able to considerably reduce with G1 producing a Z score of</p> <p>–2.701 that was significant at p &lt; .007 with the eta<sup>2</sup> value of .81, and with G2 producing a Z score of –1.919 that was <italic>nearly</italic> significant at p &lt; .055 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0033688212450497">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0033688212450497">5</xref>).</p>
<p>On the UGJT, according to the within-groups comparisons of the groups’ reaction time, G1 and G2 both showed a nonsignificant drop-off in their reaction time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0033688212450497">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0033688212450497">5</xref>). Although neither showed a significant reduction, G2 decreased its reaction time (Z = −1.274, p &lt; .203) slightly more than G1 (Z = −1.172, p &lt;.241). In terms of error rate, both groups performed better in the immediate post-test phase than in the pre-test phase on the UGJT with G1’s significantly reducing its error rate (Z = −2.449, p &lt; .014) with the eta<sup>2</sup> value of .66 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0033688212450497">Table 4</xref>). However, G2’s reduction of error rate (Z = −1.089, p &lt; .276) was not significant at p &lt; .05 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0033688212450497">Table 5</xref>).</p>
<p>In short, in terms of reduction in reaction time on the test of automatized procedural knowledge G1 significantly outperformed G2 in the immediate post-test phase. Note that G1 outperformed G2 in the pre-test phase, too, though not significantly. On the UGJT, G1 outperformed G2 (i.e. more reduction of reaction time) in both the pre-test phase and the immediate post-test phase. Although G1’s outperforming G2 was not significant in any of the phases, it was larger in the immediate post-test phase. Within-groups comparisons of reaction time showed that while G1 managed to reduce on the test of automatized procedural knowledge, though not significantly, G2 increased. According to these findings, G1 was partially more successful than G2 in reducing reaction time.</p>
<p>In terms of error rate on the test of automatized procedural knowledge, G1 could considerably, though not significantly, increase the difference from G2 from the pre-test phase to the immediate post-test phase. On the UGJT, too, G1 could considerably increase the difference from G2 in terms of error rate from the pre-test phase to the immediate post-test phase. Within-groups comparisons of error rate showed that both G1 and G2 could reduce error rate on both the test of automatized procedural knowledge and the UGJT. However, only G1 was able to reduce error rate significantly. These findings, accordingly, partially suggested that G1 was more successful in reducing error rate than G2.</p>
<p>The results obtained from the test of automatized procedural knowledge and the UGJT partially evidenced automatization on the part of G1. There was one significant between-groups difference and two significant within-groups differences that were all attributable to G1. In nonsignificant cases, it was G1 that surpassed G2 – not vice versa. These findings are, overall, reflective of G1’s ability to automatize the knowledge of present perfect more than G2 did. The eta<sup>2</sup> values obtained from the within-groups comparisons of G1 in terms of error rate on the test of automatized procedural knowledge and on the UGJT (h<sup>2</sup> = .81 and h<sup>2</sup> = .66, respectively), and the eta<sup>2</sup> value obtained from between-groups comparison of the groups’ reaction times on the test of automatized procedural knowledge (h<sup>2</sup> = .21) to some extent signify the robustness of the method applied to G1 compared to the one applied to G2. However, care must be exercised in the construal of these results since they do not strongly fit the zone of statistical significance.</p>

<title>Research Question 2</title>
<p>The second research question asked which group, G1 or G2, possessed a higher level of automatized procedural knowledge of present perfect two weeks after the treatment. It was hypothesized that there was no difference between the groups’ level of automatized procedural knowledge two weeks after the treatment.</p>
<p>To answer this question, both groups took a delayed post-test two weeks after finishing the treatment. The results of comparing G1’s reaction time and error rate with those of G2 on both measures of the delayed post-test phase, computed via the Mann-Whitney U test, are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0033688212450497">Table 6</xref>. The only statistically significant difference between G1 and G2’s reaction time was on the UGJT (p &lt; .015), with G1 having lower reaction time (Z = −2.419). This difference existed in the immediate post-test phase, too, although it was not statistically significant. In terms of error rate, however, none of the differences between G1 and G2 was statistically significant. In the immediate post-test phase, too, none of the error rate differences was statistically significant.</p>

<p>In sum, G1 showed lower reaction time and error rate on both of the tests. These results are indicative of G1’s higher level of automatized procedural knowledge two weeks after the treatment. However, these results, too, must be considered cautiously.</p>

<title>Summary and Conclusion</title>
<p>The first research question is an investigation of the effects of the methods used, the P-P-P model and the P-P model, on the experimental group (G1) and the comparison group’s (G2) ability to automatize their knowledge of present perfect two days after the treatments. It seems that G1, that received the P-P-P model, was more successful than G2 in automatizing the declarative knowledge of present perfect because all between-groups comparisons evinced the higher ability of G1 in reducing reaction time and error rate in the immediate post-test phase. Besides, within-groups comparisons in some cases showed progress only on the part of G1, and in some cases showed progress on the part of both groups. But whenever both groups made progress from the pre-test phase to the immediate post-test phase, it was G1 that progressed significantly not G2. This finding can be evidence of the superiority of the P-P-P model over the P-P model.</p>
<p>The second research question was an investigation of the groups’ level of automatized procedural knowledge two weeks after the treatment. According to the results obtained two weeks after the treatment, G1 evinced a higher level of automatized procedural knowledge than G2 in terms of both reaction time and error rate.</p>
<p>To put it in a nutshell, these findings suggest that communicative practice is more powerful than mechanical and meaningful practice in helping L2 learners automatize their declarative knowledge by reducing their reaction time and their error rate.</p>
<p>The findings of the current research can be juxtaposed with those of three empirical studies, namely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0033688212450497">Dekeyser (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0033688212450497">Dekeyser and Sokalski (1996)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0033688212450497">Robinson (1997)</xref>, of the effects of practice on L2 learners’ ability to automatize. They all succeeded in showing some automatization. In line with these studies, the present study, too, has shown some automatization of the targeted morphosyntactic structure on the part of the group exposed to the P-P-P model (G1) two days after the treatment.</p>
<p>The present study, however, differs from the above-mentioned studies in the way the targeted forms were practised. In fact, focused communicative tasks were what the latter studies lack. In other words, the type of instruction Dekeyser, Dekeyser and Sokalski, and Robinson could show effective in automatization were of the controlled type. Investigation of the durability of automatized procedural knowledge is another issue that they did not go for. The present study shows that practice of the right type helps retain automatized procedural knowledge.</p>
<p>As was previously mentioned, care needs to be taken in drawing conclusions on the basis of the findings owing to the threats to the internal and external validity of the study. For one thing, most of the between-groups and within-groups differences on the targeted form are not statistically significant due to the small samples. In fact, it is very difficult to find statistically significant results with two samples of 10. This warrants further studies with larger samples. Second, the samples cannot be representative of the population since they were not randomly selected. In addition, the treatment needs to be lengthened to be able to evidently demonstrate the conversion of declarative knowledge into automatized knowledge. Last but not least, although the groups’ initial declarative and automatized procedural knowledge of the feature were controlled, other individual differences such as proficiency level, aptitude, and motivation were not taken into account.</p>
