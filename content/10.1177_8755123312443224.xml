<p>I remember a year teaching middle school, when I began craving “grown-up” conversation. I remember a hunger for words longer than two syllables. I suppose today one might ache for words that have not been shrunk into abbreviations, LOL. To satisfy this growing hunger, I dug into <italic>The New Yorker</italic> and <italic>The Atlantic</italic> to counterbalance my immersion in adolescent patterns of expression. When I occasionally returned to my alma mater or went to a conference, I marveled at how smart everyone sounded! Although I loved my students’ enthusiasm and energy, I wondered if I was beginning to mirror my sixth- to eighth-graders’ level of intellectual sophistication, or at least their ways of explaining themselves! And if so, was I short-changing both my students and myself?</p>
<p>So, when I went to graduate school, I reveled in the chance to stretch my understanding of many things, both old and new. I was recharged by the way people expressed themselves and what they had to say. I was swimming again in the complex sentences, vocabulary, and thought processes of well-read, intellectually curious adults. Perhaps that is partly why I fell in love with research; the exposure to it came just as my appetite was thoroughly whetted for in-depth analysis. I was hungry for deep ideas and sophisticated expression of those ideas.</p>
<p>This is a little like the story of “horses and oats” shared with my undergraduates (thank you to Clifford Madsen for this gem of an analogy in his book <italic>Teaching/Discipline</italic>). First, I ask my class, “How does one get the horse to move?” At this point I draw a barely distinguishable horse on the board, looking more like a cross between a dog and a llama, despite my best efforts. How does one encourage the horse to move greater distances, using a pail of oats? Note, if the oats are too far away, the horse will not move, but if too close, the horse just eats the oats. As we discuss both type of oats and timing of dispersal (the main point of the exercise), students always strike on one aspect to consider: “Try this when the horse is hungry,” they say. Good point.</p>
<p>To make the transfer, maybe at this point in the year you are getting hungry for answers, for analysis that goes beyond the “seems to me” level. Maybe you are ready to seek out ideas from new areas. Maybe you are even hungry for “grown-up” writing! The beauty of <italic>Update</italic> is that it brings research findings to practitioners while striking a balance between heavy research jargon and statistics and day-to-day language. I think you will find the ideas stimulating and the style refreshing. You will probably find yourself thinking, “Why didn’t I think of that?” or “I always wondered if others felt this way?” You might also find yourself reacting, “So THAT’s how that works!” or “Wow, things have really changed! (or not).”</p>
<p>Perhaps even more important, <italic>Update</italic> articles encourage us to make transfers, to find what is relevant in one area that can be applied to other areas. This is so important in the world of music education where many teach a variety of assignments, such as the high school teacher who leads both string and choral ensembles, or the teacher who has both elementary- and secondary-level students. Even those who specialize in one area can borrow ideas from other teaching specializations. As one of my favorite host teachers says, “I’m a band director, but I always go to the choral sessions when I go to conference . . . that’s where I find the best new ideas!”</p>
<p>I was struck by this issue of transferability while observing a fiddle workshop with Alasdair Fraser and Natalie Haas this spring. At one point, Fraser, the renowned Scottish fiddler, made the analogy that musicians may once have been able to be completely “monolingual” (specializing in only one genre), but that today’s musicians may find it useful to be more “multilingual,” such as being able to work in both classical music and other vernacular styles. Then he took the analogy further, showing ways to learn the “language” of a certain type of music. I was struck by his analogy on several levels, including the ways this relates to learning jazz (how often have I heard jazz musicians talk about “the language of jazz?”), the metaphors used by those using approaches such as Kodály or Suzuki, and the emphasis in my own state on teachers learning how to relate music literacy to literacy with English and other languages. I was also struck by the transferability of his teaching strategies to other situations; indeed, anyone attending a jazz master class or an Orff workshop would have felt completely at home. The transfers were flying through my mind, and I was impressed by Fraser’s obvious desire to help participants make transfers to their own music making. I hope reading <italic>Update</italic> articles inspires that same reaction.</p>
<p>Our May issue ranges from research on practical teaching strategies to deep philosophical perspectives. I will restrain myself from going into detail on the transfers to be made within each, in hopes this will spur you to read the articles with an eye for potential applications. Within these articles, we discover a wealth of philosophy from Clint Randle’s literature review on phenomenology (check it out . . . six syllables just in that one word of the title!). On the very practical side, Steven Oare’s Special Topics article shares insights on what middle school students think about when they are practicing. In the tradition of <italic>Update</italic>, I labeled these both Special Topics articles because the implications stretch to so many different teaching situations.</p>
<p>We also cover a range of age-groups, from Debra Hedden’s literature on elementary children’s singing development to Thomas Kloss’s investigation into the adult concern of band director turnover, a great contribution to the instrumental category. A study that might contribute to ensembles of all sorts, at all age levels, is that by Shelly Cooper, Donald Hamann, and Robert Frost. They bring us data on how stretching before rehearsals positively affects string players’ comfort levels, important to maintaining effective rehearsals and developing lifelong healthy behaviors for instrumentalists. Gina Wych brings us another instrumental study with a great update (pun intended) on gender issues in instrumental music. Her literature review deals specifically with stereotyping and stratification.</p>
<p>Moving into new technology, we get into wonderful new areas that have come about with the cochlear implant; music therapists Feilin Hsiao and Kate Gfeller heighten our understanding of that technology’s implications for music educators. Finally, we have a fourth Special Topics article, where Jennifer Whipple concentrates on preservice teacher education. She examines the educational supports preservice teachers believe are most useful for special needs learners. Of course, veteran teachers can learn a lot from exploring the findings generated by preservice teachers! Whether the veteran teacher hosts student teachers or those in fieldwork, mentors new teachers, or wants to find ideas for self-renewal, these data can lead to great new insights.</p>
<p>You may jump into these articles this spring, or save them to savor over the summer. Either way, enjoy the craft of the writing as well as the ingenuity of the topics, the practicality of the suggestions, and the contribution to our profession’s development. I hope they will satisfy while inspiring an even greater hunger to know more.</p>
<p>To end, I would like to thank Alice-Ann Darrow (Special Topics Researcher), Martha Miller (Elementary Practitioner), and Abby Butler (Choral Practitioner) for their hard work on the editorial board for the past 6 years. They will serve through the summer, at which point new board members, nominated and appointed through our SRME (Society for Research in Music Education) processes, will join us. These three board members have contributed greatly and graciously, and while I will thank them again in the November issue, I want them to know now how much help they have been.</p>
<p>So please enjoy the May 2012 issue of <italic>Update</italic> . . . Eat up!</p>
