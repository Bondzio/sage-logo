A welcome addition to this genre is the recent publication of Eric Brady's autobiographical account spanning the years from the early 1960s to his ‘premature’ retirement on health grounds in 1994, working firstly as a probation officer and latterly as a senior probation officer. Although it is gratifying to read that he has remained extremely active and engaged in writing, speaking and of course having his eponymous publications reviewed in <italic>Probation Journal</italic>!</p><p>His early travails to secure a Home Office sponsored social science diploma to become a probation officer, being interviewed by the founding father of British social policy at the London School of Economics, Professor Richard Titmuss, and his lively placement experiences are amusingly if quaintly charted. Indeed one of his earliest field tutor's assessments, which prefigured later debates around the shifting culture of control in the organizational mores of probation, stated that ‘Mr Brady is not really suitable for social work, but would be better suited for the more authoritarian probation service!’ The disabling and life-threatening wartime injuries he suffered, aged nine after his local school in Catford, was bombed in 1943 (an event that killed his 14 year-old sister) were a foundational emotional experience and there are recurrent throwbacks to this traumatic incident throughout the book. In view of the timeframe, many of those under probation supervision had been serving in the war.</p><p>The book’s nine very readable chapters are studded with potted vignettes covering his wide range of encounters with clients, police officers, solicitors, magistrates and well before the arrival of CAFCASS, matrimonial work. There are some rich pickings for those curious to read about the discretionary ambit afforded practitioners in their quotidian meetings with clients and the standing that probation officers appeared to enjoy as sources of benign authority, well known in their local communities.</p><p>Starting with a ‘manageable’ caseload numbered around 65, when he retired after 30 years, he opines that caseloads ‘were officially’ expected to be no more than 40, although he points out that the current reality is often different. Whilst working as a probation officer in the Midlands, he had statutory responsibility for those on supervision (ten years old to 17) as well as the more familiar court mandated and prison licences for those over 18 years and reporting nights would typically stretch to 8.00 or 9.00 pm. The nature and role of the probation officer over this time is neatly described and the historic shifts in these protean responsibilities inform many of the stories. I was intrigued by the fact that at one time acting as an escort to accompany young people to approved schools was a feature of the role.</p><p>Additionally he pushed his senior managers to allow him to co-lead a group on 'Dealing with Violence' and succeeded in translating this into his first book called appropriately 'Coping with Violent Behaviour' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-026455051205900203">Brady, 1993</xref>). This foray into training and writing is clearly informed by some truly alarming accounts when efforts to mollify and placate irate clients placed his and others’ safety in some peril. The compassionate and determined manner in which he worked must have more times than not averted many other potentially threatening situations from escalating. The number of such events in the home setting bespeaks of a more permissive working ethos, which for many current probation staff unaccustomed to the frequency of home visits, may well raise some eyebrows!</p><p>Although Chapter 9 does offer some selective, if a little jaundiced, musings on some of the more recent organisational and legislative changes that have beset the service, it does conclude with the perennial wisdom that must surely act as the lodestar for today’s probation staff….the whole purpose is still to convince people of their need to change when change is needed, and then to help them straighten out their lives and to stop committing offences, having the ultimate objective of preventing future victims'. Eric Brady offers his working life story in a very readable human interest way. It will I hope get the attention of readers in and beyond probation and be added to those wonderful recollections memorably captured in the <italic>Moments in Probation </italic>(2011) anthology alluded to at the outset of this review. Never mawkish but at times unfashionably sentimental about some of the aspects of past probation practice which are now being 'rediscovered'.</p><sig-block><sig><bold>Mike Guilfoyle</bold><break/><italic>Associate Member, Napo</italic></sig></sig-block></body><back><ref-list><title>Reference</title><ref id="bibr1-026455051205900203"><citation citation-type="book" xlink:type="simple"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Brady</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>1993</year>), <article-title>Coping with Violent Behaviour</article-title> <publisher-loc>London</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Ashgate</publisher-name>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr2-026455051205900203"><citation citation-type="book" xlink:type="simple"><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name name-style="western"><surname>Senior</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group> (ed.)
