<abstract>
<p>This article presents an empirical study of transnational higher education in China at the institutional level. The units of analysis are the Chinese partner universities of transnational higher education programs. Through comparison of research universities and teaching universities, the study finds that transnational higher education programs are developed and perceived differently by these two categories of universities. For teaching universities, transnational higher education is mainly used to expand enrollment. It is the most active internationalization activity on campus. For research universities, especially top research universities, transnational higher education’s major function is to provide academic opportunities for those aspiring for advanced professional degrees. It is only one of the many internationalization activities on campus. Teaching universities tend to use transnational higher education more to generate revenue and reduce cost.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Transnational higher education is widely understood as education “in which learners are located in a country different from the one where the awarding institution is based” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1028315311410607">UNESCO &amp; Council of Europe, 2001</xref>). The development of transnational higher education in recent years has broadened the concept to comprise not only the mobility of course content (up to a whole program) but also providers (institutions) across jurisdictional borders. This research focuses on transnational higher education in China, which is a new education form mostly found in the higher education sector that involves the “cooperation between foreign education institutions and Chinese education institutions in establishing programs or institutions to deliver education service within the territory of China mainly to Chinese citizens” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1028315311410607">State Council of China, 2003</xref>). The Chinese name for it is Zhongwai hezuo banxue. Transnational higher education in China, like elsewhere, involves the mobility of courses, programs, and providers across national borders. But at the same time, it has some unique characteristics. Transnational higher education in China emphasizes the concept of cooperation, which, as interpreted in Regulations of the People’s Republic of China on Zhongwai Hezuo Banxue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1028315311410607">State Council of China, 2003</xref>), refers to investments from both Chinese and foreign higher education institutions in the forms of capital, land-use right, objects, intellectual property rights, and other properties such as institutional brand, curriculum, management system, and so on. In other words, in the context of China, an education provision is considered transnational when substantial investment from both foreign and Chinese sides are involved even if the provision does not award foreign degrees.</p>
<p>Transnational higher education is growing very fast in many parts of the world. It is widely acknowledged as an emerging global trend. However, despite its fast development, research done on transnational higher education is still very limited. Especially, “the gathering of data on cross border mobility of programs and providers is still nascent “(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1028315311410607">Knight, 2008</xref>, p. 21). A very large part of the existing literature on transnational higher education concerns the “what” and “why” questions. It succeeds in presenting a general picture of transnational higher education development and the rationales behind it at the international, regional, and national levels but fails to show what is going on at the institutional and individual levels. This research aims to extend the current literature by providing an insight into transnational higher education development at the institutional level. The units of analysis are the Chinese partner universities of transnational higher education programs. Transnational education in China has been growing dramatically since the mid-1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1028315311410607">Gu, 2008</xref>, p. 11). More than 1,000 programs and institutions are approved by the government, higher education provisions being the majority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1028315311410607">Yuan, Z, 2010</xref>). In contrast to many other countries, transnational higher education in China must be jointly delivered by foreign and Chinese higher education institutions. And according to Regulations of the People’s Republic of China on Zhongwai Hezuo Banxue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1028315311410607">State Council of China, 2003</xref>), the president should be Chinese. Therefore, the Chinese partner universities play a very significant role in the development of transnational higher education. Higher education reforms in recent years, especially Project 985 and Project 211, are stratifying universities in China. A hierarchical structure of research and teaching universities is gradually taking shape. This research aims to find out if transnational higher education is developed and perceived differently in these two categories of universities. Many studies on the development of transnational higher education focus on the activities themselves, instead of putting them into a broader context and exploring the connection between the two. This study tries to fill in this gap by placing transnational higher education in the context of higher education reforms and analyzing it from the perspective of the Chinese partner universities. The research questions are as follows:</p>

<p>The article starts with a review of the related literature and an introduction to the background of transnational higher education in China. It then explains the data collection method and the research findings. Finally, the article ends with a discussion on the findings and their implication for future research.</p>

<title>The Activities of Transnational Higher Education</title>
<p>A large part of the literature on transnational higher education is devoted to the description and categorization of the activities at the international, regional, and national levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1028315311410607">Australian Vice-Chancellors’ Committee, 2003</xref>; Blight, &amp; West, 1999; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1028315311410607">Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1028315311410607">Garrett, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1028315311410607">Huang, 2003</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1028315311410607">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1028315311410607">Knight, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1028315311410607">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1028315311410607">Larsen, Momii, &amp; Vincent-Lancrin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1028315311410607">Verbik &amp; Merkley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1028315311410607">Vik, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1028315311410607">Vincent-Lancrin,2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1028315311410607">Yang, 2008</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1028315311410607">2006</xref>). It is reported that transnational higher education occurs mostly in the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and in South America. It is most often undertaken by Australian, British, and U.S. institutions. Although institutional mobility is a small but growing phenomenon, program mobility is much more established in the educational landscape. The hotspots of program mobility are in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Malaysia in descending order. China and India are emerging markets. To this date, the conventional higher education institutions have been delivering the majority of transnational higher education programs. The major modalities of transnational higher education activities include Franchising; Twinning degrees; Program articulations; Branch campus; Virtual/distance learning; corporate programs.</p>
<p>In China, studies on transitional higher education share similar characteristics as those of other regions. The description of transnational higher education activities, such as the number of programs, areas, and subjects, constitutes a major part of the literature. Research has been conducted at the national, local, and group levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1028315311410607">Cao, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1028315311410607">Dong, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1028315311410607">Mok &amp; Xu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1028315311410607">Wang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1028315311410607">Zhang &amp; Zhao, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1028315311410607">Zhu &amp; Sui, 2003</xref>). Categorization of the activities has been made from different perspectives such as the length of schooling, the degrees conferred, the legal status, and so on.</p>
<p>To this end, little effort has been made to look at the development of transnational higher education within and among different groups of institutions. An examination from this perspective is important because it can deepen our understanding of transnational higher education by revealing the dynamics between the development of transnational higher education and the condition of universities. To fill this void, this article presents a comparative description of transnational higher education programs conducted in both research and teaching universities. It tries to explore the dynamics between university types and program types.</p>

<title>Rationales of Transnational Higher Education</title>
<p>Rationales identified from existing literature are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1028315311410607">Table 1</xref>. Though this framework covers rationales at national, institutional, and student levels from both exporting and importing sides (for student level, only the importing side is explored), it suffers from a lack of empirical proof. There have been many studies of rationales at the national level through policy analysis. Rationales at the institutional and student levels are left largely untouched except for a few case studies of individual programs or institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1028315311410607">Luo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1028315311410607">Pyvis &amp; Chapman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1028315311410607">Wang, 2006</xref>), not to mention the subgroups under the two levels. This article fills in the gap by providing an empirical study at the institutional level. Based on literature review, eight rationales (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1028315311410607">Table 2</xref>) are developed and tested on universities that conduct transnational higher education programs. In addition, it compares the differences between subgroups, namely, research universities and teaching universities and relates the differences to the larger context of higher education system.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<sec id="section6-1028315311410607">
<title>Project 211 and Project 985</title>
<p>Project 211 is an endeavor of the Chinese government to build approximately 100 key universities, key disciplines, and specifications in the 21st century. It involves the construction of three networks: a network of key higher education institutions; a network of key disciplines and specifications; a network of information sharing. Higher education institutions, disciplines, and specifications are selected into the project based on their research capacity and the effect they have on national and regional socioeconomic development. It is hoped that, through intensive financial support, significant improvement will be achieved in aspects such as teaching, research, administration, and efficiency. Project 211 is the most heavily invested higher education project ever in the history of People’s Republic of China. During 1995-2005, about 36.8 billion renminbi (RMB) had been disbursed. To this end, 114 universities have been included in Project 211, which is only less than 6% of the total number of higher education institutions in China. However, these universities educate four fifths of all PhD students, two thirds of all master’s students and half of all international students. And they own 85% of the national key disciplines, 96% of the national key laboratories, and 70% of the research fund. About 87% of teachers with PhD degrees are working at universities in 211 Project (hereinafter referred to as 211 Universities; Ministry of Education[MOE], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1028315311410607">2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Project 985 is one further step by the Chinese government to improve the quality of higher education. Universities included in Project 985(hereinafter referred to as 985 Universities) are 211 Universities as well. What differentiate them from the rest of 211 Universities is that they are the ones with the greatest potential for success in the international academic community. The aim of Project 985 is to establish within the next 10 or 20 years some world class universities and a group of internationally recognized high-level research universities. The implementation of the project revolves around 5 tasks: mechanism innovation; team development; platform and base construction; infrastructure support; international exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1028315311410607">MOE, 2008</xref>). In the initial stage, funding was made available only to two universities: Beijing University and Qinghua University. A 3-year grant of 1.8 billion RMB was provided. Later, another seven universities were added and provided with a 3-year grant of 1 billion RMB. The second phase of the project launched in 2004 and expanded the number of the universities to 39. A total of 985 Universities are generally regarded as the best research universities in China. The first 9 universities included in 985 Project constitute less than 1% of the total number of the universities. But they possess 50% of the national key laboratories and one third of the annual government research fund. And, they train 20% of the total master’s students and 30% of the total PhD students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1028315311410607">Ji, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1028315311410607">
<title>Differentiation of Universities</title>
<p>Key universities and key disciplines are not new ideas. Since the establishment of People’s Republic of China, the central government has paid attention to the construction of them. From 1954 to 1981, 96 universities had been designated as key universities and were given additional funds for development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1028315311410607">MOE, 2008</xref>).The implementation of Project 985 and 211 further entrenched what is already a two-tier higher education system. Like many other countries, China is currently also facing a growing constraint of public expenditure on higher education. Government expenditure for higher education in real terms has increased, but the proportion of GNP for education has fallen annually. The 985 and 211 Universities occupy a very large part of the expenditure. The majority of the universities, particularly local institutions with low prestige, increasingly have to depend on themselves to generate a large proportion of the revenue. Limited budget makes it difficult for them to put much effort into teaching and research improvement. Meanwhile, they play a major role in the expansion of higher education enrollment. Statistics shows that gap in per student expenditure between national and local higher education institutions increased from 3,708 RMB in 1998 to 8,196 RMB in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1028315311410607">Liu &amp; Wang, 2010</xref>). Many scholars point out that China’s higher education has evolved into a hierarchical and diversified system: national universities remain at the top, ambitiously focusing on attaining “world-class” status and promoting national competitiveness and prestige; local public universities remain in the middle, acting as the major providers for higher education and contributing to local development; and private institutions are largely at the bottom, focusing on vocational programs. Transnational higher education programs are conducted within Chinese universities. The huge differences between research universities and teaching universities prompt the question, “Is transnational higher education developed and perceived the same by the two categories of universities?”</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section8-1028315311410607" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This study employs a quantitative research method. Two data sets are utilized to analyze the differences between research universities and teaching universities in terms of the types of transnational higher education programs undertaken and their perception on them.</p>
<p>Data set 1 gives information on the types of programs. It is compiled by the author with information published by MOE on all the degree-awarding transnational higher education programs approved by the government by July 19, 2010. In total, 489 programs are included. Data are grouped under the following variables: the rank of the Chinese university; the nationality of the foreign education provider; the educational level of the program; the type of qualification, the subject of the course; the date of registration; the admission method. It has to be pointed out that universities provide nondegree transnational higher education programs too. This study focuses on degree-awarding programs because (a) degree-awarding programs are very important to their institutions and attract most attention from the government; (b) according to MOE, the total number of transnational programs and institutions, including ones run by other education sectors, is above 1,000. The number 489 is nearly half of the total number and therefore can be regarded as representing the majority of the programs provided by universities. (c) Accurate information only exists for this group of programs.</p>
<p>Data set 2 gives information about the perception of universities on transnational higher education programs. It is compiled with data from a questionnaire survey conducted by the author in July 2010 on universities that undertake transnational higher education programs. No data exist on the size of the population. The survey was implemented in Chinese in a sample of 167 universities identified from data set 1. Given that data set 1 represents the majority of the programs provided by universities, it could be argued that this sample is representative of the whole population. The 167 universities comprise 21 (13%) 985 Universities, 32 (19%) 211 Universities, and 114 (68%) universities at provincial and municipal levels. For analysis purpose, 985 and 211 Universities are grouped as research universities. The rest are put together as teaching universities.</p>
<p>The items on the survey are developed based on previous literature and a similar survey done by JICA (JICA’s 1,000 cross-border programs survey). A web page investigation of universities is also made to determine the existing internationalization activities within these universities. The respondents are asked about the rationales for conducting transnational higher education programs and other internationalization activities, and the activeness of each internationalization activity. A 5-point Likert-type scale is used to measure the significance of each item.</p>
<p>Survey questionnaires were sent by email to the international offices of all the universities in the sample and were reinforced by phone calls afterward. A total of 62 (37%) universities responded. About 40% (25) of them are research universities, among which 10 are 985 Universities and 15 are 211 Universities. Teaching universities constitute 60% (37) of the respondents. This distribution is close to that of the sample. The number of universities of both categories makes comparison possible.</p>

<title>Education Levels of Transnational Higher Education Programs and the Types of Degree Conferred</title>
<p>In general, bachelor degree programs constitute the majority (71.6%). Master’s and PhD programs each account for 27.6% and 0.8% of the total. As far as bachelor’s degree programs are concerned, 74% of them confer Chinese degrees only. The rest of them award double degrees (16%) and foreign degrees (10%). As for master and PhD programs, 90% of them lead to the attainment of foreign degrees only. A comparison between research universities and teaching universities in the above aspects reveals some very interesting differences.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1028315311410607">Figure 1</xref> shows the differences regarding degrees awarded by research universities and teaching universities. Compared with research universities, teaching universities tend more to award their own qualifications. Of the programs offered by teaching universities, 86.9% involve granting their own degrees, which is more than double the rate of research universities (42.4%). On the other hand, research universities have a very high percentage (57.6%) of programs that lead to foreign degrees only. To advance the understanding of the dynamics between university ranks and degrees, a further comparison is made by recategorizing research universities into the groups of 985 and 211 Universities. The results show (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1028315311410607">Figure 2</xref>) that 985 Universities have a much higher percentage (70.4%) of foreign degree programs than 211 Universities. And they don’t conduct programs that lead to Chinese degrees only.</p>

<p>Education levels of the programs delivered by teaching universities and research universities present significant differences too (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1028315311410607">Figure 3</xref>). Teaching universities have the highest percentage (86.3%) of bachelor’s degree programs. As the rank of universities goes higher, the percentage of bachelor’s degree programs becomes lower. The proportion of advanced degree programs follows an opposite pattern.</p>

</fig>
<p>From the data collected, it can be observed that research universities’ focal area of transnational higher education is advanced degree study. Even though conducted at the Chinese campus, a very large proportion of their programs lead to foreign degrees only. This is especially so in 985 Universities. On the contrary, teaching universities’ focal area is bachelor’s degree study. Most of the programs lead to Chinese degrees only.</p>

<sec id="section11-1028315311410607">
<title>Student Source</title>
<p>All programs that involve conferring Chinese degrees (including double degrees) must recruit students according to the national plan, which means they only recruit students who pass a certain standard in the national examination. Currently, there is no accurate information on the score standard because it varies across universities and regions. However, there is a general belief that it is lower than the regular programs of the universities. To gain more insight into this issue, a web page investigation of the universities is conducted to find out where these programs are delivered. The results show that the majority (70%) of the programs with Chinese degrees involved are implemented not in regular departments but in second level colleges, usually termed by the name of international college, international education college, or international business college. There are a few government initiated colleges that are built to enhance cooperation and communication in top research universities, for example, Beihang Sino-French Engineer School, Shanghai Jiao Tong University SJTU-UM Joint Institute, and Sino-German College of Applied Science of Tongji University. Most of the second level colleges are dependent institutes of the universities. They are built to enlarge higher education enrollment and generally admit students with lower scores.</p>
<p>Student recruitment of foreign degree programs is very flexible, basically depending on education providers’ decisions. More than 90% of the programs are advanced degree programs, which lead mostly to the attainment of professional master’s degrees (degrees that teach career oriented skills). The learners are required to have English ability, relevant knowledge/working experience, and bachelor’s/equivalent degrees. It is difficult to track where they are held. Some of them are in regular departments. Some are in second level colleges. Some are in continuing education centers.</p>
<p>In light of the findings above, student source of research universities and teaching universities are estimated to be different given their differences in the kind of degrees conferred. Significant variations should be found between 985 Universities and teaching universities, one being mainly mature students and the other high school graduates.</p>

<sec id="section12-1028315311410607">
<title>Subjects and Origins of Foreign Education Providers</title>
<p>Business-related subjects such as management, accounting, and finance occupy a dominant position (42.7%), followed by IT (12%), engineering (11.3%), and medicine (5.6%). Foreign education providers mainly come from United Kingdom (20.8%), Australia (15.9%), America (15.9%), and Russia (13.6%). Research and teaching universities show no big difference in the two aspects, except that there is more cooperation between 985 universities and Hongkong.</p>

<title>The Activeness of Transnational Higher Education programs</title>
<p>Eleven existing internationalization activities are identified from the web pages of universities’ international offices. In the questionnaire, the respondents are asked to mark the activities they have and rate how active each activity is. The purpose of these two questions is to find out how active transnational higher education programs are in comparison to other internationalization activities and whether the two categories of universities are different in this aspect. The results show that, in general, activeness of transnational higher education programs is high among all the internationalization activities conducted. For teaching universities, transnational higher education programs are the most active internationalization activities, followed by the employment of foreign experts. For research universities, transnational higher education programs are not the most active. Many other activities such as outgoing opportunities for students, recruitment of international students, and international research collaboration are rated as more active (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1028315311410607">Figure 4</xref>). In addition, it is noted that all internationalization activities are rated as more active for research universities than for teaching universities with the exception of transnational higher education programs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1028315311410607">Figure 4</xref>). While going through the web page of universities’ international offices, a similar phenomenon was observed. Many teaching universities, especially those of small scale, have transnational higher education programs shown in prominence. On the web page of some small universities with low prestige, there is barely anything to read about except for information on transitional higher education programs. While on research universities’ web page, transnational higher education programs are not given special attention.</p>

<title>Rationales for Conducting Transnational Higher Education Programs</title>
<p>In general, academic and cultural rationales are given more importance than economic rationales. The three most important reasons for conducting transnational higher education programs are to obtain high quality of education, to promote reputation, and to cultivate cross-culture knowledge of students and staff. The three least important reasons are to improve research quality, to increase revenue, and to reduce the cost of curriculum development and facilities upgrading (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1028315311410607">Figure 5</xref>). There are distinctions between research universities and teaching universities (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1028315311410607">Figure 6</xref>). It appears that teaching universities want more to use transnational higher education programs to obtain high quality of education, to increase revenues, and to reduce cost. Research universities tend to want more to use transnational higher education programs to promote reputation and to cultivate cross-culture knowledge. The difference between the two is especially obvious regarding the rationale of increasing revenue. It is rated much more important by teaching universities than by research universities.</p>

<p>To gain a deeper understanding of the perception of universities on transnational higher education programs, a horizontal comparison is made between transnational higher education programs and two other traditional internationalization activities: internationalization of curriculum and employment of foreign experts and staff with overseas education background. They are chosen because they share the same characteristics with transnational higher education programs: targeting Chinese students and being carried out within the territory of China. In addition, they are very commonly found on the average university campus, and therefore receive very high responding rate. The results show that transnational higher education programs are perceived less importantly as an instrument to improve education and research quality than the other two activities. But their function of income generation appears to be stronger than the other two. This applies to research universities as well as teaching universities. The difference between research universities and teaching universities is that research universities view the two traditional internationalization activities as more important tools to respond to international higher education market. Teaching universities are just the opposite (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1028315311410607">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1028315311410607">8</xref>). This, in a way, corresponds to the findings on the activeness issue. Even though income generation is shown as the least important rationales from the test result, the differences between research universities and teaching universities and between transnational higher education programs and the other two internationalization activities indicate the existence of some possible commercial factors.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The major difference between research universities and teaching universities is that research universities emphasize delivering advanced degree programs while teaching universities concentrate on providing bachelor’s degree programs. It is hard to argue that this phenomenon is caused by the different priorities of the two categories of universities (one being research and the other being teaching) because both of them offer very market-oriented courses and deliver the majority of the programs outside of the traditional department. The findings on degree types and student source strongly suggest that transnational higher education programs are currently being conducted by Chinese partner universities for two major functions: to contribute to higher education expansion and to provide academic opportunities for those aspiring for advanced professional degrees. Teaching universities, as the major sector that absorbs the increased number of students, are mainly using transnational higher education programs to assist the expansion. In 2004, 7,549 students were enrolled in undergraduate level transnational higher education programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1028315311410607">Tan, 2006</xref>), which accounts for nearly 0.4% of total undergraduate students (2,099,151) admitted by universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1028315311410607">MOE, 2004</xref>). Research universities, especially the very top universities, with less pressure for student enrollment and more advantages in education quality, emphasize more on using transnational higher education programs to provide academic opportunities for advanced professional degrees. Another difference between the two categories of universities relates to the activeness of transnational higher education programs. Given the strong capacity and the long international exchange history of research universities, it is natural that transnational higher education programs are not among the most active activities. What is worth noting is that transnational higher education programs are rated as the most active activities by teaching universities. Furthermore, all internationalization activities are rated as more active for research universities than for teaching universities with the exception of transnational higher education programs. It has to be admitted that the research question is designed subjectively and therefore the objectivity of the answers could be questioned. Nevertheless, a hypothesis can still be made: transnational higher education programs have some different characteristics from traditional international activities, which make them very popular in teaching universities.</p>
<p>In line with the two major functions are the rationales of transnational higher education programs. Education improvement, cross-cultural training, reputation promotion are the most anticipated benefits, followed by curriculum development and market competitiveness. Research enhancement is not considered as important, which fits in the context of professional degree education and higher education expansion. It is a surprise that revenue generation and cost reduction are rated as the least important as this is against the findings of previous literature. Considering the sensitivity of money issue, there is a possibility that the two might be underrated. The finding that transnational higher education programs are more economically orientated than similar traditional international activities, to some degree support the existing literature. The most obvious difference between teaching universities and research universities is that revenues generation and cost reduction are rated more importantly by teaching universities than by research universities. In addition, teaching universities also show stronger will to use transnational higher education programs to improve education quality. This finding can be explained by the economic and academic situation of the two categories of universities. Due to the use of 5-point Likert-type scale, the importance levels of the rationales are very close. It is hard to observe very obvious differences between the variables. However, the findings still give us a glimpse at the differences between the two categories of universities.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>China’s higher education reforms in the last decade have led to an increasingly stratified higher education system. There exist significant differences in the internal and external environment of teaching universities and research universities, which affect their strategies on transnational higher education development. This study finds that transnational higher education programs are developed and perceived differently by the two categories of universities and that, unlike the general belief that transnational higher education is very much profit driven, academic and cultural outcomes are considered as most important rationales by the receiving institutions. Even though there is a possibility that the economic rationales could be intentionally underrated, this finding urges people to look at transnational higher education from multiple perspectives. Due to the limitation of research methods, the information conveyed is still limited and some differences revealed are not obvious enough. However, it proves that there is a necessity to study the influence of institutional environment on transnational higher education.</p>
