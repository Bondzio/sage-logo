<abstract>
<p>Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a severe inflammatory disorder characterized by activation and proliferation of lymphocytes and histiocytes with cytokine release and uncontrolled hemophagocytosis, especially late in the course of the disease. Clinical features include relapsing fevers, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, lymphadenopathy, and coagulopathy. The diagnosis can be challenging, as the early signs and symptoms are nonspecific and no specific laboratory tests exist. This syndrome is frequently not recognized and has a significant mortality rate. Typical scenarios in which HLH should be considered include mononucleosis (fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy) in an infant or young child, aseptic meningitis associated with cytopenias, or a viral syndrome-like illness with cytopenias and lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, for example. Our approach includes measuring a ferritin level as a screening tool early in the course of such an illness. Two cases of HLH are reviewed, illustrating the frequent complexity of these cases and potential pitfalls to making a prompt diagnosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) or hemophagocytic syndrome is a severe inflammatory disorder caused by disruption of natural killer (NK) T-cell function, which triggers excessive activation, proliferation, and ectopic migration of lymphocytes and histiocytes, unrestrained hemophagocytosis, and overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines. This immunologic compromise causes relapsing fevers, rash, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, coagulopathy, and hyperferritinemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812465945">1</xref></sup> It was first reported as virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (VAHS) by Risdall et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812465945">2</xref></sup> HLH may occur either as a primary condition with a genetic etiology or as a secondary condition associated with an immunologic disorder, malignancy, or infection. Infections associated with HLH are most frequently viral, particularly Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and other herpesviruses, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza, parvovirus, and hepatitis viruses; bacterial, fungal, and parasitic causes are much less common. The incidence of HLH approximates 1.2 children per million per year, or 1 in 50 000 to 100 000 live births, with a male to female ratio close to 1:1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812465945">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812465945">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>HLH is a rare disease with an aggressive course and often fatal despite treatment, perhaps in part because it is frequently unrecognized. HLH comprises autosomal recessive familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, familial erythrophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, VAHS, and infection-associated hemophagocytic syndrome, adding to diagnostic confusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812465945">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812465945"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812465945"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812465945"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812465945">9</xref></sup> It may mimic a number of common conditions such as nonspecific febrile illness,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812465945">10</xref></sup> liver disease with coagulopathy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812465945">11</xref></sup> and multi-organ failure syndrome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812465945">12</xref></sup> especially early in the clinical course. This diagnostic dilemma is illustrated by a study in which the diagnosis of HLH was made antemortem in only 11 of 32 patients with HLH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812465945">4</xref></sup> The objective of this report is to review 2 cases of HLH, illustrating the frequent complexity of HLH cases and potential pitfalls to making a prompt diagnosis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0009922812465945">
<title>Case A</title>
<p>A 6-year-old Moroccan-American female developed progressive diffuse lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and relapsing fevers of unknown etiology. She was well until age 4 when she was diagnosed with autoimmune neutropenia. She started having easy bruisability, was noted to be vomiting, and had generalized petechiae. Her platelet count was 12 000/mm<sup>3</sup> and her direct Coombs test was very strongly positive. A bone marrow aspirate showed a normal marrow with erythroid hyperplasia and many megakaryocytes, but normal flow cytometry studies. She was initially treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (Ig) without response. She was then managed with oral corticosteroids for the next 2½ years. She had an excellent response, but several attempts to wean the corticosteroid therapy failed, so she underwent splenectomy. After splenectomy her platelets were normal. Pathologic examination of the spleen revealed epitheloid granulomas accompanied by multinucleated giant cells.</p>
<p>Four months after splenectomy, she began to develop recurrent fevers of unclear etiology despite an extensive evaluation, as well as progressive diffuse lymphadenopathy. Physical examination over the course of repeated hospitalizations revealed a well-developed, well-nourished, but somewhat ill-appearing female child. She had a temperature of 102.6°F, heart rate of 127/minute, respiratory rate of 24/minute, blood pressure of 94/51 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation on room air of 100%. She also had posterior occipital adenopathy and diffuse adenopathy in the axilla and groin. Her abdomen was distended with a liver that extended to the umbilicus and across to the left upper quadrant. There was a transient rash that was red and lacy. As her symptoms recurred on multiple occasions, she was noted to have increasing adenopathy, as well as severe to massive hepatomegaly.</p>
<p>Laboratory studies included the following values: hemoglobin of 12.8 g/dL; hematocrit of 36.9%; white blood cell count of 8400/mm<sup>3</sup> (15% bands, 54% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 30% lymphocytes, 1% monocyte, slight atypical lymphocytosis, and positive Howell-Jolly bodies); platelet count of 216 000/mm<sup>3</sup>; total protein of 6.1 g/dL; albumin of 3.7 g/dL; bilirubin of 0.3 mg/dL; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 145 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 212 U/L; alkaline phosphatase of 865 U/L (reference range = 95-460); fibrinogen of 143 mg/dL; triglyceride of 2006 mg/dL; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 3000 U/L (reference range = 313-618); and ferritin peaking at 3054 ng/mL. Her lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus IgG level was 1:64, with a negative IgM. Studies for <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, cytomegalovirus (CMV), EBV, hepatitis viruses, human immunodeficiency virus, <italic>Brucella, Bartonella, Leptospira, Histoplasma capsulatum</italic>, and <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> were negative.</p>
<p>Additional evaluation revealed a normal antinuclear antibody, anti-DNA, and antimitochondrial antibody; normal NK cell function; and IgM of 501 mg/dL, IgG of 1850 mg/dL, and IgA less than 6.7 mg/dL. Molecular diagnostic studies revealed no mutations in the MUNC 13-4 or perforin genes. The proportion of cytotoxic cells expressing perforin and granzyme were normal to elevated. In addition, her soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) was elevated at 13 634 pCi/mL (reference range = 373-4321 pCi/mL). Evaluations for autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome, and hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome were negative.</p>
<p>Computed tomography showed progressive hepatomegaly and extensive supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, hilar, retroperitoneal, intraperitoneal, and retrocrural lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules. A percutaneous liver biopsy was notable for granulomatous hepatitis in which epitheloid granulomas were accompanied by multinucleated giant cells (as seen in the spleen). Axillary lymph node biopsy revealed granulomatous lymphadenitis with follicular hyperplasia. Bone marrow evaluation was notable for normal cellular trilineage maturing hematopoiesis with mild megakaryocytic hyperplasia, lymphocytosis with few lymphoid aggregates, and hemophagocytosis, confirming HLH.</p>
<p>Following extensive evaluations at multiple institutions, HLH was considered the most likely diagnosis. However, the child moved back to Morocco and was lost to follow-up before treatment could be initiated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0009922812465945">
<title>Case B</title>
<p>A previously healthy 2-year-old male was admitted with an 8-day history of fever and cytopenia. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 105.7°F, heart rate of 136/minute, respiratory rate of 28/minute, and blood pressure of 98/52 mm Hg. He had hepatomegaly and his spleen tip was palpable. There was no rash or adenopathy.</p>
<p>Laboratory studies included the following values: hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL; hematocrit of 23.2%; white blood cell count of 3000/mm<sup>3</sup> (absolute neutrophil count of 2310/mm<sup>3</sup>, absolute lymphocyte count of 570/mm<sup>3</sup>); platelet count of 91 000/mm<sup>3</sup>; C-reactive protein of 73 mg/L; calcium of 7.9 mg/dL; total protein of 4.7 g/dL; albumin of 2.1 g/dL; bilirubin of 0.7 mg/dL; ALT of 242 U/L; AST of 128 U/L; alkaline phosphatase of 884 U/L; fibrinogen of 197 mg/dL; D-dimer greater than 5000 ng/mL (reference range = 0-400 ng/mL); LDH of 2505 U/L; ferritin peaking at 852 ng/mL; and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase of 450 U/L (reference range = 15-73 U/L).</p>
<p>Cytomegalovirus IgG was detected, but IgM was negative, indicating a past infection. <italic>Rickettsia rickettsii</italic> IgG titers were detected at 1:64. EBV viral capsid antigen IgG was positive (4.28), but IgM and Epstein–Barr nuclear antigen antibodies were not detected (≤0.91), suggesting a recent, but not acute, infection. Antibodies to <italic>Francisella tularensis, Ehrlichia chafeensis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Brucella, Bartonella henselae, Bartonella quintana</italic>, and parvovirus B19 were not detected. Malaria review was negative. Nasal wash showed negative results for influenza A and B and respiratory syncytial virus. Blood, throat, urine, and stool cultures were negative. An interferon-γ release assay was indeterminate. Echocardiogram was normal.</p>
<p>Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed hepatosplenomegaly with numerous splenic lesions and persistent ascites. The spleen had multiple round lesions measuring up to 1.8 cm. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple hypoenhancing masses throughout the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812465945">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0009922812465945">2</xref>).</p>

<p>Under sonographic guidance, 6 fine needle aspirations of the spleen were obtained. Smears and cell block demonstrated few foci consistent with granulomatous inflammation. Acid-fast bacilli, Gomori methenamine silver, and Warthin-Starry stains showed no microorganisms. Spleen specimen for flow cytometric studies showed no detectable evidence of B- or T-cell lymphoproliferation. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy smears revealed normal cells with a myeloid to erythroid ratio within normal limits and no altered antigenicity. The lymphocytes were small and mature-appearing. No increase in blasts was observed. Megakaryocytes were present. The differential count was as follows: neutrophils and precursors 55%, erythroid 20%, lymphocytes 21%, eosinophils 3%, and plasma cell 1%. There was no infiltration of a malignant clone, no morphologic sign of acute leukemia or lymphoma, and no hemophagocytosis. Special stains for acid-fast bacilli, spirochetes, and fungi were negative. Special stain for iron showed decreased stainable marrow iron stores.</p>
<p>On the basis of the above findings, and despite the absence of tissue hemophagocytosis, a diagnosis of HLH was made. He was treated for HLH and had a good response at early follow-up.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The precise pathophysiology of HLH is not clear. However, it is clear that HLH is a reactive disorder characterized by dysregulation of cytotoxic T cells and NK cells, resulting in hyperactivation of lymphocytes and histiocytes. There is uncontrolled proliferation and migration of histiocytes to the reticuloendothelial system, leading to aggressive tissue hemophagocytosis and abnormal cytokine release. This leads to a multi-organ dysfunction syndrome and, ultimately, a high mortality rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812465945">13</xref></sup> Elevation of multiple proinflammatory cytokines leads to a syndromic picture of relapsing fevers, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, easy bruisability, coagulopathy, rash, aseptic meningitis, icterus, cytopenias, hyperlipidemia, hypofibrinogenemia, hyperferritinemia, transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hyponatremia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812465945">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Diagnostic criteria for HLH were published in 2004 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812465945">Table 1</xref>). Additional clinical findings include aseptic meningitis, rash, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, icterus, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, transaminitis, hypoalbuminemia, hyponatremia, elevated D-dimer, and increased LDH. Demonstration of hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes may be challenging, and it may be absent in the first bone marrow specimen in almost 20% of cases, for example.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812465945">6</xref></sup> To identify the characteristic histology, repeated attempts may be necessary. The inability to demonstrate hemophagocytosis should not prevent diagnosis or treatment of HLH, provided that the other clinical criteria are met. To add further diagnostic uncertainty, the other criteria for HLH have been noted to lack specificity and sensitivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922812465945">15</xref></sup> For example, among 20 Japanese neonates with HLH, 8 (40%) did not have fever, and hypertriglyceridemia and neutropenia were present in only 15% to 30%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812465945">16</xref></sup> However, although individual criteria may lack specificity, it is the presence, magnitude, and progression of multiple criteria that are important for making a diagnosis of HLH. An example of this is the magnitude of hyperferritinemia present. One of the criteria for diagnosis of HLH is ferritin ≥500 ng/mL. However, at this level there is substantial overlap with other diagnoses. Among 330 patients with ferritin levels &gt;500 ng/mL, only 10 (3%) were diagnosed with HLH. Ferritin levels &gt;10 000 ng/mL, in contrast, were 90% sensitive and 96% specific for HLH, with minimal overlap with sepsis, infections, and liver failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812465945">17</xref></sup></p>

<p>Patient A presented with recurrent fevers, rash, hepatomegaly, adenopathy, cytopenias, hypertryglyceridemia, hypofibrinogenemia, hemophagocytosis, and elevated sIL-2R and ferritin levels, which are the key hallmarks of HLH. She met 5 criteria for HLH (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812465945">Table 1</xref>), although her ferritin level only reached 3054 ng/mL. Splenomegaly, another key criterion, cannot be commented on as her splenectomy was already performed when she first presented with fevers. She had cytopenia early in the course of the disease, but not with the fever, when the diagnosis of HLH was being considered, which further complicated diagnostic considerations and led to extensive evaluations for other possible causes.</p>
<p>Patient B presented with persistent fevers, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, transaminitis, hyperferritinemia, and relative hypofibrinogenemia (decreased for the laboratory range, but not low enough to fulfill the HLH diagnostic criteria). The patient lacked hemophagocytosis in the spleen and bone marrow biopsy specimens, which is a key element in the diagnosis of HLH, but frequently not identified early in the illness. Despite the absence of hemophagocytosis, the most likely diagnosis was thought to be HLH. Serologic evidence of recent, but not acute, EBV infection suggests a possible infectious trigger for VAHS.</p>
<p>In VAHS, the inflammatory responses are disrupted. Perforin expression and cytotoxic function of T cells and NK cells decreases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812465945">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922812465945">19</xref></sup> Specialized secretory lysosomes store granyzyme and perforin proteins and secrete them when they encounter a virally infected cell, resulting in apoptosis. An infectious insult causes severe immune dysregulation when such perforin-mediated cytotoxicity is diminished. Whether EBV causes HLH or infectious mononucleosis seems to depend on the variant of EBV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922812465945">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Especially because HLH often has a fatal or aggressive course, and prognosis depends on timely treatment, it can be concluded that HLH should be high in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with several of the following diagnostic criteria, including high fever, rash, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, cytopenias, coagulopathy, abnormal liver function, and high serum ferritin. The early clinical course can mimic a variety of much more common pediatric illnesses. The recognition of HLH must be made on clinical, pathologic, and biologic features and initiation of effective treatment should follow promptly.</p>
