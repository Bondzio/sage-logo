<abstract>
<p>The pacifist stance of western modernity that shaped the development of sociology and ethnic studies marginalises sociopolitical violence or construes it as an exceptional phenomenon of contemporary social life. The examination of the formation of Rwandan modernity and its recent history of genocidal violence highlights the connections that exist between peace and violence historically, contextually and situationally. In this article the author adopts the theoretical framework ‘interconnected modernities’ to emphasise how partial connections and selective choices made in the formation of Rwandan modernity shaped the country’s peaceful and violent ethnic relations. Subsequently, the author problematises the exceptionalism of genocidal violence through the analysis of demographic data that contextualises the Rwandan genocide as violence embedded in social life. Lastly, the author introduces the category Invisible Majority to highlight the permeable boundaries that exist between peaceful and violent relations. In conclusion, the author calls for violence to be mainstreamed in sociology and ethnic studies as a key element of the ‘dark side’ of interconnected modernities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The birth of sociology in the latter part of the 19th century is rooted in western modernity, both historically – situated within the modern period dating back to the 16th century – and geographically – rooted in the modern world, which for the founders of sociology and social theory was synonymous with western industrial societies.</p>
<p>Three main phases characterise the development of sociological research on modern societies and modernity: distinctiveness, homogeneity and diversification. Classical sociologists were interested in understanding the distinctive features of modern societies, which they saw as different from those of premodern and non-modern societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011392112456507">Eisenstadt, 1973</xref>). In the second half of the 20th century, the tendency to universalise the project of modernity to non-western societies through development initiatives meant that a homogeneous view of modernity prevailed. Research shifted from the analysis of distinct characteristics to that of ‘conditions for the emergence’ of modern societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011392112456507">Eisenstadt, 1973</xref>), with the presumption that pre- and non-modern societies too would follow the trajectory of western modernity to reach a final state of universal convergence. More recently, diversification has prevailed in the form of ‘multiple’ modernities, ‘alternative’ modernities or ‘varieties’ of modernity. For scholars of multiple modernities, the culturally specific formations of modernities in the Islamic, Eastern or African worlds are distinctively different from the classical formations of Europeanisation, Americanisation or westernisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392112456507">Deutsch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011392112456507">Sachsenmaier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011392112456507">Taylor, 1999</xref>). Supporters of the idea of ‘alternative’ modernities acknowledge difference and also challenge the hegemonic position of western modernity. Even scholars of modernity in the singular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011392112456507">Schmidt, 2004</xref>) or of global modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392112456507">Dirlik, 2003</xref>) acknowledge the existence of cultural and social variations. From an understanding of modernity as homogeneous and hegemonic, there has been a transition towards heterogeneous and diversified multiple modernities, or multiple interpretations of modernity, the aim of which is to de-westernise modernity, to separate modernity from westernisation and the monopoly of the west on modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011392112456507">Eisenstadt, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The tension between singularity and multiplicity has somewhat dominated discussions on modernity/ies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0011392112456507">Wittrock, 2000</xref>). This has downplayed the importance of connections, a limitation that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011392112456507">Hall (1992b)</xref> clearly exposed through his critique of the powerful discourse of ‘the West and the Rest’ – a discourse, he writes, that continues to inflect the language, theoretical models and hidden assumptions of modern sociology itself. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011392112456507">Hall (1992b)</xref> showed that the west forged its identity and interests in relation to endogenous developments in Europe and America, and through relations of unequal exchange with ‘the Rest’, the frequently excluded, conquered, colonised and exploited Other. ‘The West and the Rest became two sides of a single coin’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011392112456507">Hall, 1992b</xref>: 278), and what each is now depends on the relationship established between them long ago. Similarly, concepts like ‘entangled’ modernities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011392112456507">Therborn, 2003</xref>) or ‘hybrid’ cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011392112456507">Canclini, 1990</xref>) emphasise the importance of connections. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392112456507">Bhambra (2007)</xref> has introduced a framework for understanding modernity on the basis of ‘connected histories’, which recognises the particularity of western modernity as well as the particularity of others. The examination of interconnections, the author argues, permits the construction of a general structure of thinking that is predicated on the provisionality of any claim to adequacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392112456507">2007</xref>: 146–147).</p>
<p>This article shares with Hall, Therborn and Bhambra, among others, a concern with connections, and it introduces the theoretical framework ‘interconnected modernities’ to emphasise the existence of ‘partial connections’ among multiple modernities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011392112456507">Strathern (1991)</xref> calls ‘partial connections’ those whereby people, ideas and representations of space and time are interconnected but never totally symmetrical or fully integrated. Differently from Hall, Therborn and Bhambra, who show how western modernity is connected to formations of modernity/ies in ‘the Rest’, I examine the formation of Rwandan modernity as an example of how the history of ‘the Rest’ is interconnected with the west, as well as with regional and continental formations of modernity.</p>
<p>The distinctive contribution of this article to ongoing debates on modernities is to position violence at the centre of the analysis of formations of modernity/ies. As the following section will show, violence has been a neglected topic of sociological research because of the dominant pacifist stance of western modernity. The article argues that violence is a key element of the ‘dark side’ of interconnected modernities. Through the analysis of the formation of Rwandan modernity, the article shows not only that major social transformations in the formations of modernity/ies have been violent, but also that the boundaries between peace and violence are permeable: choices made during peaceful times have an impact on subsequent violent manifestations while the legacy of violence permeates social relations during peaceful times.</p>

<title>Violence: The ‘dark’ side of interconnected modernities</title>
<p>The founders of sociology examined modern societies, and in doing so they identified the advantages of being modern but they also discovered a ‘dark’ side internal to the societies they studied. Marx, Durkheim, Weber and Simmel respectively wrote of alienation, <italic>anomie</italic>, the iron cage and anonymity, which they placed at the heart of the condition of living in early 20th-century modern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011392112456507">Taylor, 1999</xref>). Classic sociologists of the 1920s and 1930s were ambivalent towards modernity as they witnessed the rise of fascism and the confrontation with communism, which were major concerns of European sociology at the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011392112456507">Sachsenmaier et al., 2002</xref>). Their concerns, however, were articulated as breakdowns of modernity, or in the case of Nazism as attempts at what might be called de-modernisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011392112456507">Eisenstadt, 1973</xref>).</p>
<p>In the second half of the 20th century, the positive sides of modern societies were emphasised, and a ‘Dr Jekyll only’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011392112456507">Taylor, 1999</xref>) social theory of modernisation was created that celebrated modernity as progress shorn of its negative downsides. In the shadow of Cold War rivalries, development models that treated capitalist societies unambiguously as success stories were devised to counter the attractions of communism to Third World countries, and the resulting modernisation theory was fully committed to the universalistic project of poor countries becoming modern, with the negative sides conveniently ignored or neglected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011392112456507">Taylor, 1999</xref>). Violence was an abnormality within modernisation theory, and was explained in terms of ‘pathologies of breakdowns of modernization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011392112456507">Eisenstadt, 1973</xref>: 51) or ‘bad’ nationalism as a source or form of conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392112456507">Calhoun, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, scholars of multiple, alternative, entangled or hybrid modernities have challenged the hegemony and distinctiveness of western modernity with reference to cultural differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392112456507">Dirlik, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011392112456507">Schmidt, 2004</xref>) without problematising the idea of modernity as progress, or its peaceful stance. In doing so they too present a ‘Dr Jekyll only’ social theory of modernities that celebrates social transformations shorn of their downsides.</p>
<p>There is, however, a ‘dark side’ inherent to the sociological understanding of modernities, and it is violence. Modernity’s triumphs and successes are rooted not simply in progress and enlightenment but also in violence, oppression and exclusion – in the archaic, the violent, the untransformed, the repressed aspects of social life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011392112456507">Hall, 1992a</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet conflict and violence are neglected topics of contemporary sociological research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011392112456507">Malesevic, 2010</xref>). Most major sociologists omit sociopolitical violence from their central problematic not accidentally but deliberately, because they believe that the future society will be pacific and transnational, and that industrial, capitalist or ‘modern’ societies will be unlike the preceding feudal, theocratic or militant societies, in that power can operate pacifically, without physical force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011392112456507">Mann, 1988</xref>). The few notable exceptions include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011392112456507">Bauman’s <italic>Modernity and the Holocaust</italic> (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011392112456507">Wimmer’s <italic>Nationalist Exclusion and Ethnic Conflict</italic> (2002)</xref>. Bauman posits that the Holocaust was not a failure of modernity, but its product. He uses Weber’s discussion of rationalisation to demonstrate that elements of modernity, namely the rationalisation process and rational bureaucracy, were key to the making of the Holocaust. Wimmer’s <italic>Nationalist Exclusion and Ethnic Conflict</italic> uses cases studies drawn from different geopolitical areas to argue that ethnic conflict is the basis for modernity itself. The conceptual marginalisation of sociopolitical violence from the sociological understanding of modernity leads Michael Mann (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011392112456507">1988</xref>: viii) to call social sciences ‘absurdly pacifistic’ in their interpretation of modern nation-states.</p>
<p>Situated within western modernity, ethnic studies has acquired a significant place as a distinct field of study with its own journals, book series and courses in the second half of the 20th century. Stemming from the analysis of US civil rights movements and UK post-imperial migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011392112456507">Mason, 1999</xref>), its concepts and theories are influenced by the social conditions in which the field was established, namely in western democratic societies, in contexts of relative internal peace, in response to migration and with the goal of promoting integration and social cohesion in western societies. The establishment of ethnic studies too was pervaded by the wish to promote peaceful ethnic relations and to strive for integration shorn of its downsides.</p>
<p>Within ethnic studies, ethnic violence is treated as a distinct phenomenon. Its analysis is marginal to the overall development of race and ethnic relation theories, and almost invisible in mainstream textbooks on the subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011392112456507">Back and Solomos, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011392112456507">Cornell and Hartmann, 2007</xref>). Ethnic violence is discussed in specialised texts like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011392112456507">Esman (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011392112456507">Bloxham and Moses (2010)</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011392112456507">Horowitz (2007)</xref>, or analysed within distinct fields of enquiry such as war studies, conflict studies or genocide studies, as if violent conflicts were the exception to the norm or an anomaly of modernity rather than one of its intrinsic features.</p>
<p>In the following section, I show that sociopolitical violence is an intrinsic component in the formation of interconnected modernities, and that ethnic violence is one manifestation of ethnic relations. Through the examination of the formation of Rwandan modernity, I detail how the existence of ‘partial connections’ influenced the relationship between the bright and dark sides of modernities. More specifically, choices made during peaceful times were decidedly influential in the escalation of violence and vice versa: the legacy of violence is highly influential in the way social relations unfold during peaceful times. This article brings together three distinct areas of sociological enquiry: modernities, ethnic relations and violence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0011392112456507">
<title>Interconnected modernities, ethnic relations and violence: The Rwandan case</title>
<p>To discuss the relationship between interconnected modernities, ethnic relations and violence, I examine in depth the case study of Rwanda, a previously little-known country in eastern Africa that entered our collective imagination through images of the genocide that took place in 1994. Similarly to other dramatic social events that mark our perception of history, like the Holocaust or ethnic violence in the former eastern bloc and more recently in the Middle East, representations of the Rwandan genocide act as a metaphor for the ‘banality of evil’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011392112456507">Arendt, 1963</xref>) and its worldwide manifestation through media, international influences and globalising forces. The roots of Rwandan ethnic violence can be traced to the history of ethnic relations in the Great Lakes region of Africa, where a distinct beginning characterised by the overlap of class and ethnicity, rather than by the analytical separation of these social categories in western modernity, marks the path towards the formation of Rwandan modernity.</p>
<p>Historic records document the coexistence of three distinct groups known as Hutu, Tutsi and Twa in the Great Lakes region of eastern Africa since the 14th century. They have diverse histories of migration, different ethnic identities and separate modes of production. The demographic minority Twa were the region’s autochthones, and their main modes of subsistence were hunting, gathering and pottery. The demographic majority Hutu were Bantu farmers who moved into the Great Lakes region, while the Tutsi were cattle herders who migrated south from northeast Africa in search of new pastures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011392112456507">Prunier, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Unlike in western modernity, in which the two are distinct, class and ethnicity overlap in the Rwandan context. Hutu, Tutsi and Twa were simultaneously both ethnic groups with distinct social identities and classes with different modes of production, and this specific class/ethnic formation was determinant in the formation of a distinctive Rwandan modernity, and in its history of peaceful and violent relations. Classical sociologists of western modernity privileged class as a unit of analysis over ethnicity, the latter gaining relevance as a separate sociological unit of analysis only in the second half of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011392112456507">Mason, 1999</xref>). The sociology of premodern and modern Rwandan social relations would need to start from the different position that class and ethnicity are intertwined aspects of the same unit of analysis, two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011392112456507">Prunier (1995)</xref> writes that by the 18th century, Hutu, Tutsi and Twa shared the Kinyarwanda language, animistic religion, cultural practices and a complex political system that resembled western feudal kingdoms, with the Tutsi holding the position of aristocrats and the Hutu that of serfs. This hierarchical political organisation was reached through violent clashes, as well as reformulations of class and ethnic relationships as complementary. The kingdom was a complex political system composed of many monarchies and micro-units within a highly organised system. Central to premodern social relations was a social contract called <italic>ubuhake</italic>, symbolised by the gift of a cow by a Tutsi patron to a Hutu client, and by the sharing of calves in exchange for services and farm produce. <italic>Ubuhake</italic> could lead to the de-Hutification of Hutu lineages and their Tutsification, resulting from the change in subsistence mode through the possession of calves. For the Tutsi this represented a contract of mutual help, while the Hutu described it as quasi-slavery.</p>
<sec id="section4-0011392112456507">
<title>The colonial encounter: Partial connections, choices and violence</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011392112456507">Hall (1992a)</xref> writes, the triumphs of modernity are rooted not only in progress and enlightenment but also in violence, oppression and exclusion. The arrival of colonial powers in eastern Africa towards the end of the 19th century was instrumental in altering ethnic, economic and political relations. Relations of unequal exchange with the excluded, conquered, colonised and exploited ‘Other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011392112456507">Hall, 1992a</xref>: 2) were established by the colonial powers. In the Rwandan context, these relations simultaneously transformed and consolidated existing hierarchical power relations. The colonial encounter was not only violent in itself, but it also contained the seeds of future violence.</p>
<p>A brief period of colonisation under the Germans that started in 1885 was brought to an end by violence in Europe and Germany’s loss of the First World War. Present-day Rwanda was formally placed under Belgian control by a mandate from the League of Nations in 1923. The process of colonial modernisation took place through the ‘selective’ transfer, imposition and withholding of features of western modernity and the simultaneous maintenance of selective precolonial relations.</p>
<p>Belgian colonisers devolved power and gave privileges to the Tutsi, whom they considered superior because of their physical resemblance to Europeans. At a time when western modernity placed value on scientific eugenic principles, these were selectively applied to the colonies to allocate power and privileges. However, through partial connections, the racial hierarchies of the modern eugenics movement coincided with existing feudal hierarchies and led to the consolidation of power in the hands of the ‘aristocratic’ Tutsi.</p>
<p>Belgian administrators transferred and imposed the modern Belgian administrative structure onto the Rwandan colony, and organised the colony in prefectures, communes, sectors and cellules. It was through this administrative organisation that subsequent violence – and most notably the Rwandan genocide that took place seven decades later – could be implemented so widely and efficiently. This administrative organisation was used to create catchment areas for targeted individuals, to bring together units of attackers, and to communicate orders from the centre to the periphery. Through the colonial encounter, ‘partial connections’ were established whereby a western model of administration coalesced with existing hierarchical power structures to plant the seeds for future violence. The relationship between the bright and dark sides of interconnected Rwandan modernity was influenced by the ways in which partial connections situate people, ideas and structures as interconnected but never totally symmetrical or fully integrated.</p>
<p>Another important way in which ‘partial connections’ were established through choices that influenced the dark and bright sides of Rwandan modernity was the introduction of identity cards, and most importantly the sanctioning of ethnicity in identity cards in 1933 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011392112456507">Longman, 2001</xref>). In the exercise of western colonial political modernity, selected components were transferred to the colonies, while others were withheld. The introduction of identity cards was not accompanied by other features of western modernity – namely the social conquests achieved in the European revolutions of the 19th century and the social protests of the twentieth, such as equality and the right to vote, which defined the relation of the citizen to the nation-state.</p>
<p>The sanctioning of ethnicity in identity cards altered ethnic/class relations in important ways that influenced future manifestations of violence. It transformed the overlap of ethnic and class membership into that of ethnic and colonial membership, which defined the administrative relationship of the (ethnic) colonial subject to the colonial administration. From being permeable ethnic identification became fixed and unchangeable. A person born Hutu, Tutsi or Twa could not change their ethnic identity during their lifetime: they were officially bound to die Hutu, Tutsi or Twa. Ethnicised identity cards were used to determine subsequent belonging to the nation-state, to allocate scarce resources, and during the climax of violence in the 1990s to separate enemies from allies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0011392112456507">
<title>The birth of the nation-state, interconnected modernities and violence</title>
<p>The official birth of Rwanda as an independent state that marked the country’s official membership of the modern system of nation-states took place in 1962, and was part of the globalising aspiration towards a universal system of self-governing states. The formation of Rwandan political modernity was marked by violence, the ‘dark side’ of modernity. This transition from colony to modern nation-state was simultaneously a social revolution, a war of liberation and class struggle – the interplay of three different yet closely related types of violence. It was through the appropriation of selective components of African and European modernities, such as national and continental identities, democratic principles and class consciousness, that ‘partial connections’ among interconnected modernities were created.</p>
<p>In the wake of Rwanda’s independence, a social revolution took place in the name of western democratic principles and the right to representative rule of the Hutu majority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011392112456507">Prunier, 1995</xref>). The subsequent war of liberation, which led to independence from foreign powers (and their local Tutsi allies), was not an isolated event, but rather a continental phenomenon achieved through international flows of ideas. Regionally, the Pan-African Freedom Movement of East and Central Africa was created to support anti-colonial movements; and the birth of independent African states was accompanied by the call of African leaders, most notably Nkrumah, to develop transnational African identities and alliances in order to facilitate the continent’s modernisation and transition towards (western) modernity. Finally, the class struggle of the Hutu proletariat against the Tutsi aristocracy locally echoed global ideological tensions between western formations of capitalist modernity and formations of the first ‘alternative modernity of the Soviet communist type’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011392112456507">Arnason, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Hutu leaders came to power in the name of the majority underclass Hutu population, who became the ‘nation’ in the new ‘nation-state’ equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011392112456507">Turton, 2002</xref>). Soon after independence, Hutu leaders of the First Republic selectively retained features of the colonial period, including the Belgian administrative structure and the sanctioning of ethnic identification in identity cards. Ethnic identification in post-independence Rwanda was used to grant access to valuable resources like education and employment in the civil service to the majority proletarian Hutu population through a quota system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011392112456507">Uvin, 1997</xref>). Quotas were implemented in Rwanda more or less at the same time as positive discrimination through quota systems was being used in the USA to promote inclusion and social mobility for the disenfranchised African American population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011392112456507">Shaw et al., 1987</xref>). While in the USA race and ethnic relations were framed within civil rights discourses and positive discrimination policies for the democratically underrepresented, in Rwanda modern ethnic relations took a remarkably different trajectory, because it was the majority ethnic group in power that promoted positive discrimination in favour of its own members on the basis of past discrimination.</p>
<p>Regional intra-ethnic power struggles between the Hutus of the south, who were in power, and those of the north led to a military coup in 1973 that marked the beginning of the Second Republic, when Hutus from the north gained power. They too choose to selectively retain key features of colonial modernity, namely ethnic identification and administrative structures. However, these connections were partial in that the core principles of western political modernity, such as democratic elections or membership of political parties, were only introduced in the early 1990s. The choices made by the Hutu leaders of the Second Republic were influenced by previous social (violent) transformations, and they in turn influenced the subsequent escalation of violence.</p>
<p>The rise to power of Hutu leaders in the aftermath of independence and in the transition from the First to the Second Republic led to the mass exodus of the Tutsi, which gave rise to a global diasporic community. The refugee diaspora, itself a product of violence, engaged in regional, continental and transcontinental relations during the second half of the 20th century. Those who fled as young refugees across national borders experienced social transformations and modernisation in other countries, from which they selectively appropriated, neglected or transformed different features. Most notably, the Rwandan Tutsi refugees in Uganda aligned themselves with the rebel forces of Museveni, who subsequently became the president of Uganda. In doing so they succeeded in strengthening their military skills, and they created the Rwandan Patriotic Army, which together with the formation of a political movement and economic support by the diaspora became a strong transnational movement. The return to Rwanda of the diasporic Tutsi was again marked by violence in the early 1990s. These former refugees have since become influential players in contemporary Rwandan politics, economics and culture, where they embody ‘partial connections’ among people, ideas and representations that are interconnected but never totally symmetrical or fully integrated.</p>
<p>This section has offered a historical argument for considering the centrality of violence as a key element of the dark side of the formation of interconnected modernities. In the next section I present a contextual argument to highlight the connections between peace and violence, and in doing so I problematise the exceptionalism of genocidal violence.</p>

<title>Contextualising genocidal violence</title>
<p>Recent Rwandan history has been characterised by extreme genocidal violence, during which almost 1 million Tutsi and moderate Hutus were killed by Hutu extremists between April and July 1994. The planning and implementation of the Rwandan genocide was made possible by the existence of features of interconnected local, regional and western modernities. These included the existence of an organised national administrative structure, the legacy of the colonial encounter, which was utilised to make up lists of targets and to set up roadblocks; the sanctioning of ethnicity in identity cards, which was used to identify and separate the targets from the rest of the population; the practice of community work dating back to feudal times when each household was asked to participate in communal works, which was used to set up killing patrols; and the modern practice common in post-independence African countries of establishing youth wings of political parties, which led to their being used as killing mobs. Mobilisation took place through the use of modern communication systems: radio programmes made references to hybrid premodern and modern myths in order to incite the population to defend themselves against Tutsi invaders from outside the nation-state and their internal accomplices, to avoid the return to exploitative feudal and colonial relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011392112456507">African Rights, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011392112456507">Des Forges, 1999</xref>). Both pre-colonial legacies and colonial policies contributed to the creation of the Rwandan nation-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011392112456507">Hintjens, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011392112456507">Mamdani, 2001</xref>). Features of interconnected modernities were used to promote peace and modern governance as well as political conflict.</p>
<p>There is a close connection between peace and conflict, and the transition from one state to the other is never clear-cut or fixed. Consequently, definitions such as that of genocide<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0011392112456507">1</xref></sup> can be simultaneously useful descriptions and partial representations of violence. Through the use of statistical information on the demographics of the Rwandan population, the dead and survivors of genocidal violence, I intend to show that the representation of Rwanda’s recent history with almost exclusive reference to the 1994 genocide is limited, because the Rwandan genocide alone cannot account for the number of losses that took place in 1994.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011392112456507">Table 1</xref> shows that over 65% of the Tutsi residing in Rwanda in 1994 were killed, making this tragedy a genocide in intent and outcome. However, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011392112456507">Table 1</xref> also indicates that genocide alone does not account for the loss during the genocide of over 40% of Rwandans, who were members of the Hutu and Twa groups. Rwandan deaths are best understood in the context of at least four kinds of violence: genocide, war, civil conflict and the intra-ethnic power struggles that preceded, coincided with and followed the genocide. The genocide that took place between April and July 1994 was embedded in a war between the Rwandan Armed Forces – the national army – and the Rwandan Patriotic Army, which was composed of Tutsi exiles who had invaded the country from Uganda in October 1990. Following the end of the genocide and formal peace in the country, violence continued in eastern Congo, where the national army of the new government engaged in a war against the <italic>interahamwe</italic>, the militias involved in the genocide who had fled into the neighbouring country.</p>

<p>In the years preceding the genocide, civil violence escalated inside the country among the supporters of a Hutu Republic and those who were against it, which included Tutsi, ‘moderate’ Hutus and Twa who belonged to parties opposed to President Habyarimana’s National Revolutionary Movement for Development (MRND). Intra-ethnic regional rivalries also took place among the Hutus from the south and those from the north, with distinct loyalties that were a legacy of the past. These forms of violence represent the dark side of Rwandan modernity, and they were made possible by the existence of partial connections among interconnected national, regional, continental and global modernities. These forms of violence did not occur in isolation, but were embedded in social life and social transformations such as the consolidation of the Tutsi refugee diaspora, democratisation processes and the emergence of multi-partism, the influence of global economic forces and development aid, and bureaucratic and political processes.</p>
<p>Another partial connection among interconnected modernities is visible in the process of Rwandan democratisation, which under international pressure led to the establishment of multi-partism in the early 1990s, when core elements of western political modernity – notably democracy and multi-partism – were incorporated into Rwandan political modernity. After Rwandan independence, involuntary migrations of the Tutsi population, most notably in 1959 and 1973, led to the formation of a transnational network composed of almost 1 million Rwandans, who in the early 1980s formed an association called the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) with members across the globe. Within western modernity, academic interest in transnationalism as a subject of sociological enquiry emerged in the 1990s in the context of migration to Europe and North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0011392112456507">Vertovec, 1999</xref>). The RPA is an example of transnationalism emerging in the context of African modernities with its core in Uganda and with regional, continental and trans-African links. The RPA invasion of northern Rwanda in October 1990 was followed by retaliations against the RPA and their accomplices, who were identified in the Tutsi residing within the country and with opponents of the extremist ideology. The term ‘moderate Hutu’ is currently being used to refer to individuals opposed to extremist politics, including members of opposition parties, who were among the first to be targeted. The best-known example is the assassination on the first day of the genocide of Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, a Hutu member of the opposition Republican and Democratic Movement (MDR) party.</p>
<p>The economic and developmental context in which violence erupted also reveals the existence of partial connections among interconnected modernities. In the early 1990s the World Bank exercised pressure on the Rwandan government to implement structural adjustment programmes which, combined with the collapse of tea and coffee prices on the world markets, exacerbated the volatile political situation in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011392112456507">Uvin, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, emphasising rationality as a core property of modernity, political regimes that portray themselves as agents of modernity attempt to control change through bureaucratic planning, a phenomenon that Woolf (1991, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011392112456507">Taylor, 1999</xref>) refers to as the ‘administrative project for modernity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011392112456507">Taylor, 1999</xref>: 13), and which can slide quite rapidly from the ‘renewal’ to the ‘disintegration’ side of modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011392112456507">Taylor, 1999</xref>: 17). In the Rwandan context this took the form of extreme genocidal violence.</p>
<p>This section has highlighted the connections that exist between peace and violence contextually, through an analysis of demographic data that explains the Rwandan genocide as violence embedded in social transformations. In the following section, I introduce the category Invisible Majority to explain situationally how permeable the physical and social boundaries between peaceful and violent relations are. In doing so, I also problematise the focus on victims and aggressors that prevails in analyses of ethnic violence.</p>

<title>A situational analysis of permeable boundaries</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011392112456507">Mann (2009)</xref> defines ethnic conflict as a type of violence waged in the name of ethnicity as the mobilising force through which a group lays claim to its own nation-state over all or part of a shared territory. In the Rwandan context, ethnic relations and loyalties were manipulated to generate state-sponsored violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392112456507">Fujii, 2009</xref>) in the context of internal and external conflicts. Ethnicity alone does not explain violence, and it needs to be understood in terms of the construction of the real and imagined enemy. Scholars of the Rwandan genocide and of ethnic conflict more generally tend to examine violence with reference to two antagonistic groups, victims (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011392112456507">Hatzfeld, 2007</xref>) and perpetrators (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011392112456507">Straus, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011392112456507">Waller, 2002</xref>), and to describe their antagonistic relations. In light of the ubiquitous use of communal violence in Rwanda, there is a widespread perception that the majority of the Rwandan population was involved in violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011392112456507">Mamdani, 2001</xref>), either as victims fleeing violence or perpetrators and their supporters. However, a statistical compilation of the number of victims and perpetrators shows that analyses of ethnic conflict that focus on victims and perpetrators omit an important social actor. I call this social actor the Invisible Majority.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0011392112456507">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0011392112456507">Table 2</xref> shows, out of a population of 7 million Rwandans, it is estimated that approximately 1 million individuals were killed during the genocide. This leaves 6 million people unaccounted for as victims; were they all perpetrators or accomplices? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011392112456507">Straus (2004)</xref> calculated that a small number of individuals, ranging between 170,000 and 210,000, committed most of the killings, an estimate that is congruent with approximately 200,000 individuals imprisoned on genocide charges.</p>

<p>A broader definition of involvement in the genocide that included stealing and inciting violence was used during <italic>gacaca</italic>, a controversial hybrid transitional justice process which combined traditional peacemaking mechanisms with western law, and which was adopted in post-genocide Rwanda to adjudicate on the perpetrators and their accomplices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011392112456507">Musoni, 2009</xref>). During <italic>gacaca</italic>, which started in 2002 and began to wind down in 2009, grassroots courts judged approximately 1.5 million citizens (not all of them were found guilty). Using this broader definition of genocide involvement, it follows that at least 4.5 million people were neither victims, perpetrators nor accomplices of genocide, while this number rises to almost 6 million if we adopt the stricter approach described earlier. These constitute the Invisible Majority, whose social identities challenge bureaucratic constructions of ethnicity, the imposition of discrete identities, and the separation of violent and peaceful ethnic relations.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011392112456507">Denis and Kalekin-Fishman (2009)</xref> suggest that in a world of increased difference, there is a need to move beyond the intersectionality of major categories like ethnicity, class or gender to consider the intersectionality of minor categories. The Invisible Majority of the Rwandan genocide contains multiple and overlapping identities of the ‘Other’ who is neither the targeted Tutsi victim nor the Hutu perpetrator. The Invisible Majority comprises the intersectionality of minor categories, like those composed of ‘moderate’ Rwandans opposed to extremist ethnic politics, of northerners and southerners, the Rwandan diaspora, foreign residents and international aid workers. The minority Twa group is the Other who is the outsider in the narrative of the genocide and is therefore subsumed among the Invisible Majority, as are families of mixed ethnic backgrounds.</p>
<p>Representations of ethnic violence depict a landscape of widespread brutality that maps a whole national territory as a violent space, in which peaceful contexts are either rendered invisible or represented through images of ‘safe areas’ or ‘safe havens’ that construct them as exceptional spaces, discrete locations or outside areas to the national territory of violence.</p>
<p>But there are spatial continuities and contiguities between peaceful and violent landscapes. In the Rwandan context, spatial contiguity was present between roadblocks, killing fields and private spaces of violence on the one hand, and on the other hand sanctuaries for the persecuted, where social identities transcended oppositional ethnic categorisations, peaceful interactions prevailed over violent ones, and the social agency of the Invisible Majority thrived. The film <italic>Hotel Rwanda</italic> brought to the attention of international audiences the existence of spontaneous places of sanctuary, which could be found across Rwanda in churches like Saint Famille, in factories like that in Mugusura Commune, or in orphanages like the Gisimba centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011392112456507">African Rights, 1994</xref>). Homes, offices, neighbourhoods, fields and empty spaces became spaces of safety for many Rwandans in search of protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011392112456507">Des Forges, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In these non-violent spaces, peaceful relations prevailed among the Invisible Majority: protectors, helpers, authorities, traders and informers, who interacted with both victims and attackers. These actions were not single acts of extraordinary courage undertaken by isolated heroic individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011392112456507">Rosoux, 2008</xref>), but multiple gestures of solidarity carried out by ordinary Rwandans during the genocide. Through negotiations, argumentations, exchanges and mediation, intense social bridging took place during the Rwandan genocide, and its value increased because it made the difference between survival and death.</p>
<p>Durkheim used the terms ‘mechanical’ and ‘organic’ solidarity to differentiate between social relations in traditional and modern societies. In the trajectory of Rwandan modernity, the intersubjectivities of the Invisible Majority were played out through <italic>hybrid</italic> solidarity, in which selective features of Rwandan traditions like <italic>abanyawani</italic> – brotherly pacts of mutual help – coexisted with modern economic exchanges like paying for safety, Christian charitable principles of assistance for those in need, and African values of communal support. Interconnected modernising processes explain violent and peaceful relations better than discrete ahistorical accounts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0011392112456507">
<title>The legacy of violence</title>
<p>While choices made during peace have an impact on violence, the following section highlights how the legacy of violence permeates social relations during peace. The inauguration of the Government of National Unity in July 1994 marked the beginning of a new phase for Rwandan modernity, which is characterised by partial connections among elements of Rwanda’s premodern and modern past as well as modernising regional and global influences.</p>
<p>Through choices, past traditions have been rediscovered, reinvented and transformed to fit current realities while elements acquired through diasporic experiences and interactions with interconnected modernities have been incorporated into Rwandan political modernity to generate hybrid initiatives. <italic>Gacaca</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011392112456507">Musoni, 2009</xref>) is the controversial outcome of partial connections among local premodern practices and western modernity. <italic>Gacaca</italic> is a hybrid process of customary mediation and modern justice whereby community courts composed of ‘wise men’ are called to judge individuals charged with genocide involvement. Similarly, the government-sponsored reconciliation initiatives are reliant on the Christian concept of forgiveness, according to which perpetrators ask survivors for forgiveness and survivors are encouraged to bestow it, a gesture that may be ritualised through the traditional custom of sharing sorghum beer.</p>
<p>Ethnicity too has been affected by the transformations that took place within Rwandan political modernity and its engagement with connected multiple modernities. Among the most significant choices made by the Government of National Unity were the removal of ethnicity from identity cards and the introduction of the Law against Divisionism (2001), which banned any reference to ethnic terminology. In contemporary Rwanda, it is illegal to mention – and consequently to research – any aspect of ethnicity. Thus, unlike the visibility given to the analysis of ethnic relations in western modernity, ethnic studies is an outlawed field of sociological enquiry in Rwandan modernity.</p>
<p>This is because the centrality of ethnic citizenship to the political project of the post-independence Rwandan government transformed it into a modern tool of control that was instrumental in the unfolding of the genocide. The legacy of violence shapes post-conflict social relations in interconnected ways. The new Government of National Unity promotes the narrative of a pre-colonial ethnic harmony that was altered by the colonial encounter and manipulated by the post-independence government, climaxing in genocidal violence. On the grounds that politically charged ethnic affiliations can be instrumental in the enactment of past violence and may constitute a threat of violence in the future, ethnic citizenship has been replaced by national citizenship under the slogan ‘We are all Rwandans’.</p>
<p>However, while western modalities of national identification have replaced ethnic citizenship, their locally distinct consequences mark the idiosyncratic trajectory of Rwandan political modernity, in which ethnic self-identification, which is openly discussed in neighbouring African countries and the subject of debates in the west, has become an unspeakable designation in the government’s exercise of control over its citizens.</p>
<p>Yet indirect references to ethnicity continue in a country where the centrality of the genocide is visible in many spheres of social life, such as identity politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011392112456507">Hintjens, 2008</xref>), memorialisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011392112456507">Doná, 2010</xref>) and transitional justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011392112456507">Musoni, 2009</xref>). The creation of new categories, most notably those of <italic>rescapé</italic> (genocide survivor) and <italic>génocidaire</italic> (genocide perpetrator), which do not make explicit reference to ethnicity and yet are charged with ethnic connotations, show that the trajectory of contemporary peaceful Rwandan modernity is reliant on the memory of its recent violent past, a phenomenon that demonstrates the link between the bright and dark sides of modernities. Pre-genocide hate propaganda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011392112456507">Schabas, 2000</xref>) relied on polarised discourses of ‘Us’ – Hutu victims – and ‘Them’ – the Tutsi enemy and their collaborators – and there is a danger that the contrasting images of <italic>génocidaire</italic>s and <italic>rescapés</italic> may replace previous categories and divide the country into the guilty and the innocent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011392112456507">Eltringham, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011392112456507">Zorbas, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The replacement of ethnic labels with new social categories that are reliant on past genocidal violence shows how the ‘dark’ side of interconnected Rwandan modernity continues to permeate peaceful Rwandan society. In the specific trajectory taken by Rwandan modernity, the legacy of violence is not an event of the past, but something that pervades political decisions and social relations in the present.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Both sociology and ethnic studies are the product of western modernity, which with its pacifist stance marginalises sociopolitical violence or construes it as an exceptional phenomenon of contemporary social life. In this article I have argued that violence is a key element, the ‘dark’ side in the formations of modernity/ies: not only are major social transformations characterised by violence, but peace and violence are historically, contextually and situationally related. Historically, choices made during peaceful times have proven to be central in subsequent escalations of violence, while the legacy of violence permeates social relations after the end of conflict. The temporal, spatial and social continuities that exist between peace and violence testify to the links between the bright and dark sides of interconnected modernities. Violence, even extreme forms of violence, is not an exceptional or abnormal phenomenon.</p>
<p>Discussions of modernity continue to be somewhat dominated by the tension between singularity and multiplicity, which has taken for granted or downplayed the existence of connections. The theoretical framework of interconnected modernities was used to emphasise the existence of ‘partial connections’ in the conceptualisation of modernity in both the singular and the plural.</p>
<p>Although I have demonstrated these connections through the examination of the formation of Rwandan modernity and its recent history of genocidal violence, the main argument of this article – that peace and violence are two sides of the same coin – is generalisable to other contexts of violence, such as the Holocaust or ethnic violence in the former Yugoslavia, the eastern bloc and more recently the Middle East. Bauman showed that presenting the Holocaust as unique Jewish history or as an extreme event belittled its significance: the Holocaust was the ‘hidden’ face of modernity. Similarly, referring to the Rwandan genocide as one of the aberrations of modern social life in the second half of the 20th century, or as a tribal affair, misrepresents not only its modernity in the present, but also its connections with formations of modernity/ies over time.</p>
<p>Neglecting, isolating or exceptionalising the ‘dark’ side of modernity/ies misrepresents modern social life and its analysis in sociology and ethnic studies. It is for this reason that this article concludes with a call to mainstream violence in sociology and ethnic studies as a key element of the ‘dark side’ of interconnected modernities.</p>

<p>The United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (1951) defines genocide ‘as acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group’. The Convention, which was established to describe the Holocaust of the Jews in Europe, is a product of western modernity and it sanctions its dark side. It was adopted in Rwanda in 1994.</p>

<p>The term Invisible Majority is adapted from Nixon’s phrase ‘the Silent Majority’, which he used to distinguish the vocal protesters against the US involvement in the Vietnam War from the majority of Americans, who did not protest.</p>
