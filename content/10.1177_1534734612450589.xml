<abstract>
<p>Extremity injury and contamination as consequence are features of high-energy wounding. A leading cause of disability and the commonest cause of late complications, prevention of wound infection determines the ultimate outcome in these populations. Multiple variables influence the development of infection, one of which is the dressing used on the wound. Antiseptic-soaked gauze dressings feature in the early management of limb trauma despite a lack of evidence to support this. Iodine and chlorhexidine are ubiquitous in other aspects of health care however, and a plethora of studies detail their role in skin antisepsis, the recommendations from which are often anecdotally applied to acute wounding. To contextualize the role for antiseptic dressing use in acute, significant limb injury this review explores the evidence for the use of chlorhexidine and iodine in skin antisepsis. The paucity of experimental data available for antiseptic use in early wound management and the need for further research to address this evidence void is highlighted.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Wound infection may occur following extremity trauma, either through contamination at the time of injury or nosocomial transmission, and is the commonest cause for late complications in limb wounding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612450589">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734612450589">2</xref></sup> The management of such patients is a multifactorial process. Antibiotics and antiseptics play an important role, as does the “patient as host”: the physiological and immunological response to initial injury and subsequent reconstruction will have an impact on recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612450589">3</xref></sup> One of the variables contributing to this process is the manner in which the wound is covered, offering an opportunity to manipulate the bacterial burden of injury. There are many agents available with which to augment dressings across the range of differing wound care requirements. A significant proportion of such preparations are used in chronic wound care with tissue viability compromised through systemic disease. These dressings are out of the scope of this review, which is focused for clarity on the 2 most common antiseptic agents used in early wound care and skin preparation following acute extremity injury.</p>
<p>Although gauze soaked in iodine is commonly applied to wounds,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612450589">4</xref></sup> there is no consensus on the type of dressing that should be used, nor is the use of antimicrobial adjuncts established. The most recent guidelines issued jointly by the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons and the British Orthopaedic Association<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612450589">5</xref></sup> do not stipulate how wounds associated with open fractures should be dressed. The American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma recommends the application of a sterile dressing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612450589">6</xref></sup> whereas the United States Department of Defence guidelines suggest placement of a nonconstricting, nonocclusive dry dressing over wounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612450589">7</xref></sup> Representing the experience of war surgery and wounds sustained by refugees from conflict, Husum et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734612450589">8</xref></sup> detail the loose packing of soft, clean, and fine meshed gauze, a practice similarly recommended by the International Committee of the Red Cross.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734612450589">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734612450589">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although there appears to be consensus for the use of nonocclusive, loosely applied sterile gauze secured with absorbent bandages, evidence for augmentation with antiseptic preparations is absent. The use of such agents is however, common practice, seen as a natural extension of the overall antiseptic philosophy. Although a range of antimicrobial dressings are available, the use of iodine or chlorhexidine-soaked gauze is commonplace in early wound coverage. Similarly, these agents are in widespread use for skin preparation of the injured extremity perioperatively and hence are the focus of this review.</p>
<p>Before determining the role of antiseptic dressings, the nature of iodine and chlorhexidine solutions, potential limitations, and misconceptions associated with their use must be appreciated.</p>
<p>Ubiquitous in other aspects of health care, evidence exists for their use in many domains, and <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental data are available for antimicrobial efficacy assessments. To assess the optimal augmentation of wound dressings and to inform future <italic>in vivo</italic> and clinical study designs, key studies relating to the use of iodine and chlorhexidine have been reviewed. To perform this review, we carried out an electronic search of the MEDLINE database using the PubMed search engine limited to manuscripts published in English until August 2011. The medical subject headings of wounds and injuries, iodine, and chlorhexidine were entered, and Boolean operators were used to construct a search strategy. Although the nature of the studies reviewed preclude systematic review or meta-analysis, the fate of retrieved abstracts is presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734612450589">Figure 1</xref>). Retrieved abstracts were analyzed for relevance and full text articles obtained. Articles initially missed in this search were obtained from manual searching of the bibliography of retrieved studies.</p>

<title>Iodine</title>
<p>The toxicity associated with early iodine solutions has been negated by combination with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) forming the iodophor compound povidone iodine (PVP-I).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734612450589">11</xref></sup> Skin irritation may be seen with its use; however, true allergy is rare, with only 2 cases seen in 5000 applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734612450589">12</xref></sup> PVP-I is water soluble and stable, enabling slow release of free iodine in solution as Betadine or Videne.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534734612450589">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534734612450589">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>As the concentration of iodine in solution increases, the noncomplex bound iodine levels decrease. This produces the counterintuitive situation where concentrated aqueous PVP-I solutions destroy bacteria more slowly than their dilutions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534734612450589">15</xref></sup> <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments studying antimicrobial activity of iodine solutions and their dilutions against multiple organisms demonstrate that low concentrations are more rapidly bactericidal, and a 1:100 dilution of 10% PVP-I solution kills bacteria at least as quickly as solutions of higher concentration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534734612450589">16</xref></sup> The most widely used preparations are a 10% solution of PVP-I generating up to 1% available iodine.</p>
<p>Iodine is bactericidal, fungicidal and sporicidal and also has activity against viruses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734612450589">11</xref></sup> Its exact antimicrobial action is unknown, although it is thought to attack intracellular proteins, nucleotides, and fatty acids, culminating in cell death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534734612450589">17</xref></sup> Renewed interest in the use of iodine in wound care has arisen because of antibiotic resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534734612450589">18</xref></sup>: PVP-I has been shown to have bactericidal effects exceeding that of other antiseptic agents against methicillin-sensitive <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MSSA),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534734612450589">19</xref></sup> methicillin-resistant <italic>S aureus</italic> (MRSA),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534734612450589">20</xref></sup> and also vancomycin-resistant <italic>Enterococcus</italic> (VRE) in <italic>in vitro</italic> testing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534734612450589">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite its ubiquitous use, only 27 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated iodine’s efficacy against either control substances or other antiseptic solutions over the past 35 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534734612450589">22</xref></sup> Many of the studies that are available pre-date the rigorous reporting criteria of modern health care and a number are industry funded. Whereas the evidence base for one of the most widespread prophylactic measures in health care is thus limited, in contrast, there is much anecdote regarding its use, including the effect of contact with organic matter, toxicity, and habituation by resistant organisms. As a consequence, there is a wealth of often erroneous dogma regarding acute extremity wound care, which has arisen partly as a result of miscitation and misinterpretation of preclinical antiseptic studies. Combined with an absence of level-1 evidence regarding antiseptic use in acute extremity trauma, to efficiently compare antiseptics as the basis for research, the experimental evidence, both clinical and preclinical, for iodine in particular must be appreciated.</p>
<sec id="section3-1534734612450589">
<title>Interaction With Organic Matter and Impact on Antiseptic Efficacy</title>
<p>One of a number of misconceptions regarding the use of iodine in wound care is the flawed concept that it is inactivated on contact with injured tissue, originating from a small number of studies with significant methodological limitations. Khan and Naqvi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534734612450589">23</xref></sup> reviewing the use of iodine as an antiseptic state that:
<disp-quote><p><italic>iodine solutions are deactivated in the presence of organic material, pus, slough and necrotic tissue in the wound.</italic><sup>(p8)</sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Articles cited by Khan and Naqvi to substantiate this “deactivation” include the evaluation of a PVP-I medicated dressing by Lawrence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534734612450589">24</xref></sup> This <italic>in vitro</italic> exudating wound model involved the passage of horse serum across test dressings. Iodine was thus not inactivated but <italic>washed out</italic> of the dressing by a passage of serum at a rate that the author acknowledges as extreme, being twice that seen in heavily exudating burns. Another study used to corroborate the inactivation claim of Kahn and Naqvi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534734612450589">23</xref></sup> is that of Morgan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534734612450589">25</xref></sup> Although the author does comment that PVP-I activity is reduced by contact with pus and serous fluid, what is not detailed by Khan and Naqvi is that Morgan also makes the same observation for both hydrogen peroxide and chlorhexidine.</p>
<p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> porcine model of Mertz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534734612450589">26</xref></sup> is similarly inaccurately cited, demonstrating increasing PVP-I activity, not decreasing activity as may be expected with deactivation by wound contact.</p>
<p>Studies other than Khan and Naqvi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534734612450589">23</xref></sup> that claim to support the inactivation theory have similar problems with accuracy and interpretation. Chaiyakunapruk et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534734612450589">27</xref></sup> state that:
<disp-quote><p><italic>blood, serum, and other protein-rich biomaterials can deactivate the microbicidal effect of povidone-iodine.</italic><sup>(p799)</sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Studies used to support this statement do not do so. Zamora et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534734612450589">28</xref></sup> report that far from completely deactivating PVP-I in the presence of both fat and pus, even at dilutions of PVP-I a tenth the concentration of commonly used preparations, no growth of organisms occurred.</p>
<p>The presence of blood did have an impact, although even at a dilution by blood half that of standard concentrations only 2 of the 8 organisms in the test panel remained viable. What can be inferred from this work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534734612450589">28</xref></sup> cited by Chaiyakunapruk et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534734612450589">27</xref></sup> is that PVP-I solutions are susceptible to dilution, although this must be put in perspective. Dilution for fat and pus would require more than 9 parts fat or pus per 1 part PVP-I before there is an impact on antimicrobial activity. For blood, dilution greater than 1 part blood to 1 part iodine is required before an impact is seen.</p>
<p>This interpretation of these experimental findings is corroborated by the second reference used to support the contrary theory of Chaiyakunapruk et al. Gottardi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534734612450589">29</xref></sup> remarks:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>in practice, no substantial decrease in the bactericidal efficacy of 10% povidone-iodine preparations is likely with body fluids having a composition similar to plasma. . . . However, contamination by 25% or more whole blood should be avoided.</italic><sup>(p173)</sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The extent of dilution required to make this impact significant is considerable. In addition, although blood demonstrates the greatest potential to have an impact on PVP-I, a surgical field with such extensive dilution by blood is one in which the outcome is threatened either directly or indirectly more by hemorrhage than by any concern over antiseptic action.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1534734612450589">
<title>Interaction With Tissues and Concern Over Cytotoxicity</title>
<p>A second aspect of anecdotal concern is local tissue damage. An early attempt to refute this, Gilmore et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534734612450589">30</xref></sup> report parallel <italic>in vivo</italic> and clinical studies investigating the effect of PVP-I on wound healing. Using macroscopic, histological, and mechanical assessments of randomized rat abdominal wall tissue subjected to application of PVP-I spray in a recovery model, the authors found no difference in tissue damage between tests and controls without iodine spray. The clinical study demonstrated a reduced infection rate in wounds sprayed with iodine compared with untreated controls. This study suffers from weak methodology, however, with subjective outcome measurements threatening the validity of its findings.</p>
<p>Subsequent experimentation yielded conflicting results. <italic>In vivo</italic> research by Bennett et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534734612450589">31</xref></sup> of 5 antiseptic solutions in a porcine wound model demonstrated negligible cytotoxicity of iodine and paradoxically an association with increased angiogenesis and fibroblast proliferation. <italic>In vitro</italic>, however, Lineaweaver et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534734612450589">32</xref></sup> applied antiseptics to cultured fibroblasts and found, in direct contrast, cytotoxicity with all test solutions. It is interesting to note that whereas significant toxicity is found with stock solutions, dilution of PVP-I in a 1:1000 ratio enabled retention of antimicrobial properties without causing fibroblast toxicity. Although the authors recommend that PVP-I is unsuitable for use in wound care, this protective effect of dilution with retention of antimicrobial effect is consistent with that shown by Zamora et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534734612450589">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Muller and Kramer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534734612450589">33</xref></sup> use an <italic>in vitro</italic> assessment of murine fibroblast viability to compare a range of antiseptic preparations in which PVP-I is associated with a level of cytotoxicity that is 20 times lower than that in other preparations and rebound revitalization of fibroblasts 24 hours from inoculation, which did not occur with the other agents. This concept of balancing fibroblast toxicity against antimicrobial activity is conceptualized in a biocompatibility index by the same investigators,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534734612450589">34</xref></sup> of which PVP-I solutions occupy the middle ground. A similar study is reported by Wilson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534734612450589">35</xref></sup> detailing an <italic>in vitro</italic> cellular assessment of antiseptic toxicity.</p>
<p>The authors claim significant toxicity of iodine, although this happens when it is used neat, and looking at the raw data, it can be seen that when diluted, toxicity is negated. This corroborates the recommendations of Lineaweaver et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534734612450589">32</xref></sup> in demonstrating retained antimicrobial efficacy at this dilution without toxicity.</p>
<p>The most comprehensive overview of studies addressing the question “Does PVP-I retard wound healing?” is that of Goldenheim.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534734612450589">36</xref></sup> Criticism of the literature regarding potential cytotoxicity of iodine and impact on wound healing includes the heterogeneity of study design and also the use of iodine preparations of varying consistency and concentration used and compared interchangeably. Errors in the interpretation and extrapolation of animal studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534734612450589">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534734612450589"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534734612450589">39</xref></sup> leading to misconceptions regarding the effect of iodine on wounds are also detailed.</p>
<p>PVP-I is shown across studies to retain antimicrobial efficacy when diluted to a level at which tissue damage attributable to iodine does not feature. Misinterpretation is seen when <italic>in vivo</italic> experimentation using all forms of iodine, often at concentrations not used in clinical practice, are coalesced with <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of questionable clinical relevance and extrapolated to modern wound care. What is key to the efficacy of PVP-I solution is its capacity, previously highlighted,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534734612450589">28</xref></sup> of not only retaining its antimicrobial efficacy but of increasing its range of action against organisms despite dilution to a level that negates its cytotoxicity. Dilution is hence the key feature of iodine use, to the extent that it has been shown to promote activity against multiple organisms with decreased bacterial killing times seen across multiple dilutions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534734612450589">16</xref></sup> Goldenheim<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534734612450589">36</xref></sup> concludes that there is evidence for beneficial properties of PVP-I and that these solutions do not have a deleterious effect on wound healing.</p>

<sec id="section5-1534734612450589">
<title>Use in Periarticular Trauma and Concern Over Chondrotoxicity</title>
<p>Concern also exists regarding the effect of iodine when applied to articular cartilage, with dogma holding that iodine should not be applied to open joint injuries because of potential negative effects on chondrocytes. The literature is again heterogeneous in design and quality, with evidence provided to both support and refute concerns over its use in periarticular trauma.</p>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> studies of chick embryos suggest significant, concentration-related effects of iodine on osteoblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534734612450589">40</xref></sup> Similarly, murine intra-articular PVP-I injection shows a cytotoxic effect on synovium and articular cartilage,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534734612450589">41</xref></sup> and in addition, results are presented by Faddis et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534734612450589">42</xref></sup> in a recovery rabbit study of knee injections in which gross histological and biochemical insult to joint tissues is seen at autopsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534734612450589">42</xref></sup> Of note, in animals injected with dilute iodine solutions, toxicity was diminished and biochemical alteration of the articular tissue minimal.</p>
<p>These studies have limited clinical relevance because of marked disparity between closed, repeated injection into uninjured, uncontaminated native tissue and short-duration dressing application in a contaminated, structurally compromised joint.</p>
<p>Bulstra et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534734612450589">43</xref></sup> investigated the impact of PVP-I on <italic>ex vivo</italic> intact murine patellar articular cartilage placed in full strength (10%) PVP-I for an hour, resulting in articular cartilage softening and inhibition of chondrocyte metabolism. Although the methodology is appropriate to antiseptic solutions in arthroscopic irrigation fluids, as with the work of Kataoka et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534734612450589">41</xref></sup> and Faddis et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534734612450589">42</xref></sup> generalizability to open joint trauma and the application of antiseptic dressings is limited. Although methodologically disparate, these studies do suggest a negative effect of prolonged exposure to neat iodine solutions; however, at low concentrations at which microbiological efficacy is retained, this cell and tissue damage may be limited. Further interrogation of the literature reveals experimental evidence to the contrary, however.</p>
<p>Switching models from their fibroblast studies, Muller and Kramer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1534734612450589">44</xref></sup> used a bovine sesamoid to evaluate the effect of antiseptics on articular cartilage in the presence of bacterial contamination. In marked contrast to the proposed cytotoxicity of iodine, this study investigating the metabolic activity of proteoglycan found iodine to be a stimulator of cartilage metabolism and not associated with its catabolism. Again, in apparent direct contradiction to the findings of Faddis et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534734612450589">42</xref></sup> Gunal et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534734612450589">45</xref></sup> report an <italic>in vivo</italic> recovery rabbit model to assess the effect of irrigation solutions on rabbit patellae. Following daily injection for 5 days with either antiseptic, antibiotic, or crystalloid solutions, the patellae were assessed 3 days later. No difference was seen either between groups or between the treated and untreated control knees.</p>
<p>These findings of Gunal et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534734612450589">45</xref></sup> and Muller and Kramer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1534734612450589">44</xref></sup> are corroborated by investigations of chondrocyte and iodine interactions at a more practical level. During articular surface reconstruction surgery, strategies are in place to enable the optimum cleansing of osteochondral fragments, should they inadvertently be dropped on the operating room floor. Investigations of decontamination regimes conclude that washing with diluted iodine solutions is recommended.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1534734612450589">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1534734612450589">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>It can be seen by these entirely contradictory experimental results across a range of disparate studies that evidence may be found for both cytotoxicity and tolerance of fibroblasts, chondrocytes, keratinocytes, and bone-forming cells to iodine solutions. No consensus exists apart from the trend of increased tolerance for iodine solutions when applied at low concentrations, which as previously established, coincides with the maximal antimicrobial efficacy of the solution.</p>

<title>Habituation and Antimicrobial Resistance</title>
<p>Prior to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in the proportions currently evident, Houang et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534734612450589">18</xref></sup> performed an evaluation of the habituation of common microorganisms to iodine.

<p>Revisiting the subject more recently, Traore et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534734612450589">48</xref></sup> tested known resistant strains of enterococci and bacilli isolates as well as MRSA.

This contrast between increasing antibiotic resistance but maintained antiseptic efficacy is illustrated by an <italic>in vitro</italic> study by Giacometti et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534734612450589">49</xref></sup> investigating the inhibition by antiseptics of nosocomial isolates of <italic>S aureus</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> known to be implicated in antibiotic-resistant clinical infections at the authors’ institution over a 6-year period. No change in efficacy was seen over the study period, indicating a lack of emerging antiseptic resistance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534734612450589">49</xref></sup> which is similarly reported by Barry et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534734612450589">50</xref></sup> PVP-I remains uniformly effective against commonly encountered organisms with known antibiotic resistance, negating fears that antiseptics were demonstrating ineffective action against key organisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534734612450589">51</xref></sup></p>

<title>Systematic Reviews of the Use of Iodine in Wound Care</title>
<p>Appreciating the contrasting, heterogeneous nature of the available evidence, clinical and preclinical, relating to the impact of iodine on wound care, an overview of the available literature has been attempted by a number of authors.</p>
<p>Approaching the problem of contradictory evidence for iodine use in wound healing from a primary care perspective, Banwell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534734612450589">53</xref></sup> carried out an appraisal of the literature to answer the following question: What is the evidence for tissue regeneration impairment when using a formulation of PVP-I on open wounds? Banwell assigned an overall evaluation to each article reviewed to quantify the level of support for or against the use of PVP-I in wound care. Of note, when all studies were considered, regardless of quality, only half of the findings supported the use of PVP-I. When the studies were segregated by quality, however, the level of support for the use of PVP-I increases to 71%. This in itself is of value because it both illustrates the disparity in experimental data regarding iodine in wound care and demonstrates that it is on opinion and poorly constructed scientific studies that the bulk of knowledge on the topic rests. Banwell concludes that there is support for the continued use of PVP-I antiseptics.</p>
<p>A limitation of this review is its focus primarily on the use of PVP-I in wounds encountered in the community, and although supportive of the use of PVP-I preparations in wound care, it cannot be immediately generalized to use in acute wounds.</p>
<p>Following the work of Banwell,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534734612450589">53</xref></sup> a systematic review was carried out by Vermeulen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534734612450589">22</xref></sup> of the benefits and harms of iodine in wound care. From 843 retrieved studies, filtering for relevance yielded 29 publications reporting on 27 RCTs. Even after filtering, marked heterogeneity remained, and this prevented meta-analysis. Of the 27 RCTs only 7 reported on patients with acute wounds. Because of the marked disparity in methodologies used and the wide range of methods of iodine administration seen in the evaluated studies, key questions regarding the optimum method and duration of application and hard end points of quantitative bacterial burden reduction were not addressed. What can be concluded is that iodine is an effective antiseptic, which is not inferior to other similar agents and that wound healing time is not prolonged compared with other antiseptics.</p>
<p>The findings of Vermeulen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534734612450589">22</xref></sup> corroborate the inferences of both Banwell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534734612450589">53</xref></sup> and Goldenheim<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534734612450589">36</xref></sup> in supporting the continued use of iodine in the generality of wound care. These reviews, however, leave many questions unanswered, particularly regarding the efficacy and optimum application of iodine in acute extremity wounding and its use when impregnated as a dressing in this setting.</p>

<title>Chlorhexidine</title>
<p>An unintended consequence of experimentation with antimalarial agents, chlorhexidine was found to have a high level of antibacterial activity, relatively low toxicity, and an affinity for binding to skin and mucous membranes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1534734612450589">54</xref></sup> Belonging to the disbiguanide family, it is commonly seen as a combination with gluconic acid—chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG). CHG’s mode of antimicrobial destruction is multifaceted. Electrostatic charge plays a role; chlorhexidine molecules are strongly cationic and are thus rapidly attracted to the negative charge of bacterial cell walls. Bacteriostatic at low concentrations, CHG demonstrates bactericidal activity as concentration increases, which although pH dependent is within a range that includes the environment at wound surfaces. Following breach of the cell wall, chlorhexidine acts on the cytoplasmic membrane, altering its potential and permeability, leading to cytoplasm precipitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1534734612450589">54</xref></sup> In contrast to its bactericidal behavior and unlike iodine, the antiviral activity of chlorhexidine is variable; mycobacteria are resistant to it, and it has no sporicidal efficacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534734612450589">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>As with other antiseptics, chlorhexidine is available in a range of preparations, and varying concentrations are available with the gluconate salt in either aqueous or alcoholic solutions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534734612450589">13</xref></sup></p>

<title>In Vitro Assessment of Chlorhexidine as Antiseptic</title>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> experimentation by Bhende and Spangler<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1534734612450589">55</xref></sup> with CHG-impregnated dressings using zone-of-inhibition assay suggests significant antimicrobial action against MRSA and VRE, although the authors state that further work would be required to assess if this <italic>in vitro</italic> impact could achieve a clinically relevant effect. Similar <italic>in vitro</italic> assessments report the role of antiseptics in relation to antibiotic-resistant organisms, including that of Block et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534734612450589">21</xref></sup> evaluating CHG and PVP-I activity against MRSA and VRE.</p>
<p>It is shown that CHG is associated with decreased killing of MRSA dried on to stainless steel surfaces, compared with MSSA. In addition, surface-dried <italic>S aureus</italic> is not fully inactivated even after prolonged exposure to CHG, whereas PVP-I resulted in marked reductions of both challenge organisms in less than 4 minutes. This work corroborates earlier findings of a disparity in the <italic>in vitro</italic> performance of the 2 most commonly used antiseptic agents against staphylococcal organisms of varying resistance.</p>
<p>In serial dilution testing of antiseptic agents against both MRSA and MSSA strains, Haley et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534734612450589">51</xref></sup> demonstrate disparate <italic>in vitro</italic> performance of PVP-I and CHG, with the former proved to be the antiseptic that most rapidly kills <italic>S aureus</italic>. The other antiseptics tested were considerably less effective when diluted than dilute PVP-I, with chlorhexidine being significantly less efficacious. Although the authors caution against the direct application of the results of their work to clinical practice, they suggest that for patients with suspected MRSA colonization, PVP-I solutions should be used in favor of CHG. This enhanced bactericidal efficacy of PVP-I compared with that of CHG is also demonstrated in an <italic>in vitro</italic> assessment of the bactericidal activity of commonly used antiseptics against clinical isolates by Kunisada et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1534734612450589">56</xref></sup> In comparison to the prompt bactericidal action of PVP-I, residual viable organisms are seen when CHG is used. In addition, resistance is demonstrated to CHG, and its impact on biofilm formation, unlike that of PVP-I, is seen to be negligible.</p>

<title>CHG and Surgical Hand Washing</title>
<p>CHG, alongside PVP-I, is ubiquitous in operating rooms for perioperative cleansing and is used interchangeably across surgical disciplines. A total of 10 studies feature in a systematic review of RCTs comparing hand antisepsis by Tanner et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1534734612450589">57</xref></sup> on behalf of the Cochrane collaboration. This review addressed 2 of the main features regarding hand antisepsis: Which solution performs hand antisepsis most effectively, and does a decreasing colony forming unit (CFU) count actually affect surgical site infection (SSI) rates?</p>
<p>Only 1 study of the 10 used SSI as an outcome, and the finding of this work was that there was no difference between infection rates seen when using either alcohol hand rubs or more established chlorhexidine scrubs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1534734612450589">58</xref></sup> The key finding of included studies is that where aqueous chlorhexidine and iodine are used in antisepsis, the former caused the greatest reduction in CFUs; however, it is not possible to extrapolate this to actual impact on SSI.</p>
<p>More recently, Jarral et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1534734612450589">59</xref></sup> identify, in their introduction for their systematic review of hand antisepsis, that published guidelines do not recommend 1 specific antiseptic. In addition to the trials reviewed by Tanner et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1534734612450589">57</xref></sup> this later work analyzed an additional 7 studies comparing the efficacy of chlorhexidine to iodine. The authors’ conclusion is indeterminate, suggesting that both agents have an impact on the reduction of bacterial load, but that seen with chlorhexidine is more dramatic. Of note, of the 7 additional papers included over those used by Tanner et al, 3 are nonrandomized trials, and a fourth concerns surgical site preparation and not hand antisepsis at all. These factors render any conclusions from this more recent review ineffectual.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1534734612450589">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>It can thus be seen that with regard to preoperative hand washing, chlorhexidine is an efficacious antiseptic, producing reductions in CFUs greater than those seen with iodine. Although this may be interpreted as being indicative of greater antiseptic properties, clinical correlation in terms of alteration in SSIs is equivocal between the 2 agents.</p>

<title>Catheter-Site Antisepsis and Impregnated Dressings</title>
<p>A driver for much of the evaluation of antiseptics is the economic impact of central venous catheter–associated blood-borne infections (BBIs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1534734612450589">60</xref></sup> Chaiyakunapruk et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534734612450589">27</xref></sup> performed a meta-analysis of 8 randomized trials comparing the use of CHG with PVP-I in central venous catheter–site antisepsis.</p>
<p>The authors found that 1% of patients with CHG skin preparation developed BBIs from intravascular catheters compared with 2% in the PVP-I group and estimated that for every 1000 catheter sites prepared with CHG rather than PVP-I, 71 episodes of catheter colonization and 11 episodes of catheter-related BBIs could be prevented. The analysis is well constructed, and the authors have gone to some length to address potential limitations of their review, particularly in terms of addressing publication bias and the heterogeneity of methodology of the studies included.</p>
<p>More recently, similar findings were presented by Mimoz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1534734612450589">61</xref></sup> in a randomized trial of CHG versus PVP-I in central venous catheter care. The authors suggest a statistically significant reduction in catheter colonization and a nonsignificant trend toward decreased BBIs in patients in whom CHG had been used to prepare the skin.</p>
<p>As well as the preparation of the skin with antiseptics, residual activity around catheter sites is afforded by antiseptic-impregnated dressings, which have been the subject of recent well-constructed clinical studies subjected to meta-analysis by Ho et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1534734612450589">62</xref></sup> Following a review of 8 RCTs using a single CHG dressing compared with a range of alternative preparations, Ho et al demonstrated from pooled outcomes that CHG-impregnated dressings are effective in reducing vascular and epidural catheter bacterial colonization. In addition, although not statistically significant, the use of such dressings is associated with a trend toward reduction in catheter-related BBIs.</p>
<p>A particular strength of this meta-analysis, supporting the use of chlorhexidine in such dressings, is the ability to analyze a single intervention over 8 RCTs, involving 2588 episodes of care. Such homogeneity of intervention is rare in clinical trials and as such lends increased weight to the author’s findings.</p>
<p>Along with intravascular catheterization, antisepsis is used in the preparation of skin for regional anesthesia, and studies have investigated the optimal antiseptic agent for these procedures. Sato et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1534734612450589">63</xref></sup> demonstrated the potential for skin flora to be implicated in epidural catheterization by a novel study based on the assessment of skin from incised wounds obtained during routine spinal surgery.</p>
<p>In a nonrandomized study design, patients undergoing elective spinal procedures had excision biopsies taken from the intended incision site following skin preparation with either PVP-I or CHG. The results suggest the presence of viable pathogenic skin flora at the incision sites despite antiseptic skin preparation. Bacteria grew in significantly higher proportions in skin that was prepared with PVP-I compared with CHG. These findings gain corroboration from an observational study carried out by Yentur et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1534734612450589">64</xref></sup> in which patients undergoing surgery under epidural anesthesia had skin swabs, needle tips, and epidural catheters analyzed for microbial colonization following introduction into the epidural space with PVP-I antisepsis. Although superficial swabs taken from the puncture site immediately prior to the procedure demonstrated low growth of organisms, 18 of 52 needles and 22 of 52 catheters were colonized.</p>
<p>In addition to the work of Sato et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1534734612450589">63</xref></sup> and Yentur et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1534734612450589">64</xref></sup> other studies comparing the relative efficacy of CHG and PVP-I in skin preparation for regional anesthesia have shown potential benefits for the former solution. In a RCT of epidural catheter use for postoperative analgesia, Kinirons et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1534734612450589">65</xref></sup> demonstrated that catheter sites prepared with CHG were one sixth as likely to be colonized as those prepared with PVP-I. Of interest, it can be seen that none of the organisms cultured were nosocomial; all originated from the skin of the patient around the catheter site.</p>
<p>Although it demonstrates success in preventing catheter-related infections caused by transmissible bacteria, this study again demonstrates the inability of antiseptic solutions, especially PVP-I, to eradicate bacterial load prior to surgery or instrumentation. Of interest, Kasuda et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1534734612450589">66</xref></sup> randomized 70 patients undergoing epidural catheterization to skin preparation with PVP-I or CHG and found no significant difference between the 2 regimes. It is to be noted that in this study, the patients received antibiotic prophylaxis, and the outcome was of colonization of the skin prior to insertion and the line itself on extraction. No correlation with BBIs is made, and the numbers are small. All these confounding factors limit the clinical importance of the findings.</p>
<p>Krobbuaban et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1534734612450589">67</xref></sup> similarly address the effect of CHG and PVP-I on skin antisepsis prior to epidural anesthesia in elective surgery. Randomly allocated to skin preparation with CHG or PVP-I, the authors demonstrated that use of the former solution is associated with a greater reduction in organisms found on skin swabs. It should be noted that this work is purely a quantitative assessment of bacterial contamination of skin following application of antiseptic. It does not correlate these findings with either catheter colonization or ultimately with episodes of BBI. It is known from the other studies that bacterial presence and quantity does not correlate with pathogenesis of either SSIs or BBIs. This again limits the clinical relevance of this work.</p>
<p>No meta-analysis compares studies of skin preparation prior to regional anesthesia. The work detailed above suggests a trend to improved reduction in organisms on the skin surface and also, in some instances, a reduction in catheter colonization with the use of CHG, but the scientific process on which this is based is tenuous, and the clinical impact is similarly questionable in terms of reducing BBIs.</p>

<title>Preoperative Skin Preparation</title>
<p>Early rudimentary assessments of the relative efficacy of CHG and PVP-I in skin preparation suggest little difference between the 2 agents, with equal reduction in volunteer resident bacterial flora seen following 2 minutes of exposure to either preparation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1534734612450589">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1534734612450589">69</xref></sup> Later, Berry et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1534734612450589">70</xref></sup> carried out a randomized comparison of the use of PVP-I and CHG in the prophylaxis of postoperative wound infection. Enrolling patients undergoing elective general surgical procedures, with wound infection as primary outcome, the authors concluded that no difference exists between either antiseptic. Considerable methodological issues limit the study validity, however, predominantly because of the subjective assessment used to declare wounds as infected.</p>
<p>Preoperative skin preparation has been the subject of a Cochrane review,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1534734612450589">71</xref></sup> although this is of limited use because it contains only 1 study comparing antiseptics—that of Berry et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1534734612450589">70</xref></sup> Further illustrating the quantity but lack of quality in terms of antiseptic literature, Noorani et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1534734612450589">72</xref></sup> report a meta-analysis of CHG versus PVP-I in clean-contaminated surgery. The search strategy yielded 22 000, articles of which 6 were suitable for analysis and suggested that CHG reduces postoperative SSI compared with PVP-I, compelling the authors to conclude that CHG should be used for antisepsis in clean-contaminated surgery. Although this review provides a robust assessment of mainly level-2 evidence, it is compromised by the lack of uniformity of SSI terminology. The study of Berry et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1534734612450589">70</xref></sup> for instance, uses an entirely subjective assessment of wound infection. The study by Darouiche et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1534734612450589">73</xref></sup> also included in the review by Noorani et al, in contrast used an end point of occurrence of any SSI within 30 days after surgery, which involved over-the -telephone assessment of patients. The undermining of the meta-analysis findings in this manner is further illustrated when the outcome criteria for SSI as used in another included study are explored.</p>
<p>In a RCT comparing surgical wound infection after preoperative skin preparation with CHG and PVP-I, Paocharoen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1534734612450589">74</xref></sup> state that:

<p><italic>an incisional surgical site infection had occurred if a surgical wound drained purulent material or if the surgeon judges it to be infected and opens it.</italic><sup>(p899)</sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The significant clinical heterogeneity inherent in these disparate outcome measures introduces a level of systematic bias that seriously threatens the validity of the findings of Noorani et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1534734612450589">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some of these studies analyzed by Noorani et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1534734612450589">72</xref></sup> also feature in a systematic review comparing the use of CHG with PVP-I reported by Lee et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1534734612450589">75</xref></sup> The nonrandomized prospective study of 3 skin preparation protocols and their effects on postoperative wound infections by Swenson et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1534734612450589">76</xref></sup> included by Noorani et al, is omitted from the review of Lee et al. In addition, Lee et al include 4 studies excluded by Noorani et al because their study populations did not involve clean-contaminated procedures.</p>
<p>A robust review, pooling data on 3614 patients, the work of Lee et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1534734612450589">75</xref></sup> provides an overview of SSIs across surgical disciplines and includes a more equal balance of clean and clean-contaminated surgery. Two main outcome measures may be gleaned from this review, the first being rates of SSIs. Meta-analysis of the 7 studies that evaluated the outcome of SSI reported that use of CHG significantly decreased the risk for SSIs compared with use of PVP-I. Significant study heterogeneity was not found, nor was publication bias for the outcome of SSI noted. The secondary outcome measure from these studies is positive skin culture results after skin antisepsis. Meta-analysis of 4 studies found that use of CHG significantly decreased the risk for a positive skin culture result after application, compared with PVP-I. Although no significant study heterogeneity was found, potential publication bias for the secondary outcome of positive skin culture result was noted. Lee et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1534734612450589">75</xref></sup> conclude that there is moderate-quality evidence supporting the use of CHG over PVP-I for preoperative skin antisepsis to prevent SSIs. In addition, there is moderate-quality evidence that use of CHG is associated with fewer positive skin culture results.</p>
<p>These findings translate to a 36% reduction in the number of SSIs in cases prepared with CHG compared with those having PVP-I antisepsis. This finding is similar for most studies and is independent of the surgical procedure involved and the concentration and inclusion of alcohol in the chlorhexidine solution.</p>
<p>The evidence from this review, particularly taken in conjunction with the findings of Noorani et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1534734612450589">72</xref></sup> is compelling and favors the use of chlorhexidine for skin antisepsis. The same caution must, however, be applied in the interpretation of the pooled results. The reporting of SSIs is central to studies concerning infection and is the Achilles heel of meta-analyses of such work.</p>
<p>Like iodine, chlorhexidine is accepted and in widespread use across numerous domains of antisepsis-related health care. More numerous, contemporary experimental evidence is available to support its use, which is suggestive of greater efficacy of CHG compared with PVP-I across all domains. As highlighted, however, the clinical impact of the differing solutions is often unclear partly because of heterogeneous methodologies and outcome measurement.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The use of antiseptic-soaked gauze is common practice in the early management of extremity wounding, although the evidence to support this is lacking. With continued concern over antibiotic resistance and infection a persisting feature of musculoskeletal injury however, any such augmentation of wound care with topical antimicrobial delivery remains an area of research interest.</p>
<p>The mechanism of action and experimental evidence for iodine and chlorhexidine preparations are presented alongside common misconceptions over their use. Concern over iodine deactivation in wounds has been shown to be misplaced, and evidence for cytotoxicity to both skin and joint tissue is conflicting, being limited by poor study design and inability to generalize preclinical experimentation. Attention is drawn to the recurring finding of the use of diluted iodine solutions in wound care, thus limiting cytotoxicity while retaining antimicrobial activity.</p>
<p>Appraisal of the use of the 2 antiseptic agents in clinical studies suggests increased benefit with the use of CHG demonstrated in patient skin preparation prior to surgery or indwelling catheter placement, in hand washing, and also in impregnated film dressings for securing indwelling catheters. This recommendation is based primarily on good evidence for a greater ability of CHG to lower bacterial CFU counts in skin and catheters, although evidence for actual impact on infection rates in terms of reduction of SSIs is less compelling. In addition, comparative <italic>in vitro</italic> evaluation of PVP-I and CHG against resistant organisms and biofilms reveals, in contrast to the clinical studies, that PVP-I has considerably greater activity than CHG.</p>
<p>While exploring the use of antiseptics in health care and identifying areas of misconception, this review has demonstrated the conspicuous lack of evidence for the use of either antiseptic in the dressing of extremity wounds. There is no comparative <italic>in vitro, in vivo</italic>, or clinical data to inform the choice of antiseptic used in acute wound care or to substantiate accepted current practice. With infection being a major sequela of limb injury and contrasting results between <italic>in vitro</italic> and clinical studies of antiseptic efficacy, the need for <italic>in vivo</italic> assessment of antiseptic dressings in contaminated musculoskeletal trauma is transparent. This review provides a basis on which future clinical and laboratory investigations of the use of antiseptics in extremity wounding may be constructed.</p>
