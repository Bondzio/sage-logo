<p><italic>Power, Change, and Gender Relations in Rural Java</italic> offers a snapshot into “the relationship between the ideological construction and the material practices of gender roles” in contemporary rural Indonesian society (p. 93). The first half of the book provides an extensive description of the historical, religious, and political influences on both men and women’s perceptions of gender roles, building toward an analytical argument focused on the contradictions inherent in and accepted by rural society in Java. The political changes that occurred in the late 1990s in Indonesia, including the fall of the New Order regime and the election of female president Megawati Sukarnoputri, provide an important backdrop to the community-level dynamics that are the focus of the latter half of the book. Ann Tickamyer and Siti Kusujiarti apply the contexualized framework of ambiguous gender ideology and practice to two villages in the Yogyakarta province, focusing in particular on the gendered divisions of household and wage labor, and political power.</p>
<p>By conducting semi-structured interviews in the same villages and with many of the same individuals for more than 20 years, the authors have rich and varied data that are analyzed and presented in a variety of ways in order to characterize and probe perceptions and experiences of gender. Their main conclusion is that abstract ideas about power differences between men and women, which are based in cultural and religious traditions, create distinctions in gender roles that are different from those found in everyday decisions about household and community needs, where women play an often assertive and sometimes directive role. This contradiction between ideology and practice has remained constant over the past two decades, despite changes in political and development rhetoric that has emphasized gender equity. The historical and analytical detail provided in this book will be of particular interest to scholars of southeast Asian social and political changes, as the authors paint a dynamic picture of the myriad influences on gender ideas and roles in Java and Indonesia. In addition, the combination of empirical detail and theory building make this book an excellent case study for graduate-level courses on the sociology of gender.</p>
