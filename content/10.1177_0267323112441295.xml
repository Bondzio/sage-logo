<p>The vast majority of literature on television history – and media history more generally – remains national in scope. Comparative, transnational studies are rare, and largely focused on the institutional, legal and economic structures of broadcasting, rather than its cultural output and influence. The reasons for such a state of affairs are easy to find: the amount of television output is daunting, and its analysis requires a level of linguistic and cultural competence that few individuals can master. It is therefore hardly a surprise that existing transnational studies of television history tend to be written by transnational teams rather than individual researchers. In light of this, Bourdon’s cultural history of European televisions – published in French by the Institut national de l’audiovisuel – is a true accomplishment. One can only hope that it will soon be available in other major European languages, and included among key readings on introductory courses of media history.</p>
<p>The core of the book – and its most original contribution – consists of four chapters dedicated to the history of individual television genres: fiction, new programmes, entertainment and reality television. Each genre is scrutinized in its cultural and social context, including its production and reception, but also in relation to the co-text – namely, the position of particular programmes and genres in television programme schemes as a whole. The historical narrative running through each of the chapters is organized around two central tensions. The first is the tension between transnational homogenization and national diversity. While acknowledging the pervasive standardization of television cultures across Europe, Bourdon contends that this standardization took place largely at the level of form, while content remained marked by substantial national as well as regional variation (especially along the South/North axis). The second tension is tied to the ideals of public service broadcasting, defined in opposition to commercial television – and, more broadly, in opposition to the institutional arrangements and cultural conventions of American television. From this perspective, the history recounted by Bourdon is a story of decline – a decline of public service television, but also a decline of a distinct European television culture, and its progressive convergence with American television culture. While this is a familiar story, Bourdon’s version includes several original elements – including a typology of different forms of Americanization, starting with the ‘invisible’ Americanization of the 1950s and the 1960s, the ‘triumphant’ Americanization of the 1980s and finally the ‘intimate’ Americanization embodied in reality shows.</p>
<p>The first substantive chapter offers a comparative overview of the rise and decline of public service television. Rather than starting from a clear-cut definition of public television, Bourdon tells a story of full of coincidences and considerable cross-national variation. The public service ideals, he argues, emerged as a ‘fragile consensus’ (p. 26) and were formed retrospectively, through various challenges posed by the rise of competition and commercial providers. The chapter examines six critical ‘moments’ in the history of public service television: the ‘golden age’ of the late 1950s and the early 1960s; the dilemmas surrounding the appearance of advertising in the same period; the introduction of second public television channels and the rise of ‘soft’ competition in the mid-1960s; the political pressures and institutional restructuring of the 1970s; the arrival of commercial television and full-blown competition in the 1980s; and the large-scale adoption of satellite and cable technology in the same period. The transition charted in this chapter – from the regime of public service monopoly to the regime of competition and partial commercialization (p. 71) – provides the backbone for subsequent chapters.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 focuses on the role of the European Broadcasting Union and provides an overview of a wide variety of pan-European television genres and exchanges, ranging from the simultaneous live broadcasting of programmes to several countries to the Eurovision Song Contest, the pan-European game show <italic>Games Without Borders</italic> and the launch of European channels such as Euronews, Eurosport and Arte. Bourdon argues that these initiatives, for the most part, failed to achieve their intended goal – namely the creation of a common European television culture – and examines some of the reasons for this failure, including language barriers, the persistence of banal nationalism and the national and local context of reception.</p>
<p>Starting with Chapter 3, the book turns to the history of individual television genres, beginning with television fiction. The chapter moves from the early period of the late 1950s and the early 1960s, when fiction was treated as the ‘royal’ genre and played a key role in delivering the public service mission; then charts the decline of live television and the growth of serial fiction in the 1960s; discusses the proliferation of serials impregnated with social critique in the 1970s; the shifting relationship between television and cinema; and concludes with the ‘invasion’ of American television fiction in the 1980s, followed by the resurgence of national production in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 tackles the evolution of television news, and interprets it as a result of tensions between the ideals of journalism and the exigencies of television as a visual and popular medium. Four key periods are identified: the 1950s, when television news was an ill-defined genre of marginal importance; the 1960s, when the evening news bulletin evolved into a major national ritual; the 1970s, when the advent of soft competition prompted changes in the form and range of television news; and the 1980s, marked by the blurring of boundaries between information and entertainment genres and the growing convergence between European and American television news.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 moves to the terrain of European entertainment, which represents a key chapter in European television history and stretches across a varied array of genres, from variety programmes and game shows to satirical programmes. One of the key arguments developed in this chapter concerns two distinct phases of Americanization of European television entertainment: the first, ‘invisible’ one, which took off in the late 1950s and was characterized by informal borrowing and creative appropriation of American genres; and the second, highly visible one, which started in the 1980s and rested on the formal purchase and adoption of formats and allowed far less room for national variation.</p>
<p>Reality television is the subject of Chapter 6, which discusses various precursors of the genre, including programmes that centre on the exhibition of ‘authentic’ intimacy, confession and testimony (e.g. talk-shows) and programmes that cover real processes such as criminal or court cases (e.g. <italic>Crimewatch</italic>). It also considers the public controversies generated by reality shows, such as accusations of voyeurism, and discusses the genre’s relationship with public service ideals and national traditions.</p>
<p>The last substantive chapter tackles the uneasy relationship between public television and ‘the popular’. The chapter identifies six manifestations of the popular that proved most challenging for the public service: game shows, stars, seriality, numbers (especially in the sense of audience ratings), the influence and success of American popular genres and formats and voyeurism (as manifested in reality television).</p>
<p>While ambitious and wide-ranging, Bourdon’s television history does not pretend to be exhaustive. As the author himself points out, the study says little about sports and documentaries, and focuses almost exclusively on the most popular programmes. The geographical scope is limited as well. The book deals primarily with developments in Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain, with occasional examples from Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal and the Scandinavian countries. The reasons for omitting Eastern Europe were not purely practical; extending the analysis to the former communist countries, argues Bourdon, would necessitate writing a global rather than European television history. Furthermore, it was Western Europe that gave birth to the ideal of public service, which, in Bourdon’s analysis, emerges as the defining characteristic of European television history.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the inclusion of communist television histories should clearly be among the priorities of European television historians. While it is true that the European traditions of public service television were defined largely in opposition to American commercial television, their history cannot be comprehended fully without considering their relationship with communist television norms and practices. It is certainly not a coincidence that the decline of public television and the accelerated convergence between European and American television cultures coincided with the end of the Cold War. A television history that would pay due attention to the cultural dynamics of the Cold War confrontation would of course need to be global rather than European in scope – yet it is only against such a global background that we will be able to come to terms with the specificity of European television.</p>
