<p>In this study, the bulk compression measurement of electrospun nanofibers was performed by using a modified KES-G5s compression tester. The fibers were directly electrospun on several sample stages, and then transferred to a compression tester in order to avoid damage during the specimen preparation. Since the thickness of a nanofiber sheet is on the micrometer scale, the use of a novel spherical ball indenter instead of conventional fabric-use disk indenter to compress the nanofiber sheet was examined with the aim of obtaining an accurate displacement value. The results indicate that an aluminum sample stage and a ball indenter are suitable for the measurement. The compression parameters were also calculated from the obtained load–displacement curves in order to understand of the fundamental mechanical properties of a nonwoven sheet of electrospun nanofibers.</p>

<body>
<p>With the rapid growth of nanotechnology, the fabrication of thin fibrous materials with a nanoscale diameter and a unique structure has become possible. Over the last decade, the electrospinning process has emerged as a main technique for producing fibers with a diameter range from a few nanometers to a few micrometers, a porous structure, and a large surface fibrous surface area to fibrous material volume.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517513481868">1</xref></sup> To date, many synthetic polymers, biopolymers, and natural compounds have been fabricated into nanofibers by electrospinning, and the application of electrospun nanofibers to medical materials, smart textiles, filter media, electrical devices, and so forth has been studied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517513481868">2</xref></sup> In the textile field, electrospun nanofiber sheets are combined with base textiles by coating or laminating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517513481868">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0040517513481868"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517513481868">5</xref></sup> The determination of the characteristics of electrospun nanofibers, especially their mechanical properties, is required for determining the performance of these fibers in the above-mentioned application. However, limitations of the bulk mechanical property measurement arise from the small thickness and porous structure of nanofiber sheets, resulting in damage during specimen preparation as well as during measurement; specimen damage also causes difficulty in analyzing the obtained values to represent the actual performance of nanofiber sheets. Therefore, a suitable experimental process adapted to the nature of electrospun nanofiber sheets needs to be considered in order to study their bulk mechanical properties.</p>
<p>The tensile property of an electrospun nanofiber sheet was measured to assess its mechanical performance conventionally. A commonly used process for specimen preparation is to embed a rectangular nanofiber sheet with a substrate such as aluminum foil into a paper frame, and then remove the aluminum foil from the fibers. This embed/remove process easily causes fiber damage, and the obtained value is influenced by the overestimated value generated due to the stress concentration in the vicinity of the grip part during the measurement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0040517513481868">6</xref></sup> Fennessey et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517513481868">7</xref></sup> reported that polyurethane nanofiber sheets show a smaller value of elongation at break and a lower ultimate strength than cast films. It is thus possible for fiber movement to generate interfiber friction when a load is applied to a nanofiber sheet with a porous structure, a phenomenon that also affects the observation of the tensile property of nanofiber sheets. By taking these findings altogether, aside from the tensile test, more studies and effective processes should be carried out to understand the mechanical properties of electrospun nanofiber sheets.</p>
<p>The compression property is a fundamental mechanical property, particularly for soft materials. Characteristics, such as elasticity and resilience, obtained by compression measurement are closely related to the mechanical performance of materials, especially when a nanofiber sheet is used in nonwoven form for medical dressings or the surface modification of composite materials. The compression test is much convenient than the tensile test in both specimen preparation and measurement. It has been reported that atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanoindentation is an effective method of probing the mechanical properties of single nanofibers by calculating the elastic modulus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517513481868">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517513481868">9</xref></sup> As for nanofiber sheets, Vondran et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517513481868">10</xref></sup> investigated the compression property of crosslinked chitosan-poly(ethylene oxide) nanofiber mats using an MTS nano-indenter XP (Eden Prairie, MN); however, they did not clearly interpret the effect of fiber movement on the mechanical properties. Lee et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517513481868">11</xref></sup> investigated the compression property of polyurethane nanofiber webs with a base nylon fabric using the Kawabata Evaluation System (KES). Note, however, that the mechanical properties of individual nanofiber sheets cannot be analyzed by using this composite structure. In addition, the conventional fabric-use disk-type indenter (2cm<sup>2</sup>) of the KES compression tester may not be suitable for measuring electrospun nanofiber sheets when their thickness decreases down to a few micrometers, because of the difficulty in adjusting the parallel condition between the indenter and the specimen surface for obtaining accurate values. Therefore, although the KES has been widely used to study the mechanical properties of nonwoven fabrics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0040517513481868">12</xref></sup> apparatus modification and effective specimen preparation are required in order to measure the bulk compression property of nanofiber sheets.</p>
<p>In the present study, we aim to develop an experimental process for measuring the bulk compression property of a nonwoven sheet of nanofibers by modifying the KES-G5s compression tester. Firstly, specimen preparation, the modification of the compression tester, and measurement conditions were studied according to the nature of nonwoven sheets of electrospun nanofibers. Secondly, the bulk compression property of several typical polymer nanofiber sheets was measured, and the compression parameters were calculated from the load–displacement curve. This experimental process is a novel solution for evaluating the compression property of nanofiber sheets, and the results obtained here can be used to obtain a fundamental understanding of the applications of these fiber sheets.</p>

<p>In order to avoid fiber damage during the specimen preparation, a few mirror-polished sample stages (diameter: 20 mm; thickness: 5 mm) were examined as spinning collectors. The sample stage materials are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0040517513481868">Table 1</xref>. Random nanofibers can be spun on the surface of the sample stage by electrospinning and then transferring them to the compression tester immediately. The deformation of the sample stage needs to be minimized under compression load and subtracted from the obtained compression load in order to obtain the real compression property of nanofiber sheets. In addition, the sample stage must be efficient enough to collect fibers during electrospinning.

<p>Four typical polymers used in electrospinning were selected to produce nanofiber sheets, including poly(caprolactone) (PCL; Mn = 70,000–90,000; Sigma-Aldrich, USA), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA; 87–89 mol% hydrolyzed; Kuraray Poval, Japan), medical-grade polyurethane (M-PU; density: 1.084 g/cm<sup>3</sup>; Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and Nylon 6 (density: 1.084 g/cm<sup>3</sup>; Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The spinning time was fixed at 1, 2, or 3 h in order to prepare nanofiber sheets of different thickness on the sample stage.

<p>The KES-G5s compression tester (Kato Tech. Co., Ltd, Japan) was modified to increase displacement accuracy. This tester was used for the measurement of feather-powder-coated films, taking account of the reliable accuracy of displacement (0.2 µm), and the minimum detectable force of this tester, which is 0.0098 N.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0040517513481868">13</xref></sup> In the case of feather-powder-coated films, a 0.25-cm<sup>2</sup> top plate was used, but careful manipulation was necessary to adjust the parallel position between the compression plate and the base stage. Considering more precise measurements, the base stage and the shape of the indenter were examined.</p>
<p>Firstly, the base stage of the KES-G5s compression tester was changed to a mirror-polished SUS-304 plate to improve the adhesion between the base stage and the sample stage. No space between the sample stage and the base stage was allowed during the compression test.</p>
<p>Secondly, the shape of the indenter was examined. A spherical ball indenter (diameter: 5 and 10 mm) and a disk indenter (diameter: 1.6 cm) were used to measure the nanofiber sheets. When a ball (diameter: <italic>D</italic>) was indented to the elastic body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517513481868">Figure 2</xref>) the relation between load (<italic>L</italic>) and indentation (δ) was obtained according to Hertz’s elastic theory as follows:

<p>The sample stage should have small displacement under compression load, which should be subtracted from the displacement of the nanofiber sheet.</p>
<p>The MD of the three sample stages measured by using a disk indenter and ball indenter under a compression load of 1 N is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517513481868">Figure 4</xref>. The MDs obtained by using the disk indenter indicated a larger value and deviation than those obtained using the ball indenter. The MDs obtained by the disk indenter were expected to be lower than that of the ball indenter, because the contact area of the disk indenter was larger than the ball. We considered that the MD of the disk indenter includes error caused by the unparallel condition between the disk indenter and sample stages. In addition, SUS-304 should have the smallest deformation under compression load according to the elastic modulus of the material. However, experimental results obtained using the disk indenter showed discrepancy from the calculation results.
<fig id="fig4-0040517513481868" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Maximum displacements of sample stages measured by using disk and ball indenters under 1 N compression load.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0040517513481868-fig4.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The results indicate that the ball indenter is more suitable than the disk indenter for measuring small displacement for nanofiber sheets. When the effect of ball diameter on the MD of the sample stage was considered, no significant difference was observed and the difference in MD among the three stages was within 0.5 µm when balls of 5 and 10 mm in diameter were used. Therefore, the spherical ball indenter with a 5 mm diameter was examined for the compression of nanofiber sheets.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although the SUS-304 and brass sample stages show smaller MDs than the aluminum one, the aluminum stage showed a higher efficiency for collecting fibers on the stage during spinning. Therefore, the aluminum stage was selected. The load–displacement curve of the nanofiber sheet was calculated in a manner that its displacement of the same corresponding load of the aluminum stage was subtracted from that of the nanofiber sheet on the stage.</p>

In the case of a 2 N compression load, a higher deviation in WC-N was found.

<p>Taking account of all the results mentioned above, in the present study, the evaluation method for the compression properties for the nanofiber sheets was set as follows: the use of a 5 mm diameter spherical ball indenter to compress nanofiber sheets on an aluminum stage, and a maximum compression load fixed at 1 N. The compression speed is 1 µm/s.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517513481868">Figure 6</xref> shows typical load–displacement curves of the nanofiber sheets after the first and second compressions, after the displacement of the aluminum stage was subtracted. Since five positions were measured for each nanofiber sheet, the curve containing a value close to the average was selected. Smooth compression curves were obtained for the electrospun nanofiber sheet. The MD, WC-N, and RC were calculated from the curves, and the means and SDs are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0040517513481868">Table 4</xref>. The average MD and WC-N calculated from the first compression were higher than those calculated from the second compression for all the samples. The electrospun nanofiber sheet is a layer-like porous structure, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517513481868">Figure 1</xref>; therefore, the space between layers is compressed in the first compression, resulting in a higher MD and a higher WC-N, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517513481868">Figure 7</xref>. This phenomenon is commonly observed in the compression of wadding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517513481868">16</xref></sup> When the nanofiber sheets were compressed, the nanofibers moved around the ball indenter and density changed under the applied force, and the space between layers was lost owing to the adhesion between layers. In the second compression, the movement between fibers became smaller because of the adhesion caused by the first compression. Therefore, the MD and WC-N calculated from the second compression were smaller than those calculated from the first compression. The interfiber friction introduced by the movement of the fibers was reflected in the large hysteresis in the first compression curve. When RC was considered, its value from the second compression curve was less affected by friction: thus, it is suitable to compare RC among various nanofiber sheets. In this experiment, the RCs of the M-PU and PCL samples were much higher value than those of the PVA and Nylon 6 samples, indicating a higher recovery. The modified KES-G5s compression tester showed the load–displacement curves of compression, and values of RC can be used to characterize materials. These results help us to analyze the electrospun nanofiber nonwoven sheet. Further research is needed to understand the compression properties of nanofiber sheets, such as elastic modulus, in more detail.

<p>A method of compression measurement was developed for nonwoven sheets of electrospun nanofibers, which uses a modified KES-G5s compression tester. An aluminum sample stage was used to prepare the nanofiber sheets for testing, and a spherical ball indenter instead of a conventional fabric-use disk indenter was used for compressing the nanofiber sheets, owing to their micrometer-scale thickness. Four typical polymers, namely, PVA, PCL, Nylon 6, and M-PU, were measured, and the compression parameters, including MD, WC-N, and RC, were calculated from the load–displacement curves after subtracting the aluminum stage value. The results indicated that the MD and WC-N calculated from the second compression were smaller than those calculated from the first compression for all the samples, because of the fiber movement and adhesion caused by the first compression; the larger hysteresis in the first compression curve can be attributed to interfiber friction. The compression test using the modified KES-G5s compression tester was much more convenient than the tensile test in both specimen preparation and measurement. The compression parameters obtained in this study can be used for understanding of the fundamental mechanical properties of electrospun nanofiber sheets.</p>
