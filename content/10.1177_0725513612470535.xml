<abstract>
<p>This article addresses the tensions between the struggle for gender equality and the struggle for cultural rights in the particular form championed by traditionalists within the ANC after 1994. While both sets of rights are recognized in the 1996 Constitution, the right to equality takes precedence. Nevertheless, a ‘turn to tradition’ within the ANC has seen the consolidation of patriarchal traditional institutions in the communal areas. These developments reflect the predominance of very thin understandings of both gender equality and culture within the organization. They have, however, been challenged by activists, with the principle of gender equality proving to be a significant impediment to the traditionalist agenda. The manner in which these dynamics have unfolded places gender at the centre of struggles over the meaning and practice of equality and democracy in post-apartheid South Africa.</p>

<title>Introduction: Constructing ‘gender equality’ and ‘cultural rights’</title>
<p>In this article I reflect on the entangled histories of two significant rights-based projects in post-apartheid South Africa – the promotion of women’s rights, which is generally described as the struggle for gender equality, and recognition for what is referred to, often interchangeably, as ‘traditional’, ‘indigenous’ or, more pointedly, ‘African’ culture. This is commonly represented as a struggle for cultural rights. The particular way in which the latter has come to be defined – the valorization of traditional institutions that have historically excluded or marginalized women – has brought it into serious conflict with the former. Tensions between women’s rights and cultural rights are, of course, not unique to South Africa. They have, however, acquired a particular salience in this country in the post-apartheid dispensation. The manner in which the contestation between ‘women’s rights’ and ‘cultural rights’ has unfolded since 1994 places gender at the centre of the ongoing debate about the meaning of equality and democracy.</p>
<p>One of my concerns is to trace the way in which a ‘turn to tradition’ within the African National Congress (ANC) has threatened the gains made by the broad women’s movement in 1993, when gender equality was confirmed as a foundational commitment of South Africa’s new democracy. That commitment would not have been possible without the acceptance by the ANC of the principle of gender equality as a core organizational value, yet, as subsequent developments have revealed, respect for women’s rights is not a deeply rooted practical virtue within the organization. There is a deep-seated conservatism around gender relations among many members (male and female), which from time to time has burst dramatically into the public arena, as in the political theatre that erupted in the course of the rape trial and subsequent acquittal of current President Zuma in 2006, when he was fighting for his political life.</p>
<p>This article also looks at the critical role that popular mobilization against the claims of traditionalists has played in defending not only the insecure achievements of the broad women’s movement, but also general principles of non-racialism and democracy. These dynamics can be seen particularly clearly in the vocal opposition within civil society to the ANC’s concerted efforts since the early 2000s to consolidate the powers of unelected traditional leadership institutions in former ‘Bantustan’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0725513612470535">1</xref>
</sup> districts: in local government, in land ownership and administration, and in the administration of justice. In the campaigns that sections of civil society have fought against the Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Act of 2003, the Communal Land Rights Act of 2004 and, most recently, the Traditional Courts Bill of 2008 and 2012, the constitutional commitment to gender equality has been a particularly difficult impediment for the state to circumvent, both legally and politically. Thus, far from the struggle for women’s rights seeking to advance sectarian goals at the expense of the greater good (a common accusation within the national liberation movement in the 1970s and 1980s), women’s rights have become central to the broader struggle for equality and full citizenship.</p>
<p>The ANC’s unfolding policy on traditional institutions reflects the dominance of very thin understandings of both gender equality and cultural rights within the organization. Although space does not allow a full development of this point, in part this can be explained historically. In terms of its organizational culture, the ANC continues to be hostage to its past as a nationalist movement, strongly influenced by Marxist-Leninism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0725513612470535">Johnson 2003</xref>) and long suspicious of feminism, individualism and western liberalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0725513612470535">Erlank 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0725513612470535">Hassim 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0725513612470535">Walker 1991</xref>). Its preferred sociology constructs South Africa as an uneasy agglomeration of distinct social groups that are defined primarily in terms of common-sense constructions of ‘race’. Philosophically and politically the collective is valued above the individual, as seen in the much-vaunted punting of the notion of <italic>ubuntu </italic>[humaneness], which lends itself to certain understandings of the past as a golden age in which <italic>ubuntu</italic> and social cohesion prevailed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0725513612470535">2</xref>
</sup> But more instrumentalist political considerations are also at work. Hein Marais, for instance, has attributed the ANC’s turn to traditional leadership institutions after 2000 to a mounting concern to ‘extend and strengthen its authority’ in rural areas, at a time when the government’s failures to deliver on promises of socio-economic transformation have become increasingly difficult to manage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0725513612470535">Marais 2011</xref>: 425).</p>
<p>In terms of women’s rights these dynamics have severely compromised the ANC’s ability to craft government programmes that not only pass formal constitutional muster but also empower the marginalized women who are regularly identified as a major target of policy interventions. The ANC’s commitment to gender equality has been most consistently expressed through its construction of women as a marginalized social group that can best be served through what Hassim has described as ‘a virtuous circle of representation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0725513612470535">Hassim 2006b</xref>: 336): that is, by setting quotas and targets for female participation in institutions, as well as by establishing special bodies to advance their interests, such as the Commission on Gender Equality. A recent example is President Zuma’s 2009 decision to establish a ragbag Ministry of Women, Children and People with Disabilities within his Cabinet, thereby constructing ‘women’ as a special-interest constituency within a clumsily conceived association of vulnerable groups. Yet, as elaborated below, ordinary women’s struggles for rights and recognition cannot be reduced to a problem of inadequate representation within government and corporate structures. Their challenges are rather more commonly located in everyday relationships with intimate partners, other family and community members, and employers. Here women’s concerns about individual bodily integrity and authority over income and property are paramount, not the gender balance in organizations.</p>
<p>At the same time, the ANC favours treating ‘culture’ as a bounded, coherent possession of distinct racial, ethnic or racially delimited ‘community’ groups. While all racial groups are seen to have their own unique cultures, in practice current public debate tends to conflate ‘culture’ with ‘tradition’ and/or ‘custom’, which encourages a preoccupation with cultural rights as a specifically ‘African’ concern. Here former President Mbeki’s invocation of an ‘African Renaissance’, with its evocative call for the reclamation of a neglected and disrespected African heritage, has been influential. In this context, South Africa’s strong constitutional commitment not only to gender equality but also to non-racialism is understood as operating, at best, within a politics of multiculturalism in which each race group is associated with a particular (if fuzzily conceptualized) cultural complex and its own, culturally specific interpretation of gender equality. Multi-culturalism was a dominant strand within ANC thinking in the 1950s and 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0725513612470535">Walker 1991</xref>) and this approach has made a strong comeback since 1994, if, indeed, it ever went away. This understanding not only goes against contemporary theories of culture as ‘fluid, porous and contested’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0725513612470535">Benhabib 2002</xref>: 184) but, more pertinently, disregards the evidence of significant cultural hybridity and syncretism in South Africa’s own history.</p>
<p>Although ‘culture’ in this account is not an exclusively rural affair, there is a marked tendency to foreground South Africa’s rural areas as the locus of the specifically African culture that is being promoted, more particularly the former bantustans or native reserves where traditional leadership institutions continue to hold sway (thanks, in large part, to their role as petty functionaries of state in the apartheid years). Traditional leaders, i.e. chiefs, sub-chiefs and headmen, have capitalized on these developments to position themselves not as the discredited hangovers of apartheid’s policies of ‘decentralised despotism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0725513612470535">Mamdani 1996</xref>: 17), but as the legitimate custodians of the authentic, indigenous culture that is being reclaimed. While the more sophisticated proponents of this chiefly traditionalism are at pains to emphasize the compatibility of their vision with women’s rights (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0725513612470535">Holomisa 2012</xref>), for most traditionalists the proper gender order is one in which women have a clearly prescribed role within their families and communities, and defer to male authority within a hierarchy of male-dominated institutions. A vivid example is the description of ‘our own system of justice administration’ on the official website of the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa (CONTRALESA):</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It begins at home where the child shows respect for the mother, the mother for the husband, the husband for the traditional leader and the traditional leader for the ancestors who intercede for us to the Creator … In practice what this means is that the court of first instance is the family, whose presiding officer is the father of the house. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0725513612470535">CONTRALESA 2012</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The account goes on to describe a hierarchy of courts, at the apex of which is ‘the court of the tribe’ where ‘Inkosi, the head of the tribe, presides’; in this role ‘he is assisted by the headmen who are in charge of the administrative areas falling within his area of rule’ (CONTRALESA 2012).</p>
<p>Given space constraints, the following account of this complex set of issues is inevitably somewhat synoptic. I begin with a brief summary of the constitutional framework that was put in place around gender equality and cultural rights in the mid-1990s. I then consider the contradictory data on the position of women in contemporary South Africa and the failure of the ANC to provide effective leadership in promoting gender equality in social practice. Thereafter I reflect on the ANC’s ‘turn to tradition’ and the challenges this policy-political choice has encountered, particularly although not exclusively because of its disregard for the principle of gender equality.</p>
<p>What I need to make clear is that I am not posing the conflict between gender equality and cultural rights as a contest between a ‘non-traditional’ sphere in which women enjoy secure rights on the one hand, and an irredeemably patriarchal ‘traditional’ sphere on the other. As my discussion of contemporary gender relations makes clear, women face serious disadvantages as women across all sectors of society. I am also not claiming that ‘traditional’, more precisely pre-colonial, society was particularly oppressive to women. There is a substantial historiography debunking this assumption, as well as documenting the role of colonial and apartheid institutions in shaping customary law in ways that actively disadvantaged black women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0725513612470535">Bozzoli 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0725513612470535">Cousins 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0725513612470535">Simons 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0725513612470535">Walker 1990</xref>). There is also a body of work exploring the contestations around ‘living’ customary law in the present, including its capacity to realign itself with changing gender norms (see especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0725513612470535">Claassens and Mnisi 2011</xref>). Rather, I am taking issue with the rise of a particular construction of ‘African culture’ in contemporary politics: one which reduces it to a narrative of idealized, timeless tradition, and further reduces that to a set of values and practices falling under the custodianship of traditional leaders who are, properly and by the very nature of things, men.</p>

<title>The constitutional framework of the mid-1990s</title>
<p>The contestation between the recognition of women’s rights and the status of traditional institutions emerged as an important albeit somewhat peripheral concern in the constitutional negotiations that culminated in the adoption of South Africa’s ‘final’ Constitution in 1996.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0725513612470535">3</xref>
</sup> In summary, this tussle saw the newly formed Women’s National Coalition (WNC), in which the ANC Women’s League (ANCWL) played a leading role, stave off a determined push from traditional leaders to insulate customary law against the principle of gender equality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0725513612470535">Albertyn 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0725513612470535">Hassim 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0725513612470535">Walker 2005</xref>). Traditional leaders were particularly concerned about the specification of gender as one of the grounds on which discrimination would be prohibited in the proposed ‘equality clause’; in the memorable words of one prominent spokesman for the traditional leadership lobby: ‘We are in Africa and we remain in Africa. We are not prepared to give up our Africanism. … Who must <italic>lobola</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0725513612470535">4</xref>
</sup> for whom if we are all equal?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0725513612470535">IDASA 1993</xref>: 5).</p>
<p>In the early 1990s many anti-apartheid activists regarded traditional leaders as outside the mainstream of progressive politics, a suspect legacy of the apartheid state’s failed ethnic project, whose powers would have to be curtailed in the interests of rural democracy and development. However, the institution of traditional leadership had already been given a new respectability by the formation of CONTRALESA in 1987, within the fold of the ANC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0725513612470535">Ntsebeza 2005</xref>: 262–6). In the mid-1990s appeasing the traditional leadership lobby also had a pragmatic appeal for the ANC, given the deadly civil war then ravaging the province of KwaZulu-Natal, where the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) enjoyed a strong rural support base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0725513612470535">Marais 2011</xref>: 72–3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0725513612470535">Waetjen 2004</xref>). At the same time, the issue of women’s rights was not a primary concern for the male-dominated political parties at the constitutional negotiations. Indeed, it was only after women activists had made a concerted fuss about the gender imbalances that steps were taken to boost women’s presence in party delegations and the Technical Committees supporting the talks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0725513612470535">Albertyn 1994</xref>). These dynamics gave the chiefly lobby some room in which to manoeuvre during the negotiations.</p>
<p>In the event, the women’s lobby prevailed. The 1993 Constitution placed equality for ‘every person’ as the first of the Fundamental Rights that it guaranteed, with gender, sex and culture all specified as grounds on which discrimination would henceforth be unlawful:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>No person shall be unfairly discriminated against, directly or indirectly … on one or more of the following grounds in particular: race, gender, sex, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture or language. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0725513612470535">RSA 1993</xref>: Section 8(2))</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Further lobbying by the WNC and ANCWL resulted in the Constitution of 1996 confirming the principle of gender equality as a non-negotiable right that could not be trumped by appeals to culture (or, indeed, any other right). It also expanded the list of grounds on which discrimination was specifically prohibited, to include not only gender and sex, as in 1993, but pregnancy and marital status as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0725513612470535">RSA 1996</xref>: Section 9(3)). What all this meant for customary law constitutionally, the primary concern of traditional leaders, was that where there was a clash, custom would have to be brought into alignment with the principle of gender equality.</p>
<p>Traditional institutions themselves received only cursory recognition in the 1993 constitution. There was no reference to them in the chapter on local government, indicating that at that stage they were not considered for a substantive role in this domain. Chapter 11 recognized traditional authorities, subject to future legislation, and also made provision for both provincial Houses of Traditional Leaders and a National Council with advisory functions on matters ‘pertaining to traditional authorities, indigenous law or the traditions and customs of traditional communities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0725513612470535">RSA 1993</xref>: section 184(4)(a)). Probably of greater significance for their future status, traditional leaders were rather more successful in lobbying for recognition in the schedule of binding constitutional principles which the drafters of the final Constitution would be required to honour:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The institution, status and role of traditional leadership, according to indigenous law, shall be recognised and protected in the Constitution. Indigenous law, like common law, shall be recognised and applied in the courts, subject to the fundamental rights contained in the Constitution and to legislation dealing specifically therewith. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0725513612470535">RSA 1993</xref>: Schedule 4, Principle XIII)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The 1996 Constitution honoured this provision but made it clear that the right to cultural rights was over-ruled by the equality clause. It also refrained from spelling out the role of traditional institutions in any detail. Thus the Bill of Rights (chapter 2) provides, <italic>inter alia</italic>, for equality before the law for all, the right of ‘everyone’ ‘to participate in the cultural life of their choice’ but not ‘in a manner inconsistent with any provision in the Bill of Rights’; it also provides for the right of people to ‘enjoy their culture, practice their religion and use their language’ but, again, not in a manner inconsistent with the Bill of Rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0725513612470535">RSA 1996</xref>: sections 9, 30, 31). Chapter 12 provides for the recognition of traditional leaders, ‘according to customary law’, but is vague on their actual role, stating merely that national legislation ‘may’ define these roles further, as well as provide for the establishment of national and provincial structures to represent their views. The absence of an unambiguous requirement that such legislation had to be forthcoming was interpreted by CONTRALESA to mean that their campaign to strengthen the role of traditional leaders had lost ground (CONTRALESA 2012), a view borne out by constitutional analysts. Thus Klug has described the 1996 constitutional provisions on traditional leaders as amounting to a downgrading of the provisions of the 1993 Constitution: ‘In effect this removed the constitutional mandate and threw the question of the role of traditional leaders back into the political arena’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0725513612470535">Klug 2000</xref>: 121).</p>

<sec id="section3-0725513612470535">
<title>Gender policy and the changing position of women since 1994</title>
<p>In 1996 gender activists were reasonably optimistic that the adoption of the equality clause had laid the foundations for the development of a progressive realization of women’s rights under the leadership of the ANC. Since those heady days, however, concern has mounted at the yawning gap between the country’s lofty constitutional commitments and policy affirmations around gender equality on the one hand, and the many sorry indicators of women’s continued embattled social standing on the other. The gap between policy and practice is a familiar one – Nancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0725513612470535">Fraser (2009</xref>: 98) has noted how, around the world, ‘on the one hand, feminist ideals of gender equality, so contentious in the preceding decades, now sit squarely in the social mainstream; on the other hand, they have yet to be realised in practice’. The disjuncture between public endorsements of gender equality and actual institutional practices is, however, particularly poignant in South Africa, in part because many of the indicators of policy failure are so stark, but also because of the scale of expectations vested in the ANC electoral victory in 1994. The disappointment in how far society has not come, among so many who celebrated the transition to formal democracy, runs deep.</p>
<p>The evidence for the persistence of gender inequality after 1994 is certainly disheartening, as various indicators in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0725513612470535">Table 1</xref> underscore. The data on gender-based violence, HIV prevalence, and child and maternal mortality constitute a particularly severe indictment of the ANC government’s commitment to rooting out gender inequality in South Africa since 1994.</p>

<p>Levels of sexual and domestic violence perpetrated by men against women are disturbingly high – amongst the highest, if not the highest, for countries where such records are kept.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0725513612470535">5</xref>
</sup> The problem may be more fully reported than it was under apartheid, but it is hard to claim the situation is getting better. A recent overview by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0725513612470535">Jewkes and Morrell (2010</xref>: 2) summarizes the position as follows:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The society is strongly patriarchal, and violence against women is widespread. South Africa’s rate of rape has been found to be the highest of any INTERPOL member country, with more than 55,000 rapes reported to the police annually. Intimate partner violence is also common. Research has found that between 25% and 55% of women have experienced physical intimate partner violence and the rate of female homicide by an intimate partner is six times the global average. In interviews, 42% of men disclose perpetration of intimate partner violence and 28% disclose rape of a woman or girl.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As is well documented, South Africa has the highest number of people living with HIV in the world, with women, especially women of child-bearing age, disproportionately affected. ANC denialism on the science of AIDS in the first decade of democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0725513612470535">Nattrass 2012</xref>), coupled with the predatory male sexual behaviour described above, are deeply implicated in the escalation of the pandemic. Linked to this, the country’s adult, maternal and child (under-5) mortality figures reflect a public health system in crisis. The mortality rates have got worse, not better, since 1994, although the long-delayed expansion of an antiretroviral treatment programme for HIV-positive people is finally beginning to show signs of turning the decline around. More familiar in global terms, South African women are over-represented among the country’s poor and unemployed. Thus in 2002 Ingrid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0725513612470535">Woolard (2002</xref>: 3) noted that male-headed households had a 28 per cent probability of being poor, compared to a 48 per cent chance for households headed formally by women and a 53 per cent chance for households headed <italic>de facto </italic>by women.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0725513612470535">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The report card on the status of women since 1994 is not, however, all negative. In keeping with the ANC’s commitment to quotas and targets to boost the representation of women, there has been an impressive gain in women’s participation in public life. By 2009, 44 per cent of parliamentarians were women, up from 25 per cent in 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0725513612470535">RSA 2010b</xref>: 57). A series of laws designed to improve women’s standing have been placed on the statute books, although enforcement remains a serious problem. Examples include broadly progressive legislation on abortion (1996), domestic violence (1998) and customary marriage (1998). The substantial expansion of a national programme of social grants since 1994, notably the Child Support Grant that goes to the caregivers of poor children, is also credited both with making a noticeable dent in absolute poverty and with giving women (who are, overwhelmingly, the caregivers) greater authority in domestic decision-making around finances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0725513612470535">Patel et al. 2012</xref>). Girls’ participation in schooling is on a par or even slightly higher than that of boys and the ‘use of modern contraceptive methods by sexually active women’ shows a slow increase, from a reported 61.2 per cent in 1998 to 64.6 per cent in 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0725513612470535">RSA 2010b</xref>: 46, 67). Women’s rights to inherit property, notably houses, have been legally promoted by various court decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0725513612470535">Albertyn 2005</xref>) while on the ground increasing numbers of single women are negotiating access to communal land within their communities, albeit with considerable regional variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0725513612470535">Claassens and Mnisi 2011</xref>). While there has been mounting criticism of the poor performance of the Commission for Gender Equality (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0725513612470535">Meintjes 2005</xref>), there is a an active network of NGOs and other civil society organizations working on the issues of women’s rights and gender issues more broadly. Mobilization around particular issues can be vigorous, as was seen during the 2012 parliamentary hearings on the Traditional Courts Bill (discussed below). Men are increasingly visible in many of these campaigns.</p>
<p>Declining marriage rates nationally, along with the upward trend in the proportion of female-centred households, provide further evidence that a complex reconfiguration of power relations between men and women is under way in the domestic sphere. While it is important to recognize the significant regional and cultural variations in the institution of marriage,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0725513612470535">7</xref>
</sup> the available data points to an overall decline in national marriage rates. In a recent article Posel et al. summarize the data on marriage rates from 1995–2008 to conclude that, while marriage rates have fallen among both black and white women, ‘the decline has been far greater, in both absolute and relative terms, among African women than among white women’; by 2008 ‘only 24% of all African women aged 20 to 45 were married, compared to 67% of white women in this same age category’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0725513612470535">2011</xref>: 104). Co-habitation rates among African women are, furthermore, ‘still low relative to the proportion of women who are unmarried, suggesting also that for many African women, cohabitation may not be an acceptable or possible alternative to marriage’ (2011: 104).</p>
<p>These shifts mean that increasing numbers of women, children and youths are living in households in which senior men, i.e. men in positions of authority as husbands, fathers, intimate partners or other patriarchal figures, are not a permanent presence. This development can be interpreted in different ways. One is that it indicates greater autonomy and growing freedom of choice about living arrangements for women. A related interpretation is that it reflects mounting disillusionment among women about men’s willingness to provide emotional and economic support, leading to a greater circumspection about entering long-term relationships. On the flip side, the changes in marriage patterns can be seen as less a consequence of active choices by women than evidence of a serious abdication of responsibility for stable relationships with women and their children on the part of men.</p>
<p>There is also evidence of a backlash on the part of many men, angered by what they see as the usurpation of their formerly unquestioned domestic authority; this could go some way to accounting for the disturbingly high levels of gender-based violence. A recent study of male perceptions of changing gender relations in six provinces gives credence to this point. The authors quote one male respondent, whose views were not considered exceptional in the study, as follows:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Men have a tendency of saying ‘I paid for <italic>lobola</italic> for you to cook here for me … If now you are saying that you are not going to do this, this is not clear. I have paid for you, so I am hungry now, I want food.’ And if she insists that ‘I am tired, I am not comfortable to cook today,’ that’s where the beating, the violence will start from. But the problem, you see, is … the way they approach their rights – women and children – it’s not appropriate … The problem is the approach of … demanding, saying, ‘this is my right, I’m not going to do a, b, c, d.’ If that could change then it could be better. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0725513612470535">Dworkin et al. 2012</xref>: 107)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The authors note that while there were men in their study who ‘embraced a shift toward more equity’ in their relationships with women, these views provoked ‘boisterous and contentious’ discussions, during which their advocates were accused of being ‘soft’ or ‘controlled’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0725513612470535">Dworkin et al. 2012</xref>: 108). The study also found a powerful nostalgia for a past when relationships between men and women were imagined to have been more clearly defined, more stable, and more harmonious (and, of course, more comfortable for men). A number of respondents (all of whom were male) explained violence against women as ‘the product of recent changes in gender relations catalyzed by rights discourse’:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In the process of making this argument, the ‘past’ was typically invoked as a time when gender relations at home, at work or in the public sphere were in better balance and violence was not necessary. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0725513612470535">Dworkin et al. 2012</xref>: 111)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this context of major insecurity around the gender order – and the moral health of society more generally – the political leadership of the ANC is important for giving content to what gender equality should mean in daily life. This is not only because of its electoral dominance but because, as a ‘broad-church’ party of liberation, it is influential across different social spheres (labour, religious, educational, etc.), and still resonant with political and moral authority for many South Africans. Its gender-specific policies obviously carry some weight, as do its public pronouncements on pressing social issues such as gender-based violence and the manner in which it integrates gender awareness into general government programmes, including rural local government and land reform. However, probably of greater significance in influencing gender attitudes in society is the practical example that its political leaders provide, both in their official capacities and in their personal lives. Here the confident expression of both implicitly and explicitly patriarchal values by leading figures in the organization has been of major concern to feminists and gender activists.</p>
<p>The next section addresses these issues, looking in particular at the resurgence of traditionalist values within the organization from the late 1990s, particularly under President Zuma, and the opposition this has provoked within civil society.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0725513612470535">
<title>The ANC’s turn to tradition</title>
<p>In a 2005 assessment of the attention to gender in the post-apartheid land reform programme, I concluded that in its first term in government (1995–2000) the ANC had been largely successful in treating ‘women’ and ‘chiefs’ as two distinct policy constituencies that could be dealt with in relative isolation from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0725513612470535">Walker 2005</xref>: 300). In this time the ANC government avoided clarifying its position on the place of traditional institutions in a democracy. It delayed defining the role of traditional leaders in rural local government until after the local government elections of 1999 and prevaricated on the thorny issue of tenure reform in the former bantustans, although it did offer major concessions to traditional leaders in KwaZulu-Natal – notably, accepting a deal initially brokered by the apartheid government, that vested ownership of communal lands in that province in a Trust (the <italic>Ingonyama</italic> Trust) under the Zulu king. By the early 2000s, however, as the focus of government shifted from broad policy development to the demands of programme implementation, the ANC was finding it increasingly difficult to manage ‘gender’ and ‘culture’ as two separate policy streams and thereby minimize the tensions between its competing commitments in these areas.</p>
<p>By then it was clear that, far from traditional institutions fading away after 1994, they were gaining in stature and resources in ways that went well beyond the minimum provided for under the 1993 and 1996 Constitutions. A more confident assertion of ‘tradition’ as the core of indigenous culture was increasingly visible in political debate from the late 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0725513612470535">Oomen 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0725513612470535">Ntsebeza 2005</xref>). This articulation acquired an unexpected intellectual gloss during the Mbeki presidency, through a particular appropriation of his call for an African Renaissance in South Africa and the continent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0725513612470535">8</xref>
</sup> Although Mbeki’s vision of an African Renaissance had a strongly modernizing thrust in terms of its reformist political and economic agenda, it also carried a deeply romantic message about Africa’s golden past before the ravages of colonialism. This strand lent itself to more unabashedly essentialist reconstructions of that heritage. Oomen describes the idea of the Renaissance as an ‘empty vessel’ that appealed to traditionalists and modernists alike but was most deftly appropriated by traditional leaders, ‘in another impressive exercise of redefinition’ that positioned themselves as at the forefront of the quest to restore ‘African norms and values’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0725513612470535">Oomen 2005</xref>: 109). Less commonly remarked was that this agenda was unselfconsciously gender-blind. Msimang notes that the African Renaissance was a philosophy with ‘one item on its agenda, the reclamation of the humanity of Africans’, but that this was construed in a way that rendered women invisible:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In this project of reclaiming African history, women are left out of the picture. More importantly, analyses of the historical gendered realities of the lives of African women and men – both before and during colonialism – either remain unwritten or sit at the periphery, and don’t qualify as ‘real history’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0725513612470535">Msimang 2000</xref>: 74–5)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The influence of these emerging currents on land policy first became apparent in late 1999, after Mbeki had succeeded Mandela as President and appointed Thoko Didiza as the new Minister of Land Affairs. One of her first actions was to suspend work on a draft Land Rights Bill that had aimed at retaining nominal ownership of communal land with the state, while recognizing the underlying land rights of those who actually lived on and used the land (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0725513612470535">Cousins 2008</xref>). In early 2000 Minister Didiza issued a policy statement that made it clear that traditional institutions were being repositioned to play a key role in managing these areas: henceforth, it was noted, tenure reform should build on ‘existing local institutions and structures’, in part to keep costs down but also to ensure ‘local commitment and support’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0725513612470535">Walker 2005</xref>: 311). This statement was followed in 2001 by draft principles on communal tenure that proposed recognizing traditional leaders as the owners of communal land; revealingly, at that stage gender equality was not one of the seven principles that were identified as significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0725513612470535">Walker 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>These developments led to a ‘flurry of protest among land-rights NGOs’, in which concerns about women’s land rights featured prominently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0725513612470535">Walker 2005</xref>: 311). The ANC’s determination to resurrect traditional institutions was confirmed with the promulgation of the Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Act (TLGFA) in 2003 and the Communal Land Rights Act (CLRA) in 2004. These laws were an attempt to resolve the mounting problems of poor local government and contested land rights in rural areas by confirming traditional institutions as the primary locus of authority over what were now regularly characterized as ‘traditional communities’ – in effect, as many commentators have noted, to repackage apartheid-era tribal authorities as an unrepresentative fourth tier of government in the name of culture and tradition. Thus the TLGFA recognizes traditional councils as the body responsible for ‘administering the affairs’ of ‘traditional communities’, ‘in accordance with customs and traditions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0725513612470535">RSA 2003</xref>: clause 4). Traditional communities are, in turn, defined as communities that are ‘subject to a system of traditional leadership’ and ‘observe(s) a system of customary law’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0725513612470535">RSA 2003</xref>: clause 2); authority to determine which communities meet these criteria falls to the relevant provincial premier. At the same time, in an attempt to deflect criticisms concerning the undemocratic and patriarchal nature of these institutions, some highly circumscribed concessions were introduced to make the councils more representative. These stipulated that 40 per cent of councillors should be elected and ‘at least a third’ should be women, the latter further qualified by a provision allowing for a ‘lower threshold’ if women failed to participate in sufficient numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0725513612470535">RSA 2003</xref>: clause 3). The CLRA built on this foundation, providing for the transfer of land ownership from the state to ‘traditional communities’ under the overall authority of the traditional leader and his institutions. While community members would be able to convert what were described as ‘old order rights’ into registered ‘new order rights’ (which did not constitute full ownership), the overarching power to administer and make determinations around communal land was allocated to ‘land administration committees’ which in most cases would be constituted by the traditional councils already set up in terms of the TLGFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0725513612470535">RSA 2004</xref>: clause 24, 18).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0725513612470535">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The enactment of the CLRA encountered strong opposition within civil society, with its failure to both recognize and advance women’s customary land rights of particular concern. Parliament’s Joint Monitoring Committee on the Status of Women and the ANC Women’s Caucus added their voices to this critique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0725513612470535">Cousins and Claassens 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0725513612470535">Walker 2005</xref>). Once again the ANC showed its sensitivity to such criticisms, amending the draft bill to strengthen general references to women’s rights in the preamble and to provide for the registration of joint land rights by married spouses. Significantly, however, the rights of single women were ignored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0725513612470535">Cousins and Claassens 2004</xref>). These largely cosmetic adjustments failed to appease the critics, leading to a constitutional court challenge by four rural communities and their NGO allies which eventually, in 2010, resulted in the CLRA being declared unconstitutional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0725513612470535">Legal Resources Centre 2010a</xref>). Although the constitutional court judgment rested on a technical argument, the case raised both technical and substantive concerns. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0725513612470535">Legal Resources Centre (2010b</xref>), which represented the litigants, the communities argued that the Act ‘undermines security of tenure, undermines gender equality, and grants authority to traditional leaders who have not been elected and whose interests do not reflect those of the communities’.</p>
<p>The political decision to place traditional institutions at the forefront of local government and development in the communal areas has acquired fresh momentum under President Zuma, who replaced Mbeki as president of the ANC in 2007 and as State President in 2009. Unlike the modernizing Mbeki, Zuma is a traditionalist in terms of background and inclination. There is a growing literature on him as a conservative patriarch who has been able to mobilize popular support for himself as a humble ‘man of the people’ but has also set back the struggle for gender equality with his sexual indiscretions, his polygamous marriages and his projection of a particular interpretation of traditional masculinity into political debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0725513612470535">Hassim 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0725513612470535">Robins 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0725513612470535">Suttner 2007</xref>). These features were all on display in his ultimately successful defence against the charge of rape in 2005–6. According to Suttner:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The mode of defence mounted by Zuma, his actions publicly outside and inside the courtroom, the meeting of minds between Zuma and the judge and the complicity of the prosecution in accepting Zuma’s version of Zulu culture and its implications, all combined to undermine hard-won gains in gender equality. (2007: 6)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Robins describes Zuma’s performance of ‘Zulu traditional masculinity’ in this trial as an enactment of the role of a ‘tribal elder-cum-liberation struggle icon … for consumption by both the court and the broader citizenry’; in deliberately invoking certain cultural idioms in explaining his sexual behaviour towards his accuser, Zuma ‘sought to valorise traditional Zulu masculinity and thereby normalise and redeem his sexual behaviour’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0725513612470535">Robins 2008</xref>: 154). Hassim concurs with this analysis, but points also to the presence of muted counter-narratives, including among young black male commentators who argued that ‘young black people should have the cultural confidence to discard practise that they find offensive or outdated’ and criticized Zuma for presenting himself as ‘an uncritical conduit of tradition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0725513612470535">Hassim 2009</xref>: 72, citing Ratele and Peacock &amp; Khumalo).</p>
<p>While academic and popular debates on the politics of culture, race and gender have ebbed and flowed during the Zuma presidency, the institution of traditional leadership has been further consolidated. By mid-2011 the state recognized a total of 7771 traditional leaders: ‘12 Kings; 1 Principal traditional leader; 882 Senior traditional leaders; and 6876 Headmen/women’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0725513612470535">DTA 2011</xref>: 22). In 2008 the establishment of a separate Department of Traditional Affairs was approved within the Ministry of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, followed by the promulgation of the National House of Traditional Leaders Act in 2009. The decision to create a separate department was justified on the grounds that ‘strengthening institutions of traditional leadership and building the capacity of traditional leadership has been a key element in our efforts over the years to improve the South African governance system and the quality of life for traditional communities’. Furthermore:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The central role of Traditional Leadership to rural development is now better appreciated together with the need to position the institution of Traditional Leadership to partner with Government to accelerate development. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0725513612470535">DCGTA 2009</xref>: 32)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To date the ANC’s most controversial initiative to entrench traditional leaders in communal areas has been its attempt to drive the Traditional Courts Bill through Parliament in 2012. This bill was first published in 2008, then withdrawn but re-released for public comment in late 2011. It seeks to ‘affirm the recognition of the traditional justice system’, in line with ‘constitutional imperatives and values’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0725513612470535">RSA 2012</xref>: preamble), by recognizing traditional courts as part of the country’s legal system. While there is considerable support for the potential of community-level forums to serve as local dispute-resolution institutions, within the ambit of ‘living customary law’, the content of the bill has provoked even stronger critique than the CLRA across a wide spectrum of society. Concerns have focused on the extent of the powers vested in traditional leaders as presiding officers, the absence of provisions allowing rural people to opt out of the traditional court system, and the failure to recognize the particular disadvantages that women face in these institutions and to protect their interests. Once again the issue of gender equality has featured prominently in the opposition to the bill, with both the Minister for Women, Children and People with Disabilities and the Minister for Justice reportedly ‘conceding that the Bill fails to protect the gains made by women over the last 20 years’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0725513612470535">Alliance for Rural Democracy 2012</xref>). As of mid-2012, the future of the bill was uncertain, with four provinces in the National Council of Provinces calling for its withdrawal in June 2012.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0725513612470535">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>While the focus on traditional institutions may appear at first glance to be of little concern for the urban mainstream, the wider ramifications of the developments described above are significant. The ‘turn to tradition’ that has become increasingly visible in South African politics after 1999 undermines not only the principled commitment to gender equality that was made in 1993, but the project of democracy and equality for all citizens more generally. It is a deeply undemocratic development, inasmuch as it is consolidating the powers of a petty aristocracy of hereditary chiefs and appointed headmen over the lives of rural people and perpetuating the status of former bantustan districts as segregated, second-class spaces. These developments are impacting directly on the rights of the 30 per cent of the total population who live in those areas now designated ‘traditional communities’, undermining their rights to equality, to unfettered access to the country’s justice system, and to secure tenure. These threats are particularly severe in the case of women who, because of the history of the bantustans as labour reserves, make up well over half the population in these areas – a statistic that also means that in the mid-2000s, a little under half of all African women lived in former bantustan districts. The patriarchal cultural politics that have encouraged and shaped these developments are also percolating through the wider society.</p>
<p>At the same time, the principle of gender equality and women’s rights – which at its most assertive involves claims to rights for women as individuals, not simply to representation as a social group – has featured prominently in the opposition that has emerged to these developments. This has provided a particularly effective challenge to the authoritarian construction of culture that is currently being espoused in the name of a particular interpretation of tradition. Given the respectability that is now firmly attached to the ANC’s formal endorsement of women’s empowerment as a fundamental value in the post-apartheid era, the organization has found it difficult to ignore criticisms of its policies that are couched in the language of gender equality. As noted above, these criticisms are not only external to the organization but have been voiced internally as well, including by senior female members.</p>
<p>As a result of the mobilization of women’s organizations, the constitutional negotiations of the mid-1990s produced an outcome in which the right to gender equality was elevated above the right to practise one’s culture. Although the realization of these ideals has proved difficult to engineer – as in other parts of the world, what gender equality means in practice remains a difficult and contested issue at all levels of society – a significant reconfiguration of gender relations in the direction of greater autonomy for women is under way. At the same time, the struggle to realize gender equality has become an important dimension of a broader struggle to ensure that the ideals of democracy are extended to rural South Africa. In this respect the principle of gender equality has emerged as an important line of defence against not only ‘decentralized despotism’ but against what could be characterized as creeping ‘centralized despotism’ in post-apartheid South Africa as well.</p>
