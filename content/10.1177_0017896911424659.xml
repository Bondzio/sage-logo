<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As elsewhere, population levels of overweight and obesity in Australia are high and of growing concern. It is estimated that 62% of adults and 25% of children are currently overweight or obese.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911424659">1</xref></sup> Governments around the world have been struggling with appropriate policy responses to the obesity crisis. While there have been some efforts at upstream interventions designed to alter the environment to become less obesogenic, most emphasis has been placed on encouraging people to take greater personal responsibility for their weight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896911424659">2</xref></sup> As a result, there have been few policies that have specifically regulated around factors relating to diet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896911424659">3</xref></sup> However, schools are recognized as an environment that is conducive to improvements in food provision and nutrition education.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896911424659">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896911424659">5</xref></sup> In addition, food labelling has come under scrutiny as a potential means of facilitating better dietary choices. In particular, front-of-pack labelling has been proposed as a relatively simple and cost-effective means of providing people with key nutrition information at the point of sale and/or point of consumption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911424659">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>One front-of-pack labelling approach is the multiple traffic light system that features red, amber, and green ‘lights’ that indicate the levels of key nutrients present in the food. These nutrients are typically total fat, saturated fat, sugar, and salt.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911424659">7</xref></sup> By providing an interpretive function based on a threshold system that determines whether a product meets certain criteria across nutrient categories, the traffic light system is designed to allow consumers to quickly ascertain the relative healthiness of a product.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911424659">8</xref></sup> Interpretative front-of-pack labelling, such as the traffic light system, is of value because many consumers lack the skills and time needed to perform the quite complex cognitive processing required to understand other forms of labelling (e.g. nutrition information panels).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911424659">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911424659">10</xref></sup> The traffic light system has been found to be more effective than other approaches in improving nutrition comprehension for consumers of lower income and education levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911424659">11</xref></sup> This is important because those of lower socioeconomic status suffer from greater health inequities and higher levels of overweight and obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911424659">12</xref></sup> In addition, grocery shopping is typically a time-poor situation; it is estimated that shoppers spend between four and 10 seconds when selecting products at a supermarket.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896911424659">13</xref></sup> This makes it essential for information to be assimilated quickly and effectively in a very short space of time, an outcome that is more feasible when interpretive information is available.</p>
<p>Despite considerable support for the traffic light labelling system in the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911424659">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911424659">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911424659">11</xref></sup> governments around the world have been reluctant to implement such a policy in retail contexts because of strong opposition from the food industry. When considering the competing forms of front-of-pack labelling for policy implementation purposes, government officials in the European Union were faced with a €1 billion campaign from the food industry in an attempt to prevent a decision in favour of traffic lights.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911424659">14</xref></sup> As popularity with the electorate is an important determinant of those health policies that are ultimately implemented,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911424659">15</xref></sup> to withstand such concerted and well-funded industry opposition, governments need to be assured that the community will support traffic light labelling. A further consideration is likely to be the extent to which a proposed policy has the potential to operate synergistically with other efforts to combat overweight and obesity. In the case of traffic light labelling, one such synergistic outcome could be the ability for broader educative strategies to be based on the traffic light principle.</p>
<p>Almost all assessments of the traffic light food labelling system have been experimental, with little in the way of ‘real world’ applications that can be used to evaluate the efficacy of the system over an extended period of time. Similarly, health policies relating to obesity do not appear to have been routinely evaluated for their potential to be extended into contexts other than those for which they were originally developed. In Australia, several states have implemented school food policies in recent years in an effort to combat childhood obesity by improving children’s diets at school. Applying to government schools, these policies include, among other aspects, the traffic light system of food categorization for foods sold in the canteen. Some states have also introduced similar policies in hospitals and other health facilities, and voluntary traffic light programmes are operating in some sporting clubs and venues.</p>
<p>The Western Australian Healthy Food and Drink Policy was introduced in public schools in 2007. It requires that at least 60% of canteen menu items are those in the ‘green’ category and that all foods classified as ‘red’ (those high in sugar, fat, and/or salt) are removed from sale. At the time of introduction, information materials relating to the policy were disseminated to school staff and parents. School stakeholders were advised of the various elements of the policy and how they should be implemented at school level, while parents received information outlining the changes and how they would impact the foods offered for sale on school premises. The parent information materials were colourful pamphlets that provided general and specific examples of foods in each of the three traffic light categories. Parents were encouraged to discuss the traffic light system with their children, and no separate materials were developed for children.</p>
<p>An evaluation of the policy was conducted approximately 18 months after its introduction to assess key stakeholders’ perceptions of its effectiveness. The results give some indication of the likely level of acceptance and adoption of the system in the community if the traffic light food categorization system were to be introduced in other contexts in the future. The results also provide insights into potential policy extensions involving education programmes for parents and children.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section9-0017896911424659">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The study participants included parents who had children attending government schools for at least three years to ensure they had experienced both the pre- and post-policy environments. Parents are often closely involved in either ordering their children’s food or negotiating with children about the foods that will be purchased at the school canteen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896911424659">16</xref></sup> Other groups involved in the study were school principals, teachers, canteen managers, and parents and citizens (P&amp;C) committee representatives. These four groups were collectively termed school-based stakeholders. P&amp;C representatives were included in the sample because in most instances school canteens in Australia are operated by P&amp;C committees. The inclusion of all five stakeholder groups reflects a growing appreciation of the need to consult those who are responsible for implementing policies and those who are affected by policy outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896911424659">17</xref></sup> Few evaluations of health policies implemented in schools have incorporated such a wide range of stakeholders.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0017896911424659">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>An initial qualitative phase involved six focus groups with 32 parents and interviews with 48 school-based stakeholders from 10 schools of varying demographic profiles. The focus group participants and interviewees discussed the various components of the policy and their perceptions of the appropriateness and effectiveness of each component. The findings were used in conjunction with the relevant literature to develop five questionnaires that were subsequently administered by telephone (parents) and the web (school-based stakeholders). A telephone survey was used with parents to ensure proportional access to those of low, medium, and high socioeconomic status. Quotas were used to achieve a sample comprised of equal number of families with children in primary and secondary school and those residing in metropolitan and country areas. To access the school-based stakeholders, principals (<italic>n</italic> = 699) were contacted by email and asked to complete the survey themselves and to provide the web link to two teachers in the school, the canteen manager, and the P&amp;C committee president.</p>
<p>The survey items were somewhat different for each stakeholder group, reflecting their areas of experience and expertise, but many items were standard across the surveys and related to a wide range of variables including canteen operation information (e.g. opening hours), attitudes toward the different components of the policy, and perceptions of the educative potential of the policy. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 18. The results presented in the paper relate to the traffic light component of the policy and how it was perceived by members of the five stakeholders groups surveyed.</p>

<p>Overall, parents expressed very positive beliefs about the policy. More than three-quarters reported that the traffic light system used to classify the products sold in school canteens was easy to understand, with this belief significantly higher among women (<italic>p</italic> = .015). Just under half reported that their child talks about the traffic light system (44%) and around a quarter that it impacted their purchasing at the supermarket (24%). The latter outcome reflected comments made in the focus groups that the information provided to parents about the kinds of foods that are classified as red, amber, and green assisted them in evaluating the general healthiness of items sold in supermarkets. Those in metropolitan areas of the state were more likely to report that their children talked about the traffic light system than those in rural areas (<italic>p</italic> =.025), and use in the supermarket was greater amongst those aged younger than 45 years (<italic>p</italic> = .041).</p>
<p>With respect to transferring the traffic light system to grocery shopping contexts, 79% of parent respondents rated the inclusion of traffic light labelling on supermarket products as a good idea, with those younger than 45 years of age (<italic>p</italic> = .041), women (<italic>p</italic> = .000), and those from low and medium socioeconomic areas (<italic>p</italic> = .031) significantly more likely to share this view. Similarly, 84% of parents considered it a good idea for parents to be given information on how they could apply the traffic light system in their own homes, with those younger than 45 expressing most interest in this option (<italic>p</italic> = .029). Parents also saw potential to increase the benefits of the traffic light system within schools by active promotion of ‘green’ menu items: 88% rated providing school canteens with advertising materials to promote green menu items as a good idea.</p>
<p>Moderate correlations were apparent among some of the survey items relating to the traffic light system. Parents whose children talked about the traffic lights were more likely to apply the system to their supermarket purchases (<italic>r</italic> = .314), and parents who endorsed traffic light labelling in stores were also likely to support canteens being provided with advertising materials to promote ‘green’ menu items (<italic>r</italic> = .335) and parents being provided with information about how to apply the system at home (<italic>r</italic> = .335).</p>

<p>As was the case with parents, around three-quarters of these stakeholders (77%) reported that the traffic light system was easy to understand. P&amp;C representatives were significantly less likely than other stakeholders to share this view (<italic>p</italic> = .002). Just over a third of the school-based stakeholders (36%) reported that students had shown interest in the traffic light system. Principals and canteen managers were more likely than P&amp;C representatives and teachers to perceive children as interested.</p>
<p>As was the case with the parent respondents, the school-based stakeholders saw considerable potential to extend the traffic light system beyond the current application within schools. Around three-quarters (73%) were in favour of providing parents with further information about how the system was implemented in the canteen and almost two-thirds (63%) were in favour of giving information to parents about how the system could be applied in the family home. However, there was significant variation in relation to the latter, with a large majority of principals, teachers, and P&amp;C representatives sharing this view compared to only around half of canteen managers. As noted earlier, 84% of parent respondents wanted such information, indicating that canteen managers were less attuned to parents’ wishes in this instance.</p>
<p>Reflecting parents’ support for providing canteens with advertising materials to promote ‘green’ menu items, a substantial majority (76%) of the school-based stakeholders agreed that this would be beneficial. Teachers had the highest level of support at 85%, although the difference between teachers’ and other stakeholders’ level of agreement was not statistically significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The general agreement across stakeholder groups that the traffic light system of food categorization is easy to understand reflects previous research that has found it can effectively convey the healthiness of food products to consumers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911424659">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0017896911424659">18</xref></sup> This outcome, along with the finding that most parents would welcome the inclusion of traffic light labelling on products sold in supermarkets, and almost a quarter had spontaneously extended the system to their grocery shopping, suggests that governments could expect high levels of community support for future policies that implement traffic light labelling in other contexts.</p>
<p>The extension of the traffic light system to supermarkets and other food retailers would be consistent with calls to ensure policies implemented in schools are accompanied by parallel changes in other environments to avoid compensation across contexts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911424659">19</xref></sup> For example, in many instances children can purchase foods high in fat, sugar, and/or salt from stores on the way to or from school without any indication given to them of whether the foods would be classified as red, amber, or green.</p>
<p>Of note is that P&amp;C representatives, who are typically parents themselves, were significantly less likely than all other stakeholders, including parents, to perceive the traffic light system as easy to understand. This may be a result of the ultimate responsibility held by the P&amp;C committee for the selection of items included on the canteen menu. As such, they are likely to require a higher level of understanding than other stakeholders who are less directly involved in policy implementation. Given their non-health professional status, P&amp;C representatives may need to be considered as a special communications audience that requires more detailed information on the traffic light system and how it should be applied when developing a school canteen menu.</p>
<p>The results relating to children’s engagement with the traffic light system are encouraging. The focus of the traffic light system as introduced in the policy was to ensure products high in fat, sugar, and salt were removed from the menu. The traffic light system was not required to be incorporated into nutrition education programmes for students. As such, the primary communications audiences for the disseminated information materials were school-based stakeholders and parents, rather than children. Children’s interest in the traffic light system could be expected to be substantially higher if they were treated as a primary communications target and exposed to relevant information as part of their learning activities. Such efforts would be consistent with calls to directly link health promotion initiatives in schools with the curriculum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896911424659">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The age variations apparent in some of the parent data suggest that younger parents are likely to be particularly supportive of policy extensions involving translating the traffic light food categorization system to home and retail contexts. The results of the present study also suggest that lower socioeconomic families may be especially receptive to the availability of traffic light information in a greater number of food selection contexts. This reflects previous research that found that less affluent consumers are able to use traffic light labelling more effectively than other forms of front-of-pack labelling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911424659">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>To conclude, the introduction of the traffic light food categorization system into Western Australian government schools appears to be widely accepted among key stakeholders. Many of the parents surveyed were in favour of extending the traffic light system into other food choice contexts, and some had already spontaneously used the system to guide their supermarket shopping. There was wide support across all stakeholder groups for extension of the policy into the school curriculum and parent education programmes. Future research could explore children’s reactions to the traffic light system and compare parents’ responses to their body mass index measures to determine whether there are differences in acceptability according to this variable.</p>
