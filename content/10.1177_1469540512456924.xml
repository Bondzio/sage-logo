<abstract>
<p>This article explores the ways in which interpassivity, as conceptualized in the work of Robert Pfaller and Slavoj Žižek, can contribute to understanding the role of brands in today’s commodity form. Interpassivity, like interactivity, implies an active relationship between an actor and an external entity. Interpassivity, however, suggests that the actor is active <italic>in order to</italic> take on a passive role. As it is used here, it refers to a condition in which a consumer actively delegates her or his emotional expressions to a brand. The integration of brands in funerals is appealing given the abject nature of deathcare, the affective intensity of dealing with loss, and the increasingly rationalized role of the funeral industry in deathcare. Based on a multi-sited ethnography, the author discusses the ways in which brandscapes are becoming more widespread in funeral products and services and are even contributing to ‘themed’ funerals and funeral settings. The author argues that these developments are conducive to conditions of interpassivity and they further the ongoing colonization of capital into human emotion.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1469540512456924" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Interactive products have become a popular, value-added means to attract consumers. For example, mobile software applications, assorted forms of entertainment and recreation, augmented reality technologies, and industrial design, have all increasingly impacted how the consumer relates to a commodity. While adding to the varieties of novel experiences and allowing for vast options of consumer choice, these trends also heighten the labor of the consumer to the production process. Nigel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1469540512456924">Thrift (2006)</xref>, for instance, writes: ‘This stream of thought and practice has now blossomed into a set of fully fledged models of ‘co-creation’ that are changing corporate perceptions of what constitutes ‘production’, ‘consumption’, ‘commodity’, ‘the market’, and, indeed, ‘innovation’’ (2006: 282). Several contemporary scholars have examined the ways in which the line between consumption and production has become increasingly porous thanks in large part to companies that rely on the role of the consumer to take a more active part in the production process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469540512456924">Beer and Burrows, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1469540512456924">Comor, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469540512456924">Jurgenson and Ritzer, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>However, there is a converse side to what is now being called ‘prosumption’ and consumer interactivity, in general, and it is this other aspect that is the focus of the present article. Where interactivity implies increased involvement of the consumer, the concept of <italic>interpassivity</italic> as developed by Robert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469540512456924">Pfaller (2003)</xref> and Slavoj <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469540512456924">Žižek (1989)</xref>, reveals some of the caveats to this increased involvement. Interpassivity is a form of delegated passivity – one is active as a means to become a passive subject. Rather than being interactive, interpassivity is the condition whereby the emotional catharsis that may be available through consumptive activities is transferred to someone or something else.</p>
<p>In this article, I discuss the ways in which brands and branding can establish a state of interpassivity, even when those brands simultaneously provide the means for interactive consumer experiences. More specifically, I examine brands and branding as they are utilized by actors within the contemporary American funeral industry. This examination demonstrates the capacity of producers, especially ones not typically associated with creating interactive products, to explore the theoretical benefits of interpassivity to studies of consumerism and to critiques of late capitalism’s increasing colonization of quotidian life. The article is the result of extensive participant-observation that includes multiple sites (funeral homes, mortuary schools, trade shows, and memorial parks), more than 60 interviews with a wide range of individuals (including funeral directors and their staff, mortuary school students, teachers, and administrators, members of trade organizations and lobbies, consumer advocates, and industry entrepreneurs), and content analyses of trade literature and mortuary science texts.</p>
<p>Because one of the functions of brands is to append a narrative to a product or company, brands establish a discursive medium through which customers can relate or interact. In the funeral industry brands are increasingly relied upon to humanize the abject nature of deathcare as well as to thematize the funerary rituals used to celebrate the life of someone who has died. However, brands enable funeral consumers (like consumers more broadly) to delegate the difficult activities required in marking the death of a loved one to the brands themselves. As Johnsen and colleagues write, ‘[Interpassivity is] the act of leaving it to someone or something else to externalize emotions’ (2009: 206). Here I explore some of the possible ways that conditions for interpassivity are established through funeral brands and branding processes. In more general terms, this article examines how the concept of interpassivity reframes the conventional notion of interactivity in order to more fully comprehend the complexity of the consumer–product relationship. I begin with a brief description of the current state of the funeral industry’s hegemony over funerary ritual before turning to an elaboration on how interpassivity begins to intersect with funeral services and products. In subsequent sections I explore how funeral companies both brand themselves and incorporate more iconic mainstream brands into their products and services. Both processes of branding instantiate conditions for interpassivity and, in doing so, reinforce commodity fetishism. In revealing the surrogate and para-social relations that can be established through brands and branding, one may also see how interpassivity contributes to the perpetual circulation of capital.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1469540512456924"><title>Commercializing rites</title>
<p>Organizing a funeral for a loved one who has recently passed away can be one of the most difficult challenges in life. While the key function of a funeral is to dispose of the body, tradition mandates that the survivor also use the occasion to appropriately honor the lived life of the deceased. In normative terms, one expresses gratitude for the life of the deceased and sorrow around the termination of that life and does so in thoughtful, sincere, and respectful ways.</p>
<p>The intimacy of such an endeavor can be daunting because the expressive equipment furnished by the funeral provider (e.g. casket, chapel, musical accompaniment) is, to some degree, a proxy for the emotive intent of the survivor. Illouz writes: ‘[I]nasmuch as objects and experiences of consumption always bear the trace of social relationships that they signal and constitute – they should be viewed as nodal points around which converge a multiplicity of relationships between self and others’ (2009: 388). So, the items one purchases to construct a funeral can be viewed as extensions of a consumer’s relational ties between the survivor and the deceased. Funeral goods and services are symbolic tools that to some degree represent the emotional dimensions of a relationship in transition (from one that is lived to one that exists only in memory).</p>
<p>With funerals, one may generally experience a bewildering swirl of emotions that are complex and often messy. The funeral industry supplies ready-made consumables (e.g. the casket and urn) that are ostensibly meant to represent the traces of those emotions because they are typically purchased during periods of intense feelings shortly following the death. In terms of funerary ritual, consumers delegate a portion of their subjectivity to one or more of the commodities provided by the funeral industry – something that is undoubtedly linked to the acceleration of what Arlie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469540512456924">Hochschild (2012)</xref> refers to as the ‘outsourcing’ of everyday life.</p>
<p>However, because of the significance of such intense and intimate emotions, many people feel conflicted about the commercialization of funerary rites (Farrell, 1980;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469540512456924">Wernick, 1995</xref>). One of the ways in which the commodification of such intimate expression is bracketed is through the marketing of what funeral professionals refer to as personalization. The funeral industry has increasingly embraced the trend toward making its products and services customizable as an attempt to provide the consumer with ‘choice’.</p>
<p>Thus, one can see how the funeral industry, like so many other commercial arenas, increasingly relies on the labor of the consumer in the production process. In fact, in 2011 the British <italic>Funeral Service Journal</italic> reported that according to a recent nation-wide study ‘almost half … [of funeral consumers] are keen for their funeral to reflect their favourite, hobby, colour, football team or music’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469540512456924"><italic>Funeral Service Journal</italic>, 2011</xref>). In the funeral industry, consumer ‘choice’ is touted as the most significant selling point in many years. For instance, customers are routinely encouraged to create scrapbooks to display near guest registries. ‘Memory boards’ that contain pictures, notes and other memorabilia are common and tribute DVDs, incorporating images from the deceased’s past and family photos, are also widespread. Additionally, firms turn over the actual running of the funeral visitation and service to the customers. Customers can bring in their own music, their own videos, and include a variety of speakers. All of these elements necessitate the inclusion of the consumer in the creation of the final product – seemingly making the funeral product not only personalized but interactive in the process.</p>
<p>Thanks in large part to an attenuation of control over funerary rituals by industry actors and the simultaneous rise in customer participation in the process of shaping these rituals, as my data show, today’s funerals are beginning to look quite different from yesteryear’s. Garces-Foley and Holcomb attest to this: ‘[T]he contemporary funeral is a constructive reaction against the impersonal, cookie-cutter, ostentatious, theologically focused, tradition-determined, somber funeral practices of the twentieth century’ (2006: 208). Re-shaping consumers into co-producers of an individualized funeral gives them more control than they once had. Funeral participants and attendees tend more often now to avail themselves of the opportunities to re-present the lives that have been lived, an important component of funerary rituals and one that previously fell under the jurisdiction of clergy and funeral directors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469540512456924">Irion, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469540512456924">Emke, 1999</xref>). Evidence suggests that funeral customers do in fact feel they are given a great deal of latitude in how they wish to mark the passage of a loved one and are thus increasingly responsible for the creation of these rites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1469540512456924">Wirthlin Worldwide, 2005</xref>). Because consumers are responsible for providing the images and selecting or bringing their own songs and soundtracks, they are as much a part of the final product as the conventional ‘producer’ (i.e. the funeral director). Thus, part of the commodity that the funeral industry is producing is in fact a co-production. The industry’s product is, in part, the consumer’s experience of <italic>making</italic> the final product, which reflects a general trend whereby companies provide the context and the means for a mode of experiential consumption (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469540512456924">Caru and Cova, 2007</xref>). Personal agency, however, is problematic for a variety of reasons. One such reason has to do with the so-called ‘tyranny of choice’. Until recently, for instance, one prominent American funeral corporation provided their consumers with a 29-page catalogue of available products and services – creating a daunting array of possible options. The abundance of choices leads many consumers to become overwhelmed and desensitized. Writing on interpassivity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1469540512456924">Van Oene (2006)</xref> points out that one consequence of such ratcheting up of stimuli is to retreat: ‘[A]n increased amount of “interactivity”, that is to say, an optimized interaction between human and system functions in the production process, is accompanied by a loss of involvement and interest in the product itself.’ Van Oene goes on to suggest that such conditions create the need to delegate some of one’s emotions to a proxy outside of the self; allowing oneself to become distanced, estranged, and sometimes even alienated from one’s feelings.</p>
<p>The concept of interpassivity here is useful for thinking about the ways in which one’s agency is delegated to someone or something that chooses, feels, and thinks for the consumer. This is especially true when looking at the role of brands as they are utilized in funeral goods and services. To elaborate on the how interpassivity functions in the everyday life of a consumer one can turn to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469540512456924">Žižek’s (1989)</xref> discussion of the laugh track that is so commonly found in TV sitcoms. The laugh track allows us to ‘say afterwards that objectively, through the medium of the other, we had a really good time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469540512456924">Žižek, 1989</xref>: 34). The laugh track is a commercially manufactured mechanism that not only laughs for the viewer but also reinforces social conventions. With it, the viewer learns where it is appropriate to laugh, what kind of laugh to utter, how hard one might laugh, and the like. Similarly, brands, insofar as they humanize non-living entities, can be said to <italic>emote</italic> for the consumer. That is, rather than becoming a conduit for emotional expression, brands are themselves expressers of emotion. And by demonstrating the appropriateness of different emotions, they reinforce normative emotional expressions.</p>
<p>It should be noted that there are additional reasons more specific to the case of the funeral industry. Probably foremost is related to the fact that, in spite of the rising numbers of consumers who are pre-planning their funerals, the majority of consumers purchase funeral products and services on an ‘at-need’ basis. As one economist who has conducted in-depth studies of the industries has written: ‘Once a death has occurred, survivors do not usually have the time or inclination to enter into a discriminating decision-making process’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1469540512456924">Smith, 1997</xref>: 139). Choice is therefore constrained by consumers’ lack of familiarity with products, processes, and services that are available to them and the demands of a loved one’s death can severely limit the survivors’ ability and willingness to familiarize themselves with those things.</p>
<p>In general, though, when it comes to personalization, choice is conflated with agency. That is, consumers are in control of their choices only insofar as they choose to purchase what is made available to them. One of the increasingly popular ways funeral providers create choice is through the creation of goods and services that are tied to specific brands. In some cases, particularly in those where the brand is hidden or when a company dominates an industry, consumer choice is only putative. In the next section, I look at one particularly robust instance of this; it is the case of the largest funeral provider in the world and its premier brand in the US – Dignity.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1469540512456924"><title>Dignified deathcare</title>
<p>In all the moral locutions that permeate the discourses of death care, there is one term in particular whose frequency seems to signal extraordinary value – <italic>dignity</italic>. Over and over again this term emerges in the trade literature, podcasts and blogs, logos, advertising copy, and even policy and instructional manuals. From one of the earliest embalming textbooks: ‘[Funeral workers] should live in their business and move out and in a subdued, dignified, and by no means Pharasaical manner’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469540512456924">Dodge, 1908</xref>: 232), to a mid-century one: ‘The care and disposition of the dead is, in all of its aspects, a religious rite which requires all of the dignity and solemnity accorded the other sacred customs and procedures of any church or religious group’ (Strub and Fredrick, 1967[1958]: 50), and a contemporary textbook: ‘The preparation, care and final disposition of a deceased human being should be attended with appropriate observance and understanding, having due regard and respect for the reverent care of the human body and for those bereaved and the overall spiritual dignity of humankind’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1469540512456924">Mayer, 2006[1990]</xref>: 3). Individual funeral firms regularly incorporate the term <italic>dignity</italic> into their business slogans. Merely a cursory look at firms in my home community reveals the use of the word in company mottos: ‘Service with Dignity’; ‘Serving the Community with Christian Dignity’; ‘Dignity Measured in the Simplest of Terms’; ‘Care and Dignity’, and so on.</p>
<p>In spite of the word’s questionable empirical traction, <italic>dignity</italic> is so common in the trade that is has frequently been integrated into sociological discussions. In their Goffmanian analysis of funerals Turner and Edgley write: ‘Funeral directors and allied members of their team may be seen as actors whose job it is to stage a performance in such a way so that the audience to it (the bereaved family and friends) will impute competence, sincerity, dignity, respect, and concern to their actions’ (1976: 378). And the legal scholar Rachel Ariss states that <italic>dignity</italic> is even a common term in juridical discourse with regard to the dying and the dead. ‘Dignity is conferred on human remains as memory of a specific person is respected …  The self of memory can be understood as having a role in the larger narratives of the community… Dignity was conferred on human remains in this case through collective memorial narrative’ (2004: 51).</p>
<sec id="sec4-1469540512456924"><title>The ‘death with dignity’ movement that became so popular in the early 1990s</title>
<p>further attests to the import of this term. <italic>Dignity</italic>, in short, may be understood as part and parcel of the ways one thinks about and constructs values involving care and disposal of the dead. One may understand this as a need to confer decency and meaning on what can otherwise be indecent and meaningless. The dying lose control over their bodies. One’s eyes sink in and one’s skin turns black. Gravity settles the blood, involuntary defecation is frequent, and gases bloat the torso. And yet we are all powerless against these forces of nature that impose what are commonly believed to be <italic>in</italic>dignities, in spite of the biological necessities.</p>
<p>Biology presents the living (i.e. consumers) with the formidable and sometimes even overwhelming challenge to respond to the abject nature of death, and society compounds the demands with the expectation that all of that is done with dignity. The desire to delegate such a task to an entity outside oneself may be significant. It may come as no surprise, therefore, that the term <italic>dignity</italic> was appropriated for mobilization in the marketplace – priming the pump of interpassivity.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Houston, Texas, Service Corporation International (SCI), the world’s largest funeral provider in the world created a new brand in 1999:<disp-quote>
<p>The Dignity Memorial network has started a quiet revolution in funeral, cremation and cemetery services. With more than 1,000 North American locations, Dignity Memorial providers are committed to delivering standards, options and values not found elsewhere. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1469540512456924">SCI, n.d.</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Dignity (the American brand) emerged during the acquisition bubble that was prevalent in the 1990s in the industry. SCI and other large corporations were buying out independent, ‘mom-and-pop’ firms not only across the USA but also in Canada and some European countries. Indeed, in the UK, SCI acquired the Great Southern and Plantsbrook Groups out of which the British version of Dignity emerged in 2001 and proceeded to acquire a number of funeral firms across the country. (In the UK, Dignity plc was created following a management buy-out from SCI and Dignity plc has since operated as a British company and is a distinct entity from its American brand.)</p>
<p>In the most recent decade, SCI focused on corporate acquisitions – purchasing the second largest American funeral corporation in 2006 and the fifth largest in 2010. So while the plotline of the HBO television program <italic>Six Feet Under</italic> (in which a family-owned funeral home faced constant threat of being bought out by a large corporation) was yet to be revealed to a widespread populace (the show began airing in 2001), critics of the takeover trend were already mounting.</p>
<p>The American funeral industry has long been the recipient of negative publicity (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469540512456924">Bowman, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469540512456924">Harmer,1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469540512456924">Mitford, 1998[1963]</xref>). However, it was the target of amplified scrutiny beginning in the mid-1990s. Consumer advocacy groups, television news programs, magazine articles, not to mention the funeral conglomerates themselves, all contributed to a multifaceted conversation centered around the funeral trade. The creation of Dignity, then, backed by the resources of an enormous corporate entity, provided both members of the industry as well as the wider public with a new interpretation of commercialized deathcare. After all, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1469540512456924">Mommaas (2002)</xref> writes:<disp-quote>
<p>Brands derive their attraction largely from the fact that they introduce a certain order or coherence to the multiform reality around us. Brands enable us more easily to ‘read’ each other and our environment of brands and places and products  …  Seen in this way brands are not purely a source of differentiation but also of identification, recognition, continuity, and collectivity. (2002: 34)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Dignity has fairly obvious, preferred semiotic implications. That is, consumers and other participants in the American way of death (such as competing funeral companies, potential vendors, and consumer advocates) are encouraged to ‘read’ their environments in particular ways. Because of the conventional linguistic associations to a <italic>moral</italic> discourse, <italic>dignity</italic> suggests tradition, longevity, and steadfastness. Its first-order meanings, of course, refer to respect, honor, or esteem, and the cultural currency provided by the then-burgeoning debate around the ‘death with dignity’ movement only adds to this cachet.</p>
<p>Given that there is so little that can be dignified (in any compelling sense of the word) about death, the possibility for delegating the moral and emotional high ground to someone or something else can seem very appealing. This is especially true in circumstances in which a death has taken place unexpectedly. The demands on the survivor to complete necessary paperwork, make phone calls, prepare for visitors, and all the other tasks one must attend to can be overwhelming. In such cases, delegation can be a must and delaying one’s cavalcade of emotions in order to remain ‘dignified’ may almost feel necessary. In these instances, one might welcome the condition of interpassivity as described by Žižek: ‘When I am frenetically active not in order to achieve something, but to prevent something (that which really matters) from happening’ (1998: 145). Thus, one might sympathize with the desire to allocate the dignified aspect of deathcare to a company whose very name allocutes dignity.</p>
<p>Dignity (the brand) is not perceived as a benign presence in the industry, however. Funeral consumer groups and other assorted critics of the conglomerates have had a field day with the irony they perceived in this branding effort; positioning it somewhere in between oil companies’ green-washing, marketing strategies and ABC Television’s self-consciously ironic, ‘TV is bad for you’ ad campaign (e.g. ‘Hobbies, Schmobbies’). Oliver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469540512456924">McRae (2004)</xref> for instance, a well-regarded contributor to the premier trade magazine <italic>The Director</italic>, expressed his disapprobation when he wrote: ‘Sticking a label that says “Dignity” on it does not make it so; it is just one more example of the emptiness and deception consumers get from everybody else in society’ (2004: 40).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, under the Dignity moniker in the USA, SCI (its parent corporation) accomplished things it may not have otherwise been able to. Among other things, the company manufactured new funeral service packages, and it established ties with other corporate brands to produce synergies (including FedEx, Florida Hospice, and others). In other words, these companies that provide different products and services have developed networks such that when a customer is working with one company, that company can recommend the customer also use the services or products of another company in their network. However, they also fulfilled another important function that has historically been a part of the funeral business. In the past, funeral homes played a visible role in civic life – from sponsoring softball teams to participation in chambers of commerce. Dignity enacted this civic engagement by creating community outreach programs such as the Dignity Escape School, which, according to its web page, ‘[I]s a nationally recognized program that teaches children and parents how to recognize deceptive practices of a would-be-kidnapper while demonstrating escape tactics children can use in case of abduction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469540512456924">Dignity© Memorial, n.d.</xref>). Dignity has a traveling, ¾-scale replica of the Vietnam Memorial. Among other programs, Dignity also features a program called ‘Defeat Diabetes’ in which: ‘Members of the <bold>D</bold>ignity Memorial® network <bold>E</bold>ncourage client families and employees to fight diabetes by <bold>F</bold>unding, <bold>E</bold>ducating, <bold>A</bold>cting and <bold>T</bold>reasuring loved ones.’</p>
<p>As a ‘good corporate citizen,’ Dignity is the alter ego to SCI’s image on Wall Street, which can sometimes be perceived as ruthless and greedy. Its founder and former CEO, Robert Waltrip, for instance, is quoted as saying, ‘People who don’t buy our stock just don’t like money’ (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469540512456924">Bryce, 1997</xref>). SCI has been an emerging giant since the 1960s, but the 1990s saw nearly exponential expansion for the company. SCI went from 1400 firms in 1992 to 4500 by the end of the decade. The buy-outs of what were mostly firms under independent and family ownership earned frequent comparisons to the menacing Kroehner Corporation that was depicted in <italic>Six Feet Under</italic>. Kroehner, with its mantra ‘Consolidate or die’, was presented as a dehumanized golem set to feed off more earnest and naïve firms such as Fisher and Sons, the protagonists of the series.</p>
<p>The Dignity brand also allowed SCI to create new signage for their facilities and obscure their heavy acquisitive period in the 1990s. In fact, SCI’s ownership of individual firms is most often obscured by Dignity’s logo. Even then, Dignity is, quite literally, peripheral within the framework of the overall façade of the funeral home. In its 2010 annual report, SCI states: ‘While this branding process is intended to emphasize our seamless national network of funeral service locations and cemeteries, the original names associated with acquired operations, and their inherent goodwill and heritage, generally remain the same’ (2010: 7). The visual <italic>mise en scène</italic> of a Dignity brand funeral home continues to rely on the signage that preexisted SCI’s purchase of that home. Which is to say that a Dignity funeral home very rarely looks any different from any other funeral home. This works in SCI’s favor since according to a reputable industry analyst 55 percent of consumers preferred locally owned funeral firms versus 5 percent who preferred corporately owned ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469540512456924">Gould, 2005</xref>). The analyst writes: ‘Since the corporate operators are unlikely to make ownership an issue, the onus falls on the locally owned funeral firms. If the locally owned funeral homes don’t advertise their independence, the consumer is left to draw their own conclusions; and they typically conclude all of the local firms are family operated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469540512456924">Gould, 2005</xref>: 16).</p>
<p>When SCI assumes ownership of a firm that was previously under independent (or familial) ownership, the actual name of the firm remains fixed both in space and on paper. Furthermore, this name is most often the surname of the founder or founders. Names are of special consequence in the funeral industry. As the poet/funeral director Thomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469540512456924">Lynch (1999)</xref> writes:<disp-quote>
<p>The name is mine, my family’s, my father’s and mother’s, my brother’s and sister’s, our son's and daughter’s …  The name is worth more than the brick and mortar, the rolling stock or any money in the bank. It is the only one we have. We cannot get another. It determines whom we hire, what we sell, for how much, what we say, who we are and what we do.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Even in accounting terms the firm’s name has its own ‘goodwill value’ that accrues from having been in a locality over years or even decades. Goodwill value is vital to a funeral home. As Smith writes: ‘“[H]eritage” implies a high degree of customer loyalty which virtually guarantees repeat business through generations of families. In spite of various barriers to entry into local death care markets, well-established local (“heritage”) funeral homes have been able to expand by adding branches’ (1997: 285). Yet the name is subsumed into the overall value of the brand once a firm is purchased and becomes part of the ‘story’ of the firm. The Dignity brand then, allows SCI to co-opt the goodwill value of an already established family name into the overall value accrued through its corporate brand, which benefits from the cultural narrative it is intended to evoke. As one funeral director told me: ‘I’m friends with some of the former owners of what are now SCI firms and they told me if they could go back in time they would never have sold out because they sell their names. And now they are stuck with that.’</p>
<p>Here, one can see the ways in which branding has in fact elicited a condition of interpassivity by appealing to the consumer’s desire for authenticity, familiarity, and credibility. Consider the following statement offered by Laderman, a funeral industry historian who contrasts corporatization with the common view of the corner ‘mom-and-pop’ firm: ‘By defining themselves against the now-familiar image of multinational, publicly-traded corporations voraciously gobbling up the death trade, funeral directors who have not sold out stake their claims of professional integrity, moral purity, and ritual competence on a combination of core middle-class American values and personal religious convictions’ (2003: 188). Thus, one can understand the importance when the Dignity signage is sufficiently present to evoke the connotations that the word carries but sufficiently inconspicuous so as to avoid connotations that are evoked by being linked to a rationalized, corporate chain.</p>
<p>Because the Dignity brand relies on a signifier that is associated with a decidedly humanistic characteristic, the brand is a commodity that is easily fetishized. It is also conducive to creating the possibility for interpassivity. However, the contradictory nature of interpassivity suggests that where consumers may have the expectation that they are delegating their desire to honor the deceased, they are instead consigning the responsibility to a highly rationalized entity with a bottom-line revenue of $2.2 billion in 2010. Even early on, SCI’s financials attested to the success of the Dignity brand. From SCI’s 2003 annual report one finds the following statement: ‘On a burial funeral, Dignity packaged sales generate on average approximately $2,800 more than non-Dignity sales’ (2003: 14). Thus, there is evidence that branding, at least according to the industry’s leader, is at least somewhat effective. This is in spite of the fact that most consumers still traditionally rely on word of mouth when it comes time to select a funeral provider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1469540512456924">Wirthlin Worldwide, 2005</xref>: 16).</p>
<p>Throughout much of the history of the American funeral industry, a core tension (i.e. between genuine, solemn honor for the dead and the commercial, rationalized apparatus that has emerged to provide for deathcare) has been addressed via appeals to a moral economy in which funeral work gets framed as care and the industry legitimates itself as preserving a social good. Workers and other participants in the industry historically saw themselves as paid care providers, upholders of sacred traditions, and healers. For this reason one might characterize the members of this occupational class as moral entrepreneurs who are charged with (or otherwise assume the duties of) preserving, highlighting, and promoting what they view to be sanctified values (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1469540512456924">Habenstein and Lamers, 1955</xref>). As rationalizing mechanisms such as corporatization and secularization attenuate their status as moral entrepreneurs, the kinds of messages that communicate to the consuming public have also changed. These messages not only help to convey the kinds of goods the industry provides, they also signal suggested ways of consuming these goods and ways of interacting with funeral producers. This is accomplished through intertextual linkages in which images, symbols, or themes are used by the funeral industry to create associations or connections to other spheres of consumption (such as shopping at a big box retailer or watching television).</p>
<p>Through branding, an abstract entity, the corporation, can signify its humanness, as well as its goodness, to boot. A leading marketer who has been in the industry for decades told me that, in times past, ‘[W]henever the funeral home got a call, Mom, and I do mean <italic>Mom</italic>, would bake a cake or a pie or something …  [but] there’s no way corporations can incorporate Mom to cook fried chicken.’ One very important way of communicating the ‘humanity’ of corporations to consumers is through the use of branding. Establishing the brand allows the consumer to both delegate core human abilities of respect, solemnity, and thoughtful care to another while simultaneously shoring up the bottom line of a highly rationalized entity. Thus, through the brand, the corporation is able to continue its anthropomorphic transformation. This works by appeasing the consumer market through the substitution of a trope that is sufficiently pleasant (a hypostatized brand) for themes that are altogether unpleasant (death, corporate behemoths, and negative publicity). At the same time, though, the brand works to establish conditions that are conducive to interpassivity in which the consumer merely mimes interactivity in order to assume a passive role in the funerary process.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1469540512456924"><title>Brandscaped experiences</title>
<p>While the Dignity brand might be described as relatively inconspicuous to most consumers, the explicit display of mainstream (non-funerary) brands is becoming increasingly popular. Such commercial branding is still in its nascent stages in the funeral industry but it is rapidly ascending both in importance and frequency of use. Brands can easily become part of the physical environment, integrated into the surroundings, and add to the levels of stimuli the consumer experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469540512456924">Codeluppi, 2007</xref>). Experiential forms of consumption can produce the conditions for interpassivity because the branded environment is suggesting to consumers that they are not merely performing a ritual but doing other things (such as being entertained and shopping). Brands, too, provide the means and conditions for experiential forms of consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469540512456924">Brodie, 2009</xref>) and, in the case of funerals, the incorporation of brands and branded environments is typically used as a shorthand way to represent the values, preferences, or consumer habits of the deceased as I discuss below.</p>
<p>Branding and even themed funerals are becoming more widely available in the funeral industry all the time and resemble other retail industries’ efforts to commodify and sell <italic>experiences</italic> (rather than simply material goods). Alan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469540512456924">Wolfelt (2001)</xref> authored <italic>Funeral Home Customer Service A–Z,</italic> a title that is considered requisite by the traditionally conservative National Funeral Directors Association. In it, Wolfelt points out American consumers are as often as not paying for experiences and memories (instead of material products), which accounts for much of the success of Niketown, Hardrock Café, Mall of America, and the like (2001: 25–8). To this discussion, Wolfelt appends a consideration for theming funeral homes or even individual funerals themselves. The funeral director, he argues, must engage all five of the customer’s senses and make use of what he typologizes as the four forms of experience: entertainment, education, escapism, and aesthetics (2001: 31). Actors in the funeral industry recognize that brands borrowed from everyday life can be easily incorporated as an efficient way to create a more inclusive, immersive experience for the consumer. And since brands have come to function as an extension of identity (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469540512456924">Keller, 1998</xref>), it should be easy to understand their inclusion in contemporary funerals because funerals ostensibly signify a life once lived. That is, when incorporated into funerals, brands can accomplish two different things. They can provide the living consumers with a value-added experience and, because brands are increasingly viewed as representative of individuals’ hobbies, preferences, or lifestyles, they can symbolically represent the deceased.</p>
<p>Enter Clint Mytich and his publicly traded company, Eternal Image. The company, whose motto is ‘Products that Reflect a Life well Lived’, does not, ironically enough, manufacture any products. Instead it partners with other vendors who make caskets, urns, and the like, and then affix a brand to that product – a brand for which Eternal Image has purchased the reproduction rights. Eternal Image deals with customers only through funeral firms. Eternal Image has licensing agreements with Major League Baseball™, Precious Moments®, the Vatican Library Collection™, American Kennel Club™, the Cat Fancier's Association™, the rock band KISS™, Star Trek™, and they continue to ‘relentlessly pursue’ additional brands.</p>
<p>The message Eternal Image provides to the public, equating life to consumables, is relatively artless. On its home page the company notes: ‘Over the course of one’s lifetime many have invested time, energy, and enthusiasm into passions and pursuits which involve one Brand-name or another.’ Representing neither work nor pleasure, nor the deceased’s relationship to others except as mediated by the brand, the introduction of this commodity form into funerary ritual creates the possibility for interpassivity. The survivor (i.e. the consumer) is presented with an array of options when it comes to planning the funeral rites of a loved one. Opting for a brand to tell a story rather than having another person serve that function, the emotional expressions felt by the survivors are sublated into the brand. Thus, where participation in funeral rites once helped secure meaning for people after the death of someone in their community, now one’s identification with a particular brand links an individual to others who may share little else than an interest in the brand.</p>
<p>Martin is the head of one of the nation’s largest funeral marketing agencies in the country. After I asked him about the increasing visibility of iconic brands in funerary rites, he reminded me that it was typical for previous generations to bury their dead in a family plot. Presently, though, he added, given the geographical mobility of the middle class, the decline in the use of clergy members at funerals, and the pervasiveness of brands in everyday life, the incorporation of brands in the funeral services and products has become an efficient focal point in the funeral:</p><disp-quote>
<p>A lot of casket companies now are buying the rights to school logos and some ball parks around the country are actually selling cremation niches. [Through] the San Diego Padres, you can get a cremation niche with their stadium. Doakes Field up there at FSU, Florida State, is selling niches at the field …  My family has [burial plots across] two states that I never have any intention of going to again. Now a lot of families have that because it was an American tradition to buy an estate or a lot of gravesites or even build a family mausoleum.</p></disp-quote>
<p>Where physical sites once served to situate individuals in a community network, various disembedding mechanisms have uprooted individuals, in this case, quite literally. Via the market, the funeral industry has increasingly integrated brands – through which a kind of re-embedding can take place. To use Martin’s illustration, the individual is re-embedded – situated within an affinity network that shares loyalty to a sports brand (or a stadium that serves as a proxy to the team).</p>
<p>Athletic franchises make for excellent brands because they are fairly enduring and provide a wealth of narratives. Team personalities, trades, particular playbooks, conflicts, scandals, and so forth, all provide additional dimensions of discursive realities through which individuals can come together. Though it tends to be a gendered phenomenon, some individuals mark particular memories by reference to sports or even particular games or competitions. Thus a team’s brand may be metonymically related to an actual tangible experience of the past. Of course, sports are, for many people, fun. Spectator sport is indeed a very big business and thus juxtaposing sports brands onto somber funeral rituals may serve to displace some of the anxiety around sadness that historically surrounds American funerary ritual.</p>
<p>Many other kinds of brands, though, not simply athletic brands, can allow individuals to situate themselves along affinity networks. This can include the branding of places, as scholars such as Kevin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469540512456924">Gotham (2005)</xref> and Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1469540512456924">Silk (2007)</xref> have demonstrated. Many people have witnessed how the branding efforts of Las Vegas, for example, changed over time (from a brief family-oriented brand to the decidedly ‘adult playground’ brand now employed). My informant, Martin, describes one attempt to piggyback on the success of promoting Las Vegas as a brand when he remarks:</p><disp-quote>
<p>Families… don’t want to be buried some place that nobody will ever visit. That’s why for instance there was a plan at one time… [for] a huge pyramid with a beacon so bright that this light from this pyramid would be visible on the Vegas strip. And it was going to be columbarium niches and the idea is that [since] everybody goes to Las Vegas from time to time you could go and visit Mom. And the same concept applies to putting them in at a football field. Whenever you come to a football field you’d see Dad’s niche and you’ll think about him and then you’d go in and cheer for the home team. It’s all reflective of the changes of society.</p></disp-quote>
<p>The market, and in this case, more specifically, a brand, provides what families, churches, and neighborhoods once did – a point of common reference. Brands, therefore, function ‘as ‘linking devices’ that enable the crystallization of however transitory …  forms of community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469540512456924">Arvidsson, 2005</xref>: 242). They can connect people both virtually (e.g. in taste communities) and physically (e.g. sports stadiums) and construct new kinds of rituals – ones that are mediated through the commodity form.</p>
<p>Furthermore, brands are increasingly deployed in the funeral industry in order to create themed funerals. Theming, or the use of ‘overarching symbolic motifs within consumer milieus’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469540512456924">Gottdiener, 2001</xref>:7), is a socially manufactured relationship between either discursive or non-discursive entities within a particular context. Theming, in this context, juxtaposes retail consumption with representative symbols from mass (non-retail) culture. This marketing strategy is widely popular in other areas of consumer life (e.g. restaurants such as Hard Rock Café or Planet Hollywood, Disney cruises, Las Vegas hotels, Niketown), and is easily incorporated into the contemporary funeral. The <italic>New York Times</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469540512456924">Leland, 2006</xref>), for example, describes the popularity of themed funerals in an article titled ‘It’s my Funeral and I’ll Serve Ice Cream if I Want To’ – in which one funeral was centered around a disco dancing party and another was an ice cream party. Another story in <italic>USA Today</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469540512456924">Pancrazio, 2007</xref>), described how a ‘funeral director simulated a campsite because the deceased loved to camp. The director pitched a tent and brought in a faux fire.’ From <italic>Exit Strategy</italic>, a book that describes a number of alternative funerary options, the reader is told ‘In Hickory, North Carolina, at Catawba Memorial Park, Chuck Gallagher has built a putting green that houses cremains’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469540512456924">Cromer, 2006</xref>: 117).</p>
<p>The funeral industry’s adoption of theming borrows heavily from branding strategies, thereby transforming personal rituals into promotional tools. Like brands, themes can be used to divert attention away from some of the more unpleasant aspects of the funeral – such as the symbolic pollution associated with corpses and the ‘dirty’ work of embalming, to the economic motivation of the funeral provider or even the deep sadness contained in loss. Themed funerals have the potential to liven up what has historically been a dour event. One can only imagine the fun that could be had at this customer’s funeral: ‘“We want a nice party. It’ll be so pretty. It’ll be held in a public park with fountains with a tent, and very good catering” …  And the music must have a water theme, [the customer] said, such as the Beatles’ hit “Yellow Submarine”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1469540512456924">Montet, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Theming invites consumers to create meaning, construct narratives, and emplace and emplot themselves within that larger theme. It is not surprising that most of the funeral directors that I spoke with are increasingly seeing themed funerals and more and more of them are seeing themed funerals that revolve around popular brands such as the Beatles, a NASCAR (National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing) driver, Harley Davidson motorcycles, or a favorite football team. Theming and branding are appealing for their ability to embed the consumer in a narrative that is easily recognizable and widely available. This is especially relevant for individuals who have become disembedded by market mechanisms. However, because the branded environment, services, or funeral products are intended to serve as a narrative voice for the survivors and the deceased, emotional expression is delegated to a commercial entity. As a spokesperson from Eternal Image told a Fox Business news reporter, ‘The new trend is for themed funerals to celebrate the life of the person, what they’re all about and our products are usually the centerpiece in that kind of thing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1469540512456924">Eternal Image, n.d.</xref>).</p>
<p>While such products and services are sold on the basis of their ability to ‘personalize’ the funeral rituals, they in fact perpetuate the ongoing colonization of brandscapes into everyday life and may even provide the consumer with an exaggerated sense of agency and choice. Brands and the themed funerals they offer provide a sociality for consumers who might feel alienated either as a consequence of disembeddedness or because former rituals no longer hold any kind of currency of meaning for them (i.e. one is merely ‘going through the motions’). On the other hand, there is little to mark the distinctiveness of the funerary rites to separate them from quotidian consumer life. One is merely going through another set of motions, delegating the work of mourning, eulogizing, and celebrating to an abstract brand who acts on the consumer’s behalf.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1469540512456924" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The widening availability of branded funeral services and goods would seem to suggest that funeral consumers’ options for the ways in which they ritualize the passing of a loved one are also expanding. As one funeral home claims on its website: ‘All your life you’ve had a say over your choice of wardrobe, music, hobbies and friends. So why is it, when it comes to final wishes, there is hardly any choice?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1469540512456924">Bunker Funeral Home, 2004</xref>). Implied in this ad copy is the positive correlation between agency and choice – specifically, consumers’ agency increases with the ability to express their identities and values through their interactive purchasing decisions. Considering branding through the conceptual tool of interpassivity reveals a number of cultural contradictions. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469540512456924">Žižek (1998)</xref> writes: ‘You think you are active, while your true position, as it is embodied in the fetish, is passive.’ Brands and themes are able to emplace and emplot consumers into pre-fabricated narratives without the consumer having to do much at all. The commodity, in this case the brand, is attributed a kind of subjectivity that can think and feel on behalf of the passive consumer.</p>
<p>Interpassivity is a novel commodity form by which one can delegate the aversions, pleasures, and affections contained in consumption to an other. In that light, one might contend that interpassivity has been a presence in the funeral industry for as long as the industry has existed as a profit-motivated, commercial institution. In the past, for example, customers were often encouraged to spend more money on funeral services and products as a way to demonstrate their love for the person who had passed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469540512456924">Mitford, 1998[1963]</xref>). For instance, purchasing the finest casket available was a way to let everyone know how much you ‘cared’. However, brands are particularly pernicious when it comes to interpassivity because they not only signify (or ‘advertise’) one’s feelings for the deceased person, they also level the decedent to a cipher – for which advertising is provided <italic>gratis</italic>. Thus, the company behind the brand is the ultimate recipient of the consumer’s affection, which has been displaced and transferred.</p>
<p>It ought to be noted, however, that interpassivity represents a negotiation. It would be too simplistic to caricature the consumer as a non-agentic dupe. Putting together a funeral for a loved one who has just passed away is no small task – there are significant physical and emotional burdens involved. The act of delegation may be one strategy to bracket the pain and confusion imposed by loss and replace it with recognizable features from everyday life (i.e. branded signifiers so pervasive in video screens, retail environs, public spaces, and so forth). Consumption of brands provides individuals disengaged from grounding institutions the opportunity to cobble together new identities and new forms of expression. Thus, even in death one may be able to convey a commitment and care for others through the purchase of branded goods and services that allow the consumer to displace some of the heavy (emotional) labor. Conditions of interpassivity, therefore, may reveal the ability of late capital to circumscribe the tedium, the banality, and at least some of the horror of loss.</p>
<p>This is not, of course, to suggest that the explicit and self-conscious creation of brandscapes is entirely ingenuous. Here lies a basic cultural contradiction between treating death as something fiscal and treating death as something ontologically sacred. The poet/funeral director Thomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469540512456924">Lynch (1999)</xref> in an article he called ‘Funerals ‘R’ Us’ writes:<disp-quote>
<p>A funeral is not a great investment; it is a sad moment in a family's history. It is not a hedge against inflation; it is a rite of passage. It is not a retail event; it is an effort to make sense of our mortality. It has less to do with actuarial profits and more to do with actual losses. It is not an exercise in salesmanship; it is an exercise in humanity.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Moral norms dictate that funeral workers attend to the dead and the bereaved in a meaningful, un-self-interested, and sincere manner. The fiduciary realm places a different set of demands on those in the industry – to be rational (disinterested with regard to non-market-related concerns), opportunistic, and instrumentalist. The inclusion of branding, then, is seen as yet one more sales gimmick with which to inspire consumer spending.</p>
<p>The kind of products and services now available for consumption in the funeral industry challenges the tenacity of the funeral tradition by supplanting the corpse with company logos and lifestyle icons as an additional focus for ritual performances. While funerals are still about the dead, they are also about the consumer’s relationship to the commodity form. Delegated expression, as articulated in conditions of interpassivity, functions to normalize novelty, maybe at the expense of memory and tradition or even the connection with others or one’s own mortality. It also reinforces the increasingly dominant role of capital in reifying social relations. But delegated expression occurs in many other places too. Interactive technologies such as social networking, mobile communications, retail environments, and recreational forms of entertainment, are becoming ever more ubiquitous. Studying such interactive technologies through the lens provided by interpassivity may be one means to situating consumer agency along the continuum of commodity relations. Indeed, interpassivity may provide another tool in the evolving scholarship on the role of capital in consumers’ emotional and affective lives.</p>
