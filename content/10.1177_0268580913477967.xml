 <p>Do existing social theories adequately reflect ‘social facts’ and ‘social actions’? Are we able to understand all kinds of social constellations, all mental intentions, aspirations, meanings of individual actors and their intrasubjective and intersubjective practices in social contexts where human behaviour is consensual and cooperative, or in those other contexts where it is conflictual? Can we offer a new concept that would cope with the cooperative and also with the conflictual individual and social relations? Do we need a new terminology which corresponds to meaningful sociological reflections of the social world? What generates the objective regularities of human social history, and can these be analysed in terms of objective, scientific, rational? These and similar questions are addressed in <italic>The Social Power of Mind: An Introduction to the Theory of Social Pulsation</italic> by Ivo Komšić, Professor of Sociology at the University of Sarajevo. Through 15 thematic units, Komšić critically argues with the main philosophical and sociological figures in order to describe sociology as Jaspers once interpreted it, as ‘the particular science of human behaviour and its consequences’. On the other hand, this book points out the insufficiency of various theories when they deal with particular human interests and social praxis.</p>
<p>The author considers Bosnia and Herzegovina as a case study for a new sociological approach which he outlines in the form of a thesis serving as the conclusion of the book and entitled ‘Introduction to the theory of social pulsation’. Starting from the individual as the central element of the social structure, he asks ‘What is it that prevails and instructs us: “Thou shalt”? Is it the grand moral reasons, conceited historical goals, pragmatic purposes; or is it fear, narrowness, one’s persuasion or some unforeseen trifles?’ (p. 18). How do individuals act as they act and why do they act in the way they do? Are individuals capable of autonomous action, or do they react to different stimuli, aided by some theoretical or cognitive background as the basis of logical and correct knowledge? Or do they react spontaneously by practising acquired social skills? The author points out that decision making and acting happens in <italic>a moment</italic>, a temporal unit that cannot be reduced to the linear quantification of time. The author names this social concept of time, ‘pulsed time’, which he opposes to a linear concept of time. He stresses that pulsation is a languorous activity, an activity that abrades itself by its own realization: ‘Then the new time is created, new “now” with its own duration’ (p. 29).</p>
<p>What is the significance of this concept of time to the question of individual and social action? The answer lies in the particular character of a social phenomenology and social ontology where causal explanation is not suitable and immanent. This is because the pulsation of some temporal unit does not necessarily cause the pulsation of the new unit; a new temporal quantum is more often discontinuous, sudden and unexpected. The paradigmatic example of this non-causal temporal pulsation is Sarajevo under wartime siege between 1992 and 1995; it represents the temporal unit of the siege that includes within itself narrow geographic space without food, water, medicines, electricity, heating, and including shelling, sniping and killings. Within these social circumstances time could not be measured linearly because nobody paid attention to what day or date was: ‘the people lived the moment between life and death, and nobody knew how long this moment would be because that one moment cannot be meaningfully measured in terms of physical time. … It stretched on for 1479 days’ (p. 29).</p>
<p>Given the assumption that the core element of human action consists of action within such moments, the author proposes as an approach to it the notion of ‘power of mind’, in the sense given by Aristotle, Kant and Hegel. Here, mind is useful as a concept because it transcends the mere facticity and everyday social activity that are bound to circumstances, yet allows us to understand how in most cases action may be observed to be quite expected and common-sensical. More specifically, the author addresses the question of the ‘creative power of the mind’ as an orientation to matters beyond simple social objectivity, or as an orientation to realizing its own effectiveness within the sphere of uncertainty, stressing that uncertainty does not necessarily result only from a given social condition. In creativity, ‘the mind makes demands of itself for action; it does not submit to the pragmatic and objectively fixed limits that form a different kind of reality, one that has no purpose outside of itself but in itself has the power of viability’ (p. 172). The suitable example includes such concepts as human freedom and morality, where action is not exhausted in a sense of what Weber calls ‘purposive/instrumental rationality’.</p>
<p>If we examine events in Bosnia during the war, we have an opportunity to understand human action in general ‘out of the social practices that simultaneously constitute social actors and social facts’ (p. 177). Within the context of Bosnia we discover the real meaning of the social power of mind. If the realm of mind is beyond social givenness and if its practices are beyond the ‘art of the possible’, then the creative power of mind within the sphere of politics and social relations was dealing with the art of the impossible by creating a new language, new social vocabulary and new intersubjective relations and objectifications. Following Richard Rorty, Komšić seeks to define ‘the final vocabularies’ and new discourses beyond the dominated and dominant aggressive languages of the social order in Bosnian social ontology. This new communicative and creative mind is not exhausted by contingencies of personal vocabularies; it needs to be institutionalized in order to be effective as the possible <italic>novum</italic> in social order; it needs to be realized as the public creative mind in the sphere of political action (in the sense of civic society as given by Charles Taylor).</p>
<p>This creative mind stands between the two ontological references, namely, between social statics of Comte and social dynamics or social action in general. Pulsed time and the concept of social pulsation provide a way of thinking about action without linear causation, and also without need for discussing events in terms of human history, or even with regard to social structure as the necessary objective environment of communicative action (Habermas) or <italic>Weltgeist</italic> (Hegel): ‘In sociological doctrine, and also within the philosophy of history it must be taken into account that subjectivisms and various psychotic states can be transformed into objective social and historical facts, which then acquire the power of social and historical causality’ (p. 98). The social constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its internal contradictions are considerably the product of objectivized subjectivisms that suddenly became major drivers of social causality, and the reason for the new social pulsation that has nothing to do with previous institutional facts and historical processes.</p>
<p>In this light, the search for definite drivers of individual and social actions cannot be accomplished exclusively through objective and transparent logic which highlights such principles as consensus, communicative action, continuity, rational choice, predictability and so on. This is because these principles are plausible and functional (and they are able to explain social order and social action) only in the situations where we are dealing with stable social systems in which the social pulsation is not exhausted and in which social causality is not <italic>languorous</italic>. Here lies the challenge of the creative mind which must prevail over these ‘necessities’ of social facts, and here lies the insufficiency of mere cognitive and practical power of mind, because the creative dimension of the mind is the only possible way for the construction of the new social reality.</p>
<p>This is clearly not action within the institutional social and historical givenness of possible situations (in the sense of politics as the art of the possible). Through the example of Bosnian society, Komšić tries to propose several concepts that are suitable for explaining and interpreting social action and social systems. Instead of the ontology of social structure or social action as the primary and final causality, he offers a concept of transferable causality: ‘Either by placing it into a social structure, or by placing it into social action, the social practice remains uncovered to the end’ (p. 179). This transferability of causality is the pulsation of social structure and social action.</p>
<p>While it appears as an affirmation of individual actors and their behaviours, this book does not emphasize the ontology of subjective meaning as the core of sociological enquiry, just as it turns away from objective structures. Instead, it seeks to articulate the concept of social pulsation as achieved in social praxis, but without making that the essence of social ontology. Durability of social entities and individual actions depends on the intensity of the pulsation, which is extended from the most intense to the most languid, until it is totally exhausted. The path from which the new social pulsation emerges depends on various subjective, intersubjective and objective constellations. Thus pulsation, along with its intensity or languid nature, is mostly unpredicted. It does its work through the plurality and distinct character of social realities, rather than in the form of structural or processual ideal types.</p>
