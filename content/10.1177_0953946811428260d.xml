<p>The author of this book, an American Jesuit Professor of Theology at Boston College, is a notable and distinctive figure in the world of Roman Catholic moral theology. Far from a mere theoretician, Keenan is untiringly active in bringing together thinkers from a wide variety of backgrounds and starting-points with a view to creative address of current questions. Nobody has done more than he to promote such interchange at a time when the hierarchical leadership of our Church continues to seek to impose a monochrome approach. This author has also made a seminal contribution to the search for a constructive Catholic response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.</p>
<p>Coming from such a source this survey of Catholic moral theology in the twentieth century deserves careful attention. Jim Keenan is very much an insider to the debates and disagreements chronicled here, although he goes to very great lengths to maintain a tone of judicious impartiality. The book presents a mass of detailed information, much of which must seem esoteric to anyone not initiated into what already seems a strange, remote chapter in the history of Catholicism. The world of the neo-scholastic manualists whose thinking had long formed the background to Catholic moral formation only began to be seriously subverted in the mid-twentieth century. Even then the process of subversion was somewhat tortuous, for there was an abiding concern to show that whatever new thinking came into play was consonant with Catholic tradition as then understood. This remains an overarching pre-occupation of Keenan’s own work.</p>
<p>The manuals had taken for granted a law-based, sin-centred approach, on the assumption that the founding principles were clear. The only thinking required was their application for the benefit of confessors and penitents. The theological virtues of faith, hope and love did not loom large in this schema. Those who came to see how unsatisfactory this was appealed to biblical material and philosophical thinking in their aspiration towards the renewal of moral theology. The Second Vatican Council encouraged such renewal while remaining largely unspecific. In subsequent years there has been a significant shift from an act-centred to a person-centred moral theology. Early promoters of the task of renewal are dubbed by Keenan revisionists, a word which seems to have no negative connotation for him but which in the wider political landscape carries a hint of opportunism. In our present context this is unfortunate. Would you prefer to be called a manualist or a revisionist? It is an unappealing choice.</p>
<p>Our author’s sympathies appear to be with those he calls revisionists, but the way forward has proved a troubled one, as an increasing disjunction has become apparent between their work on the one hand and the pronouncements of papal and episcopal authority on the other. These last Keenan categorises as neo-manualist in outlook, the most notable contributions being the papal encyclical <italic>Veritatis Splendor</italic> and the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Yet he claims in passing that these documents are ‘more personalist and less neo-scholastic than people might think’ (p. 133). This remark hangs in the air, without any indication of where the author wants to take this seemingly contradictory qualifier.</p>
<p>The bulk of this book consists of detailed accounts of the ideas of particular manualists, revisionists and neo-manualists. Towards the end we hear with tantalising brevity of a new breed of moral theologian who thinks the revisionist project has worked itself out. This new chapter in the history of moral theology offers a much broader and more deeply diverse range of perspectives, no longer influenced either positively or negatively by the manualist past. The book then comes to an abrupt conclusion with a brief note on the encyclicals of Benedict XVI, hinting that the Pope’s emphasis on love somehow heals the breach within moral theology.</p>
<p>A major difficulty with this book as a whole is that the author is not a historian and, like the overwhelming majority of theologians, does not think historically. The particular authors dealt with are not placed in their own context, so that we are left with little or no idea why they thought and taught as they did. What we have therefore is an account of one set of ideas after another, ungrounded in what was happening in people’s lives or in the wider world. Even in the case of Bernhard Häring, where it is acknowledged that his wartime experience influenced his theology, nothing is made of this despite Keenan’s great admiration for him. It was after all Häring who told the world much later that his experience of being interrogated by Vatican officials was worse than being quizzed by the Nazis, because these were people supposed to be his friends!</p>
<p>Charles Curran is said here to be the leading Catholic moral theologian in the USA, but there is no explanation of how this can be, given that he has long been deprived of his mandate to teach as a Catholic theologian. Then there are references to the two large international conferences of moral theologians in Italy in recent years. Jim Keenan was a leading figure, if not the leading figure behind these happenings, but he is too modest to claim this role when he mentions them here. Writing of the first conference, he tells us it was a success without explaining by what frame of reference it could be so judged. It is certainly of interest, and germane to the subject of this book, that these conferences took place and aroused so much interest. But given that a high proportion of the participants are not well known for their sympathetic identification with current magisterial teaching, what exactly is the significance of these gatherings? An obvious answer would be that they have functioned as a kind of alternative or parallel magisterium, opening up horizons which the hierarchy wishes to close down. But this interpretation does not sit easily with the concluding sentence of the book: ‘In many ways, the encyclical [‘Caritas in Veritate’, by Benedict XVI] exemplifies the developments of theological ethics over the last seventy years’ (p. 242).</p>
<p>Similarly puzzling is the enthusiastic mention made here of a conference of bishops and moral theologians in England in 1994 under the aegis of Basil Hume (misleadingly but understandably referred to here as the Archbishop of London). Keenan, present as a guest, reports that this meeting ‘demonstrated how bishops and theologians could once again discern together’ (p. 134). As a participant this was not my impression, although our proceedings were civilised enough and not without interest. In any case there was no follow-up, and our present hierarchy marches to a very different drum. That gathering now looks like the last manifestation of a very mildly liberal episcopal regime. Given the aggressively polarised state of the Catholic Church in the USA this author may have been misled by our civility into imagining more of a meeting of minds than in fact took place.</p>
<p>A more general point arises here. The lack of any convincing historical perspective in Keenan’s writing converges with a marked underplaying of the ecclesial context in which all these ideas were and are being pursued. The reality is that revisionists, post-revisionists and neo-manualists are not just groups who happen to disagree with each other or offer different emphases. There is an ongoing power-struggle in which for the moment neo-manualists are calling the shots at the hierarchical level, so that constructive moral theology can only proceed if the centres of such power can be kept at a discreet distance. You would hardly suspect from Keenan’s text that wherever ecclesiastical power is in play there is a not unreasonable anxiety among moral theologians of an exploratory turn of mind. Under the last two popes in particular an absolutist cast of mind in relation to a range of disputed questions, especially in sexual and medical ethics, has more and more come to do duty as a badge of orthodoxy. The dysfunctionality this insistence perpetuates within moral theology shows no sign of being easily or swiftly resolved. Yet decent people such as Keenan and Curran seem to have concluded, without evidence, that Joseph Ratzinger as Pope has suddenly become a different, humane person.</p>
<p>Despite its subtitle this book makes very little indeed of the dramatic decline in private confessional practice which set in just before Vatican II and has not been reversed despite occasional local revivals. This reticence strikes me as another symptom of this author’s reluctance, for whatever reason, fully to engage with some uncomfortable ecclesial factors influencing moral theology. The hitherto taken-for-granted nature of private confessional practice and its frequency was the <italic>raison d’être</italic> of the moral theology of the manuals, which therefore lost their pivotal role with demise of private confessional practice as a regular feature in the lives of most Catholics.</p>
<p>That kind of moral theology was the work of clerics, and could only flourish in a world where the priest was in effect the ultimate authority in the lives of Catholics. The confessional was among other things a means of clerical control in the life of the Church, as long as people were prepared to accept a religious world in which the priest was the judge of the gravity or otherwise of any fall from grace. Nowadays moral theology is by no means the preserve of clerics. Much of the most stimulating and impressive work is being done by lay people in university posts, or by priests not dependent on bishops for their teaching positions. This is from one point of view a wretched state of affairs, though in the present subservient state of our hierarchies it has the supreme advantage of facilitating the pluralism which Keenan rightly commends.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it is the Pope and the bishops who are in theory the symbols and guardians of unity in the Church, so that when as now they become promoters of a single interest-group, namely the so-called pro-life party, we have a problem. In this sense the leadership of our Church begins to look more sectarian than Catholic, especially in the sphere of moral theology. By largely averting attention from this intractable problem the book under review risks a certain blandness, and might even induce in the unwary a degree of unfounded hope that things are healthier than they seem. Yet Keenan’s witness is welcome to the most striking change in thinking about morality in the Catholic Church in the twentieth century: ‘From Confessing Sins to Liberating Consciences’. This remains very much a work in progress, but has certainly made significant headway in my lifetime.</p>
