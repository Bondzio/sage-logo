<abstract>
<p>This article focuses on garments used in care environments. We investigate a patient overall, developed for the care of people with severe memory problems, severe learning difficulties and brain injuries. The aim of the use of a patient overall is to prevent undressing in socially inappropriate situations and/or to stop the user from removing an incontinence pad. This article is based on interviews of designers of medical textiles and patients and family carers in Finland. Both designers and patients found patient overalls to be infantilizing and stigmatizing for the user but accepted the basic functions of the product. We report results of a design project aimed at designing a new type of garment that takes into account the technical requirements but provides a more dignified look and opportunities for activity. We discuss the ethical issues concerning the use of this kind of product in the care of people with dementia.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1471301211416614"><title>Background</title>
<p>Memory problems and dementia challenge a person's relationship with others and with the living environment. Similarly, the environment has an impact on the person − his thoughts and actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211416614">Latour, 1988</xref>). In this article we are interested in the material care environment and more specifically in the garments used in care environments. A visually pleasing living environment and aesthetic appearance can raise a person's self-esteem, provide positive feedback and increase social acceptance, as well as being regarded as part of good care practices for people with dementia. In this article we focus on the design of a garment developed for the care of people with severe memory problems, severe learning difficulties and brain injuries.</p>
<p>Clothes are a way of communicating social roles and personal identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211416614">Entwistle, 2000</xref>), which is no less true among people of advanced age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211416614">Iltanen, 2007</xref>) and people receiving care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211416614">Topo &amp; Iltanen-Tähkävuori, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211416614">Twigg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211416614">Iltanen &amp; Topo, 2007b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211416614">Twigg (2010)</xref> organizes her analysis of clothing in dementia patients around four main themes: inrelation to embodied selfhood; to the immediate physical surroundings; as part of social interactions; and as a dimension of normativity and control. The clothes designed to meet the functional or cognitive needs of people receiving care often neglect aesthetics and expressivity and prioritize effectiveness and cost-efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211416614">Iltanen &amp; Topo, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211416614">Iltanen &amp; Topo, 2007b</xref>).</p>
<p>People with moderate and severe dementia may need help in dressing because of difficulties in perception, short-term memory, and physical functioning. They may also have lost interest in their appearance or are unable to express it independently through their clothing. As a consequence, other people often make decisions on their behalf about their clothing and appearance. Despite these issues, the link between clothing and dementia has rarely gained the attention of researchers and fashion designers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211416614">Twigg, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Undressing in socially inappropriate situations by people with moderate or severe dementia has been noted as a problem in care institutions. One reaction to this challenge has been to design special garments that make it difficult for the wearer to undress on their own. When browsing international websites we found these garments to be marketed (and therefore designed) for use either in the home or in care environments in many countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Canada, Sweden and Finland. These products advertised online are referred to by various names: patient overalls, anti-strip suits, special-needs jumpsuits, body suits with a zip in back, back-zip suits, all-in-one wear, one-piece garments, back-zip suits, or hygiene overalls. In French it is called ‘combinuit’; in German ‘Pflegeoveralls’. In the following we will refer to them as patient overalls. It is common to all patient overalls that the user cannot undress the garment independently.</p>
<p>This type of garment can also prevent the person from removing incontinence pads. Theprevalence rate of incontinence among nursing home residents ranges from 43 to 77 percent, according to a review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211416614">Offermans, Du Moulin, Hamers, Dassen and Halfens (2009)</xref>. The incontinence of a person with dementia has been identified as being one of the reasons for giving up family care at home and moving to residential care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211416614">Eloniemi-Sulkava, 2002</xref>). It is not clear whether incontinence is caused mainly by the progress of the dementia syndrome or whether it is associated with social issues, such as not getting enough assistance and support for visiting the toilet, a lack of rehabilitation, or having medication with side-effects that increase the risk of incontinence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211416614">Schnelle &amp; Leung, 2004</xref>). However, it is possible that continence could be supported by the material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211416614">Namazi &amp; DiNatale Johnson, 1991</xref>) and psychosocial care environment. Garments may have the potential to support the continence of people with dementia but there is lack of such products and no studies that assess their value.</p>
<p>This study focuses on Finland, where most of the residential care services are provided by the municipalities. The patient overalls are used in residential care, and are usually provided by the care institution. In Finnish residential care institutions, both patients’ own clothes and clothing provided by the institution are used. In the UK, it is required that people with dementia who live in residential care wear their own clothes all the time (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211416614">Twigg, 2010</xref>) but in Finland there are currently no standards or regulations concerning clothing. Use of restrictive methods such as safety vests is regulated in Finland as in many other countries but the current regulations do not cover the use of patient overalls, despite the restrictive elements of such a garment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1471301211416614"><title>Aims</title>
<p>In this article, our perspective is guided by our backgrounds in clothing design, design research and social research. We aim to describe the patient overalls that are marketed for dementia care and used in care services and to describe the process of how patient overalls came to be developed and used in Finland. In addition, we aim to report how the current patient overalls are assessed and valued by designers of medical textiles and how experienced users of medical textiles talk about the overalls. Finally, we describe a recent design project that sought to improve the appearance of patient overalls so as to give them a more dignified look. At the end of the article we discuss the ethical dilemma related to the use of restrictive products in the care of people with memory problems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1471301211416614" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title>
<p>Two main data sources are used in this article. First, data was derived from a research project called ‘Close to the body’, which studies the practical and ethical issues related to medical textiles. The project was conducted in co-operation between National Institute for Health and Welfare and University of Art and Design Helsinki (currently Aalto University School of Art and Design). The project data included:
<list id="list1-1471301211416614" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Online catalogues that market medical textiles (240 clothing items, of which 10 were patient overalls) to the Finnish care institutions;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>photographs (<italic>n</italic> = 12) of patient overalls used by dementia patients on a hospital ward;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>interviews with designers of medical textiles (<italic>n</italic> = 14, working for 10 different companies);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>interviews of people with experience of wearing medical textiles, or their regular visitors in the care institutions.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The designers were recruited for the interviews based on the information the companies gavein response to a postal survey sent to all producers of medical textiles in Finland. They were interviewed twice, and in the second interview, apatient overall was one topic discussed. People with experience of wearing medical textiles, ortheir regular visitors in the care institutions, were recruited for the interviews via local patientorganizations and an organization for family carers. Nine women and three men participated in the group interviews, of which three were family carers. Active group interviews (three interviewees each) were carried out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211416614">Holstein &amp; Gubrium, 1995</xref>). Concrete examples of medical textiles were presented in all the interviews, one of the items being a patient overall similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1471301211416614">Figure 1</xref>. The transcribed interview data totalled 160,000 words from the interviews with the designers and 74,000 from the interviews with the users. All the interview data were organized by AtlasTi and analyzed through content analyses.

<p>Second, data was derived from a design project for a new type of a patient overall (Care-Wear). The design project was conducted at the University of Art and Design Helsinki (currently Aalto University School of Art and Design). The goal of the project was to develop a garment that would meet not only the functional needs related to dementia and incontinence, but also the expressive needs of thewearer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211416614">Wikberg, 2008</xref>). To gain knowledge and hands-on information about the different aspects of dementia care and specifically the patient overalls, the staff of a dementia care unit was interviewed. The clothing designer responsible for designing the new prototype also used knowledge gained in her previous occupation as a nurse.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1471301211416614"><title>The current patient overalls</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1471301211416614">Figure 1</xref> shows a photo of two typical patient overalls published in a catalogue for medical textiles. In the catalogues, all ten overalls advertized had a zipper at the back, starting at the neck. The zipper went between the legs, and either ended at the waist in the front side, or at the inseam of the leg. The trouser legs were usually long but there were also short trouser legs available and the sleeves were either long, three-quarter length, or there were no sleeves. Some garments were elasticated at the waist, and many of them had rib knit on the trouser legs and sleeves. The patient overalls were a single colour or abstract patterns and all were unisex. The material used was a combination of cotton and polyester, with the percentage of polyester varying between 50 and 80 percent.</p>
<p>In the interviews, the designers described the users of patient overalls as incontinent and having dementia. They explained that patient overalls with fasteners at the back are used toprevent the wearer from undressing and removing the incontinence pads in inappropriate situations. A unisex design was chosen to rationalize purchases: it is cheaper to spend the money on a few unisex garments than to maintain a larger stock of gender-specific items.</p>
<p>Many of the designers explained that they had started to design patient overalls in the 1990s. These design processes had begun somewhat simultaneously but without knowing that other people were working on the same task. The initiative for designing this new item had come from the nursing staff. Sometimes the nurses had begun developing patient overalls themselves because there was no such garment available:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think it was in the beginning of the 1990s when lots of stuff developed from laundry items (e.g. duvets) started appearing. Then came these overalls that were made of a blue duvet cover and we knew which institution had made several similar items. From the duvet cover they had made this kind of a rough, first prototype. And then we understood that they really needed something like that. They also explained why, that there was this problem with incontinence pads. (Designer working for an industrial laundry)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Designers were aware of practical and ethical issues related to the patient overall, and they were discussed in a very contradictory way. On the one hand, it was claimed to be essential in the care of people with dementia. On the other, the garment was seen as visually stigmatizing for the wearer.</p>
<p>The ambiguous feelings were reflected in the nicknames given to this garment. The most popular name used by designers was ‘a bunny suit’, and the designers argued that this name was given by the care staff. The patient overalls were also referred to with names related to urine or faeces – the most correct name being a ‘hygiene overall’.</p>
<p>The photographs of patient overalls taken on a dementia ward showed that patient overalls used by the unit were similar to those presented in the catalogues. However, the garments photographed were mostly physically worn out, though still in use. The ward was part of a primary health care hospital. Patient overalls were ordered or bought directly by a carer on each ward who was responsible for medical textiles and there were very scarce financial resources available for this purpose.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1471301211416614"><title>Comments by patients and family carers on patient overalls</title>
<p>When discussing clothes designed for residential care, the experienced patients and family carers interviewed questioned the phenomenon of using institutional clothing. They pointedout the importance of one's own clothing in self-expression, individuality and in improving mood and self-confidence.</p>
<p>The patient overall present at the interviews had long trouser legs with rib, no sleeves or collar, and was made of bright pink polyester. The zipper started at the neck, went between the legs and ended in front at the waist. Only some of the interviewees had seen people usingpatient overalls in care settings. The experience of seeing an old relative wearing such a garment had been upsetting since they had found it infantilizing. The interviewees called it a ‘baby romper suit’ and stated that the use of such a garment would degrade the old person wearing it:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is a fact that this is a baby romper suit. It's as if human dignity was taken away when you are dressed in a romper suit when you are old. (A female family carer)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As found in the interviews with the designers, the patients and carers offered contradictory comments on the patient overall. On the one hand, it was not only infantilizing but also stigmatizing because the design openly made visible the fact that the wearer was using an incontinence pad, had severe cognitive problems, did not understand their situation, or was fully dependent on others. On the other hand it was found to be helpful to carers' work and a benefit to the users as it encouraged behaving in a socially acceptable manner. Uncertainty towards the patient overall was conveyed by laughing and making jokes about it:
<disp-quote>
<p>One has to behave to be helped in undressing. (A man with an organ transplant)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This comment also underpins the dependency of the user on the carers.</p>
<p>The participants made pointed comments about the dominance in institutional care practices of economic considerations and an ideology that emphasize efficiency. They recognized that by using such a garment, the costs of incontinence pads can be reduced because cheaper and fewer pads could be used. The patient overalls were also associated with lessening the time taken by carers to assist with toileting.</p>
<p>Just the appearance of the patient overall suggested to the participants a picture of a severely disabled user: a person who can get lost, only stays in the care environment, needs psychiatric care, is worried about having things stolen, wants to have something in their hands all the time and puts things in their mouth. These comments were associated with the features of the patient overall presented in the interviews. The bright pink colour was calledrefreshing but uncommon in single colour garments such as trousers. The lack of a pocket was mentioned as a problem because the users were expected to want to keep some belongings with them. The zipper was acknowledged as preventing the wearer from eating the buttons.</p>
<p>The material was found to be comfortable because it was soft and flexible, making it easy to sit and move, but the zipper was thought to be pressing on the user when lying in bed. One younger interviewee found it unnecessary to provide good design for those ‘who don't recognize it’ while the others tried to find ways to improve the design. For example they proposed that if the zipper could be hidden by a skirt similar to culottes it could then hide the fact that a female user is using an incontinence pad. Even if the comments concerning the appearance of the patient overall were mainly negative, the need for such a garment was accepted:
<disp-quote>
<p>When there is a real problem to be solved, one forgives the deficiencies of the garment. (Female family carer)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1471301211416614"><title>A prototype new design</title>
<p>A design project aimed at lessening some of the problems associated with the current patient overall was conducted as a part of the final work of a Masters of Arts candidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211416614">Wikberg 2008</xref>). The need for a new version of the patient overall was expressed by the staff of a nursing home for people with dementia. These goals were set for the new garment: it should allow the wearer to express femininity or masculinity, and their own personal dress style. The garment should serve the necessary functions and technical requirements, but it should also be aesthetically pleasing and not make the wearer stand out from the other nursing home residents.</p>
<p>Care-Wear was the name given to the new design. It looks like a normal two-piece outfit, but has the functional solutions needed. The garment is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1471301211416614">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1471301211416614">3</xref>. As the upper and the bottom part can be separated, it allows more ways of combining the pieces to create different styles, colour combinations and either more feminine or masculine style. The shirt can be attached either to trousers with long legs or to culottes. The underpants areattached to the upper garment, to protect the incontinence pads and open from the front to make dressing easier. Trousers are pulled on and attached to the upper garment by means of a horizontal zipper, that way making the outfit a one-piece suit. The fabric used in the prototype was 95 percent bamboo and five percent lycra fibres.
<fig id="fig2-1471301211416614" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Patient overall and Care-Wear.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1471301211416614-fig2.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig3-1471301211416614" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Care-Wear.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1471301211416614-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Familiar movements and rituals when dressing can support the wearers’ sense of time and place and ability to continue carrying out familiar movements and procedures. Getting dressed and undressed is done the same way as with ordinary clothing, the shirt is pulled on over the head and the trousers pulled on as usual. Also going to the toilet and changing incontinence pads follows the normal routine where one lifts up the hem of the shirt and pulls down the trousers. Difficulties in time orientation can also cause challenging behavior and sleep deprivation. The Care-Wear outfit is a day outfit, and changing the clothes for night is likely to support thewearers’ diurnal rhythm. The garment is designed not to be visually stigmatizing for the wearer or to make visible their dementia or incontinence problems. The Care-Wear prototype is currently in use in a nursing home and the model rights are protected.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1471301211416614" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Patient overalls are a part of the reality of care practice and management, at least in Finland. The restricted elements of the patient overall lead to more ethical issues being associated withit than to clothing provided by the care institutions in general. In some countries, person-centred care practices are more advanced and the use of the person's own clothing is the rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211416614">Twigg, 2010</xref>). In countries where people with dementia wear clothing provided by the care institution newly designed garments are needed that better meet the wearer's needs. That was the aim of the development project described.</p>
<p>Designers can do their share in designing products that dignify rather than stigmatize people with dementia. But their role is limited: they are unable to change the care practices or care culture or obtain better resources for the services. At the moment, national guidelines estimate that there should be at least 0.5–0.6 care workers per resident in residential care and that between 0.7 and 0.8 is a good level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211416614">National Framework for High-Quality Services for Older People, 2008</xref>), but the level is much lower in many institutions, especially during the nights.</p>
<p>The original design of the patient overall was based on the needs expressed by carers, not by the people wearing them. Patient overalls are used because family carers and formal carers are willing to protect the person with dementia from expressing socially inappropriate behavior. When this is done by preventing the actions of wearers, their dependence on carers is increased. The use of a patient overall benefits family carers or care staff by making it possible to control the wearer's needs for assistance in dressing and toileting. The use of methods that materialize the power relationship in care situations always risks them being used unnecessarily and in ways that may harm the care recipient. Such products also communicate the wearers' fragility and how their needs are met in care services. Even if the product is designed to be more dignifying, the design itself cannot solve the ethical dilemma concerning use. That is why guidelines and regulations are needed for the use of such products.</p>
<p>Restricting a person by means of a patient overall is different from tying a person to a chair or a bed, something that is regulated in many countries. However, it can be classified as a restrictive method. Guidelines are needed to convey when the use of the patient overall isallowed, the time period for which it can be used, and the procedure for deciding on the use. As long as such regulations do not exist, the misuse of restricting methods is possible and more likely.</p>
<p>When reading the online advertisements for patient overalls, one can see that the products' functions are expressed in a gentle and subtle way. It may be that modesty related to issues ofincontinence and socially inappropriate undressing has prevented direct discussion. Through this article we hope to raise this and several other questions for international discussion: How can the challenges related to undressing and incontinence be solved withoutresorting to patient overalls in those countries where it is not permitted? The use of patient overalls can be defined as a non-pharmaceutical method. Other non-pharmaceutical methods used include rehabilitation, better design of physical care environments or raising thepatient–carer ratio. What other non-pharmaceutical methods are possible? Do other countries have guidelines on these kinds of garments? And how much are pharmaceuticals used?</p>
<p>In Finland, patient overalls are often financed through the small annual budgets assigned to care wards. As a consequence the patient overalls in use may be physically worn out. This limited funding also has an impact on the development of such products: a niche market provides scarce opportunities for product development. The outworn appearance of such garments also communicates that the wearers are in a socially low position and that the quality of the care environment is not adequate.</p>
<p>In the Finnish care system medical textiles are often owned, rented and maintained by industrial laundries, and this is sometimes the case with patient overalls as well. In industrial laundries the textiles are washed and dried in high temperatures, considerably limiting the options in terms of viable fabrics, colours and design details for the garments. If fabrics other than those suitable to industrial laundries could be used, it would give more possibilities for the designers to meet the various needs of the wearers.</p>
<p>Julia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211416614">Twigg (2010)</xref> has written about ‘a standardized appearance of the dementia patient’ in her article concerning clothing and dementia, referring to the polyester garments commonly used in care homes in the UK. Our concern is that in Finland a dementia patient either does not wear their own clothes at all, or that their own clothes are combined with the garments provided by the care institution shared by other residents. Wearing institutional clothing devalues the role of clothing in interaction and as a part of selfhood or personhood. In addition, it is a method of domination that removes from a person the capacity to determine their appearance and, rather, imposes a unisex, stigmatized or infantilized appearance that goes against the cultural norms concerning clothing. All these aspects came up in the interviews when talking about patient overalls.</p>
<p>We conclude that when designing products for people with dementia and for dementia care, it is essential not to stigmatize the user. We argue that textiles designed for this user group should be designed in a way that supports and maintains the daily routines and agency of theperson. If we want to improve the physical care environment, all the actors involved should be ready to compromise and be willing to focus on the main aims of the care services, and to clarify the core values in care provision and care practices. It should always be remembered that the utmost priority must be the well-being of the person in care. If efficiency is made the main priority, it is impossible thereafter to guarantee good quality services.</p>
