<p>There is an increasing awareness of the importance of child public health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987112442763">Blair et al., 2010</xref>) and family public health, both in terms of the health of the individual child and family, and the contribution the health of each individual makes to the long term health of communities and populations:<disp-quote>
<p>All children should be able to enjoy their childhood, in a supportive and nurturing environment, and be protected from harm. Children’s physical, emotional, language and cognitive development from pregnancy to age five are the foundations of the rest of their lives, influencing what and how they learn, their physical and mental health, friendships and relationships, and later vocations and careers. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987112442763">Department for Education/Department of Health, 2011</xref>: 8)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Reports by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987112442763">UNICEF (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987112442763">2011</xref>) which demonstrate the challenges to child health in different parts of the world, as well as improvements that are being achieved, reinforce the importance of the focus within the Millennium Development Goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987112442763">United Nations, 2011</xref>) on the health of children. Increasingly, research evidence from disparate fields including: genetics, brain physiology, psychology, education and public health nursing on child public health is being brought together in ways that make such evidence accessible to practitioners, families and policy makers. For example, in the UK, an Evidence Pack to support work with families in the early years has been produced which distils the research evidence in the key areas of: children’s health; good maternal mental health; quality of parenting and parent-child relationships; learning activities and high quality early education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987112442763">Department for Education/Department of Health, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Public health nurses and health visitors have much to contribute to this international movement both in terms of generating, being aware of, and making use, of the research evidence. There may, however, be a need for mechanisms to support the sharing of knowledge, beyond journal publications, between public health nurses and health visitors to enhance their contribution to the interdisciplinary approach needed to promote child and public health. For example, the Child Public Health Special Interest Group (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.cphig.org.uk">www.cphig.org.uk</ext-link>) which has as its aim: ‘to raise the profile of child public health (CPH) among paediatricians and public health practitioners’ does not list on its web site affiliation to the Community Practitioners’ and Health Visitors’ Association, the largest organisation for public health nurses/health visitors in the UK, suggesting a lack of cross disciplinary connection with the public health nursing workforce.</p>
<p>In recognition of the importance of networking of community nurses, including public health nurses, to the dissemination of research evidence and in generating new research activity, the network organisation <italic>International Collaboration for Community Health Nursing Research</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.icchnr.org">www.icchnr.org</ext-link>) was established in 1995. This is an international organisation which works with local community and public health nursing organisations to run conferences and symposia. These enable public health nurses to learn about current and completed research in different parts of the world; to present their own work and to hear keynote papers from leaders in public health nursing. The next conference to be run on 13 and 14 March 2013, by ICCHNR is a partnership with the Queen’s Nursing Institute Scotland entitled: <italic>Transforming Community Health: The Nursing Impact</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.qnis.org.uk">www.qnis.org.uk</ext-link>), a title which neatly illustrates the value of community nursing research to improvements in community health.</p>
<p>The conferences and symposia enable participants to have contact with researchers from around the world offering the potential to develop international collaborative projects. The work of Kendall and colleagues in Japan provides an illustration of the value of such networking to the generation of research knowledge that is directly related to child public health and was initiated through the ICCHNR network. This work is around parenting and the importance of parenting support in the community for the wellbeing of children and parents themselves. The study, funded by the British Council PMI2 programme, enabled public health nurses, psychologists and mental health nurses in England and Japan to share cross-cultural knowledge of parenting support and to carry out a comparative study of parenting support outcomes, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987112442763">Kendall et al., submitted</xref>). Japanese public health nurses were able to engage in parenting support using a structured programme for the first time and to evaluate the outcomes. Interestingly, it was found that parents in Japan experience many of the same issues that English parents face and that a parenting programme does increase their self-efficacy as parents and reduce stress. The researchers hypothesise that these changes in parents will lead to longer-term benefits for children, which they hope to test in a future study. In the meantime, the Japanese public health nurses continue to use the programme within their community and collate data that will inform public health practice around parenting.</p>
<p>A further development for international networking and co-operation for the health of young people has emerged from the Health Behaviour of School Aged Children survey (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.hbsc.org">www.hbsc.org</ext-link>) that is co-ordinated by the World Health Organisation. The database of information about how young people themselves respond to a range of health related issues is vast and has been collected since 1982. One of its main aims is ‘to increase understanding of young people’s health, the findings from the HBSC surveys are used to inform and influence health promotion and health education policy and practice at national and international levels’. The English dataset is co-ordinated by Brooks and colleagues and has already thrown some important light on the way that young people’s health behaviours are changing within England in comparison with other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987112442763">Fenton et al., 2010</xref>). Significantly, the researchers are exploring the use of an assets based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987112442763">Morgan and Ziglio, 2007</xref>) to young people’s health, drawn from the concept of salutogenesis proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987112442763">Antonovsky (1996)</xref>. These international data and the assets approach to health promotion have enormous relevance to public health nurses world-wide and much more use should be made of these developments in public health nursing education and training so that it is extended into practice.</p>
<p>To further promote networking between all public health nurses, including practitioners as well as researchers and educationalists, the Japanese Nurses Association is leading the development of an International Public Health Nursing Network as a network of the International Council of Nurses (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.icn.ch">www.icn.ch</ext-link>). Community based practitioners are in the ideal position to identify research questions concerning the health of children and their families and networks enable the sharing of these ideas with public health nursing researchers with the aim of strengthening the evidence base for child public health.</p>
<p>Networks are known to provide support to members of communities and to enhance community wellbeing and resilience as Gilchrist comments: ‘While the physiological mechanisms for this resilience are unclear, it is probable that social networks provide a variety of forms of support and affirmation, including practical advice around health matters’ (2007: 142). Public health nurses and health visitors are expert in supporting the development of networks to enhance the health of people in their practice areas. What is needed now is for public health nurses and health visitors to make use of their skills in networking to further enhance and strengthen their research contribution to the public health challenges experienced by children and families.</p>
