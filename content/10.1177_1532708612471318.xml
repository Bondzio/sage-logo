<abstract>
<p>Reflecting on his five decades of passionate involvement in justice scholarship, teaching, and community action, a senior scholar offers some observations about the long path from Plato to Rawls, and how this relates to daily practice and political involvement. The Western justice tradition is very cerebral and rational, whereas real-world involvements are very emotional and ethically ambiguous. What does one need to know to be a conscious and ethical actor in the daily world of practical action and community politics? Is one’s intellectual the best guide? One’s emotions? What does justice mean?</p>

<p>Everyone takes the limits of his own vision for the limits of the world.</p>

<p>I completed my undergraduate education at Indiana University in 1963, and during these years I became a civil rights advocate, worker, and protester. I then spent 4 years as an officer in the U.S. Navy, between 1963 and 1967, which included two tours of duty in the Vietnam War. I began my graduate education at San Diego State University in 1967, and during this time I also participated in the antiwar movement protesting the Vietnam War, with my sociology graduate student friends. I completed my graduate education at the University of California, San Diego, and in 1972, I accepted a tenure-track position in the Department of Sociology at Arizona State University. During my graduate education I maintained two passionate interests, the first in the ethereal realm of social theory and the second in the mundane realm of daily life. I was fascinated by the relations between these two realms.</p>
<p>For the first decade of my teaching career I continued with these two intellectual passions. I frequently taught the Departmental course on classical sociological theory, and in addition I taught courses on deviance, social problems, and social policy. This was before I moved to the field of justice studies, so I taught these courses as sociology courses. But in retrospect I think it is fair to say that my interests in classical social theory were animated by justice interests and normative concerns. In the writings of the French philosophers there were clear expressions about freedom, equality, and fraternity, and such issues were barely below the surface of the early social scientists who claimed the mantel of science for their work. In the so-called scientific socialism of Karl Marx there is a clear normative valuation for human equality among all workers, and in the early Marx this is further mixed with other noble virtues. In the classic works of Emile Durkheim it is easy to identify normative values of community and fraternity. And in the complex writings of Max Weber we find impassioned advocacy for peace, freedom of thought, and democracy.</p>
<p>In 1982, I moved to the School of Justice Studies and began teaching the core course on Justice Theory. Like other sociologists before and after me, I began to change my sociological theory course into a justice theory course, now beginning with the Sophists, Plato, Aristotle, and so on. I began using Plato’s <italic>Republic</italic> as a required text for undergraduates, since few American students had read this earlier in their education. In the <italic>Republic</italic>, Socrates asks “What is Justice?” and he interrogates and ridicules his fellow Athenians who deign to answer. Socrates’ substantive answer to the question “What is Justice?” is easily dismissed by modern standards and values, for the city-state he envisions is slave-holding, racist, sexist, classist, ageist, elitist, and totalitarian. But this remains a classic text because it raises one very fundamental question, the relationship between individual citizens and the larger social order of justice and injustice. We may disparage Socrates’ specific answer for his social setting of 2,400 years ago in the ancient Hellenic city-states, but we continue to struggle with an answer to that question today. When compared to Plato, Aristotle’s writings, especially those found in <italic>Nichomachean Ethics</italic>, seem more temperate, measured, and common-sensical, but he too struggles to answer the larger question about justice as a personal or cultivated virtue of individuals versus justice or its absence in the larger social order.</p>
<p>Over time I added and dropped many other theorists and writers to my Justice Theory course; St. Thomas Acquinas, several Roman Emperors or Orators, St. Augustine, Thomas Hobbes, the French philosophers, the British empiricists and utilitarians, the Scottish moralists, the German idealists and their critics, the critical theorists, postmodernists, feminists, queer theorists, and so on. The theoretical portion of my course usually concluded with John Rawls, Michael Sandel, and Alasdair MacIntyre. Throughout my teaching I would ask how these abstract theories related to daily life or mundane social policies, and I accumulated many examples of both good and bad correspondence between the abstract and the material. Still, in fairness I would have to say that my early teaching of Justice Theory was very cerebral, intellectual, rational, and ideational.</p>
<p>My increasing awareness of the rationalist and cognitive biases of Justice Theory provided the foundation for my 1993 Distinguished Lecture to the S.S.S.I., with the title “In Dispraise of Justice.” The title was intentionally provocative. It included a critique of existing theories of justice, and assertions they had overlooked the role of emotions in human life and action. This emphasis on emotions is one of the important cornerstones of Existential Sociology, as our California group initially articulated in the 1977 anthology by that name, and as additionally expressed in the two remaining volumes of the Existential Sociology trilogy. From their earliest beginnings existentialists have notoriously emphasized the emotionality of daily life, not as a corrective to Western rationalism but as a basic reorientation that conceives the ideational and cognitive aspects of human living to follow in the wake of a primordial emotionality. To put this differently, our ideas and thoughts stem from, flow from, and express the underlying emotions that give birth to them. So my purpose in the article “In Dispraise of Justice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532708612471318">Johnson, 1995</xref>) was to reorient this field or domain to the fundamental emotionality of our lives, especially our concerns and interests with justice. Despite this rational argument about emotionality, I remained personally caught up with the ideas about justice in my teaching and writing. I criticized the early theories for their failure to fully capture or express human emotionality, but I did so as if emotions were just one more “variable” in a positivist equation or formula.</p>
<p>Throughout this early to middle period of my academic career, I remained involved in my community and political activities. Beginning in the 1970s, I helped create seven nonprofit organizations, mostly dealing with domestic violence or crime issues. I spent most of my first sabbatical leave working at a shelter for battered women, and I served on many boards of the agencies or organizations I helped create. I found this involvement to be enormously invigorating and refreshing for me personally. It was an immediate, practical kind of involvement. I worked with people who were nonacademics, but kindred spirits who were often very bright, talented, and passionate about their causes and commitments. Living inside one’s head as an intellectual or academic can become very obsessive and neurotic, commonly leading to or sustaining anger, rage, depression, alienation, and withdraw from the daily world. Being involved with fellow compatriots and colleagues in some social movement organization is the antidote for this; it communalizes our common burdens and instills an ethical perspective built on one’s relationships rather than one’s abstract ideas about right and wrong.</p>
<p>Pragmatic action in the daily life of community or political movement takes one into the swamp of compromise, the quagmire of ethical compromise. I have many stories, some of them now humorous after so many years have passed. At the shelter for battered women we fabricated records and statistics to receive our quarterly allotment of money for the women, all because the bureaucratic requirements forced us into a no-win situation. We once sent one of our employees, with blackened face and burglar’s tools, to steal food from St. Mary’s Food Bank. This is funny when one knows that St. Mary’s Food Bank <italic>gives away</italic> their food to local worthies. But we had used our monthly allotment, and had 30 women and children to feed, and so it seemed reasonable to burglarize St. Mary’s Food Bank rather than a local commercial grocery store. I tell this story because I assume my audience will interpret it with a certain noble or Robin Hood perspective, but I will leave out other stories that suggest more sinister or dark (criminal) motives or purposes. I have noticed this about many other aspects of my life too; I can now create a very humorous or compelling story out of some lived experience that was originally very painful, excruciating, and ethically problematic. This is often the way it is in the swamp of pragmatic action; individuals are commonly placed in reactive or responsive situations, where one responds to one injustice by choosing another injustice. Resources are always minimal and strained, there is never enough to do what the group wants or needs, there is always too much to do, and too little time to do it, by individuals who are often exhausted. There is never enough power to fight the local powers and hegemonies; the situation is often futile and hopeless. When one adds to this minor or very egregious crimes by our own employees against the battered women we were sworn to protect, like stealing from the purses of the battered women for their own private gain, it is difficult to maintain the moral high ground in such situations. This is hardly a setting for a would-be ethical actor or justice worker.</p>
<p>I first became a parent at age 38, and this is another experience that will knock down one’s high intellectual or moral conceits. Being a primary caregiver of two young children taught me many important lessons; the first and most important lesson is that the children are the teachers, and we are the students. Small children demand that we are present in the moment, and this teaching is more profound than thousands of hours in Buddhist meditation. When one pays attention to the development of one’s children, it is clear that our human nature is profoundly social, and builds from an early foundation of empathy and attachment to others. This direct experience of my children’s teaching truly transformed my life, and continues to do so even today, when they are 32 and 29 in age. This did not happen because I made some grandiose decision about values or morality or ethics, it happened because I felt a passionate love and empathy for my children, and the passionate commitment to orient my awareness to their best interests and needs, as opposed to some selfish needs of my own ego.</p>
<p>The world of human contact is our salvation, however, and a needed corrective to the pure intellectualism of the university. We reclaim our selves in face-to-face contact, and in the quality of our relations with friends, colleagues, kindred spirits, and fellow justice workers. We engage in practical actions, and in so doing we reclaim our humanity, our connections to others. We have meals together, we do things together, and importantly, we laugh together. I would be remiss if I were to suggest that all this serious justice business is without laughs; indeed, the famous Christian scholar for whom this university is named, Erasmus, ridiculed and satirized the doctrinal rigidity of the church teaching, and in so doing created new openings for dialogue. In Arizona, our entire Amnesty International group once participated in a parade wearing pink underwear to ridicule our local Arizona sheriff. (The Sheriff dyed all of the jail-issued underwear pink as a result of such large underwear loses from men sent outside the jail on work-release during the day.) We rode on the back of a truck, on which we had constructed a jail cell made from plastic pipes. We received the cheers and jeers of the crowd, and then after the parade we went home to disassemble the jail cell, and smoke some good weed, have a few beers and a few laughs. Life-long friendships are built from such relationships. From personal experience I can tell you that it is very difficult to feel isolated and alienated when wearing pink underwear in the midst of a parade.</p>
<p>Our human friendships and relations create alternate worlds, renewing ourselves while manifesting the world we envision in our desires and hopes. Most of my own political involvements have been reactive in nature, I reflect with some chagrin, but still in that reaction a new future is manifested. We invent all this as we go along, and happily we have friends and compatriots to guide, change, correct, and celebrate with us along the path. This is how justice is really created. It is not created in the classroom for Justice Theory, but in the mundane realms of daily life, where we are present with our brothers and sisters. Our actions are like a mirror held up to ourselves, to reflect back on our actions, to make good decisions and to make mistakes, to be ethical and unethical as we progress toward a more enlightened path. We have a profound empathy for those who suffer in our current world; this is real impact of studying the social sciences, to feel at one with those who are oppressed, dehumanized, and devalued in our current globalized nonculture. Our real-world experience is an embodied experience, and it is the window to experience another’s plight and struggle for justice, as if it were our own. We join with others to become more alive, to become more connected to others, and in this manner learn more about our place and situation in the larger scheme of things. This is the real impact of studying the humanities and the social sciences, to reach beyond the small domain of our own ego to expand our companionship, empathy, intimacy, and sense of belonging with others; to expand beyond ourselves to participate with and belong to a larger community; to be embedded in more complex webs of meaning and justice. This is often the impact of traveling and visiting other cultures. Many of those who visit non-Western cultures such as India, Tibet, Bhutan, Southeast Asia, Africa, and much of South America are moved by encounters with many kind, compassionate, loving people, often involved in their own daily struggles for justice, making it very clear that one does not require a university course in Justice Theory to know what needs to be known to love and struggle for justice. We renew ourselves in each interaction with others, and create the justice we embody with our interactions and presence. To some extent this comes down to a question of human nature. Did the materialists and utilitarians from past centuries get it right about our self-serving, aggressive, pleasure-seeking, and potentially violent nature? If you believe that, then I suggest there is little hope for making progressively informed choices concerning the fundamental problems that now threaten our human existence on this planet. Or do you think our more current research from brain science, attachment research, neurology, genetics, and transdisciplinary initiatives have it right about our fundamentally social nature, that even in our human complexity and diversity we are driven to associate with and seek the affection and recognition of our community members, that our expanding technologies and communications have led us to include more and more people in our webs of empathy and community, and that despite the disasters and tragedies that await us in the future, we will ultimately prevail to create sustainable and just adaptations for life on this planet. For me personally, when I am living inside my head at the university, I tend to become morose and pessimistic about this, but when I am working in the trenches of social action our in the community, creating emergent webs of meaning with my flawed kindred spirits, than I become much more hopeful and optimistic that someday we will get it right. We <italic>are</italic> the justice we seek to create in the world, whether we like it or not.</p>
