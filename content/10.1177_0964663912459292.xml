<abstract>
<p>Striptease venues have been the subject of considerable public debate following the emergence of highly visible ‘lap dancing’ clubs in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Accused of promoting forms of criminality and nuisance, the state and the law has nonetheless stopped short of banning such venues in England and Wales, with Section 27 of the <italic>Policing and Crime Act 2009</italic> allowing for regulation through locally devolved systems of licensing. This article accordingly analyses the licensing of sexual entertainment venues (SEVs) enacted at the local level and demonstrates how the deployment of these local powers is capable of removing such businesses from select cities simply on the basis that they are ‘out of place’. Given this is a form of spatial regulation against which there is little legal recourse, the article highlights the particular role played by municipal law in the regulation of sexuality, stressing the growing importance of environmental, planning and licensing law – as opposed to criminal law – as a means of regulating sexual conduct.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite important variations in national responses to sexual commerce, in recent times the legality of clubs providing striptease and ‘adult’ entertainment has been widely questioned (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912459292">Hanna, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0964663912459292">Jeffreys, 2008</xref>; Liepe Levinson, 2002; Magnanti, 2012). In England and Wales, for example, the emergence of lap dance and pole dancing clubs since the mid-1990s has prompted significant policy debate, with the opening of such clubs routinely opposed by local resident and business groups as well as those arguing that such clubs represent a pernicious and damaging ‘sexualisation’ of society (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0964663912459292">Bindel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0964663912459292">Eden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0964663912459292">Patiniotis and Standing, 2012</xref>). One consequence was that the <italic>Policing and Crime Act 2009</italic> contained new adoptive powers allowing for the tighter regulation of such clubs by adding the category of Sexual Entertainment Venue (SEV) to the list of sex establishments controlled by the <italic>Local Government (Miscellaneous Powers) Act 1982</italic>. Under the terms of this legislation, any premise where a live display of nudity is provided to a paying audience ‘solely or principally for the purposes of sexual stimulation’ on more than ‘eleven occasions…within the period of 12 months’ (Section 27, schedule 2A) needs to be licensed in the same manner as a sex shop or sex cinema. Previously, under the <italic>Licensing Act 2003</italic>, such venues were licensed via a waiver to a public entertainment license and permitted subject to licensing conditions so long as there were no serious concerns raised by licensing officers about public order, public safety, nuisance or child protection (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0964663912459292">Hadfield and Measham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0964663912459292">Hough and Hunter, 2008</xref>). However, under the clauses in the <italic>Policing and Crime Act 2009</italic>, a license may be refused simply if the local authority determines that:
<disp-quote>
<p>…the number of sex establishments, or of sex establishments of a particular kind, in the relevant locality at the time the application is determined is equal to or exceeds the number which the authority consider is appropriate for that locality [<italic>or</italic>] that the grant or renewal of the licence would be inappropriate, having regard (i) to the character of the relevant locality (ii) to the use to which any premises in the vicinity are put; or (iii) to the layout, character or condition of the premises, vehicle, vessel or stall in respect of which the application is made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0964663912459292">Home Office, 2010</xref>: p. 10).</p>
</disp-quote>Given a ‘locality’ is defined by the local authority, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0964663912459292">Kolvin (2010</xref>: p. 65) concludes the new powers give authorities ‘a high degree of control, even amounting to an embargo, on licenses for particular types of sex establishment within particular localities’, noting that ‘the width of the discretion is consolidated by the absence of any appeal against a refusal on this ground’.</p>
<p>In this article, we argue that the discretion now given to local authorities to ban lap dancing on the basis that it is inappropriate in a particular locality represents a significant example of how municipal law – as opposed to criminal law – can shape sexual conduct and morality. With a few honourable exceptions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0964663912459292">Valverde and Cirak, 2003</xref>), there has been little sociolegal analysis of municipal law as a technique of sexual governance, which on the surface is explicable given it is primarily concerned with the governance of premises rather than the policing of individuals. Indeed, much of the literature on the governance and regulation of sexuality has focused on the role of policing and the deployment of criminal law in the maintenance of sexual conduct (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0964663912459292">Ashford, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0964663912459292">Colter et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0964663912459292">Johnson, 2007</xref>). However, in this article, we demonstrate that municipal law can censor entertainment, take on a surveillance role, and significantly augment policing powers as they pertain to sexualities. In this sense, it is important to note that when municipalities make ‘common sense’ judgments about where lap dancing is appropriate (or not), they exercise a form of control over sexual conduct to which there is little right of appeal because of the assumption written into municipal law that a local authority is best able to decide what belongs where in its own jurisdiction.</p>
<p>As such, this article provides a case study of how municipal law can govern sexual conduct via a regulation of space. Here, we follow Mariana <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0964663912459292">Valverde (2005</xref>: p. 36) in defining municipal laws as revolving around ‘access to, control over, and enjoyment of spaces, buildings, parcels of land, and other largely material entities’ and suggest that this focus on land use rather than individual’s conduct per se bequeaths local government with considerable power to impose a <italic>moral geography</italic>. This article demonstrates this through an exploration of how local policies and license determinations for SEVs are creating a variegated landscape of regulation in which local discretion appears total. To these ends, the article draws on a survey of all 348 local authorities with licensing powers in England and Wales as well as analysis of the 131 SEV applications determined in the first two years of the new regulatory regime (which took effect on 6 April 2010 in England) to demonstrate the evidential powers that local authority licensing officers and (especially) licensing committees now have to influence the location and operating conditions of lap dance clubs. Situating licensing within the wider armoury of municipal powers that local authorities use to impose urban order, the article concludes that more attention needs to be devoted to the local discretion that produces highly divergent landscapes of sexual freedom and constraint.</p>
<sec id="section2-0964663912459292">
<title>Sexuality and municipal law</title>
<p>One of the rights claims commonly made by those who experience, or feel, discrimination, is the right to city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0964663912459292">Attoh, 2011</xref>). Reclaiming the city’s streets, for example, has become an important tactic for making rights claims, with the playful appropriation, occupation and transformation of urban space having been a feature of multiple campaigns for civil rights. More broadly, the right to the city has become a key thematic in sociolegal scholarship, given it entails consideration of who is able to inhabit the city and on what terms (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0964663912459292">Cunningham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0964663912459292">Layard, 2010</xref>). Rather than taking the city’s divisions and sequestrations as given, such scholarship considers the city as both a political instrument for state control and the basis on which particular property relations are reproduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0964663912459292">Blomley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0964663912459292">Mitchell, 2003</xref>). In this light, arguing for the right to the city is a call to transform the power relations that underlie the production of space, fundamentally shifting control away from capital and the state and toward urban inhabitants (see especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0964663912459292">Harvey, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Whilst notions of rights to the city are often freighted with utopian idealism and radical intent, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0964663912459292">Attoh (2011</xref>) suggests that in Western democracies, municipal law continues to play a crucial role in mediating and shaping these rights claims. Here, municipal law denotes the range of planning regulations, land use zoning instruments, environmental policies and building codes designed to ensure urban orderliness and an effective use of land, as determined by the local authority or municipality. Such municipal law shapes rights to the city in a number of significant ways. For example, it is evident that the law can reproduce or challenge particular rights claims through development control and building regulations that constrain the production of space by particular social groups or communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0964663912459292">Keenan, 2010</xref>). Likewise, zoning the city into distinct areas reserved for retail, industrial and residential land uses places limits on the range of functions that a space might fulfil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0964663912459292">Beckett and Herbert, 2010</xref>). In this respect, it is significant that municipal law tends to be enforced not so much by police but by ‘street-level bureaucrats’ including planners, environmental health inspectors, public health officials, licensing officers and local councillors who have a relatively narrow interest in influencing rights to property and development rather than intervening in the broader terrain of human and civil rights (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0964663912459292">Proudfoot and McCann, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This given, the deployment and local interpretation of municipal law is described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0964663912459292">Valverde (2005</xref>) as a fundamentally important (and <italic>flexible</italic>) form of governmentality, albeit one whose role is often overlooked in critical legal scholarship despite its evident power. The key exceptions here explore the legal production of property (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0964663912459292">Blandy and Sibley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0964663912459292">Blomley, 2010</xref>) and the regulation of public space (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0964663912459292">Blomley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0964663912459292">Blumenberg and Ehrenfeucht, 2008</xref>). Collectively, such work shows that even though dominant notions of citizenship are based on certain assumptions about the right to enjoy one’s property as well as the rights to access public spaces of the city freely and without fear, conflicts between these different rights claims are always resolved locally with reference to the ‘urban good’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0964663912459292">Valverde, 2005</xref>). This means that rights secured via the nation or federal state – right to assembly, freedom of expression, rights to development and so on – are frequently overturned where it is decided in the public interest to do so because it will ensure the best possible use of land:
<disp-quote>
<p>At the local level, use is an absolutely crucial legal technology, whose effects are best understood if we contrast governing through use to governing through persons. One difference with crucial political effects is that while the governance of persons through law has in recent decades undergone a number of changes increasing due process rights and antidiscrimination protection, uses, unlike persons, are not rights bearers at all. Changes in such areas as planning law thus proceed from causes other than political changes in rights consciousness or rights allocations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0964663912459292">Valverde, 2005</xref>: p. 38).</p>
</disp-quote>Planners, environmental health inspectors, public health officials, licensing officers and local councillors are accordingly empowered to monitor and control land use to secure particular state objectives. Given the municipal law and policy revolves around the management of land use rather than people, it is perhaps unsurprising the actions of these municipal bureaucrats may well come into conflict with the aims of other state actors for whom the rights of individuals are more important.</p>
<p>A vivid example of municipal law in action is provided by pedestrianism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0964663912459292">Blomley, 2010</xref>). In most jurisdictions, one of the activities undertaken by municipalities is to regulate the use and occupation of sidewalks and pavements: this is something exercised through a diverse set of municipal agencies, including planning departments, civil engineers and utility companies (Blumenberg and Ehrenfeucht, 2008). Perceived part of the commons, there is often, in the eyes of regulators, too much life on the street, and they are forced to adjudicate between different uses and users of sidewalks. In many accounts, the removal of prostitution, panhandlers, street vendors and political activists from the streets is read as an attempt to privatise the commons, removing bodies whose presence threatens the prime function of the ‘neoliberal’ city as a space for leisured consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0964663912459292">Atkinson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0964663912459292">Mitchell, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0964663912459292">Blomley (2010</xref>), however, defers from this perspective, arguing that municipal law does not seek to promote particular forms of consumption/accumulation as that is not its remit: rather, its aim is to enforce an instrumental model of sidewalks where they must function as spaces of circulation. As he notes in the case of Seattle, municipal law rarely utilises a language of purification, censorship or otherness and fully acknowledges begging as a legal right of expression: irrespective, begging is outlawed because the begging body is understood as an ‘unsafe obstruction’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0964663912459292">Blomley (2010</xref>) hence argues that from the perspective of the municipal bureaucrat, the beggar is removed from public sidewalks simply because their sedentary body is viewed as an impediment to mobility, not because the sight of begging offends the leisured consumer. The effect may be the same – a privileging of exchange values over use values – but the municipal law is ultimately underpinned by a desire to secure urban orderliness rather than promoting consumer capitalism.</p>
<p>At face value such observations on the power of municipal law appear to have little to do with questions of sexuality per se. Yet an emerging body of work suggests that there are multiple ways in which municipal law can shape sexual conduct, not least by creating the boundaries between public and private space that underpin obscenity laws and censorship regulations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0964663912459292">Morton, 2011</xref>). Studies of the municipal regulation of spaces of street prostitution (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0964663912459292">Kerkin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0964663912459292">Laing, 2012</xref>), gay bathhouses (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0964663912459292">Prior, 2008</xref>), sex shops (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0964663912459292">Coulmont and Hubbard, 2010</xref>) and public sex environments (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0964663912459292">Andersson, 2012</xref>) also provide examples of how municipal law plays a role in the regulation of sexuality. However, in the majority of these cases, municipal law is implicated in the regulation of the obscene (i.e. that which threatens to corrupt or deprave): striptease, when performed in private spaces, is now defended in many jurisdictions as a form of free speech and nonobscene entertainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912459292">Hanna, 2005</xref>). In England and Wales, for example, striptease does not fall within the threshold of obscenity that might lead to successful prosecution under the <italic>Obscene Publications Act 1959</italic>, and was hence not incorporated in the terms of the <italic>Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982</italic> which introduced regulation for sex cinemas and sex shops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0964663912459292">Kolvin, 2010</xref>). Moreover, recent test cases referring to the European Convention on Human Rights have suggested that adults have a right to buy and sell sexual entertainment (see <italic>Belfast City Council v Miss Behavin’ Ltd, UKHL 13</italic>, 2007). In this sense, the difficulty of applying censorship law to striptease, and the wider acceptance of sexual consumption, means that municipal laws (e.g. zoning ordinances, development control and premise licensing) provide the main mechanisms by which lap dance and related entertainment can be controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0964663912459292">Hubbard et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0964663912459292">McGinnis, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Sexual entertainment and the <italic>Policing and Crime Act 2009</italic></title>
<p>Striptease entertainment has long existed in England and Wales, typically occurring in licensed pubs and working man’s clubs in largely unadvertised manner that attracted little attention. However, the emergence of ‘US-style’ lap dance and gentleman’s clubs in the mid-1990s took striptease from the backstreets to the high Street, locating them firmly within the mainstream economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0964663912459292">Brents and Sanders, 2010</xref>). As had been the case with sex shops some 30 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0964663912459292">Coulmont and Hubbard, 2010</xref>), such shifts excited considerable comment. In many instances, plans to convert premises into lap dance clubs provoked vociferous local campaigns of opposition alleging that such venues create noise and nuisance, attract undesirable elements, and compromise the safety of women, families and young people in their vicinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0964663912459292">Hadfield and Measham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0964663912459292">Hubbard, 2009</xref>). Opponents of lap dance venues routinely argued that their presence intimidates many women and discourages them from participating in nightlife: moreover, there were concerns that (male) customers leaving venues will harass or attack women or children. For example, opposing the conversion of <italic>The Fox</italic> public house, West Kensington, London, to a lap dancing venue, Rachel Marlowe, 34, who led the protests, argued:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is a completely unsuitable area to have a lap-dancing club. There are two primary schools, three nurseries and an all-girls senior school within 200 metres. The bus stop is right outside and women do not want to be propositioned by drunk customers having a cigarette. We are worried about prostitution, drug-dealing and late-night noise (cited in the <italic>The Evening Standard</italic>, 23 October 2008).</p>
</disp-quote>In another instance, the proposed conversion of a music venue in Crouch End, London, prompted considerable protest and a 600-signature petition from local residents, with David Winskell, local councillor, arguing:
<disp-quote>
<p>The first reaction when people heard about this was absolute shock and amazement. Crouch End is a small, local shopping centre with good restaurants and independent family-owned shops. It is a happy family area. People were absolutely stunned. The [<italic>venue</italic>] is pretty well run, but in the past there have been issues with noise and public order and the lives of the local people were made a nightmare. This is not a moral crusade. This is about a development that is totally inappropriate in a residential area where there is a school around the corner (cited in <italic>The</italic> <italic>Evening Standard</italic>, 23 February 2009).</p>
</disp-quote>The suggestion that such clubs do not belong in ‘happy family areas’ underlines that many regard sexual entertainment as contrary to norms of coupling, parenting and domesticity, their imagined negative impacts on public order seemingly based on stereotypes of (in the words of one protestor in Crouch End) ‘unsavoury characters’ and predatory males who have rejected, or are unable to form, monogamous relationships (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0964663912459292">Sanders, 2008</xref> on the stigmatisation of sex workers’ clients).</p>
<p>Such arguments about the negative consequences of lap dance clubs for the safety of women and children clearly resonated with established feminist arguments about the division of the city between a masculine public sphere and a feminized private one. Given studies have repeatedly identified an association between the night-time city and women’s fear of violent crime (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0964663912459292">Roberts and Eldridge, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0964663912459292">Sheard, 2012</xref>), the increasing sexualisation of the night-time economy appeared to be reinforcing patriarchal ideas that women can enter the city at night only on men’s terms as part of the sexual spectacle of the city. This was a theme emphasized in the work of the antisexual objectification group, Object, who in 2008 launched a major campaign (Stripping the Illusion) designed to push for tighter regulation of lap dance clubs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0964663912459292">Object’s (2008</xref>: p. 8) widely publicised report <italic>A Growing Tide</italic> states ‘lap-dancing clubs have a negative impact on the safety and well being of women living and working in the vicinity, both in terms of actual assault and in less measurable effects such as increased harassment and fear of violence’. This claim was supported with reference to a single report on lap dance in Camden, London (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0964663912459292">Eden, 2007</xref>), which concluded that striptease clubs had a significant effect upon women in the local area, with an increase in reported rape noted in the year when a lap dance club opened. Eden's (2007) findings were contested given the link between rates of rape and the proliferation of lap-dancing clubs is difficult to prove (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0964663912459292">Colosi, 2013</xref>). It also needs to be noted that Eden’s findings contrast with some of the legally scrutinised ‘secondary effects’ literature emerging from the United States, which suggest that striptease clubs are often less associated with drunkenness, disorder and noise than other licensed premises in similar locales (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0964663912459292">Edwards, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912459292">Hanna, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0964663912459292">Linz et al., 2004</xref>; for a contrasting view, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0964663912459292">McCleary and Weinstein, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Not withstanding the lack of empirical data convincingly demonstrating negative effects, Object’s campaign – when combined with the efforts of residents, businesses and Members of Parliament (MPs) in affected constituencies – appeared to be significant in prompting the inclusion of clauses concerning lap dance in the <italic>Policing and Crime Act 2009</italic>. A key theme in their campaign was that there was a serious ‘democratic deficit’, with local authorities seemingly unable to respond to the wishes of vocal resident groups by preventing the opening of lap dancing clubs using existing licensing laws.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0964663912459292">1</xref></sup> For example, when introducing the initial Bill proposing the licensing of lap dance clubs as Sex Establishments, Roberta Blackman-Woods, MP, for Durham (North East of England) stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>The <italic>Licensing Act 2003</italic> is not the appropriate measure for granting licenses to lap dancing clubs. My experience of Durham…highlights the Act’s weaknesses most clearly. Durham received an application for a lap dancing license to 2.30 am for a premises…located on a street that acts as the main gateway to the city, adjacent to the bus station and on a main route to the city centre from the railway station. It is also in close proximity to the world heritage site and city centre, across the road from a youth club and in the vicinity of three churches. Some 1,000 residents live within a 500 m radius. In the views of local people, the application contravened not only local licensing policies but a number of Government licensing objectives. The application was heard at the beginning of August, when everyone was on holiday, and it was approved… (House of Commons Debate, <italic>Hansard</italic> 19 March 2008, cc287-9WH).</p>
</disp-quote>Though Blackman’s Bill collapsed at second reading, the addition of clauses to Section 27 of the <italic>Policing and Crime Act 2009 </italic>allowed local authorities to license lap dance premises in the same manner as sex cinemas and sex shops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0964663912459292">Kolvin, 2010</xref>). Justifying this legislative reform, the Culture, Media and Sports Committee on Licensing Reform argued:
<disp-quote>
<p>A lap-dancing establishment is not the same as a pub or nightclub, and interested parties with legitimate concerns should to be able to make representations to the licensing authorities without having to resort to making spurious objections on grounds such as the location of a club’s toilets (DCMS, 2009: section 7, para 123).</p>
</disp-quote>Likewise, Harriet Harman (Minister for Women and Equality) argued, ‘If people don’t want to have a sleazy lap dancing club in their neighbourhood, they shouldn’t be forced to have one, which is why we’re changing the law so local people can object and say ‘we don’t want this’ in our area because it’s a sex establishment’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0964663912459292">2</xref></sup> The implication here was that the new licensing powers will allow local authorities to respond to the concerns that people have about striptease venues and not limit them from closing clubs where there are repeated and demonstrable environmental nuisances or instances of criminality. As such, the four licensing objectives (public safety, prevention of nuisance, reduction of crime and protection of children) underpinning the <italic>Licensing Act 2003</italic> are no longer the only considerations determining whether a lap dance club can open. For instance, if the number of venues in an area equals or exceeds that which a local authority considers appropriate, this justifies refusal. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0964663912459292">Home Office (2010</xref>, paragraph 3.23) guidance stipulates that ‘it is reasonable and potentially useful to future applicants for a local authority to decide in advance of receiving any applications that certain areas are, or are not, appropriate locations for a sex establishment’, the fact that they can ultimately decide whether a club is appropriate in a given locale means that their discretion is total.</p>
<p>Accordingly, it is licensing that has been deemed the appropriate means of regulating lap dancing in England and Wales. The logic underpinning this decision is clear: ‘arm’s length’ regulation via annual renewal of licenses appears both adequate and ‘proportionate’, being preferred to intrusive policing and surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0964663912459292">Hubbard et al., 2009</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0964663912459292">Valverde and Cirak (2003</xref>) write in the context of alcohol licensing, such regulation is not simply a cheaper means of controlling activities deemed potentially disruptive of morality and order, also it allows the state to sidestep questions of individual liberty and morality, given it regulates the space in which an activity occurs, not the activity itself. The liberal conceit of licensing – that it does not interfere in questions of personal morality – thus belies its illiberal intent as a way of enacting a politics of concealment: ‘questionable’ activities (including gambling, drinking alcohol, and consuming sexual entertainment) remain legal but are restricted to specific urban spaces that are not considered to be public (i.e. are not accessible to minors, only adults) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0964663912459292">Dixon, 1991</xref>, on bookmakers and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0964663912459292">Coulmont and Hubbard, 2010</xref> on sex shops). Licensing is, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0964663912459292">Measham and Moore (2008</xref>) note, part and parcel of the ongoing process in which certain ‘immoral’ practices are commercially exploited while others (e.g. the consumption of illicit drugs) are criminalised. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0964663912459292">Valverde (2003</xref>: p. 237) notes, licensing’s tendency to ‘externalise the state’s duty to manage the risks or urban disorder by delegating it to a nontechnical and nonexpert personnel’ (i.e. venue managers and door staff) should not distract from the fact that local licensing officers, committees and related ‘street-level bureaucrats’ can ultimately exercise considerable discretion in determining which businesses are appropriate in which spaces.</p>

<title>Exercising local discretion</title>
<p>The regulation of SEVs through the licensing system has provoked considerable debate about the appropriateness of venues in particular locales. In this respect, it needs to be stressed that licensing – like other instances of municipal law – tends to be enforced not by police but by the licensing officers who process applications and the elected councillors who approve or refuse them. Since the introduction of the new licensing powers in April 2010, local authority licensing officers and licensing committees have hence devoted considerable energy to debating such issues. A survey of all 348 local authorities with licensing powers in England and Wales<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0964663912459292">3</xref></sup> suggests that, two years on from the introduction of the new powers, all but 33 local authorities had decided upon adoption, including many who have no lap dancing clubs (e.g. rural districts such as Denbighshire, Wales; High Peak, Derbyshire; Purbeck, Dorset; and the Isles of Scilly) and some where lap dancing occurs infrequently or solely on a seasonal basis (e.g. Cheltenham, where lap dancing tends to occur only during the Gold Cup). Significantly, some local authorities where there is existing adult entertainment – namely, Bolton, Charnwood (Loughborough), Derby, Southampton and Swindon – have not adopted the new powers and continue to license lap dance clubs in the same way as other premises. The majority of local authorities with existing lap dancing clubs venues have, however, adopted the powers. While there is no obligation for them to evolve a policy for SEVs, in at least 74 cases the local authorities have also published lengthy policy documents to guide the determination of future applications (the majority of these having undergone public consultation).</p>
<p>Where they exist, policies underline that regulation aims to be proportionate and fair, with the local authority determining any application for an SEV on its merits. As was the case under the <italic>Licensing Act 2003</italic>, most policies set standardized conditions for lap dancing clubs in terms of security, surveillance and safety, dictating that all premises must be lit at all times and have closed circuit television installed. However, there are notable variations in the conditions imposed on the form and content of the entertainment offered in clubs, with some policies suggesting performances must be conducted only on a stage area, to seated patrons, with others (e.g. Oxford, Doncaster, Colchester) insisting on a minimum one-metre separation between dancer and customer (though Doncaster, bizarrely, suggests that it is permissible for customers to place money in a garter worn by a performer). Whilst Paragraph 2A(14) of Schedule 3 of the <italic>Policing and Crime Act 2009</italic> defines a ‘display of nudity’ as exposure of ‘nipples, pubic area, genitals or anus’ for a woman and ‘exposure of pubic area, genitals or anus’ for a man), some local authorities set caveats on this. For example, Blackpool, Bromley (South East London), the City of London, Liverpool, Purbeck (Dorset), Weymouth (Dorset) and Wigan’s policies dictate that performers shall ‘not expose at any time, wholly or partly, their genitalia’; Chelmsford (Essex) likewise dictates that only ‘topless entertainment’ is permissible. Many local authorities – but not all – ban performers using any sex toys or touching another performer’s anus, genitals or breasts and some also suggest performers may not perform any act that simulates a ‘sexual act, use ‘inappropriate, suggestive or sexually graphic language’ or engage in contact of a ‘sexual nature’ with any customer.</p>
<p>As well as encouraging certain modes of conduct within the club, the licensing conditions enshrined in newly drafted policies are designed to alleviate any potential public nuisances. Most notably, there is repeated insistence that there should be no soliciting for business outside the club, and that no part of the interior of the premise should be visible from the public thoroughfare. Any advertisement or signage requires written approval from the local authority. In some cases, these conditions go further to suggest ‘in more sensitive locations applicants should consider whether it would be appropriate to locate such premises at basement level or locate entrances away from retail thoroughfares or busy pedestrian routes’ (e.g. Hart Council, 2010: p. 9). Irrespective of such limited visibility, and the imposition of strict opening hours, all local authorities stress that applications for clubs will be decided with reference to the character of the surrounding area, and:
<disp-quote>
<p>The proximity of residential premises, including any sheltered housing and accommodation of vulnerable people; The proximity of educational establishments to the premises; The proximity of places of worship to the premises; Access routes to and from schools, play areas, nurseries, children’s centres or similar premises; The proximity to shopping centres; The proximity to community facilities/halls and public buildings such as swimming pools, leisure centres, public parks, youth centres/clubs and so on.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0964663912459292">4</xref></sup>
</p></disp-quote>This suggests a desire for a strict demarcation of ‘family’ areas and a distancing between sex premises and spaces where children might routinely be present (irrespective of the fact they would not normally be in the vicinity during the opening hours imposed on the clubs). Based on their reading of the potential impact of lap dancing clubs, some local authorities also insist they will ‘normally only grant licenses in predominately commercial areas’ (Chelmsford Sexual Entertainment Venues Policy, 2010, appendix 2); others stipulate unsuitable locations include ‘gateway’ areas, areas earmarked for regeneration, or even ‘any conservation area’ (Basingstoke Sexual Entertainment Venues Policy, 2010: p. 7). It is common for policies to state that applications will normally be refused in ‘areas that are likely to be adversely affected due to the cumulative impact of existing sex establishments’.</p>
<p>These discretionary grounds for license refusal allow councils to decide on the suitability of a particular locality for a sex establishment determined by the particular circumstances of each case and not via the prescription of boundaries on a map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0964663912459292">Kolvin, 2010</xref>). Yet, there are numerous policies which have followed Home Office guidance by naming localities where they might actually be permitted. Watford’s policy, for example, identifies two areas where lap dancing clubs would be appropriate, only one of which currently contains a venue; in Bournemouth’s Sexual Entertainment Policy (2010: para 7.2), only the Hawkhurst Road, Old Christchurch Road and Triangle areas are identified as suitable, the latter considered appropriate location ‘for no more than two sex establishments, one of which can only be a Lesbian, Gay, Bi-Sexual and Trans-gender lifestyle shop’. In contrast, the London Borough of Hackney policy states:
<disp-quote>
<p>Local people continue to be more concerned about the level of crime than about anything else. Although crime levels have been falling significantly in recent years, attending to the needs of people feeling safe is important. Hackney seeks to further reduce crime and help people feel safer in the borough…It is the Council’s view that having regard to each ward and recognising that because of the mix of uses, the character, the strategic vision and the existing locations of particular types of premises in those wards, it would be inappropriate for sex establishments to be located in its wards… (Hackney Draft Sex Establishment Policy, 2010: p. 6).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0964663912459292">5</xref></sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>This ‘nil’ policy is mirrored elsewhere. Haringey (North London), for example, provides similar justification for its nil policy, arguing that ‘the association sex establishments have with a part of the “sex industry” and adult entertainment means that they are not suitable for location in those parts of the borough associated with commerce, family retail and entrepreneurship, nor are they appropriate for location in residential areas or areas frequented by families and children’ (Haringey Sexual Entertainment Venue Policy, 2010: p. 6). In Winchester (Hampshire), ‘the Council’s vision to achieve balanced, sustainable communities’ would apparently be undermined by the granting of any sex establishment venues, and that ‘this applies equally to the town centre area of Winchester itself and to the villages and market towns within the District’ because of traffic movements and other disturbance (Winchester Sexual Entertainment Venue Policy, 2010: pp. 9–10). In Mid-Sussex’s Sexual Entertainment Venue Policy, 2010: p. 6), even industrial areas are deemed inappropriate for lap dancing clubs, not because of nuisance, but because ‘customers frequenting sex establishments may be vulnerable in these areas, particularly after dark…the Council acknowledges that a sex establishment venue in a business/industrial area does not carry the same risk to vulnerable groups as a residential or retail area. However, it does include a different type of crime risk, due to the loneliness of the operation’.</p>
<p>The idea that there are no suitable localities within a local authority for a lap dancing club has thus allowed numerous local authorities to effect a ban on sexual entertainment: additional examples include North Tyneside, Havant (Hampshire), Enfield (North London), Harrow (North West London), Richmond upon Thames (West London), Tower Hamlets (East London), Wellingborough (Northamptonshire), and the City of London. However, previous appeal cases by sex shops in the 1980s and 1990s suggest such blanket bans may be unreasonable (for summaries see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0964663912459292">Coulmont and Hubbard, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0964663912459292">Kolvin, 2010</xref>), with<italic> R v Newcastle Upon Tyne City Council ex parte The Christian Institute</italic> (2000) suggesting it would be unlawful for a local authority to refuse a license based on its own view that sex establishments should not be allowed <italic>at all</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0964663912459292">Cross, 2010</xref>). This is noted by some local authorities; the London Borough of Bromley, for instance, suggests in its policy it is unable to impose a total ban having regard to Article 8 (Right to respect for private and family life), Article 1 of the First Protocol (Protection of Property), Article 6(1) (Right to a Fair Hearing) and Article 10 (Freedom of expression) of the <italic>Human Rights Act 1998</italic>. In this light, there is some doubt as to whether imposing a nil limit is reasonable, leading some authorities with nil limits to note that in very exceptional circumstances an application might actually be granted. For example, the City Corporation of London SEV Policy (2011: p. 7) argues ‘there are no localities in the City of London in which it is appropriate to license a sexual entertainment venue…This policy is intended to be strictly applied and while the merits of each individual case will be considered it is most unlikely that exceptional circumstances will be found’.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the fact that local authorities have ultimate discretion to judge what is suitable in a given locale means that the economic, aesthetic and prudential basis for imposing ‘moral geographies’ remains largely unquestioned. Simply identifying an area as unsuitable is sufficient to justify refusal of a new license or closure of an existing club, even in the absence of evidence of criminality. This is evidenced through analysis of the determination of the 136 premises that sought an SEV License up to April 2012.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0964663912459292">6</xref></sup> Although the vast majority of these were approved, eleven applications were refused. In each case these refusals were made by licensing committees on the grounds that the award of the license would be inappropriate having regard to the character of the relevant locality. Among these were 10 clubs which had previously been offering lap dancing and similar striptease entertainment on a general premises license: in all but one case the police had no objection to the granting of a license to any of these clubs on grounds of crime and safety. In many instances, the police wrote in a supportive manner about the management of lap dance clubs:
<disp-quote>
<p>Where sexual entertainment venues are well managed, and clear protocols are in place to deal with issues arising, then generally these premises cause few problems. Thames Valley Police are satisfied that [<italic>applicant’s name</italic>] has put much thought and effort into the operation of [<italic>venue name</italic>] which will help in keeping issues relating to crime and disorder to a minimum.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0964663912459292">7</xref></sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>In this particular case, the Licensing Committee considered such arguments, weighing these up against 201 letters of objection from local residents, and determined that the application be refused given ‘the close proximity to a residential area’ (South Buckinghamshire Licensing Committee, 28 November 2011: np). In Leicester, East Midlands, a club was similarly refused a license on the basis that it ‘was close to the entrance of a shopping precinct’ despite a lack of police complaint or, in this case, any letters of public objection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0964663912459292">8</xref></sup> Against this, in a case where the police raised multiple objections about a club’s management and operation (alleging failures to maintain order), and a 443-signature petition was presented objecting to a club (in County Durham), the premise was nonetheless granted a license.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0964663912459292">9</xref></sup> While those on licensing committees draw on their own ‘local knowledge’ in making decisions, the fact that they often make decisions contrary to the advice of police or licensing suggests that the ability of just a few councillors to determine the visibility and location of sexual entertainment is considerable indeed, and worthy of further scrutiny. The potential for ideologically – or morally informed decisions to be made by licensing committees and subcommittees is something that is accentuated in situations where they consist of just four or five councillors, all drawn from the same party (a situation that applied in both Leicester and Durham).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is important to note that local authorities have often been encouraged by local residents to adopt precautionary and exclusionary approaches, and while the <italic>Policing and Crime Act</italic> 2009 was not prescriptive about how local authorities should consult on their policy, some local authorities have made considerable efforts to obtain the views of ‘local people’ (defined as anyone who lives or works in the local authority area). In Hammersmith and Fulham, for instance, 81% of 59 respondents suggested clubs were inappropriate near schools, 65% near places of worship, and 72% near tourist attractions; in Richmond 97% of 98 respondents said the number of SEVs in their locality should be nil, while in Ealing 53% of 57 responses to the public consultation were in favour of a nil limit:
<disp-quote>
<p>There is absolutely no need to license lap dancing clubs or any such premises. The associated treatment of women, alcoholism, and crime is unacceptable when more money can be raised by opening other types of establishments. (anonymous response, Appendix 2 – Consultation on Draft Sex Entertainment Policy, Ealing Licensing Committee agenda papers, 9 December 2010).</p>
<p>Sexual entertainment businesses are NEVER of benefit to the local community and simply draw undesirable characters from other areas. The number of sexual entertainment establishments should be strictly limited and license fees made prohibitively expensive (anonymous response, Appendix A – Consultation on Hammersmith and Fulham Draft SEV Policy, Licensing Committee agenda papers, 3 May 2010).</p>
<p>These establishments encourage the wrong sort of people who are not respectful of local residents right to privacy and quality of life. There are many families in the area and children need protection from the harmful and immoral consequences that sex venues inevitably bring with them (anonymous response to Richmond-upon-Thames SEV consultation, cited in agenda papers, Regulatory Committee, 20 October 2010)</p>
</disp-quote><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0964663912459292">Home Office (2010</xref>: p. 7) guidance states that that under the new regime, local authorities should ignore public objections ‘based on moral grounds/values’ rather than ‘real’ anxieties about crime, nuisance and disorder (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0964663912459292">Home Office, 2010</xref>: p. 7). However, in reading such consultation responses, the impossibility of divorcing moral objections from such considerations becomes all too apparent.</p>

<title>Regulating sexuality, spatially</title>
<p>The introduction of a new licensing regime for SEVs in England and Wales has clearly provided the means for local authorities to exert greater control over lap dancing than previously was the case. However, this should not necessarily be read as representing a suppression or condemnation of lap dancing per se as local authorities have discretion to allow as many lap dance clubs to open as they wish. Indeed, some local authorities have granted licenses to lap dancing clubs in the face of police objections, and others appear content to allow clubs to open where there is no objection. Yet the fact that most local authorities have put forward policies limiting the overall number of clubs to no more than the existing number, and that some have imposed a nil limit, implies that the overall number of premises will gradually reduce. The new fees liable under the SEV Licensing regime are significant here. Lap dance clubs licensed under the <italic>Licensing Act 2003</italic> were liable to an annual fee based on rateable value (typically £635 for a mid-sized venue serving alcohol), with an additional fee for a waiver to allow for lap dance; under the <italic>Policing and Crime Act 2009</italic> local authorities can charge a fee commensurate with the costs of operating sex establishment licensing. These fees – which are generally the same for SEVs as sex shops or sex cinemas – range from £424 in Rochford (Essex) to £24,625 in Greenwich, and average at over £6,800 per annum.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0964663912459292">10</xref></sup> It is perhaps unsurprising that the overall number of lap dance clubs has reduced markedly since the introduction of the new powers: in addition to those clubs refused a license, our survey of local authorities suggests another 70–80 have decided not to apply for a license under the new regime, adopted a new trading model or gone bankrupt.</p>
<p>The introduction of a new licensing regime for lap dance, if not quite marking the death knell for lap dancing in England and Wales, has hence created a more challenging legislative environment for venue operators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0964663912459292">Hubbard, 2009</xref>). In the context of this article, we would also argue that recent legislative change has been significant in so much that the object of regulation is not the performer or the consumer, but the <italic>venue</italic>. Precautionary measures intended to reduce crime and disorder via the closure or restriction of lap dancing venues adjudged ‘out of place’ represent a regulation of sexual conduct through a form of ‘spatial cleansing’ that combines notions of aesthetic and moral order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0964663912459292">Millie, 2008</xref>). Given the <italic>Policing and Crime Act 2009</italic> allows representations to be made by all residents in a local authority, and not just those in the immediate surroundings of a club (as was the case under the <italic>Licensing Act 2003</italic>), there is the potential here for licensing to become entwined in the wider processes which push stigmatized forms of commercial sex away from politically articulate and valued spaces towards socially disorganised, politically inarticulate or poorer areas where it is ‘out of sight and out of mind’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0964663912459292">Edwards, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Alongside the observation that the new regime will result in a gentrification and corporatization of venues, producing a more challenging working environment for performers, and a more expensive one for customers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0964663912459292">Colosi, 2013</xref>), a concern here is that licensing is being used to enable (some) communities to distance themselves from the sights and sounds of commercial sex, not tackle the gender exploitation or sexual harassment that some believe adheres to sexual entertainment. In this respect, it is notable that exploitation, harassment and sexual assault are crimes that can, theoretically, be dealt with through existing criminal law. Irrespective, the way that venues are being subject to the police-type powers of licensing is in keeping with the pre-crime modes of social control which some commentators believe now characterize contemporary society:
<disp-quote>
<p>In a post-crime society there are crimes, offenders and victims, crime control, policing, investigation, trial and punishment, all of which are staples of present criminological enquiry. Pre-crime, by contrast, shifts the temporal perspective to anticipate and forestall that which has not yet occurred and may never do so. In a pre-crime society, there is calculation, risk and uncertainty, surveillance, precaution, prudentialism, moral hazard, prevention and, arching over all these, the pursuit of security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0964663912459292">Zedner, 2007</xref>: p. 261).</p>
</disp-quote>Licensing is a crucial part of this, given it is not remedial but preventative, ‘a hinge that links past-oriented punishment of wrong doing to the future orientated-governance of risks and dangers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0964663912459292">Dubber and Valverde, 2008</xref>: p. 4).</p>
<p>It can thus be suggested that whilst the role of policing can be much wider, the deployment of criminal law is generally <italic>reactive</italic> to perceived disorder. In contrast, municipal law as it has traditionally been conceived is forward-looking, and reformist, seeking to manage land in accordance with a vision of the ideal city. A vivid example of this future orientation is provided by the refusal of a license for a club in Leicester. Here, one justification for refusal was that the premises (which had been operating for some years) were too close to a proposed University sports centre that would be used by students and, in time, local families.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0964663912459292">11</xref></sup> In this case, the fact that the club was licensed and operational before the sports centre was completed was considered irrelevant: ‘common sense’ local knowledge suggested that there would be a conflict of use in the future, and that the lap dance club could not be licensed for this reason. Another example of such anticipatory logic is provided by the planning inspector’s decision to uphold a refusal of planning permission for a lap dance club in Bristol because it ‘could have a materially detrimental effect on schemes for continuing regeneration’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0964663912459292">12</xref></sup> These types of statements are also common in local authority policy statements, where it is suggested that consideration can be given not just of current land use but anticipated land use. Given the difficulty of demonstrating that a premise will not be incompatible with land uses that are yet to be apparent, there is obviously little premise operators can do to challenge such decisions.</p>
<p>All these aspects of the regulation of lap dance clubs in England and Wales point to the power of municipal law to determine whether clubs are able to open in given locales. Hence, while it was not the stated intention of the <italic>Policing and Crime Act 2009</italic> to prevent consenting adults consuming sexual entertainment, in some instances this has been the outcome, given local councillors are able to deploy their own ‘common sense’ understanding that such venues are – or will be – inappropriate in given neighbourhoods. This de facto banning of lap dance in particular locales is significant in the light of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0964663912459292">Home Office (2010</xref>: p. 7) guidance stating that that under the new regime, local authorities should not make determinations based on questions of morality or taste. While all refusals of lap dance clubs are justified in terms of the idea that they are inappropriately located, being ‘too close’ to residential or ‘family’ space, such judgments are always and inevitable suffused with moral assumptions about the nature of lap dancing and its impact on society. As such, it is possible for local authorities to prevent a lap dance opening within 200 m (Hackney), 250 m (Camden), or 500 m (Richmond-on-Thames) from a ‘sensitive land use’ on that basis alone: the possible moral harms of lap dancing on the ‘sensitive’ are left unspoken and unscrutinised. This attempt to sidestep questions of morality is not surprising, given the law’s inability to distinguish between matters of private sexual morality and the public good has long been noted (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0964663912459292">Ashford, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0964663912459292">Carline, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0964663912459292">Johnson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0964663912459292">Scoular and O’Neill, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0964663912459292">Stychin, 2009</xref>). Yet the fact that decisions are cloaked in a language that emphasizes the incompatibility of land uses rather than fears about the impacts of premises means the evident disgust felt by many about the proximity of sex commerce is not registered as a legitimate grounds for refusal (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0964663912459292">Johnson, 2010</xref>, on the role of disgust in obscenity law).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>On the face of it, licensing appears to offer a nondiscriminatory, proportionate, and cost-effective way of regulating sexual entertainment, with the power granted to local authorities under the <italic>Policing and Crime Act 2009</italic>, providing them with total discretion to prevent lap dancing clubs opening in gives locales. To the extent that this allows local authorities to respond to local concerns, this is not a problem in and of itself. Yet in terms of the regulation of sexual conduct, the extent of the new powers demands further scrutiny, not least the fact there is no right of appeal against a judgment that a club is inappropriate in a given locality. Moreover, because licensing takes the city to be its object of regulation, judgments made about whether lap dancing belongs in a particular neighbourhood cannot be easily overturned with reference to rights secured at other scales – such as the right to buy or sell sexual entertainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0964663912459292">Valverde, 2010</xref>). Managing the city evidentially involves making common sense decisions about what belongs where and is not much concerned about the sexual rights of citizens. The very fact that lap dancing has <italic>not</italic> been made illegal in England and Wales means local authorities are able to make decisions which cannot be appealed because they do not deny individuals their rights to buy or sell sexual entertainment, merely their ability to do this legally in particular places. It is this lack of a right of appeal that we argue is particularly significant, as it gives sometimes ad hoc policies their evidential power and ensures the decisions of licensing committees will remain unchallenged and unscrutinised.</p>
<p>This article has not sought to interrogate whether the regulation of lap dance club is proportionate, or whether lap dance clubs are a source of negative externalities that exceed those associated with other licensed venues. In many regards, we would suggest such questions are irrelevant, given that it is a precautionary principle that dominates in the regulation of sexual conduct – in the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0964663912459292">Hebenton and Seddon (2009</xref>: p. 345), regulators have historically been ‘cautious about being cautious’ and have not required unambiguous evidence about the magnitude of risk before acting to remove that risk. Indeed, given the assumption that commercial sex is a site of sexual risk and danger, the decision to remove it from ‘inappropriate’ locales appears commonsensical. This makes any shift in the regulation of sexuality from deployments of the criminal law to environmental, planning and licensing law highly significant, for, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0964663912459292">Valverde (2005</xref>) notes, regulation through use is rarely perceived as upholding morality, merely determining the best use of land. We accordingly conclude by arguing that licensing needs to be analysed as a technique of governmentality that works alongside policing in the construction of social and moral orders, and, moreover, that critical legal scholarship needs to recognise that municipal law can be as significant as criminal law in the regulation of sexual conduct.</p>

<p>In these debates, surprisingly little was said about the use of planning regulations: while lap dancing clubs are a <italic>sui generis</italic> land use (i.e. not defined within the Use Classes Order), planning permission is theoretically required when a nightclub or pub converts into a lap dance club and has been refused in some instances (e.g. <italic>E Zadeh v Bristol City Council</italic>, Ref APP/Z0116/ A/10/2127967, 24 Aug 2010).</p>

<p>The survey was initially conducted by contacting licensing managers via e-mail in October 2011, with follow-up e-mails, telephone calls and Freedom of Information requests in February and March 2012: it should be noted that some of those local authorities who had not adopted section 27 of the <italic>Policing and Crime Act 2009</italic> were still considering doing so, despite government guidance suggesting that they needed to have done so by 6 April 2011, or should have consulted locally on their decision not to adopt. </p>

<p>This statement stands in policy despite a consultation of 2,700 residents that suggested two thirds opposed the nil limit. However, in the final policy adopted by the Council in January 2011, para 5.3.3 was inserted as follows: ‘In deciding whether to make an exception to any provision within this Sex Establishment policy, including the nil policy and any other policy consideration within this policy, the Council will give due weight to the fact, if proved, that the applicant is an established operator whose establishment is a long-standing, well-run sex establishment which has not generated significant levels of concern among the community or statutory authorities’ (Borough of Hackney, Sex Establishment Licensing Policy, 2011).</p>

<p>These are mainly dedicated lap dancing clubs offering female dancing for a male clientele, though this figure includes 18 public houses that offer lap dance periodically, 1 nightclub for lesbian, gay, bisexual and/or transgender (LGBT), which hosts occasional striptease and 1 sex-on-premises ‘swinger’s club’. In addition to these 131 licensed premises, as of 1 April 2012, there were 33 clubs whose applications for an SEV license were to be determined and c. 42 premises offering lap dance remain licensed under the terms of the <italic>Licensing Act 2003</italic>.</p>
