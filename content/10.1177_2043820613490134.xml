<abstract>
<p>Considering geography in public debate merits asking what kinds of ‘publics’ geographers engage with and whose interests this serves. In turn, historicizing academic geographers’ reaches and roles beyond the academy casts these questions into starker relief. The case of Isaiah Bowman is instructive in this regard and leads us to consider forms and strategies of geographical engagement and vocation.</p>

<p>My first response to Alexander <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820613490134">Murphy’s (2013)</xref> essay was to wonder about its insistence on engaging <italic>grand</italic> regional narratives. Might we not want to equally value microscale or ‘local’ scholarship? Or advocate what has been called ‘minor theory’? We could therefore join Cindi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820613490134">Katz (1996</xref>: 498), who wished ‘to pry apart conventional geographies not by dismantling “major theory”, but by situating minor theory in its midst’.</p>
<p>After all, Murphy has written detailed grounded scholarship with rewarding results; for example, his work on linguistic divides in Brussels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820613490134">Murphy, 2002</xref>). Thus to think of choosing <italic>between</italic> grand theory or its minor other might not always be very helpful. I realize that such a stark choice is probably not what Murphy is advocating. Yet, there is perhaps a danger that grand narratives disavow others who are explicitly situated or ‘local’ and those grand narratives might also be oblivious to their own limits and blind spots. Or to put it in other terms, the ‘boundary’ between macro and micro is arguably no more stable than the role and status of Brussels has been through the decades and centuries.</p>
<p>Moreover, I know Professor Murphy to have been a tireless advocate of geography and one of the co-authors of a widely used textbook that will have informed thousands of students through one or other of its 10 editions. This is to be admired and should be emulated. Yet, part of me is also wary of some of the potential implications of his imperative to reach beyond the academy combined with attachment to grand narratives. We need to keep in mind how some geographers have done just that ‘reaching’ in the past – in distinctly troubling ways. Therefore, as I read on, it struck me as more important to historicize the concerns for ‘advancing [public] geographical understanding’. Geography’s past role in public (especially foreign) policy tells us something about both American geography and the making of that policy.</p>
<p>The calls for geography to be engaged with and make significant contribution to public debate that Murphy develops in this essay and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820613490134">Murphy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820613490134">Murphy et al., 2005</xref>) are part of wider discussions about geographical literacies and publics. In a thoughtful review of some of them, Karen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820613490134">Morin (2012</xref>: 6) notes how:
<disp-quote>
<p>Though crossing ideological divides, most of them share a core value that geographical research must be usable to a consistency of people/users, must relate to or solve real-world problems, and must detach from the confines of the Ivory Tower and engage citizens in university research.</p>
</disp-quote> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820613490134">Morin (2012</xref>: 8) goes on to pose questions hinted at, but ultimately elided in Murphy’s essay, namely, ‘what type of public do they aim to bring into being, and what national interests are they attempting serve?’ This echoes a question posed nearly 40 years ago: ‘What kind of geography for what public policy?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820613490134">Harvey, 1974</xref>).</p>
<p>In these respects, a longer historical perspective on Murphy’s manifesto may be instructive. Fortunately, a related task has already been tackled by the late Neil Smith. It is therefore worth rehearsing Smith’s (2003) account of <italic>American Empire: Roosevelt’s geographer and the prelude to globalization</italic>. It is not possible to do justice to Smith’s arguments in his 557-page-book here. But the parts that are most helpful in situating Murphy’s essay are Smith’s argument that American geography had a profound connection with US geopolitical power during the first half of the 20th century (between the First World War and the early Cold War), largely through the figure, work and connections of Isaiah Bowman (1878–1950). Bowman was key both to the course of academic geography in 20th century America and deeply involved in the making of American globalism. Yet, as the Cold War progressed, other disciplines (such as International Relations) and area studies programmes would be more successful in seating themselves around the tables of power. Geographers, it turns out, were more often technicians for empire (through links between the defense department and Geographic Information Systems and remote sensing) than power architects in the way that (for a few years) Bowman was. Geography perhaps did not sustain sufficient intellectual capital, for example, witness geography’s weak presence in the Ivy League. Other intellectuals and disciplines sought worldly roles and to enter attendant power networks. Smith contrasts geography’s submerged role in 20th century American imperialism with its centrality to earlier European imperial projects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2043820613490134">1</xref></sup> Yet, Bowman’s years at the side of Woodrow Wilson and Roosevelt were vital to the crafting of American power. Bowman charted paths for American power beyond the Caribbean and Pacific territories acquired in the 1898 war towards (what later, other disciplines and policy intellectuals termed) superpower. Soon after World War II, however, geography was displaced from its brief role as a key discipline for the American power brokers. Smith goes on to argue that the post-war American vision of its power and role would be couched more in terms of abstract principles of Democracy, Freedom and Justice or historical narratives about the ‘American Century’:
<disp-quote>
<p>The replacement of European power by U.S. hegemony is simultaneously a victory over geography…. The emerging American Empire defined its power in the first place through the more abstract geography of the world market rather than through direct political control of territory. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2043820613490134">Smith, 2003</xref>: 18–19)</p>
</disp-quote> The result for the United States was to be a distinctive <italic>combination</italic> of rising global power with deepening popular geographical ignorance. Administrations may have been anything but ignorant of geography. Yet, public obliviousness of geography was deep and geography as a disciple came increasingly to be seen as another source of technical know-how, rather than a subject commanding how and where that knowledge would be deployed.</p>
<p>This is perhaps why Murphy may continue to feel frustrated at geography’s relative powerlessness ‘to shape public conversations’ and why ‘terrain will be left to others’. Paradoxically, however, outside the power lines, geographers have connected with and contributed to an array of critical debates in the humanities and social sciences since the 1970s. Such debate has sometimes refused or critiqued grand narratives. Or, to be more precise, it has traced their origins, explored their blind spots and in turn shown how grand narratives are partial (situated) knowledge that certainly comes from <italic>somewhere</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2043820613490134">Sidaway, 2013</xref>). In this spirit, it also becomes important to consider varied modes of theorization and outreach. Not all geographers will enjoy the relative autonomy he advocates, but there is much food for thought in the late Edward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820613490134">Said’s (1994</xref>: xiii–xiv) position:
<disp-quote>
<p>All of us live in a society, and are members of a nationality with its own language, tradition, historical situation. To what extent are intellectuals servants of these actualities, to what extent enemies? The same is true of intellectual’s relationship with institutions (academy, church, professional guild) and with worldly powers, which in our time have co-opted the intelligentsia to an extraordinary degree… . Thus in my view the principal intellectual duty is the search for relative independence from such pressures. Hence my characterization of the intellectual as exile and marginal, as amateur, and as the author of a language that tries to speak the truth to power.</p>
</disp-quote> This might yield other readings of advancement and ways of being engaged.</p>

<p>The literature on these is too extensive to survey here. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820613490134">Stoddart (1992</xref>) remains a valuable entrée to the British case and provides an instructive point of comparison with the American one.</p>
