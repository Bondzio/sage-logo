<abstract>
<p>Social phenomena often involve long-term changes, but most organizational studies focusing on sector comparison have not illuminated the decisive role that time plays. I tested “sector imprinting,” the effect that occurs when an individual who has adapted to the norms of one sector, moves to another sector, by using a sample comprised of respondents from both public and nonprofit organizations. I found that in the public sector, individuals switching from business enterprises and nonprofit organizations perceive more formalized personnel rules and red tape than individuals who have not switched sectors. In the nonprofit sector, individuals switching from the government perceive lower levels of formalized rules and red tape as compared to nonswitchers and switchers from the private sector. Although unpleasant rules are critical sources of one’s turnover intention, individuals who switch into the public sector have longer current job tenure than nonswitchers. I argue that the theories of contrast effect, self-persuasion, extrinsic motivation, and public service motivation (PSM) help explain these findings.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although public management (PM) scholars claim that the context of public organizations is distinctive, how should we define the word “distinctive”? Does it differ only from that in the private sector or that in the nonprofit sector as well? Although most classical studies would endorse the perspective of the public–private distinction due to their different economic natures in profit making, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0275074011402492">Bozeman’s (1987)</xref> argument of “publicness” drives me to address the distinction between sectors from a different angle: economic and political authorities both determine the distinctiveness of an organization. That is, economic authority or profit making is not the only predictor for organizational types.</p>
<p>Looking more deeply into the legal and political dimensions, one may find little evidence suggesting that the context of the public sector is akin to that of the private and nonprofit sectors. Public organizations, in contrast to both nonprofit and private organizations, face more complex political influences, political oversight, and legal constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0275074011402492">Rainey, 2003</xref>). Therefore, public sector workers are subject to more formal bureaucratic structures and red tape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0275074011402492">Baldwin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0275074011402492">Rainey &amp; Bozeman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0275074011402492">Rainey, Pandey, &amp; Bozeman, 1995</xref>). Overemphasized rules and red tape, in turn, often undermine work attitudes (e.g. job satisfaction, involvement, and so on) and increase the likelihood of work alienation for public managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0275074011402492">DeHart-Davis &amp; Pandey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0275074011402492">Pandey &amp; Kingsley, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Although social phenomena are frequently accompanied by long-run environmental shaping, most organization studies that have examined sector comparison fall short of illuminating the decisive role of time and sector switching because collecting cross-sectional and single-time-point data is much easier and more convenient than collecting longitudinal behavioral data.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0275074011402492">1</xref></sup> Therefore, my research questions center on the decisive role of “time” in the sector switching process. Before raising my questions, I would like to introduce “contrast effect,” an effect that frequently alters one’s perceptions.</p>
<p>Contrast effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0275074011402492">Louis, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0275074011402492">Sherif &amp; Hovland, 1961</xref>) takes place when people are previously exposed to a stimulus of lesser or greater value. For example, people may tend to feel that their contemporary work environment is pleasant if they had previously worked in a less satisfactory work environment. Psychologists have noticed this phenomenon and used it to interpret cognitive bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0275074011402492">Petty &amp; Wegener, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0275074011402492">Schwarz &amp; Bles, 1992</xref>). For newcomers in an organization, a contrast between the experiences accumulated in the previous sector and the contemporary work conditions perceived in the current sector is a critical input for their sense making, attribution, and behavioral response.</p>
<p>A question that concerns me is the role that contrast effect plays in the synthesis of the previous sector settings and the way it shapes one’s perceptions. If the degrees of red tape and formalization differ across the public, private, and nonprofit sectors, could those having no switching experience and those switching from the business and/or nonprofit sector(s) to the public sector have different standards of red tape and formalization and, because of this reason, sector switchers and nonswitchers perceive different levels of red tape and formalization? Similarly, do those who have only worked in the nonprofit and those switching from the public sector to the nonprofit sector perceive different levels of red tape and formalization?</p>
<p>The dynamics of sector switching have important implications for managers, especially for public managers. Given that perceived red tape and overemphasized formal rules could detrimentally impact work attitudes, and turnover is often a result of negative work attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0275074011402492">Porter, Steers, Mowday, &amp; Boulian, 1974</xref>), is it possible that people switching (from either the business or nonprofit sector) into the public sector perceive higher levels of red tape and formalization as compared to nonswitchers and, in turn, exhibit more compromised work attitudes and higher reluctance to stay in their current job? I will test these research inquiries in the current study. In sum, considering the importance of turnover intention in motivation and organizational studies, sector switching deserves both researchers’ and practitioners’ attention in the field of public management.</p>

<sec id="section2-0275074011402492">
<title>Sector Switching: How “Time” Shapes One’s Perceptions</title>
<p>Time is a critical moderator in organizational studies. A model’s explanatory power, or the validity of inference, can become vulnerable if researchers neglect how “time” alters an individual’s adaptability. For example, workers may react differently to organizational change at two time points. One may contend that instantaneous organizational change can cause stress and anxiety and contribute to managerial rigidity, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0275074011402492">Staw, Sandelands, and Dutton (1981)</xref>. However, one would reach a different conclusion if managers successfully demonstrate adequate leadership skills to appease employees’ anxiety in the long run. A long-term adaptation may drive many energetic workers to consider organizational change as a chance for their growth and thus work harder. It also improves their citizenship behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0275074011402492">Mishra &amp; Spreitzer, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>I present time as the moderating effect in the form of “sector imprinting” in this study. The concept of sector imprinting, first proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0275074011402492">Boardman, Bozeman, and Ponomariov (2010)</xref>, originates from a combination of organizational socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0275074011402492">Van Maanen &amp; Schein, 1979</xref>) and sector switching.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0275074011402492">2</xref></sup> Sector imprinting focuses on how individuals’ past experiences and current beliefs converge to form new attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0275074011402492">Boardman et al., 2010</xref>), and it centers on different perceptions between sector switchers and nonswitchers due to their distinctive “imprinted” memory in the previous sector. The discussion of sector imprinting effect can be two fold: the imprinting effect on sector switchers and the imprinting effect on nonswitchers. Different underlying theories explain how effects are imposed on these two types of workers. Theories of organizational socialization best interpret nonswitchers’ attitudinal persuasion, whereas contrast effect explains switchers’ perceptional change. Regardless of seemingly unrelated theoretical backgrounds, the success of an imprinting process rests on “time”—whether time is long enough to help workers generate relevant sectoral memories.</p>
<sec id="section3-0275074011402492">
<title>Sector Nonswitchers: Self-Persuasion Effect</title>
<p>Time frequently infuses processed information to an individual and thus strengthens his or her perceptions of specific sectoral conditions, provided the conditions are constant. From the perspective of social psychology, the formation of attitudes and perceptions results from people’s spontaneous evaluation of an object/event, thereby generating beliefs about that object/event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0275074011402492">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 2000</xref>). However, beliefs tend to change in the long run due to an individual’s “persuasion,” which refers to a process of guiding people toward the adoption of ideas, attitudes, or actions. Social psychologists have identified two critical factors in the persuasion process.</p>
<p>The first one is cognitive dissonance—inconsistency among beliefs in one’s cognitive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0275074011402492">Festinger, 1957</xref>). A recent study of cognitive dissonance holds that individuals experience dissonance mainly due to discrepancy between their self-identity (i.e., original beliefs) and an averse or unwanted event that they are responsible for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0275074011402492">Cooper, 1992</xref>). Most likely, people may attempt to reduce dissonance and maintain their perceptional integrity by changing their self-identity or attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0275074011402492">Festinger, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0275074011402492">Simon, Greenberg, &amp; Brehm, 1995</xref>). The second factor is the memory of message. Social psychologists argue that people cannot elaborate messages at the time of exposure, but they are often required to make judgments sometime after exposure to the message. In such circumstances, people try to retrieve whatever they can remember and make inferences based on their memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0275074011402492">Petty, Wegener, &amp; Fabrigar, 1997</xref>). Memory of messages not only accumulates but also becomes relevant after each event that reduces cognitive dissonance. A complete persuasion process relies on the functioning of both dissonance reduction and memory accumulation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0275074011402492">
<title>Sector Switchers: Contrast Effect</title>
<p>We have learned from the socialization process for sector nonswitchers that experience is an essential predictor of perceptions, and length and relevance of one’s experience yield important implications for designing and implementing socialization practices. Practical studies confirm this point of view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0275074011402492">Reichers, Wanous, &amp; Steele, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0275074011402492">Songer-Nocks, 1976</xref>). Following the same logic, one may anticipate that sector switchers may have been “persuaded” to construct a specific set of criteria for event judgment and beliefs in their “old” sector. Their prior-switching experience will also alter switchers’ sense making via the “contrast effect.”</p>
<p>Early studies on the contrast effect can be traced back to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0275074011402492">Sherif and Hovland (1961)</xref>, who found that research participants who were first asked to lift a heavy object and then asked to lift a lighter object tended to underestimate the weight of the lighter object, whereas participants who lifted only the lighter object tended to provide more accurate estimates. Focusing on the contrast effect in organizations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0275074011402492">Louis (1980)</xref> considered the impact of socialization on sense making for switchers/newcomers. His introduction of prior-switching socialization for switchers is similar to the persuasion process—they learn essential elements from their roles in their original organizations (e.g., needs ability, expectation on them, and so on), and they also learn organizational culture when they are “learning the ropes.” The content of learning in the organization and on the job develops expectations and beliefs about their lives. When they move to a new environmental setting, the new situation may require an adjustment. Entry experience in this phase is “contrast.” In all likelihood, the transition does not erase all the old traces, and switchers/newcomers frequently carry memories into the new roles. Recalling experiences from prior roles is synonymous with triggering contrast effects.</p>
<p>One of the most typical consequences of contrast is surprise, an effect that can be either positive or negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0275074011402492">Louis, 1980</xref>). Negative consequences of surprise are generated when persons and roles mismatch during work-role transitions, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0275074011402492">West and Rushton (1989)</xref> contend. Such negative surprise is especially salient in an environment where the level of discretion is low and individuals are seldom allowed to make personal adjustments. Person-role mismatches in the long run can increase one’s frustration and turnover intention.</p>

<title>Comparing Sector Switchers and Nonswitchers</title>
<p>Objective conditions alone cannot constitute the whole scenario of perceived features in the contemporary environment. Reported scores on perceptions also reflect individual experiences. Considering the self-persuasion effect, the contrast effect, and possible differences across the sectors simultaneously, we may infer that sector switchers and nonswitchers in the same worksite have different sets of criteria in evaluating their current environment and accordingly they generate different perceptions. As to how each sector may be distinctive from one to another, I will elaborate two themes: red tape and formalized personnel rules.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section6-0275074011402492">
<title>Red Tape and Formalized Personnel Rules: Distinctive Features in the Public Sector</title>
<p>In general, red tape and a formalized but crippled personnel system can result from the government’s constrained political–legal power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0275074011402492">Boyne, 2002</xref>). Acting on behalf of governmental institutions and citizens, public organizations operate in a multiactor network organized by legislators, interest groups, clients, and so on. In addition, they implement policies funded by tax dollars. Some actors in a political arena such as the legislative branch, higher level administrative branch, and courts can even impose legal mandates on the government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0275074011402492">Rainey, 2003</xref>). These constraints are sources of formalization and red tape.</p>
<p>Conflicting demands and goal ambiguity serve as an alternative explanation of the pervasiveness of red tape and formalization in public organizations. In the sense that stakeholders have a variety of apparently conflicting interests and public agencies frequently rely on political support from these actors to obtain appropriations and authorization for actions, public managers often incur contradictory demands and goal ambiguity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0275074011402492">Chun &amp; Rainey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0275074011402492">Pandey &amp; Rainey, 2006</xref>). Goal ambiguity is often accompanied by red tape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0275074011402492">Chun &amp; Rainey, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0275074011402492">Pandey &amp; Rainey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0275074011402492">Pandey &amp; Wright, 2006</xref>). The “quality” nature of public service delivery and a lack of precise indicators for performance measurement increase the difficulty in manipulating personnel tools and, in the meantime, create goal ambiguity. Public managers may strive to control subordinates with more red tape when they fail to review clear and precise performance indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0275074011402492">Rainey et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Although formalization and red tape share similar sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0275074011402492">Bozeman &amp; Scott, 1996</xref>), and some researchers have used formalization scales to measure red tape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0275074011402492">Buchanan, 1975</xref>), there are important conceptual differences between these two organizational features.</p>
<sec id="section7-0275074011402492">
<title>Formalized Personnel Rules</title>
<p>Formalization refers to a system of rules covering a worker’s rights, duties, and work situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0275074011402492">Hall, 1968</xref>). It refers to the extent to which rules and procedures are specified (i.e., job codification) and to which subordinates comply with these rules and procedures (i.e., rule observation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0275074011402492">Agarwal, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0275074011402492">Aiken &amp; Hage, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0275074011402492">Hage &amp; Aiken, 1967</xref>). To manage environmental complexities and minimize uncertainties, organizations need bureaucratic elements to reduce risks. That is, formalization is often a response to the resource environment, institutional environment, and political pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0275074011402492">Meyer &amp; Rowan, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0275074011402492">Meyer &amp; Scott, 1983</xref>) and it helps managers prescribe detailed guidelines for smoother coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0275074011402492">Michaels, Cron, Dubinsky, &amp; Joachimsthaler, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>However, proliferated rules and excess procedures reduce one’s autonomy, increase one’s potential role conflict, and finally result in work alienation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0275074011402492">Agarwal, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0275074011402492">Agarwal &amp; Ramaswami, 1993</xref>). Due to administrative oversight and legislative control, a formalized structure exists more commonly in the public sector than in the business and nonprofit sectors. The merit-protection system, which reduces a public manager’s flexibility to motivate subordinates by using external incentives and punishments, is one of the most negative forms of formalization in the public sector. The power of public managers to control personnel issues is immensely compromised because regulations on recruiting, layoff, and promotion are so complicated and time consuming that few people would be willing to adopt these measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0275074011402492">Baldwin, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0275074011402492">Boyne, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0275074011402492">Coursey &amp; Rainey, 1990</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0275074011402492">
<title>Red Tape</title>
<p>Recent literature and empirical studies generally hold a view that red tape is conceptually different from formalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0275074011402492">Pandey &amp; Kingsley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0275074011402492">Pandey &amp; Scott, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0275074011402492">Pandey &amp; Welch, 2005</xref>). The overemphasized formalization that entails compliance burdens, triggering high compliance costs, and having no efficacy for the functional goal is often referred to as “red tape” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0275074011402492">Bozeman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0275074011402492">Bozeman &amp; Scott, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0275074011402492">Bozeman (1993)</xref> views red tape as “good rules gone bad.” Although some “good red tape” provides protection for citizens against capricious governmental decisions and ensures equity, it is frequently deemed a pathology and is defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0275074011402492">Bozeman and Scott (1996)</xref> as “organizational rules, regulations, and procedures that serve no appreciable social or organizational function but that nonetheless remain in force and result in inefficiency, unnecessary delays, frustration, and vexation” (p. 8).</p>
<p>One may also observe the emergence of red tape from the view of the organizational life cycle. Although formalization in the beginning may facilitate positive work attitudes and reduce alienation, it could contribute to overall rigidity and decline of organizations in the long term due to the overemphasized value of compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0275074011402492">Walsh &amp; Dewar, 1987</xref>). That is, red tape occurs when rules become an end instead of means.</p>

<sec id="section9-0275074011402492">
<title>The Intersection of Sector Imprinting, Rules, and Current Job Tenure</title>
<p>By integrating red tape, formalized personnel rules, and sector imprinting, one may reach an inference that sector switchers and nonswitchers are likely to evaluate the extent of red tape and formalization with different standards so that a perceptional gap should exist between these two types of workers. I first introduce the scenario of sector imprinting in the public sector.</p>
<p>Admittedly, sector switchers from either the nonprofit or private sector are sometimes rational enough to minimize the drawbacks and maximize the benefits. They may switch to the public sector where they are able to obtain higher levels of job security, stable salary, and more opportunities to serve the public interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0275074011402492">Tschirhart, Reed, Freeman, &amp; Anker, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0275074011402492">3</xref></sup> Despite their before-switching rational choice and preparation, however, sector switchers are relatively inexperienced in confronting red tape and formalization as compared to their nonswitching peers. As a result, the public sector’s higher levels of red tape and formalization create both a contrast and cognitive dissonance for sector switchers.</p>
<p>Public sector nonswitchers include those who have had no job-switching experience and those who have changed jobs only within the government. Assuming that red tape and formalized personnel rules are universally present in the public sector as compared to the private and nonprofit sectors, workers falling into the nonswitching category should undergo similar organizational socialization of red tape and formalization. Because red tape and overemphasized personnel regulations, according to definitions employed in this study, may be unpleasant features and experiences for workers (i.e., inefficiency, unnecessary delays, frustration, vexation, and difficulties in rewarding good employees, removing lazy workers, and promoting well-performing subordinates), those who choose to accept socialization instead of turnover usually accumulate relevant bureaucratic memory thereby helping them adapt to unfavorable worksite conditions accompanied by red tape and formalized rules, based on the theory of organizational socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0275074011402492">Van Maanen &amp; Schein, 1979</xref>). One may speculate that, in contrast to sector switchers, nonswitchers in the public sector may have more generous standards in evaluating red tape and a formalized personnel system.</p>
<list id="list1-0275074011402492" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1.1</italic>: In public organizations, individuals switching from both the private and nonprofit sectors are more likely than nonswitchers to perceive formalized personnel regulations and red tape.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A strong intent to quit is a consequence of compromised work attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0275074011402492">Begley &amp; Czajka, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0275074011402492">Jaros, 1997</xref>), and red tape and proliferated rules often erode one’s positive work attitudes. Inasmuch as a perceptional gap of red tape and formalization may exist between sector switchers and nonswitchers, I suspect that the current job tenure of sector switchers (from both the private and nonprofit sectors) is shorter than that of nonswitchers in the government. That is, switchers have a stronger intent to quit as compared to nonswitchers.</p>
<list id="list2-0275074011402492" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1.2</italic>: In public organizations, the current job tenure of individuals switching from both the private and nonprofit sector is shorter than that of nonswitchers.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Sector imprinting in the nonprofit sector should appear as a different scenario. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0275074011402492">Louis (1980)</xref>, a switcher’s surprise stems from both undermet and overmet anticipations. Assuming that switchers from the public sector to the nonprofit sector have undergone certain levels of organizational socialization in their previous (i.e., public) sector and have formed a set of “lenient” criteria in evaluating red tape and formalization, their contrast experience after switching may reflect overmet expectations—lower levels of formalization and red tape in the current (i.e., nonprofit) sector may potentially bring them a sense of “emancipation” from previous restrictions. Nonswitchers and switchers from the private sector usually “take it for granted” when they are enjoying a flexible personnel policy. In the nonprofit sector, the first hypothesis with respect to sector imprinting is stated as follows:</p>
<list id="list3-0275074011402492" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2.1</italic>: In nonprofit organizations, individuals switching from the public sector are less likely than nonswitchers and those switching from the private sector to perceive formalized personnel rules and red tape.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The second hypothesis is concerned with the comparison of current job tenure between sector switchers and nonswitchers. Following the logic supporting the statement of Hypothesis 1.2, I surmise that sector switchers from the public sector exhibit a stronger propensity to stay in their current job and thus have longer current job tenure as compared to nonswitchers and switchers from the private sector.</p>
<list id="list4-0275074011402492" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2.2</italic>: In nonprofit organizations, the current job tenure sector of individuals switching from the public sector is longer than that of nonswitchers and those switching from the private sector.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>To recapitulate, the conventional wisdom suggests that formalized personnel rules and red tape are more prevalent in the public sector than in the nonprofit and business sectors. Due to the effect of sector imprinting, switchers either “from” or “to’ the public sector should perceive different levels of formalization and red tape as compared to nonswitchers. In addition, I also speculate that sector imprinting also determines one’s current job tenure because one’s perceived environmental features often hinge on turnover intention (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0275074011402492">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Data and Variables</title>
<p>I analyze my hypotheses by employing the National Administrative Studies Project-III (NASP-III) data. NASP-III aims to collect data on <italic>public and nonprofit</italic> managers. The population of NASP-III covers both the state of Georgia and Illinois. The population of public managers in Georgia was drawn from the list provided by the Department of Audit (DoA). This list includes people who have been on a state agency’s payroll during 2003/2004 fiscal year. The population of public managers in Illinois was developed through a Freedom of Information Act request. The NASP-III research group purchased a list from Infocus Marketing, Inc. This list includes members of the American Society of Association Executives (ASAE) with titles such as operation managers, executive director, company president, development manager, education director, CEO, and so on. This list provides 280 nonprofit managers from Georgia and 1,048 from Illinois. At the end of this survey, the NASP-III research group obtained 790 responses out of 1,849 reduced <italic>N</italic> with a response rate of 43% (47% in Georgia and 38% in Illinois) for public sector respondents, 430 out of 1,307 reduced <italic>N</italic> with a response rate of 33% (39% in Georgia and 31% in Illinois) for nonprofit sector respondents, and the overall response rate of 39% for their study. For more detailed information about NASP-III, please refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0275074011402492">Bozeman and Feeney (2009)</xref>.</p>
<p>There are three dependent variables (DVs) in the current study. The first one is formalized personnel rules. It is a combination of three different 1-4 ordinal items including rules regulating pay, promotion, and layoff (Cronbach’s alpha = .66).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0275074011402492">4</xref></sup> The degree of red tape is measured by a single 0 to 10 item asking “how would you assess the level of red tape in your organization.” Current job tenure, the last DV, comes from a section in the NASP-III designed to obtain work history data from the respondents.</p>
<p>In the section of work history, respondents were asked to indicate their current and previous (before the current job) sector affiliations. They were also asked to provide information about starting (and ending) years in their current (and previous) jobs. After recoding, I obtained (a) current job tenure, which is used as my last DV and (b) four sector switching and nonswitching items, which are used as my main independent variables (IVs). These four items include BUS and NPO–GOV (switchers from the business and nonprofit sectors to the public sector), GOV–GOV (nonswitchers in the public sector), BUS and NPO–NPO (switchers from the private sector to the nonprofit sector and nonswitchers in the nonprofit sector), and GOV–NPO (switchers from the public sector to the nonprofit sector).</p>
<p>In the current study, I control for variables on the contextual level, organizational level, and individual level. On the contextual level, I control for the state of Georgia/Illinois. The elimination of civil service protection in Georgia has important implications for formalized personnel rules and red tape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0275074011402492">Battaglio &amp; Condrey, 2006</xref>). On the organizational level, I first control for organizational size as represented by the total number of full-time employees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0275074011402492">5</xref></sup> The conventional wisdom suggests that organizational size and complexity often correlate, and formalized rules are necessary tools for managers to handle organizational complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0275074011402492">Kalleberg, Knoke, Marsden, &amp; Spaeth, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to size, I control for managerial trust and task clarity as perceived by respondents. These two concepts are measured by two individual 1-4 ordinal items asking respondents whether “top management displays a high level of trust on their employees in this organization” and “most employees are clear about the tasks they are expected to perform.” A centralized power is in conflict with empowerment and a manager’s trust on employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0275074011402492">Osborne &amp; Gaebler, 1992</xref>). Centralization occurs when public managers suffer from disturbance caused by political interference, have weaker authority over subordinates, and accordingly begin to entrench themselves in power with more formal control and red tape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0275074011402492">Rainey, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0275074011402492">Rainey et al., 1995</xref>). Task clarity and red tape should negatively correlate as well. Although the existence of proliferated rules and red tape are often embedded in a complicated external environment where goal ambiguity is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0275074011402492">Pandey &amp; Rainey, 2006</xref>), the occurrences of goal ambiguity and task ambiguity are usually concurrent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0275074011402492">Moynihan &amp; Pandey, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>On the individual level, I control for a respondent’s (a) desire to serve the public interests, (b) feeling of being underpaid, (c) age, and (d) current position. Empirical evidence shows that public service motivation may first determine one’s attribution style so as to help reduce perceived red tape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0275074011402492">Scott &amp; Pandey, 2005</xref>). Underpayment to oneself is usually perceived as being unfair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0275074011402492">Greenberg, 1983</xref>), which increases the likelihood of alienation. Alienated workers, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0275074011402492">Pandey and Kingsley (2000)</xref>, tend to perceive strong red tape within organizations. Age and promotion are often negatively correlated with work alienation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0275074011402492">Aiken &amp; Hage, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0275074011402492">Mottaz, 1981</xref>), so older people and those recently promoted should have lower potential to perceive unpleasant rules. A managerial responsibility is often accompanied by age and promotion, so I surmise that a managerial responsibility is negatively associated with perceived red tape and formalized personnel rules as well.</p>
<p>I report descriptive statistics in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0275074011402492">Table 1</xref> and variable measurement in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0275074011402492">Table 2</xref> respectively. Percentages of sector switching reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0275074011402492">Table 3</xref> indicate that switching “to” and “from” the public sector is not an infrequent phenomenon. For those who are currently working in the public sector, around 15% have had experience working in either nonprofit organizations or business enterprises. In the nonprofit sector, 9% previously worked in the public sector.</p>

<p>In the models of formalized personnel rules and red tape, I found that managers in the group of BUS and NPO–GOV perceived higher levels of formalized personnel rules (<italic>B</italic> = .30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.08) and red tape (<italic>B</italic> = .38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.08) than do managers in the GOV–GOV group, an evidence of sector imprinting for those who currently work in the public sector. Although coefficients of BUS and NPO–NPO and GOV–NPO are both statistically significant, statistical significance merely implies that nonprofit managers are less likely than public managers to perceive formalization and red tape. Because my research questions are concerned with the gap of perceptions between managers falling into these two groups, I set the null hypothesis as Ho: GOV–NPO = BUS and NPO–NPO and conducted postregression Wald tests. I found that managers in the group of GOV–NPO tended to report even lower levels of formalized personnel rules (<italic>B</italic> gap = .51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.08) and red tape (<italic>B</italic> gap = .75, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.04) as compared to managers in the groups of BUS and NPO–NPO, another sign of sector imprinting. None of the variables’ VIF was higher than 4, and the mean of VIF was lower than 2, an implication that the problem of multicollinearity is not serious (please refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0275074011402492">Table 6</xref> for VIF values). In other words, statistical findings support my Hypotheses 1.1 and 2.1. With respect to control variables, organizational size, the state of Georgia, managerial trust, task clarity, a feeling of underpayment, and age were statistically significant in both models, but public service motivation and managerial responsibility were insignificant in the model of formalized personnel rules.</p>

<p>The last model is concerned with whether sector imprinting determines one’s current job tenure. Regression results showed that managers in the group of GOV–NPO have longer current job tenure than managers in the group of BUS and NPO–NPO (<italic>B</italic> gap = 3.82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.00). This finding supports my Hypothesis 2.2 and implies that switchers who experienced overmet expectations are more likely than those who have not had such experience to stay long in their current (nonprofit) organizations. However, I obtained a result contradicting my Hypothesis 1.2: managers in the group of BUS and NPO–GOV have longer current job tenure as compared to managers in the group of GOV–GOV (<italic>B</italic> gap = 2.01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.00) despite their perceptions of higher red tape and formalized personnel rules. As compared to those having similar sectoral experience but currently work in the nonprofit sector (BUS and NPO–NPO), switchers into the public sector (BUS and NPO–GOV) demonstrated a stronger desire to stay in their current organizations. This unexpected finding calls for further discussion. I will elaborate possible explanations in the next section.</p>
<p>In sum, regarding the contrast between switchers and nonswitchers, results show that imprinting effects stemming from overmet expectations (i.e., switching into the nonprofit sector, <italic>B</italic> gaps = .51 and .75, respectively) and that rooting in undermet expectations (i.e., switching into the public sector, <italic>B</italic> gaps = .30 and .38, respectively) are both statistically significant predictors for perceived red tape and formalized personnel rules, although the impact of the former one is stronger. Statistical evidences of sector imprinting also underpin a classical view of “sector matters”: political interference, conflicting demands, legal mandates, and the merit-protection regulations imposed on governmental agencies often resulting in strong red tape and a formalized but crippled personnel system in the public sector.</p>

<title>Discussion: Missing Links Between Job Tenure and Unpleasant Rules</title>
<p>Managers switching into the public sector appear to be more likely than their nonswitching peers to have longer current job tenure even though they tend to perceive higher levels of red tape and formalized personnel rules. If assertions about the contrast effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0275074011402492">Louis, 1980</xref>) and organizational socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0275074011402492">Van Maanen &amp; Schein, 1979</xref>) are universally applicable, and if perceptions of unfavorable conditions frequently lead to turnover, one should not witness such a contradictory finding. What could be the underlying reasons leading to discrepant results in one’s current job tenure and perceptions? I suggest that we probably underestimate the roles that a sector switcher’s (a) perceived competence, (b) self-persuasion, and (c) motivation play in the entire process of sector switching, or more specifically, <italic>switching under self-selection</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section13-0275074011402492">
<title>Self-Selection and Perceived Competence</title>
<p>An individual’s rational choice, based on personal desires and perceived competence to work in different sectors, often determines the result of one’s current sector affiliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0275074011402492">Tschirhart et al., 2008</xref>). With respect to perceived competence, sector switchers often include those who feel uncomfortable with high competition in the private or/and nonprofit sector(s) or those who fail to survive in a fluctuating environment. As compared to nonswitchers who have never experienced the high pressure of survival, switchers may have a higher likelihood to disregard the possibility of “switching out.” No wonder scholars tend to equalize public employment and a “dead-end” job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0275074011402492">Greiner, Hatry, Koss, Millar, &amp; Woodward, 1981</xref>) because “switching out” from the public sector could be much more difficult than “switching into” the public sector.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0275074011402492">
<title>External Attractions and Self-Persuasion</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0275074011402492">Tschirhart et al. (2008)</xref>, personal desire (e.g., needs for salary, job security, opportunities to help others, and so on) is another important determinant of sector switching. Many modern studies of work motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0275074011402492">Houston, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0275074011402492">Jurkiewicz, Massey, &amp; Brown, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0275074011402492">Kilpatrick, Cummings, &amp; Jennings, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0275074011402492">Lyons, Duxbury, &amp; Higgins, 2006</xref>) found that public sector workers are inclined to place job security on the top of a priority list comprised of various needs/values. Although some scholars argued that public managers usually place a lower value on income than do private managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0275074011402492">Frank &amp; Lewis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0275074011402492">Houston, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0275074011402492">Khojasteh, 1993</xref>), some contended that the gap is not extremely large, and a public manager’s priority for salary usually ranks top among the top three on a list of needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0275074011402492">Jurkiewicz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0275074011402492">Karl &amp; Sutton, 1998</xref>). In addition, fringe benefits in general are more favorable in the public than in the private and nonprofit sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0275074011402492">Bellante &amp; Link, 1981</xref>). These studies imply that external attractions should be a critical reason for switchers to change their sector affiliation.</p>
<p>Therefore, for those switching into the public sector, “switching out” is synonymous with “losing these attractions” and “refuting the original reason of switching.” To maintain those attractions, people switching into the public sector may prefer self-persuasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0275074011402492">Aronson, 1999</xref>) to turnover when they perceive, or suffer from, symptoms of bureaucratic pathology such as red tape, formal control, legal constraints, and political interference. That is, self-persuasion is embedded in a self-selected sector switching process when a tradeoff decision needs to be made between keeping attractions and avoiding public sector pathologies. Once persuasion starts functioning, it has the ability to affect a switcher’s long-term changes in perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0275074011402492">Aronson, 1999</xref>) so as to help a switcher reduce turnover intention and prolong current job tenure. Admittedly, nonswitchers in the public sector should have undergone self-persuasion as well, according to the literature reviewed earlier. However, nonswitchers’ lack of working experience in the private and nonprofit sectors may lead them to underestimate the importance of external attractions and overestimate their antipathy toward symptoms of bureaucratic pathology. Eventually, nonswitchers will exhibit a higher propensity to choose turnover as compared to switchers from the private and nonprofit sectors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0275074011402492">
<title>Individual Motivation</title>
<p>The perspective of self-persuasion leads me to contemplate a question on another level: why self-persuasion helps prolong switchers’ current job tenure but fails to decrease their perceived red tape and formalized personnel rules originating from a contrast effect? Does any logical limitation exist within the applicability of self-persuasion? Considering external attractions in the public sector and related motivation types, I argue that the self-determination theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0275074011402492">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0275074011402492">2000b</xref>), the attribution theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0275074011402492">Weiner, 1986</xref>), and the public service motivation theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0275074011402492">Perry, 2000</xref>) can make up the insufficiency left by self-persuasion.</p>
<p>Extrinsically motivated people care more about external incentives such as paychecks, job security, pension plans, and fringe benefits than they do about internal rewards such as pride, growth, and “chances to make a difference.” Because sector switching into the public sector is often a result of external attractions, sector switchers should be more extrinsically than intrinsically motivated. According to the self-determination theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0275074011402492">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0275074011402492">2000b</xref>), extrinsically motivated people generally have an external locus of causality, a psychological feature that impedes one from <italic>internalizing external regulations into their actions and behaviors</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0275074011402492">6</xref></sup> Therefore, it is not too surprising that people switching into the public sector still perceive higher levels of red tape and personnel regulations than nonswitchers do, although they may have already persuaded themselves to “stay long” in the current organization.</p>
<p>Attribution theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0275074011402492">Weiner, 1986</xref>) and public service motivation (PSM) theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0275074011402492">Perry, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0275074011402492">1997</xref>) also explain the reasons for a sector switcher to perceive higher levels of red tape and formalization but concurrently have longer current job tenure as compared to a nonswitcher. A complete PSM construct, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0275074011402492">Perry (1996)</xref>, includes the following dimensions: attraction to policy making, commitment to the public interest, social justice, civic duty, compassion, and self-sacrifice. By using this taxonomy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0275074011402492">Scott and Pandey (2005)</xref> found that attraction to policy making and civic duty effectively reduce one’s perceived red tape (personnel and procurement red tape). They also argued that this causality can be best captured by attribution theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0275074011402492">Weiner, 1986</xref>): those with high levels of PSM should be more likely to provide an internal attribution and see rules as something over which they have some measure of control. Considering that people switching into the public sector tend to be concerned about external attractions, and that extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation are mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0275074011402492">Kanungo, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0275074011402492">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0275074011402492">2000b</xref>), individuals switching into the public sector may have little PSM as a type of intrinsic motivation and thus easily perceive high levels of red tape and unpleasant rules.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Why is sector imprinting an important issue? First, it examines whether contexts differ across the sectors. Sector switching will not generate a gap of perceived personnel rules and red tape between sector switchers and nonswitchers if contexts in the public sector are not distinctive. Findings in this study confirm that formalized personnel rules and red tape, derivatives of the merit-protection system, political interference, and intensive hierarchical control, are indeed prevalent in the public sector. No wonder the merit system has long been the first target of contemporary administrative reform efforts.</p>
<p>In addition, managerial effectiveness can improve when managers obtain clearer knowledge about their subordinates’ work history via the lens of sector imprinting. The effect of sector imprinting reminds one that organizational features are socially constructed and they are a matter of comparison, which is akin to the measurement of effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0275074011402492">Herman &amp; Renz, 2008</xref>). Maybe red tape and formalization do objectively exist, but individuals having different work history evaluate them with unique criteria and thus generate differing perceptions. One may infer that sector imprinting creates a channel for managers to access the work histories of their subordinates and helps managers “use” labor force more effectively. For example, nonprofit sector managers need to make a better use of switchers from the government. Their productivity could be higher than their peers in the same organization because their switching experience is likely to be accompanied by positive work attitudes, longer current job tenure, and lower levels of perceived red tape.</p>
<p>Findings of sector imprinting in the current study have critical implications for public managers as well. A disconnected relationship between perceived unpleasant rules and current job tenure for individuals switching into the public sector (from both the private and nonprofit sectors) denotes that sector switching into the public sector is a voluntary decision made as a tradeoff between avoiding red tape and obtaining public sector attractions such as job security, a stable environment, fringe benefits, and so on. That is, regardless of sector switchers’ willingness to work in the public sector, their extrinsic motivation may prevail over their public service motivation. Unfortunately, extrinsic motivation and a low level of public service motivation are crucial antecedents of negative work attitudes and undermined work motivation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0275074011402492">7</xref></sup> Given that considerable numbers of individuals have had switching experience in the public sector (15% of the public sector respondents in the NASP-III), public managers should use particular caution in interpreting sector switchers’ reported turnover intention—their high willingness to stay might not guarantee their high performance because such willingness is often accompanied by a low level of work motivation.</p>
<p>Research limitations exist as well. First, although the understanding of sector imprinting could be more comprehensive and complete if “switching into the private sector” is also considered, there is no private sector sample in the NASP-III because public and nonprofit organizations are the main focus of this data set. Second, although “sector matters” seems to be a consensus among public management researchers, they also concur that the importance of size, technology, service field, and profession sometimes outweighs that of sector affiliation in predicting structural features such as formalization and red tape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0275074011402492">Rainey, 2003</xref>). To make the most appropriate tradeoff, rational individuals who prepare to change their sector affiliations possibly care more about previously mentioned features in their current and prospective organizations but less about the sector per se. Unfortunately, work history data in the NASP-III do not cover such detailed information in one’s previous organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0275074011402492">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The existence of drawbacks notwithstanding, I believe that the contribution of this study outweighs its limitations. The discussion of sector imprinting not only successfully elucidates the synthesis of previous and current sector settings and its impacts on perceived environmental features but also helps one understand how a person’s work history is reflected in perceptions in the current sector. Most importantly, this study inspires managers to develop new managerial knowledge beyond the traditional scope—current sector distinction. I encourage future sector imprinting studies to examine different organizational phenomena.</p>

<p>Although the NASP-III data set does not cover detailed information of a respondent’s previous organization, it does include names/professions and size of a respondent’s current organization. As the discussion of size and profession is beyond the scope of the current study, I report organization names, switching frequency (number of people switching into this organization), and organizational size (total number of full-time employees) in appendix for readers interested in such information. I only report the group of “sector switchers in the public sector” because of their disconnected current job tenure and perceived rules. The most welcome “target professions” for them include natural resource and human service (or human resource). In the meantime, however, I fail to find a clear linkage between switching preference and organizational size.</p></fn>
