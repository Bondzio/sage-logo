<title>Objective:</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of five chair designs on interface pressure distribution and tissue perfusion in the buttock-thigh region.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0018720812457681">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Prolonged sitting has been found to contribute to the symptoms of work-related low back pain. Studies have found that chair design affects users’ sitting posture and comfort. As sitting applies pressure to the user, it is necessary to investigate how chair design affects sitting pressure and tissue perfusion during sitting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0018720812457681">
<title>Method:</title>
<p>We tested five chair designs (Suspension A, Suspension B, Foam A, Foam B, and bicompliant) on 15 young, healthy females. Sitting interface pressure and buttock-thigh tissue perfusion (in terms of transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide, tcPO<sub>2</sub> and tcPCO<sub>2</sub>, respectively) were measured during 10-min sitting on each chair.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0018720812457681">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>We found that chair design significantly affected the distribution of the sitting pressure (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and buttock-thigh tissue perfusion (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .023). Average pressure and total contact area were found highest in both foam designs, and the average pressure was the lowest in one of the suspension designs. Across all tested chair designs, the anterior portion of the seat sustained the lowest contact pressure. It was also found that tcPO<sub>2</sub> was the lowest (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .003) and tcPCO<sub>2</sub> was the highest (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) in tissue around ischial tuberosity for all chair designs.</p>

<sec id="section5-0018720812457681">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Chair design and materials of the seat significantly affect the sitting interface pressure distribution and tissue perfusion in sitting area. Further evaluation of these outcomes may provide useful information to correlate chair design with sitting comfort.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Low back pain (LBP) is acute or chronic pain involving the lower back, buttocks, and/or thighs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812457681">Bernard, 1997</xref>). Approximately 100 million workdays are lost each year in the United States because of LBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812457681">Maetzel &amp; Li, 2002</xref>). Although there are many different causes and contributing factors of LBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812457681">Callaghan &amp; McGill, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720812457681">Harrison, Harrison, Croft, Harrison, &amp; Troyanovich, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720812457681">Kanayama, Togawa, Takahashi, Terai, &amp; Hashimoto, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812457681">Lis, Black, Korn, &amp; Nordin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720812457681">Sato, Kikuchi, &amp; Yonezawa, 1999</xref>), it is accepted that prolonged sitting, which is necessary in many jobs and daily activities, may contribute significantly to the symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812457681">Lis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720812457681">O’Sullivan et al., 2010</xref>). Taking different sitting posture can affect stresses within the spine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720812457681">Sato et al., 1999</xref>), and prolonged sitting was found associated with L4-L5 disc pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720812457681">Kanayama et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018720812457681">Rohlmann, Zander, Graichen, Dreischarf, &amp; Bergmann, 2011</xref>). Chair design, which influences the sitting posture of the user, may have an active role in both causing and relieving LBP associated with sitting.</p>
<p>Several researchers have investigated the effects of office chairs on the low back tissues of users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812457681">Alnaser &amp; Wughalter, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720812457681">Callaghan &amp; Dunk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812457681">Liao &amp; Drury, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812457681">Lis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812457681">Makhsous et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018720812457681">Williams, Hawley, McKenzie, &amp; van Wijmen, 1991</xref>). Makhsous and colleagues (2009) reported that using a back support significantly changed the distribution of interface pressure on the buttock-seat surface in individuals with and without LBP. Long periods of sitting during office work has been found to be one of the significant determinants for predicting LBP occurrence in office workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018720812457681">Spyropoulos et al., 2007</xref>). As a result, chairs have been designed to provide support for the user in such a way that minimizes discomfort while promoting “good” posture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812457681">Liao &amp; Drury, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>During sitting, the head, arm, and trunk weight is carried mainly by the ischia and surrounding tissues. In this scenario, increased pressure at the ischium may change the curvature in the lumbar spine, and the lack of back support may promote lordosis in the lumbar area and increases the stress on the spinal structure. Therefore, sitting interface pressure distribution between the buttocks and the seat may be used to evaluate new chair designs. In a previous study investigating seat interface pressure, it was found that although both chair design and postural variables made significant changes in pressure distribution at the body-seat interface, variations in the chair design produced the greatest effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018720812457681">Vos, Congleton, Moore, Amendola, &amp; Ringer, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to interface pressure, tissue perfusion assesses an individual’s physiologic response to sitting, and it has a significant effect on the occupant’s sitting comfort. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720812457681">Newsome, Pearcy, and Rolfe (1981)</xref> reported that an individual’s transcutaneous pressure of oxygen (tcPO<sub>2</sub>) may be an indication of tissue viability. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720812457681">Xakellis, Frantz, Arteaga, and Meletiou (1991)</xref> found that transcutaneous oxygen flow declined with increasing compressive load and eventually reached zero. They concluded that during low oxygen flow states, use of the oxygen may exceed the delivery even if blood flow is not completely occluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720812457681">Xakellis et al., 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812457681">Baldwin (2001)</xref> reported that transcutaneous oximetry is a useful tool in assessing tissue comfort in a study on mobile and immobile participants.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate five existing chair designs to determine their effect on interface pressure and tissue perfusion in the buttock-thigh region. These quantitative measurements would be helpful in selecting chairs for seated individuals and in assisting in future chair design.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants consisted of 15 healthy Caucasian women of mean age 23.5 years (range = 23 to 25), with mean weight of 58.2 kg (range = 49.9 to 67.1), mean height of 167.3 cm (range = 158.5 to 180.4), and mean body mass index (BMI) of 20.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range = 19.1 to 23.4), in good physical condition. Exclusion criteria included current or previous history of LBP, past pelvic surgery, and cardiac and/or vascular dysfunction. Participants had to be able to sit for at least 10 min continuously without significantly shifting their position in the chair. Informed and written consent following the guidelines of the institutional review board was obtained from each participant before any experimentation.</p>

<title>Office Chairs</title>
<p>We tested five office chairs with different seat designs in this study, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720812457681">Figure 1</xref>, that is, Suspension A, Suspension B, Foam A, Foam B, and bicompliant pixelated support matrix (bicompliant). The Suspension A chair was a Pellicle suspension design with its seat and backrest made of glass-reinforced polyester material. The Suspension B chair was an Elastometric mesh design with glass-filled nylon frame material for both seat and backrest. The Foam A chair was a polyurethane foam chair; the seat was made of a black plastic frame, and the backrest was made of double mesh. The Foam B chair was a urethane foam chair with a seat made of polypropylene shell and glass-reinforced nylon material and a backrest made of chlorofluorocarbon-free foam. The bicompliant chair was a contoured suspended pixels suspension design with seat made of Amitel and Sarlink and backrest made of polypropylene Krayton mat. The seat height and tilt and recline were adjustable for all chairs. The seat depth could be adjusted only for Foam A, Foam B, and bicompliant chairs.</p>

<title>Sitting Posture</title>
<p>Participants were asked to maintain an upright posture with minimal movement of the limbs. Seat height and back position were adjusted for each chair to ensure that all participants sat with 90° angles at the knee and hip to standardize the posture in data collection. The participants were instructed to sit in the testing chair using the backrest with buttocks to the rear of the chair, hands on the thighs, and feet flat on the floor.</p>

<sec id="section11-0018720812457681">
<title>Interface Pressure</title>
<p>An XSensor (XSensor Technology Corporation, Calgary, Canada) pressure-mapping mat with 36 × 36 cells was secured over the surface of the seat prior to each sitting trial. It was used to record pressure distribution on the body-seat interface during sitting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720812457681">Figure 2</xref>) with a sampling frequency of 1 Hz for the entire 10-min sitting trial for each chair (1 Hz).</p>

<title>Tissue Perfusion</title>
<p>Five oximeters (TCM3 Oximeter; Radiometer A/S, Brønshøj, Denmark) were used to record tissue perfusion as the transcutaneous partial pressures of oxygen (tcPO<sub>2</sub>) and carbon dioxide (tcPCO<sub>2</sub>) from the posterior buttock-thigh area. Oximeter sensors were calibrated and attached to the skin, with three at the right ischial tuberosity (RIT), one on the right middle thigh (RMT), and one on the right distal thigh (RDT). RIT was identified and marked when the participant was sitting upright on a chair on his or her left buttock with right buttock off the seat cushion. The RMT and RDT sensors were placed on the middle of the MID-Seat and ANT-Seat (equal divisions of the area between the buttock-thigh fold to the front edge of the seat), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720812457681">Figure 2</xref>). The reason for using three sensors at RIT was to cover the tissue overlying the sharp tip of the ischial tuberosity, a circle surrounding the tip of RIT skin movement. To avoid artifacts in interface pressure reading, a soft latex foam ring (Callus Cushions, by Walgreens, with inner diameter of 15 mm and outer diameter of 35 mm) was placed around each oximeter sensor to distribute concentrated interface pressure points caused by the sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812457681">Makhsous et al., 2007</xref>). Oximeter readings of tcPO<sub>2</sub> and tcPCO<sub>2</sub> were collected by a host computer via serial ports with a sampling frequency of 0.509 Hz.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0018720812457681">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>All participants were instructed to wear nonrestrictive clothing, such as mesh or cotton shorts. The testing order of the five chairs was randomized for each participant.</p>
<p>When the data collection was initiated, the participant stood for 5 min to establish the baselines of the tissue perfusion. The start of data collection from the XSensor and oximeters was synchronized and recorded continuously. During the data recording, the chair was secured to the floor to avoid accidental movement. Forced airflow was provided by a regular office fan to the whole room to ensure the heat dissipation in the environment. For each chair, data were recorded for 10 min of sitting, and the participant was instructed not to shift position significantly during the testing. Between chair testing sessions, the participant stood for 5 min to recover the tissue perfusion in the buttock-thigh tissue to an off-loading condition.</p>
<sec id="section14-0018720812457681">
<title>Data processing</title>
<p>For evaluating the sitting pressure distribution pattern, the interface pressure map on the seat was divided into three seat regions as anterior (ANT-Seat), middle (MID-Seat), and posterior (POST-Seat). The posterior portion of the seat was the area between the buttock-thigh fold and the rear edge of the seat where the backrest was located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720812457681">Figure 2</xref>). The remaining recorded area was bisected into the ANT-Seat and MID-Seat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720812457681">Figure 2</xref>). From the interface pressure recordings, total contact area (TCA) and average pressure (AP) of the seat were obtained. We calculated TCA by multiplying 1.61 cm<sup>2</sup> (the area of a single cell of the XSensor mat) by the number of cells that had a pressure reading higher than the pressure threshold (5 mmHg). The pressure threshold was chosen to eliminate possible noise in the pressure data. The AP was calculated as the total contact pressure (summation of the pressure for all cells with pressure reading higher than 5mmHg) divided by the TCA (summation of the area for all cells with pressure reading higher than 5mmHg). The AP was obtained as a measure for a general indication about the contact pressure applied to the whole contact area.</p>
<p>For tissue perfusion data, the tcPO<sub>2</sub> and tcPCO<sub>2</sub> were averaged along the recording time from a single sensor at RMT and RDT and from three sensors at RIT recording sites across the entire protocol for each chair.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0018720812457681">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>We performed a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures to detect any chair effect (the significant difference among the five chairs) or recording location effect (the difference among the recordings from the three locations of RIT, RMT, and RDT) for tissue perfusion and the three regions of ANT-Seat, MID-Seat, and POST-Seat for the interface pressure. When significance of any effect of the two-way ANOVA was detected, we conducted a pairwise comparison using the Tukey method. An additional similar two-way ANOVA with repeated measures was performed when adding the standing tissue perfusion data at the end of the 5-min period as a virtual “chair” to the chair factor, and the location factor was unchanged. For all the statistical analysis, the independent variables were chair and location, and the dependent variables were AP, TCA, tcPO<sub>2</sub>, and tcPCO<sub>2</sub>. All statistical tests were performed with SAS (SAS, Inc., Cary, NC) with a significance level of .05.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we found a significant effect of chair design on both sitting pressure distribution and buttock-thigh tissue perfusion. Several conclusions can be drawn from the current study.</p>
<p>We assumed that a low AP and a high TCA would give the best distribution of body weight for tissue health and comfort. The ischial tuberosity and posterior sitting area are of greatest concern because these spots present the greatest risk for discomfort because of the amount of weight placed on this area and the presence of bony prominences. The bicompliant chair had the lowest AP on the posterior area as compared with all the other tested office chairs. However, the AP of the posterior area did not have statistically significant differences between the chairs with the exception of bicompliant versus Foam A. Foam B had the highest overall value for TCA, and it was statistically greater than that of Suspension B and bicompliant chairs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we believed that an optimal chair would limit tissue perfusion deviations from standing to a sitting position. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0018720812457681">Figure 4</xref>, one can see that during standing, oxygen perfusion was high and equally distributed at all three locations from buttocks to the thigh. From the same figure, it is apparent that the bicompliant chair was best able to maintain an equal distribution of oxygen during sitting. In addition, the bicompliant chair was the only one that had highest oxygen at RIT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0018720812457681">Figure 4A</xref>) and maintained even distribution of the oxygen among the three recording locations. Other chair designs attained higher levels of oxygen perfusion at the thighs, but since bony prominences are not present at the thighs, this level of perfusion should not have as much benefit as for tissues around the ischial tuberosity.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720812457681">Bogie et al. (1992)</xref> suggested a threshold value of tcPO<sub>2</sub> as 30 mmHg to indicate significantly higher risk to tissue viability below this value. In their later study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812457681">Bogie et al. (1995)</xref> also suggested the threshold value for tcPCO<sub>2</sub> as not beyond 44 mmHg. For all the chairs tested, the tcPCO<sub>2</sub> level during sitting around the ischial tuberosity was well above the suggested level of 44 mmHg. At the same time, the tcPO<sub>2</sub> level around the ischial tuberosity for all the chairs was below the 30-mmHg threshold. This finding suggests that sitting for long durations in any of these chairs without adjusting the posture may impose discomfort in the buttock-thigh region.</p>
<p>There are a few limitations to the findings set forth in this study. First, the patient population was confined to only healthy young Caucasian women with a normal BMI (19.1~24.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Caution should be taken when extrapolating our results to a typical working population of individuals who are not defined by these characteristics. The reason for these stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria was to minimize variations in pelvic shape between genders and body composition, in an attempt to minimize variations in tissue deformation and tissue perfusion caused by pressure, because the pattern of buttock tissue deformation may affect pressure distribution. A narrow age range was used to minimize tissue changes attributed to age, such as decreased collagen and so on.</p>
<p>Another limitation is the short time spent by participants in the seated position for each chair, that is, a period of 10 min. The entire protocol from preparation to the end of the experiment took approximately 2 hr, which was the longest time we could keep an individual in the experiment without causing fatigue in the muscles. The short time sitting in this protocol will not reflect the same trends as from long-term sitting. In addition, because of the short time spent in each chair, any subjective measure of sitting comfort would be limited for its validity. Finally, the posture and static positioning that the participants maintained during the seated data collection was likely not representative of a normal work environment across a prolonged period. Office workers rarely remain in an absolute upright sitting position with 90° angles at the hip and knee. In addition, it is unrealistic to think that a worker would not be moving or shifting around to complete his or her necessary work tasks throughout the day.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings illustrate that chair design and material have small effects on an individual’s pressure distribution and soft tissue perfusion during sitting. It was seen that no one chair in comparison to the others was able to have all the best outcomes. As stated previously, we expected that the best chair would maintain high perfusion of oxygen, would evenly distribute pressure, and would minimize carbon dioxide level. The bicompliant chair kept evenly distributed tissue oxygen perfusion compared with the other chairs and also limited an increase in accumulation of carbon dioxide. In addition, the bicompliant chair had the lowest overall value for average pressure at the location of ischial tuberosity. However, the Foam B model provided the greatest TCA, distributing pressure better than its rivals.</p>
<p>Further research should be conducted to confirm our findings and to find correlates between the investigated variables and actual workplace effects, such as sitting comfort. Ultimately, by drawing links between experimental results and worker responses, we can aid in the recommendation of an optimal office chair.</p>
