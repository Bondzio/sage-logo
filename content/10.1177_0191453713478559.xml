The winner was – or so he himself claims – Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (b. 1956), president then and still president today. However, a great many people doubted the official outcome of the elections, convinced that, in fact, Ahmadinejad’s challenger Mir Hossein Moussavi (b. 1942) had gained the most votes.</p><p>Both on the initial announcement of the election results on Saturday and again on the following Wednesday when the results were formally confirmed in the face of persistent protests, people took to the streets by the millions. Even Tehran’s conservative mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf (b. 1961) estimated the protesters to number about 3 million people. </p><p>A remarkably large number of the initial protesters were women. Even when after a few days of protest, the Revolutionary Guards began clubbing and shooting demonstrators, an exceptionally large number of women remained in the front line of the protests. The protest movement’s face turned out to be a woman’s, too: student Neda Agha Soltan (b. 1982) was shot – possibly by a sniper – and died at a protest march against alleged electoral fraud on 20 June 2009. The video documenting her dying moments went around the world, making public the Iranian regime’s brutality and stirring up hitherto unprecedented international awareness of this protest movement which presented such a young and feminine face. There are songs in her honour, an Oxford-based grant bears her name, and US American sculptor Paula Slater created a bust of Neda Agha Soltan.</p><p>It is no surprise that so many women protested against the allegedly fraudulent elections as it is they who have paid the highest price in the changes of the past decades. Iran has become a country of gender apartheid. The system established after the 1978–9 revolution in Iran made it a top priority to abridge women’s rights. Mere weeks after the Pahlavi dynasty came tumbling down, the progressive Family Law of 1967 was repealed and a new law based on the principles of Islamic jurisprudence was established. Women’s rights to divorce and child custody were limited, the age of consent for girls was at first lowered to 13, later again to 9 years, and polygyny was legalized. A woman’s testimony in court legally was set to be worth only half a man’s, and the same applied to the compensation payable in case of lethal accidents: a woman’s bereaved family still is due only half the blood money that would be paid to relatives of a male victim. A woman’s life, as a logical consequence, is deemed worth only half a man’s.</p><p>Notwithstanding this legal discrimination, today’s Iran is a country where women make up two-thirds of the student body. They hold one in three doctoral degrees; women are parliamentarians, physicians, teachers, mayors and members of the police force. They have even carved out a place for themselves in the Near East’s most male-dominated of public spaces, i.e. road traffic: women are taxi drivers, and even car racers. A great many Iranian women practise the ‘masculine’ martial art karate; the national women’s karate organization has about 1 million members. Karate – an answer to a legal system which allows men to beat up their wives? That is one possible explanation. </p><p>Women have made the arts their home, as well. Their novels can be found at the top of bestseller lists, and they make movies. Some directors are by now nationally and internationally renowned for their work using their skills to exercise influence on an international stage, among them Samira Makhmalbaf (b. 1980) and Rakhshan Bani E’temad (b. 1954). Mir Hossein Moussavi, the man Iranian women saw as the true winner of the 2009 election, was the man they trusted to better their lot. </p><p>It is to director Rakhshan Bani E’temad that we owe a harrowing portrayal of the situation of Iranian women today, filmed in the spring of 2009 right before the elections took place. In her movie <italic>We are Half of Iran’s Population</italic> Bani E’temad recorded meetings of the politically most diverse women uniting to present their demands to the four presidential candidates. These include: joining the United Nation’s CEDAW (Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women) and changing the laws on divorce and on polygyny. The movie shows discussions among Iranian women’s rights activists who openly talk about problems such as the fact that in Iran, you cannot even google the phrase ‘Women’s diseases’ because the word for woman, <italic>Zan</italic>, is blocked by filters, and that journalists in magazines and newspapers are not allowed to use the phrase ‘women’s movement’.</p><p>The movie project included an invitation to the presidential candidates to attend a preview after which their reactions would be filmed and used in the final cut. Of the four candidates invited, Ahmadinejad declined the invitation while Mir Hossein Moussavi attended the preview in the company of his wife, Zahra Rahnavard (b. 1945). When Moussavi was asked to comment and had nothing more to offer than the standard fare of how there is a need for culture and society to change, Rahnavard interrupted him: ‘The main problem is the legal system,’ she blurted out, ‘90 per cent of this country’s laws are against women.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0191453713478559">1</xref></sup> Zahra Rahnavard, Moussavi’s wife, had been Chancellor of Alzahra University until Ahmadinejad, shortly after his election in 2005, had all Iranian universities purged of professors not to his liking, including her.</p><p>Rahnavard certainly is no radical reformer, and her frame of reference is seen as too strictly Islamic by some, but over the past 30 years, she has raised her voice in defence of women’s rights time and time again. She demands more opportunities for political participation and more representation of women by women in parliament. It is wrong to ostracize women, she argues, pointing to their commitment in the 1978–79 revolution in an interview with the women’s magazine <italic>Zan-e ruz</italic> in 1990. In it, she explained that women always have played and continue to play an important role in Iranian society. During the revolution, they contributed centrally and were instrumental in bringing about its victory. Yet when it comes to appointing someone to public office, women are always passed over.</p><p>During the presidential campaigns, many women voters thought that as a man with a woman like her at his side, Moussavi would be certain to champion equal rights once he was elected president. It is even possible that Zahra Rahnavard – albeit indirectly – swung the vote, since at the campaign’s outset, Ahmadinejad, who controls the state media and used taxpayer money for pork barrel politics, stood a good chance of re-election, as surveys from independent sources show. Stood, that is, until the memorable television presidential debate between Ahmadinejad and Moussavi. In this duel, out of the blue, President Ahmadinejad confronted his contender Moussavi with a picture of the latter’s wife and stated that she, the university professor and women’s rights activist, had gotten her various diplomas by fraud. Many Iranians say that this move lost Ahmadinejad a great deal of support. It was his nastily mocking <sup>‘</sup><italic>Begam, begam?</italic>’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0191453713478559">2</xref></sup> [You want me to tell? You want me to tell?] that reminded many people of the numerous occasions in their own lives when they had undergone inquisition-style interrogation by a so-called revolutionary ‘komité’ because of a headdress slipped too low or music played too loudly inside their car.</p><p>Then there was Moussavi’s reaction. Upon hearing this defamation, the normally reticent economic specialist turned vivid and passionate, rising to his wife’s defence with touching fervour. This tender closeness, which the couple also displayed publicly during the campaign, had given rise to many hopes for a new style of politics, especially since Rahnavard was present at every single one of her husband’s campaign appearances and always delivered closing remarks to frenzied cheers. This practice, documented even in Moussavi’s official campaign ads, was previously unheard of in the Islamic Republic of Iran: a man publicly letting his wife have the last word. For her sake or because she was with him, a great many women were on Moussavi’s side in the campaign and actively supported him.</p><p>Thus it came as no surprise that women specifically felt terribly betrayed after the official results were announced and took to the streets by the millions. One of the most popular slogans visible during the protests next to ‘Where is my vote’ and ‘No War, No Lies, Freedom’ was ‘Women equal Men’ (‘Women = Men’). </p><p>The Iranian protest movement of 2009, which was born from protests against a fraudulent election and grew into an outcry against the entire system, has not enjoyed the kind of success the protesters in Egypt or Tunisia have had. But neither is the protest movement of 2009 that came to be known as the Green Movement dead, as the regime likes to claim on all channels; proof of that is provided by news of protests flaring up whenever people see any opportunity, which keep reaching us despite the official news blackout. </p><p>This is not the place for me to address the question why Egyptian and Tunisian protesters, women and men both, succeeded where Iranians did not. The fact remains that some kind of progress has been achieved because the way of thinking about gender has undergone a change. I will now go into some detail to explain why I think this is the case: I believe that in the Iranian public discourse, ‘the woman question’ has come to be viewed as part of the question of democracy. This is a recent development; until very recently, women’s legal discrimination was perceived in Iranian discourse as a ‘women’s only’ problem. There was no widespread public awareness of women’s suppression in Iran as part of a greater issue.</p><p>An important agent of that change, or possibly more of an indicator of how the attitude has changed to what we are seeing these days, was a campaign called ‘Men in Hijabs’ (though, to be precise, it actually featured men in chadors). The issue was not the campaign alone, but rather the whole long ongoing process in which several factors contributed to the change; one of them was the emergence of an indigenous feminism in Iran since the 1990s, which unfortunately cannot be addressed at greater length here. The movement now commonly referred to as ‘Islamic Feminism’ in Iran has made feminism more readily compatible with the local reform discourse. </p><p>But let us return to the campaign ‘Men in Hijabs’ which made international headlines in December 2009 when, after an Iranian photographer’s call for entries, hundreds of pictures of men wearing chadors were posted on a Facebook page. Using these pictures, a movie with a clear political message was produced: the men who had had their pictures taken in this manner had done so to express their commitment to the so-called Green Movement, the movement which arose after the presidential election of June 2009 and which is fighting for democracy.</p><p>‘Men in Hijabs’, however, was not a solidarity campaign for Iranian women who are forced by the law to wear headdress, but rather an act of solidarity with a man, Madjid Tavakkoli (b. 1986), who had delivered a passionate speech on 7 December 2009 on the occasion of the Iranian Students’ Day at Tehran’s Amir Kabir University and had escaped arrest by running from police in disguise. The next day, the Iranian news agency FARS published an article on the dissident illustrated with a photograph of him in women’s clothing.</p><p> This picture was a visual reference to a photograph of the Islamic Republic’s first president Abolhassan Bani Sadr (b. 1933). Both pictures were published on the same page side by side. After falling into disgrace in 1981, Bani Sadr fled Iran. It was rumoured at the time that he had disguised himself as a woman, but this has never been proven, and Bani Sadr himself has never commented on these allegations. As Iran’s erstwhile president, who now lives in Paris, did not get caught when he made good his escape, it must be assumed that the photograph showing him in women’s clothing is a fake. The point in question is: what is being referred to here, opposition politician Bani Sadr’s escape, allegedly veiled and in women’s clothing, is a widely known <italic>topos</italic> in Iran. As a journalist of Iranian descent explained in the<italic> Guardian</italic>:<disp-quote><p>In street slang the image of a man dressed as woman is a slanderous [<italic>sic</italic>]<bold> </bold>of his sexuality and essential manhood. In political terms, evoking Banisadr represents a sort of political red card.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0191453713478559">3</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>The message the state news agency wanted to convey was: the opposition movement’s members aren’t real men; they cowardly hide under women’s clothing while they secretly steal away. They are wimps, sissies, not opponents worth taking seriously. This is a particularly twisted message (and blatantly untrue to boot) since there were notably large numbers of women protesters in the summer of 2009. Not surprisingly, the regime’s tactics fell through and the message backfired massively. The Facebook site mentioned above entitled its campaign: ‘Be a Man. Send us your Picture as a Woman’ and from this, the movie <italic>Men in Hijabs</italic> was created which soon caused quite a stir both nationally and internationally.</p><p>On youtube, the film’s title in both Persian and English is ‘We are all Madjid Tavakkoli – <italic>ma hame madjid tavakkoli hastim</italic>’, and the film also ends with this message in Persian. It starts with a few snapshots, a short clip of the student protests at Amir Kabir University, and Tavakkoli’s speech during these protests. There is also a screen-shot of the Internet site showing the article and photographs of Bani Sadr and Tavakkoli in women’s clothing. The soundtrack of the film’s first pictures consists of a commentary by Mir Hossein Moussavi. In his words:<disp-quote><p>The regime may imprison our children and put them into clothes meant to humiliate them, but we can see them as heroes. We know they are heroes, and we are proud of them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0191453713478559">4</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>The film ends with repeated chants of the word ‘Freedom’, and the appeal: <italic>Let Madjid go.</italic> </p><p>Building a solidarity campaign on a film showing veiled men was an interesting experiment because, for one thing, it subverted Iranian men’s and women’s viewing habits, and also made clear to many men donning a headdress for the first time in their lives how it feels to be wearing one. Another important effect was that gender questions were now being discussed by the Iranian public with a fresh awareness. Aside from creating international awareness, the film also aims its message at an Iranian audience – both the domestic Iranian public and the Iranian diaspora. These two public spheres are increasingly merging into one unified discursive community. By ‘domestic Iranian public’ I mean the public that has constituted itself as an alternative or counter-public to the state-controlled official Iranian public sphere. The place where it unfolds is the Internet, widely available in Iran with its 25 million registered Internet connections. This ‘Internet agora’ is dominated by Iranians living in exile, but they are engaged in an intense dialogue with Iranians living in Iran.</p><p>In a blog, a comment on the film stated:<disp-quote><p>We’ll humiliate you by dressing one of your friends up as a woman! Oh yeah? Well now we’re all dressed like women. And anyway, what’s so bad about women?</p></disp-quote>Another commentary read:<disp-quote><p>The green movement is a post-modern, post-ideological civic movement. It also points to how far the notion of women as a political force has travelled in the 30 years since the revolution. Women are at the forefront of this movement and its badge of honour – they are not an accessory. Zahra Rahnavard [Mir Hossein Moussavi’s wife (K.A.)] and Shirin Ebadi are key leaders and spokeswomen of the movement and Neda [Agha Soltan] its most famous martyr. The green movement is helping to redefine the idea of womanhood in the language of a contemporary Iran.</p></disp-quote>This brings me back to my earlier hypothesis: today, there is a stronger connection between the democratic movement and women’s rights, and paradoxically enough this connection was at least in part established by the attempted humiliation of Tavakkoli; not by that alone of course, but it was a contributing factor. </p><p>This was clearly expressed in speeches held at a solidarity event for Tavakkoli – yet another video widely circulated in the net.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0191453713478559">5</xref></sup> The main speaker at this event was Ahmad Batebi (b. 1977). Batebi became a figurehead of the Iranian opposition after he was photographed during the 1999 student protests holding the bloodied shirt of a dead fellow student. Iranian official security forces had stormed Tehran University’s campus, attacked several of the protesting students and thrown some of them out of windows. Batebi’s picture made it all the way to <italic>The Economist</italic>’s cover and was named ‘Photo of the Year 1999’ – and it put Ahmad Batebi in prison. After his escape, Batebi today continues his work as a political activist in the USA. The interviews he has given since his arrival in the USA are widely circulated over the Internet and have made him famous. His every action is followed in Iran. </p><p>It is not only Batebi saying that the people gathered in the hall should decide if wearing a headdress is shameful or worthy of praise who draws attention to the veil’s symbolical meaning in Iran and connects the Green Movement to the women’s movement; Shirin Ebadi (b. 1947), Iran’s 2003 Peace Nobel Prize winner, has done the same. In an article posted both on the website of her campaign ‘One Million Votes for Women’s Rights’ and on her website named <italic>madrese-ye feministi</italic> [Feminist School], she stated that the men participating in the symbolic campaign had not only stood by their friend, but also defended ‘being a woman’. These men, she wrote, had positioned themselves against the Islamic Republic’s discriminatory laws. They had ‘cried out that they respect their mothers and that they respect the human rights of their sisters’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0191453713478559">6</xref></sup></p><p>In the many blogs and videos by now circulating on the net that use the veiled men’s photographs, many comments in a similar vein can be found. A user named <italic>lacountess</italic> writes:<disp-quote><p>Our values have made a huge leap into the future and we are all riding the waves of this amazing cultural revolution, thanks to Madjid and thanks to all these brave, honorable men. </p></disp-quote>In the end, the solidarity campaign for Madjid Tavakkoli turned out to serve several purposes at once: it was a chance to express support for Tavakkoli as well as livening up the debate among the different factions of the opposition movement. In addition, it presented an opportunity to express rejection of state-ordered <italic>hijab</italic> and discrimination of women, to demand equal rights, and thus to take a stand for democratic values. </p><p>It is true that it has taken a long time until the problem of women’s legal discrimination in Iran was no longer seen as a ‘women only’ problem, and perceived as a problem for men as well. Only recently have Iranian intellectuals started taking a critical stance towards their own past behaviour. Hamid Dabashi (b. 1951), professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, who must be numbered among the most important contemporary Iranian <italic>public intellectuals</italic>, is on record stating:<disp-quote><p>The head scarf protest is a way of showing the same solidarity against a system that came into being after the Iranian Revolution. We Iranian men are late doing this. If we did this when <italic>rusari</italic> [a form of headcover for women, whose wearing is legally enforced in Iran] was forced on those among our sisters who did not wish to wear it 30 years ago, we would have perhaps not been [<italic>sic</italic>] here today. ‘If the Islamic Republic of Iran is this narrow-minded’, Shahin Najafi [an Iranian musician, poet and singer], has put it, ‘then we will accept the challenge.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0191453713478559">7</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>One of Iran’s most famous contemporary writers, Shahriar Mandanipour (b. 1956), tells a similar tale about this delay, the lack of solidarity, and how the connection between democracy, women’s rights and compulsory veiling was ignored, in his novel <italic>Censoring an Iranian Love Story</italic>: <disp-quote><p>Sara goes to the dressing room. This is the perfect opportunity for Dara to savor the bitter taste of Sara’s tooth-shattering report. Well, like many enlightened Iranian men, he is subconsciously ashamed of his own incompetence and inaction, when after the revolution, mothers, sisters, and wives, through coercion and by having pushpins stabbed into their foreheads, were forced to wear headscarves and chadors, and year after year, their human rights were taken away from them. And at this very moment, the stinging slap of a political inspiration lands on his ear. Dara discovers that during all the years that he and his generation fought for utopia in Iran, they were wrong, and they should have instead fought for this small and basic right.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0191453713478559">8</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>While Iranian women’s rights activists always – and quite rightly – insist that Iranian women have more pressing problems than their headdress, the veil as such has tremendous symbolic significance stemming from its history. It is an essential part of the history of the Iranian government’s disregard for and suppression of its citizens’ rights. </p><p>Within the Iranian discourse, however, awareness of this connection was virtually non-existent. Looking at the writings of the reformers most dedicated to fighting for human rights and democracy, this absence is very striking. Most reformist thinkers, be they religious or secular in outlook, have little to say in regard to gender. This is especially true of the <italic>roushanfekran-e dini</italic>, religious intellectuals, as they call themselves. Take ‘Abdolkarim Soroush (b. 1945), the Iranian reform movement’s leading figure: he rarely talks about gender, and when he does, he stays inside the traditional conceptual framework. A detailed analysis of his views by Parvin Paidar comes to the conclusion that they are ‘limited and discriminatory’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0191453713478559">9</xref></sup> <italic>Kiyan</italic>, possibly the most important magazine of reformist Islam, which was shut down in 2008, did not once feature either a contribution under a female author’s name or a single article on gender questions. When asked why this was, Soroush said that the religious intellectuals had more important issues to address and that women’s issues had their place in women’s magazines. In the reform intellectuals’ mode of thinking, there was no category called gender. To be fair it must be said that the secular opposition is hardly less gender-blind – the intellectuals who gathered around the magazine <italic>Goft-o Gu</italic> [Dialogue] in the 1990s being an exception – and that also applies to the opposition in exile outside Iran. </p><p>Human rights issues were viewed in a hierarchical order with democracy regarded as a primary right that, in the hierarchy of rights, held priority over women’s rights, which were regarded as a secondary type of right. This has led to a perception of the democracy movement as the main struggle and the women’s movement as the less important one. Some reformists articulated this view and concluded that, although it was acceptable that groups would organize for and around their special group rights, care had to be taken that these special group activities did not come into conflict with the broader and more general struggle for democracy.</p><p>Naturally, women have protested against this attitude saying there could not possibly be a hierarchical ranking in which women’s rights find themselves positioned below democracy as women’s rights are an intrinsic part of human rights and thus of the democratic process itself. Disregarding this criticism, the male-dominated discourse long assigned all gender issues exclusively to the field of jurisprudence, <italic>feqh</italic>. However, the reformers did not see <italic>feqh</italic> as the arena where a new interpretation or reorientation of Islam ought to be promoted. <italic>Feqh</italic> proper was no subject of interest to reform intellectuals such as Soroush, Akbar Ganji (b. 1960), or Saeed Hajjarian (b. 1954), and those who did work on it – Mohsen Kadivar (b. 1959), for example – only concerned themselves with constitutional law. Gender was not only too unimportant to be addressed, but the prevailing attitude – you could call it a hopeful view – even was that once the reformist agenda had been realized, questions of gender would just go away.</p><p>My impression is that ever since the summer of 2009, this has changed. These days, there is an awareness that women’s rights are not a secondary type of rights, but that rights are interconnected. This was made possible by women’s mass participation in the protests, the discussions that followed, some of which were sparked by the movie <italic>Men in Hijabs</italic>, and of course by the state of Iran’s ‘Islamist feminism’.
