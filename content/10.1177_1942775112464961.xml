<abstract>
<p>This study examined faculty staffing patterns in 217 university-based leadership preparation programs, using data collected from an online questionnaire. Units rely on full-time educational leadership faculty, faculty from outside their units, and adjuncts to comprise their instructional core. Findings disclose that research institutions have smaller student–faculty ratios than other institution types, and units with enrollments exceeding 500 students employ significantly more adjuncts than institutions with smaller enrollments. Units are hiring more adjuncts and full-time clinical faculty, while employing fewer tenure-line faculty than reported in previous studies of the professoriate. In addition, full-time faculty numbers are not increasing proportionately with enrollment increases.</p>

<p>In today’s era of accountability, school leaders are expected to possess the necessary skills to facilitate student learning gains as soon as they complete their leadership preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1942775112464961">Frye, O’Neill, &amp; Bottoms, 2006</xref>). A growing body of research has documented the positive influence of effective school leaders in guiding instructional improvement and school reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1942775112464961">Leithwood &amp; Jantzi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1942775112464961">Robinson, Lloyd, &amp; Rowe, 2008</xref>). Equally obvious is the fact that an ineffective school leader can have a negative influence on student learning. Over the past decade, university-based leadership preparation programs have been under increasing scrutiny—being challenged to defend their efficacy in preparing high-quality leaders and to document their program effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1942775112464961">Cibulka, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>An important marker of leadership preparation effectiveness is the quality of the instructional staff. It is essential that leadership preparation units possess sufficient faculty resources to deliver high-quality learning experiences that provide aspiring school administrators with the knowledge and skills to effectively lead the nation’s schools and school systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1942775112464961">National Commission on Excellence in Educational Administration [NCEEA], 1987</xref>). Programs should create a vibrant learning community that demonstrates “intellectual vigor, high standards of practice” and includes “a challenging faculty who are themselves active scholars” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1942775112464961">NCEEA, 1987</xref>, p. 23). A core group of faculty is essential, and the collective instructional staff not only should have varied professional experiences but also should possess scholarly expertise to teach disciplinary subspecializations within the leadership preparation curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1942775112464961">Hackmann, Bauer, Cambron-McCabe, &amp; Quinn, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The term <italic>critical faculty mass</italic> has been used to describe the educational leadership faculty who comprise each unit’s instructional core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1942775112464961">University Council for Educational Administration [UCEA], 1998</xref>), but this definition does not fully encompass the staffing arrangements that may be used. Leadership preparation programs may engage a variety of professionals to deliver the curriculum and supervise learning experiences for educational leadership students, including tenure-line and clinical faculty members who are assigned full-time to the unit, university faculty assigned to other units within the department or college and who occasionally teach educational leadership courses in their areas of expertise, and part-time adjunct instructors who typically are practicing school administrators contracted to teach courses on an as-needed basis. Furthermore, recommendations for minimum staffing levels for university-based leadership preparation programs consider only the number of full-time faculty assigned to the unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1942775112464961">National Policy Board for Educational Administration [NPBEA], 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1942775112464961">NCEEA, 1987</xref>), thus overlooking other professionals who also may teach educational leadership courses and supervise students’ field experiences.</p>
<p>Historically, there has been controversy over the appropriate role of part-time instructors in leadership preparation programs. The use of part-time adjuncts was endorsed by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1942775112464961">NCEEA (1987)</xref>, because individuals who are practicing administrators can bring relevance to the curriculum and course experiences due to their ongoing leadership experiences. Yet, some scholars have cautioned against the overuse of adjuncts because they are perceived to diminish program quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112464961">Levine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1942775112464961">Shakeshaft, 2002</xref>). Additional research is needed to determine the extent to which full- and part-time faculty members are utilized in the nation’s leadership preparation programs.</p>
<p>This article begins with an overview of research on educational leadership faculty in higher education institutions and then presents selected findings from a comprehensive study of educational leadership programs and faculty. In the “Discussion” and “Implications and Recommendations” section, comparisons are made to prior studies and recommendations are provided for institutions and professional organizations.</p>
<sec id="section1-1942775112464961">
<title>Context of Faculty Staffing in Educational Leadership Units</title>
<p>To gain an understanding of instructional staffing practices in educational leadership units, we reviewed research related to institutional capacity, which involves the university’s commitment of sufficient human, physical, and fiscal resources to deliver high-quality learning experiences. In addition, we examined studies on academic drift, which addresses the expansion of leadership preparation programming by nonresearch-oriented institutions.</p>
<sec id="section2-1942775112464961">
<title>Institutional Capacity</title>
<p>Concerns have been voiced for several decades that many universities do not have the necessary institutional capacity to fully support their leadership preparation programs. In 1987, the NCEEA asserted that fewer than 40% of U.S. leadership preparation programs possessed the institutional resources and commitment that were necessary for excellence. More recently, scholars have argued that some leadership preparation programs function as cash cows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1942775112464961">Anderson &amp; Jones, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112464961">Levine, 2005</xref>), generating tuition windfalls through large student enrollments staffed by minimal faculty lines, with revenues siphoned away and redistributed to fund other campus initiatives that are more highly valued by the university administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112464961">Levine, 2005</xref>). To sustain their programs, these units may reduce costs by hiring part-time instructors and increase tuition revenues by admitting large numbers of lower quality students in multiple off-campus cohort sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112464961">Levine, 2005</xref>). These strategies can lead to mediocrity and can seem counterproductive for units that are dedicated to preparing highly skilled school leaders. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1942775112464961">NCEEA (1987)</xref> suggested that programs dedicated to excellence must admit fewer and higher quality candidates into their programs, implement rigorous clinical preparation, and commit additional university resources to support faculty and students. In this section, we review recommendations of national professional associations regarding faculty resources, and we explore historical trends in educational leadership units.</p>
<sec id="section3-1942775112464961">
<title>Faculty minimums recommended by professional organizations</title>
<p>In an effort to ensure sufficient institutional faculty capacity, some professional organizations and educational leadership task forces have suggested minimums for the number of faculty assigned to leadership preparation programs. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1942775112464961">NCEEA (1987)</xref> and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1942775112464961">NPBEA (1989)</xref> recommended that programs must have a minimum of five full-time educational leadership faculty members. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1942775112464961">UCEA (1998)</xref>, which accepts as members only leadership preparation units offering doctorates, has adopted standards requiring member institutions to maintain a “critical mass of tenure-line full-time faculty members” described as “typically five or more.” The National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE), through its Educational Leadership Constituent Council (ELCC), accredits numerous leadership preparation units across the United States, but NCATE and the ELCC have not established minimum faculty staffing requirements (H. Fede, personal communication, March 16, 2011).</p>
<p>An analysis of these staffing recommendations discloses several limitations. First, the recommendations address only full-time faculty minimums and do not consider other individuals who may work within the program, such as part-time adjunct instructors. Second, the recommendations do not differentiate by administrative licensure options (i.e., principal, superintendent) or degrees awarded by the unit (i.e., master’s, educational specialist, doctor of education, doctor of philosophy). Units involving multiple licensure programs and degrees arguably would be required to offer a broader array of courses, thus necessitating additional faculty members. Similarly, units offering doctorates likely will need additional faculty members compared with those offering only master’s degrees, due to the intensive time commitments involved with dissertation supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942775112464961">Baker, Orr, &amp; Young, 2007</xref>). Finally, the staffing recommendations are not graduated by student enrollments; thus, a program might be considered as adequately staffed with five full-time faculty members, regardless of whether 10 or 1,000 students were enrolled.</p>

<title>Research on educational leadership staffing</title>
<p>The proportion of nontenure-line instructors, including full-time clinical positions and part-time adjunct appointments, has dramatically increased in all academic disciplines in U.S. colleges and universities since the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1942775112464961">American Association of University Professors [AAUP], 1993</xref>). The AAUP reported in 1993 that 58% of U.S. higher education faculty members were employed in nontenure-line appointments. In fall 2009, 68% of faculty employed in 4-year public universities were in full-time appointments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1942775112464961">Snyder &amp; Dillow, 2011</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1942775112464961">AAUP (2003)</xref> recommended that no more than 25% of any department’s total instruction should be delivered through contingent appointments, including both part-time appointments and full-time nontenure-line positions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1942775112464961">
<title>Number of full-time faculty</title>
<p>National investigations of educational leadership faculty have disclosed that the mean number of full-time faculty members per unit has fluctuated through the years and also varies by institution type. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1942775112464961">Davis (1978)</xref> reported a mean of 6.5 full-time faculty in 1975 to 1976, with an average of 8.7 faculty in institutions offering doctoral degrees and a mean of 5.1 at other institutions. The mean number of full-time faculty declined to 5.0 in 1986 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1942775112464961">McCarthy, Kuh, Newell, &amp; Iacona, 1988</xref>), then increased slightly to 5.6 in 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1942775112464961">McCarthy &amp; Kuh, 1997</xref>), and again declined to 4.8 in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1942775112464961">Hackmann &amp; McCarthy, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Institutions classified by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942775112464961">Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (n.d.)</xref> as research and doctoral universities historically have employed more full-time educational leadership faculty than comprehensive institutions, which typically offer few, if any, doctoral programs on their campuses. For example, in 1994, the mean number of full-time educational leadership faculty members at research universities was 6.6 and at doctoral universities was 6.5, compared with a mean of 4.5 faculty members in comprehensive institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1942775112464961">McCarthy &amp; Kuh, 1997</xref>). In 2008, the research universities reported a mean of 6.5 full-time educational leadership faculty, compared with means of 4.5 full-time faculty in doctoral universities and 3.9 in comprehensive universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1942775112464961">Hackmann &amp; McCarthy, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Clinical versus tenure-line full-time faculty</title>
<p>Part-time adjunct faculty members have been involved in educational leadership instructional units for quite some time, but the employment of full-time clinical (nontenure-line) faculty is a more recent phenomenon. In studies of the educational leadership professoriate conducted in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s, clinical faculty occupied only 1% to 3% of the full-time faculty roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1942775112464961">McCarthy et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1942775112464961">McCarthy &amp; Kuh, 1997</xref>). Yet, by 2008, this proportion had climbed to 16% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1942775112464961">Hackmann &amp; McCarthy, 2011</xref>). Within the educational leadership discipline, UCEA is the only professional organization that has adopted policies related to proportions for tenure-line and other faculty involved in the instructional program. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1942775112464961">UCEA (1998)</xref> membership standards state that full-time <italic>tenure-line</italic> faculty must teach a majority of the leadership preparation program’s coursework.</p>
<p>Leadership preparation units often employ full-time clinical faculty who have had successful careers as school superintendents because recent administrative experience is lacking among the tenure-line faculty, and the addition of such clinical faculty is perceived to give the units more credibility among practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1942775112464961">Hackmann, 2007</xref>). Differences were documented in 2008 in that clinical faculty were more likely than tenure-line faculty to have school administrative experience, to be leadership generalists rather than content specialists, and to list teaching as their primary strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1942775112464961">Hackmann &amp; McCarthy, 2011</xref>). Tenure-line faculty in 2008 were more likely than clinical faculty to engage in research and publishing and to report content specializations in areas such as law, finance, and organizational theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1942775112464961">Hackmann &amp; McCarthy, 2011</xref>). Thus, if the percentage of clinical faculty continues to climb, the nature of instruction in preparation programs and amount of research conducted by educational leadership faculty will be significantly affected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1942775112464961">
<title>Student–faculty advising ratios</title>
<p>The quality of personal and professional support that professors provide to their advisees can be compromised when student–faculty ratios are excessive. Trends indicate the advising loads have increased over the past several decades. Reviewing the number of master’s students that full-time faculty members reported advising over the previous 3-year period, the student–faculty ratio was 11.5 students in 1986 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1942775112464961">McCarthy et al., 1988</xref>), 31.9 in 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1942775112464961">McCarthy &amp; Kuh, 1997</xref>), and 47.5 in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1942775112464961">Hackmann &amp; McCarthy, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1942775112464961">Hackmann and McCarthy (2011)</xref> found that units with off-campus locations and online course offerings in 2008 had significantly higher student–faculty ratios than did units that offered no distance learning coursework.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1942775112464961">
<title>Adjunct instructors</title>
<p>Leadership preparation units regularly hire part-time adjunct instructors, whether to complement the expertise of full-time faculty or as a cost-savings mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1942775112464961">Schneider, 2003</xref>). Because of their school administrative experiences, adjuncts can be valued contributors, bringing relevance to curriculum content and field experience supervision. Although the use of part-time clinical faculty was endorsed by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1942775112464961">NCEEA (1987)</xref>, empirical research on these appointments is relatively sparse. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1942775112464961">McCarthy and Kuh (1997)</xref> reported an average of 3.0 adjunct instructors were regularly employed per unit in 1994, approximately one half the number of full-time tenure-line faculty. In 2008, Hackmann and McCarthy determined that educational leadership units hired a mean of 5.4 adjunct instructors, a large increase from the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>Some researchers have reported that program quality can be diminished when leadership preparation programs excessively or exclusively rely on adjuncts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112464961">Levine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1942775112464961">Shakeshaft, 2002</xref>). Based on a survey of 295 school superintendents who were part-time adjuncts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1942775112464961">Schneider (2003)</xref> found little communication between adjuncts and full-time faculty. More than one third of adjuncts developed their course syllabi without guidance from the faculty and fewer than one fifth were formally evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1942775112464961">Schneider, 2003</xref>). Stating that many leadership preparation units disproportionately staffed their off-campus cohort locations with adjunct instructors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112464961">Levine (2005)</xref> argued that the dominant instructional delivery mode for many adjuncts consisted of “telling war stories” (p. 36). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1942775112464961">Shakeshaft (2002)</xref> reported that 11% of leadership preparation programs on Long Island, New York, employed no full-time faculty and utilized only adjunct instructors. She concluded that program quality can be reduced if adjunct instructors are not informed of expectations for course quality and are not socialized into the departmental culture.</p>

<sec id="section9-1942775112464961">
<title>Academic Drift</title>
<p>The number of leadership preparation units in the United States has greatly increased over the last several decades, increasing from 299 in 1972 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1942775112464961">Campbell &amp; Newell, 1973</xref>), to 366 in 1986 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1942775112464961">McCarthy et al., 1988</xref>), and to 590 in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1942775112464961">Hackmann &amp; McCarthy, 2011</xref>). Growth has been spurred, in part, as some higher education institutions increased overall student enrollments, shifted their missions, and expanded academic offerings; this practice in which smaller, lower status institutions enact processes to become more like more prestigious top-tier research universities has been characterized as <italic>academic drift</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1942775112464961">Berdahl, 1985</xref>). This phenomenon commonly involves an aspirational desire of a lower status institution to pattern itself after research institutions through the addition of doctoral programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942775112464961">Baker, Orr, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1942775112464961">Huisman &amp; Morphew, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1942775112464961">Morphew, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1942775112464961">Morphew &amp; Huisman, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Evidence of academic drift has been documented in leadership preparation, as numerous nonresearch institutions recently have established educational leadership doctoral degrees as the first doctoral-degree option on their campuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942775112464961">Baker, Orr, et al., 2007</xref>). Lower tier universities often select educational administration doctoral degrees to increase their institutional stature because state approval can more easily be attained for these doctoral programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112464961">Levine, 2005</xref>). Several concerns regarding institutional capacity exist for the institution’s first doctoral program, including faculty research expertise and their ability to develop a rigorous curriculum, the need to nurture a departmental and university culture to support high-quality research, and the need to formulate and adhere to rigorous doctoral admissions standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1942775112464961">Orr, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942775112464961">Baker, Orr, et al. (2007)</xref> noted that comprehensive universities experienced a 48% increase in educational leadership doctoral programs between 1993 and 2003. As a result, educational leadership doctoral-degree production is shifting away from research institutions: Whereas 60% of doctoral degrees were awarded by research universities in 1990, this proportion sharply declined to 42% in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1942775112464961">Baker, Wolf-Wendel, &amp; Twombly, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As was noted earlier in this section, a trend over time has been documented that leadership preparation programs are employing fewer full-time faculty than in the mid-1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1942775112464961">Davis, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1942775112464961">Hackmann &amp; McCarthy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1942775112464961">McCarthy et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1942775112464961">McCarthy &amp; Kuh, 1997</xref>). Approximately 60% of leadership preparation units were staffed by recommended minimum of five full-time faculty members in 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1942775112464961">McCarthy &amp; Kuh, 1997</xref>), but only 44% of units met the five-faculty standard in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1942775112464961">Hackmann &amp; McCarthy, 2011</xref>). In light of concerns about institutional capacity and academic drift in leadership preparation programs, additional investigation of faculty distribution and its relationship to student enrollments in doctoral and masters programs seemed warranted to discern whether units maintained faculty staffing levels sufficient to offer high-quality programs.</p>

<list id="list1-1942775112464961" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: Does the number of faculty members assigned to leadership preparation units, including full-time faculty, other university faculty, and adjuncts, vary by institution type and UCEA affiliation? Are there differences between leadership preparation units that offer doctoral degrees compared with other educational leadership units?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: Does the student/faculty ratio vary across institution types, doctoral-degree granting institution types, UCEA affiliation, and enrollment strata?</p></list-item></list>
<sec id="section11-1942775112464961">
<title>Population</title>
<p>To address these research questions, we conducted additional analyses on a data set we collected on leadership preparation programs in the United States and full-time educational leadership faculty members in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1942775112464961">Hackmann &amp; McCarthy, 2011</xref>). We engaged in extensive efforts to identify all leadership preparation programs in the United States, including consulting directories of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1942775112464961">Educational Testing Service (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1942775112464961">Peterson’s (2007)</xref> and searching websites maintained by the National Council of Professors of Educational Administration, the UCEA, and individual universities. We identified 614 programs and extended email invitations to the department heads or educational leadership program coordinators (program heads). Individuals from 24 institutions responded that they did not have a leadership preparation program, resulting in a total population of 590 units. Data were gathered through an online questionnaire, compiling information on the unit’s structure, degree programs offered, faculty size, faculty composition, and number of graduate students. Usable questionnaires were completed by 217 program heads, resulting in a 36.8% response rate.</p>

<title>Types of Institutions</title>
<p>In 1970, the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education developed a classification system of colleges and universities, subsequently modifying these classifications in 1976, 1987, 1994, 2000, and 2005. The framework was revised substantially in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942775112464961">Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, n.d</xref>.), and six basic classifications were created: doctorate-granting institutions, master’s colleges and universities, baccalaureate colleges, special-focus institutions, tribal colleges, and associate’s colleges. Institutions were further differentiated within these classifications in accordance with their externally funded research activity and the number and type of degrees granted. Doctorate-granting universities include research universities with very high research activity (RU/VH), high research activity (RU/H), and doctoral/research universities (DRU). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1942775112464961">Figure 1</xref> contains descriptions of the Carnegie categories that include institutions with leadership preparation programs.</p>

<p>We compared the distribution of the 217 respondents to the total population of 590 leadership preparation programs that we identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1942775112464961">Table 1</xref>). Of these 217 responding units, 124 offered doctoral degrees in educational leadership. All responding units that were within the Carnegie classifications of research universities—RU/VH or RU/H—offered educational leadership doctoral degrees. Within the next tier, 84.6% of DRU educational leadership units awarded educational leadership doctoral degrees. The master’s colleges and universities–larger programs (Master’s/L) contained the highest proportion of U.S. institutions offering leadership preparation, but only 39.7% of this subgroup offered educational leadership doctoral degrees. Of the responding units in the two other master’s classifications, master’s colleges and universities–medium rograms (Master’s/M) and master’s colleges and universities–smaller programs (Master’s/S), only 10.5% contained doctoral-degree programs, and 15.4% of the baccalaureate, special-focus, and tribal classifications reported having doctoral-degree programs. Therefore, we elected to combine these remaining institutions into a category we called “Smaller Tier” institutions. This resulted in the following five categories for the current analyses: RU/VH, RU/H, DRU, Master’s/L, and Smaller Tier institutions (Master’s/M, Master’s/S, Baccalaureate/Arts and Sciences, Baccalaureate/Diverse, Special/Faith, Special/Other, Tribal).</p>

<p>Data also were categorized based on UCEA affiliation at the time of the study. In addition, student enrollments in the responding units were grouped into the following strata for analysis: fewer than 100 students, 100 to 199 students, 200 to 299 students, 300 to 399 students, 400 to 499 students, and 500+ students.</p>
<p>Frequencies and means were calculated for all variables, using the SPSS 18.0 statistical package. Univariate analysis of variance tests were used to identify differences based on institution type and UCEA affiliation, and multivariate analysis of variance tests were used to test for significance based on enrollment strata, with the Bonferroni correction used for post hoc comparisons.</p>

<sec id="section13-1942775112464961">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>In developing the population, we relied on multiple sources to create our database of university-based educational leadership units. It is possible that some programs were overlooked in this process. In addition, our analysis of the research questions was limited by the overall respondent pool. Another limitation is that, for the purposes of this study, we did not differentiate tenure-line and clinical faculty in analyzing full-time faculty.</p>
<p>An additional limitation is that some universities may have changed their Carnegie classification status, may have attained or relinquished UCEA membership, or may have implemented doctoral-degree programs since 2008. Distribution of institutions based on their current standing related to these criteria, rather than their status in 2008, may alter the findings.</p>
<p>A final limitation is that this study investigated the total number and types of faculty who were involved within the educational leadership unit, and this information was not used as a proxy for the quality of the leadership preparation unit itself. A variety of factors, including the institutions from which faculty members earned their terminal degrees, research or instructional expertise, and prior school leadership experience of the faculty, may influence the overall instructional quality and capacity of the leadership preparation unit.</p>

<sec id="section14-1942775112464961">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>This section presents the findings of this study, including the number of full-time faculty in leadership preparation units, the number of full-time faculty outside educational leadership units who regularly teach educational leadership students, part-time adjunct faculty, student enrollments, and student/faculty ratios. Results are presented by institution type and UCEA affiliation.</p>
<sec id="section15-1942775112464961">
<title>Number of Full-Time Faculty</title>
<p>Program heads were asked to enumerate the individuals in their units who were employed in full-time educational leadership faculty positions, noting whether they were in tenure-line or nontenure-accruing appointments. Both faculty types (tenure line and nontenure line) were included when calculating the number of full-time faculty members employed in the unit.</p>
<p>The number of full-time faculty employed in the 217 leadership preparation units ranged from 0 to 16, with a mean of 4.75 faculty. There was a significant difference in the number of full-time faculty employed based on institution type, <italic>F</italic>(4, 212) = 11.29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .18. Units classified as RU/VH employed on average significantly more full-time faculty (<italic>M</italic> = 6.56) than Master’s/L units (<italic>M</italic> = 4.73). The RU/VH also employed more full-time faculty as compared with Smaller Tier institutions (<italic>M</italic> = 2.63). RU/H (<italic>M</italic> = 6.35) and Master’s/L (<italic>M</italic> = 4.73) employed significantly more full-time faculty than Smaller Tier (<italic>M</italic> = 2.63) units (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1942775112464961">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study provides an overview of recent faculty staffing trends in leadership preparation units across the United States. These findings substantiate prior concerns that have been stated regarding full-time faculty numbers at various institution types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112464961">Levine, 2005</xref>). The results also deepen our understanding of the array of staffing alternatives used by leadership preparation units. In this section, we discuss selected findings, comparing them with previous research on educational leadership units and faculty.</p>
<sec id="section22-1942775112464961">
<title>The majority of leadership preparation programs and students are situated in nonresearch universities</title>
<p>A thorough investigation uncovered 590 degree-granting leadership preparation programs in the United States in 2008, a number that is higher than estimates of 360 in 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1942775112464961">McCarthy &amp; Kuh, 1997</xref>), 472 in 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942775112464961">Baker, Orr, et al., 2007</xref>), and 500 in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112464961">Levine, 2005</xref>). Although 43% of responding units in this study were situated in the Carnegie categories that offer doctorates (RU/VH, RU/H, or DRU), only 35% of the total population of 590 programs were housed in universities offering doctorates, which supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112464961">Levine’s (2005)</xref> assertion that the majority of educational leadership students were enrolled in nonresearch universities. Expressing concerns about institutional capacity and academic drift, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942775112464961">Baker, Orr, et al. (2007)</xref> also reported movement away from research universities, noting a concentration of programs at the Comprehensive I level (a prior Carnegie classification that is most closely aligned with the current Master’s/L designation).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1942775112464961">
<title>Educational leadership units are being staffed by fewer full-time faculty members and are relying on more full-time clinical faculty and part-time adjunct instructors to deliver instruction</title>
<p>Leadership preparation programs reported a mean of 6.5 full-time faculty members in 1975 to 1976 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1942775112464961">Davis, 1978</xref>), but this number declined to 5.6 in 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1942775112464961">McCarthy &amp; Kuh, 1997</xref>) and to 4.8 in 2008. Differences were apparent by institution type. In 2008, programs in research universities (RU/VH and RU/H) averaged more than six full-time faculty members, whereas the DRU and Master’s/L averaged fewer than five full-time faculty, and the Smaller Tier institution types averaged fewer than three full-time faculty. In 1994, staffing levels in doctoral programs were similar to those in research institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1942775112464961">McCarthy &amp; Kuh, 1997</xref>), but this was no longer the case in 2008. The mean number of full-time faculty members in DRU universities in 2008 more closely resembled that of Master’s/L units.</p>
<p>The number of tenure-line faculty has declined more than the overall means suggest, because the percentage of full-time clinical faculty has increased dramatically across educational leadership units during the past 15 years. The overall decline in the number of full-time faculty has understandably caused leadership preparation programs to use part-time adjunct instructors to supplement instruction. The use of adjunct instructors has increased over time, with units averaging 4.67 adjuncts in 2008 compared with 3.0 in 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1942775112464961">McCarthy &amp; Kuh, 1997</xref>). In addition, in 1994, there was a 2:1 ratio of full-time faculty members to adjuncts. No institution types approached that ratio in 2008; in fact, the number of adjunct instructors exceeded that of full-time faculty in DRU, Master’s/L, and Smaller Tier units. This finding of increased use of adjuncts is consistent with that reported by other scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112464961">Levine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1942775112464961">Shakeshaft, 2002</xref>). Given the significant reductions in funding that many universities have experienced during the current economic recession, leadership preparation units have not been immune to cuts in full-time faculty that have occurred across university campuses. Thus, fiscal constraints are possibly causing units to rely on higher proportions of clinical and adjunct faculty members to staff their programs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1942775112464961">
<title>The majority of programs do not meet the standard of five full-time faculty members recommended by professional associations</title>
<p>Considering both clinical and tenure-line faculty in full-time roles, approximately 44% of all responding units in 2008 contained at least five full-time faculty members. In 1987, the NCEEA estimated that only about 40% of leadership preparation programs possessed the resources that were necessary for excellence. If this minimum is applied as the NCEEA criterion for excellence, it appears that educational leadership units have been losing ground in meeting this standard. Furthermore, there were dramatic differences by institution type in 2008. Whereas approximately three fourths of RU/VH and RU/H institutions met the five-faculty standard in 2008, only 39% of DRU, 37% of Master’s/L, and 12% of Smaller Tier institutions staffed their educational leadership programs with this recommended minimum. A total of 80% of UCEA-member institutions met this standard, compared with 33% of non-UCEA institutions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-1942775112464961">
<title>Full-time faculty numbers in leadership preparation units are not increasing in proportion to student enrollment increases</title>
<p>The mean number of full-time faculty members in programs with fewer than 100 students was 3.35, compared with a mean of 9.33 for programs with 500+ students. Units with the largest student enrollments had nearly 3 times as many faculty members as those with the smallest enrollments, which is to be expected, but the student/faculty ratios of these large-enrollment programs were 10 times greater than the small-enrollment units. To compensate for the inability to add sufficient numbers of full-time faculty members as student enrollments increased, units reported expanding the employment of part-time adjunct faculty. Depending on the enrollment stratum, units with the highest student enrollments regularly used between 5 and 9 times more adjunct instructors than other leadership preparation units and reported student/faculty ratios that were 3 to 9 times larger. These data lend credence to criticisms that some units are cash cows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1942775112464961">Anderson &amp; Jones, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112464961">Levine, 2005</xref>), operating with large student enrollments and courses staffed by a stable of adjunct instructors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-1942775112464961">
<title>Research universities employed more full-time faculty members and enrolled fewer students, on average, than other institution types</title>
<p>Programs at RU/VH and RU/H universities in 2008 reported lower student enrollments on average and a higher mean number of full-time faculty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1942775112464961">1</xref></sup> As a result, research universities maintained lower student/faculty ratios (24.80:1 for RU/VH, 26.74:1 for RU/H), whereas DRU, Master’s/L, and Smaller Tier institution types reported ratios ranging between 35.75:1 and 45.70:1. When institutions that did not offer educational leadership doctoral degrees were excluded, student/faculty ratios improved only marginally for Master’s/L programs and increased for DRU and Smaller Tier programs. Thus, research institutions (RU/VH, RU/H) are dedicating full-time faculty to their units in proportion to their student advising ratios, whereas the other institution types (DRU, Master’s/L, Smaller Tier) are not increasing their full-time faculty numbers as student enrollments increase. Others have questioned the institutional commitment and ability to deliver a quality program of nonresearch universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942775112464961">Baker, Orr, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112464961">Levine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1942775112464961">Orr, 2007</xref>), and these findings reinforce these concerns.</p>
<p>Previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1942775112464961">McCarthy &amp; Kuh, 1997</xref>) has disclosed that the mean number of full-time faculty in leadership preparation programs at doctoral universities was very similar to the mean in research universities. However, this study determined that staffing practices at DRU universities in 2008 were much closer to those at Master’s/L institutions in terms of the number of full-time faculty, number of enrolled students, and student/faculty ratios. It is unclear whether these changes in the DRU universities are a result of the 2005 revision of the Carnegie classification for doctoral universities or are representative of changing practices within leadership preparation units at these types of institutions.</p>

<title>Implications and Recommendations</title>
<p>Several findings from this study are very disconcerting and have implications for the educational leadership field. First, the majority of university-based leadership preparation units in the United States are staffed by fewer than five full-time faculty members, and the average faculty size continues to decline. Second, several units—albeit a small minority of the respondent sample—have elected to maintain exceptionally large student enrollments, rather than to embrace the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1942775112464961">NCEEA (1987)</xref> recommendation, “that the campuses prepare fewer—better” (p. 24). Third, trends were very clear in confirming that as student enrollments increased, student/faculty ratios did not remain constant; indeed, the number of students per faculty member increased significantly as enrollments climbed. Fourth, although research universities and UCEA-member universities in this study reported student/faculty ratios averaging between 26 and 28 students per faculty member, all other institution types and non-UCEA units reported much higher ratios, ranging between 38 and 50 students per faculty member.</p>
<p>Numerous implications arise from these findings. With current budget constraints facing universities nationally, educational leadership faculty may be pressured to offer off-campus and online programs in an effort to create new and expanded revenue streams. As leadership preparation units expand their enrollments, program quality, student quality, and student support can become compromised. Faculty may be called into service to handle increasingly heavy student advising loads and may need to dedicate more time to grading student assignments and responding to student needs, or they may elect to lower course expectations to keep instructional demands manageable. Alternatively, units may rely on a large cadre of adjuncts to teach courses and advise students. Others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112464961">Levine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1942775112464961">Orr, 2007</xref>) have expressed concerns about diminished instructional expectations, reduced admissions standards, decreased selectivity, and diminished student quality that can result when leadership preparation programs expand their student enrollments without increasing their full-time faculty numbers proportionately.</p>
<p>In addition to implications for instruction, if faculty are required to expand their advising and dissertation supervision responsibilities, they will have less time to conduct research and to publish. Thus, faculty scholarly contributions to the field may diminish, which could negatively affect untenured faculty members’ progress toward attaining promotion and tenure. Furthermore, if units graduate ever-growing numbers of aspiring administrators without regard to selectivity and quality, additional fodder will be available to local school districts, state education agencies, and national constituent groups to increase their already heavy criticisms of leadership preparation program quality.</p>
<p>One important recommendation arising from this study is the need for state education departments, national professional associations, and national accreditation agencies to develop standards and criteria regarding what constitutes a critical mass of faculty members necessary to adequately staff a leadership preparation program by student enrollment. To illustrate the current problem, units in this study that enrolled 500+ students averaged more than nine full-time faculty members, which was the largest mean faculty size reported by any enrollment stratum or institution type and might appear to present solid evidence that the units operated with adequate faculty resource capacity. Yet, these units had significantly higher ratios of students to full-time faculty than any other enrollment stratum and consequently were greatly understaffed. As a result, they elected to fill this void by using an exceptionally high number of adjunct instructors to teach courses. Thus, merely analyzing the number of full-time faculty can provide a deceptively inaccurate picture of a unit’s actual faculty capacity.</p>
<p>When establishing full-time faculty standards, we recommend that policymakers consider the number and types of graduate degrees that are offered by the unit, the number of students, the use of university faculty who are external to the unit, student/faculty ratios, and the proportion of courses that are permissible to be taught by adjunct faculty members. Individual states are responsible for enacting standards related to the structure and staffing of leadership preparation units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1942775112464961">Darling-Hammond, Meyerson, LaPointe, &amp; Orr, 2010</xref>); consequently, they have the authority to require universities to maintain sufficient faculty resources to meet their instructional and student advising needs. A formula readily could be developed linking faculty to enrollments, so that additional full-time faculty would be required to be employed in proportion to student enrollment increases if programs are to retain state accreditation.</p>
<p>In this study, for the purposes of our analyses, we included individuals in tenure-line faculty and nontenure-line roles in the same classification of full-time faculty. Yet, the changing clinical/tenure-line ratio that we documented in our research has implications for program development and delivery as well as for knowledge production, and the implications of the growing proportion of clinical faculty need to be investigated.</p>
<p>As noted in the introduction, sufficient faculty resources are imperative for educational leadership units to offer high-quality programs. Given the decline in mean number of faculty members nationally, whether most educational leadership units have the necessary critical mass of faculty to ensure a rigorous preparation program is being seriously questioned. As part-time adjunct faculty and full-time clinical faculty are providing an increasing percentage of the instruction in leadership preparation programs, the backgrounds and contributions of these nontenure-line faculty need to be systematically investigated. Only with data on the integration of nontenure-line individuals in educational leadership units can an accurate determination be made as to whether there are adequate faculty resources to provide the type of leadership preparation that is essential for our nation’s schools.</p>
