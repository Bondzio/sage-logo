<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Children with ADHD are likely to experience emotional difficulties. The <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed., text revision; <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054710389990">American Psychiatric Association, 2000b</xref>) lists temper outbursts, mood lability, and dysphoria among the associated features of ADHD. In a National Health Information Survey, 23.0% of parents with a child diagnosed with ADHD reported that their child had a high level of emotional problems compared with 6.3% of parents of children who had no history of ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054710389990">Strine et al., 2006</xref>). The root causes of such difficulties in patients with ADHD are not well understood and numerous variables have been examined. Disturbed emotions and emotional expression may be an integral part of the disorder’s symptoms; some evidence suggests that emotional symptoms of ADHD may peak later in the day. In a laboratory classroom trial, the behavior of children with ADHD in the placebo group was worse in the late afternoon and early evening than in the morning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054710389990">Swanson et al., 1999</xref>). Other evidence points to the high frequency of comorbid mood and anxiety disorders as a source of emotional problems in patients with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054710389990">Bauermeister et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054710389990">Biederman et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Medication used to treat ADHD may also affect emotional expression, potentially changing the character and/or pattern of emotional expression. Stimulant therapy may cause blunting of emotional expression in some patients with ADHD, making them seem “dull or overly restricted” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054710389990">American Academy of Pediatrics Subcommittee on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Committee on Quality Improvement, 2001</xref>). Some parents have expressed concern about their children’s “zombie-like” demeanor while on stimulant therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054710389990">American Academy of Pediatrics Subcommittee on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Committee on Quality Improvement, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710389990">Kratochvil et al., 2007</xref>). In early studies comparing children with ADHD to a non-ADHD control group, stimulant treatment was associated with an increased dysphoria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054710389990">Whalen, Henker, &amp; Granger, 1989</xref>). In placebo-controlled pediatric trials of stimulants in which frequency of adverse events (AEs) related to emotional expression was described, results have been inconsistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054710389990">Ahmann et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054710389990">Gillberg et al., 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054710389990">Ahmann et al. (1993)</xref> found that frequencies of emotional AEs, such as euphoria, sadness, crying, and disinterest, were unchanged, whereas those of irritability and anxiety were decreased with methylphenidate therapy (vs. placebo). In a report from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054710389990">Gillberg et al. (1997)</xref>, dysthymia was the only emotion-related AE that showed an increase with active amphetamine sulfate treatment. By contrast, in a small sample of preschool patients (<italic>N</italic> = 28), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054710389990">Short, Manos, Findling, and Schubel (2004)</xref> found the tendency to cry, sadness/unhappiness, and rebound effects to be more frequent than when the same patients were given placebo; it is notable, however, that with the exception of rebound effects, frequency of such AEs during active treatment was similar to untreated baseline. These findings of more prominent emotion-related AEs in preschool children were corroborated in the Preschool ADHD Treatment Study (PATS) program that assessed the effects of immediate-release methylphenidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054710389990">Greenhill et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054710389990">Wigal et al., 2006</xref>). In a detailed analysis of the PATS safety and tolerability data, emotional outbursts was one of the top five AEs reported, and of 21 children who discontinued due to AEs, emotional AEs were listed among the reasons. Survival analysis in this study indicated that emotional lability was significantly related to early termination from the titration phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054710389990">Wigal et al., 2006</xref>). Other studies have also documented significant emotional rebound effects; in hospitalized children treated with stimulants, 30% showed that symptoms such as sadness, crying, and irritability were linked to the time when the last daily dose of short-acting stimulant medication wore off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054710389990">Carlson &amp; Kelly, 2003</xref>). Serious rebound was observed in 8.7% of such patients. Nevertheless, this observation might be confounded by the fact that the time of stimulant waning was late afternoon, which is the same time that emotional symptoms of ADHD tend to be at their peak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054710389990">Swanson et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Because of the complicated clinical picture of patients with ADHD, it is difficult to discern whether disturbances in emotional expression represent a direct consequence of stimulant therapy, a secondary result of the medication abruptly wearing off, the symptoms of comorbid disorders, or behavior patterns associated with ADHD itself. To better describe emotional expression and behavior in children with ADHD, the Expression and Emotion Scale for Children (EESC) was designed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054710389990">Perwien et al., 2008</xref>). This is an instrument that requires parents to evaluate both positive and negative aspects of their child’s emotional expression. In a study examining its psychometric properties based on surveys completed by parents of children with a diagnosis of ADHD, the EESC exhibited a high level of internal consistency and good test–retest reliability.</p>
<p>The EESC was recently used to evaluate the effect of treatment on emotional expression in a 7-week, open-label, dose-optimization clinical trial in children with ADHD treated with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054710389990">Findling, Ginsberg, Jain, &amp; Gao, 2009</xref>). LDX is the first long-acting prodrug stimulant indicated for the treatment of ADHD in children aged 6 to 12 years and in adults in the United States. LDX is a therapeutically inactive molecule and is converted to l-lysine and active d-amphetamine after oral ingestion. The d-amphetamine derived from LDX is responsible for the therapeutic effect. A small amount of LDX is hydrolyzed to d-amphetamine in the gastrointestinal tract; however, the conversion of LDX into active d-amphetamine occurs primarily in the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054710389990">Pennick, 2010</xref>). In line with findings from other controlled trials of LDX in pediatric patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054710389990">Biederman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054710389990">Biederman, Krishnan, Zhang, McGough, &amp; Findling, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054710389990">Findling, Childress, Krishnan, &amp; McGough, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054710389990">Wigal, Kollins, Childress, &amp; Squires, 2009</xref>), ADHD symptoms were significantly improved, on the basis of clinician and parent ratings, and the safety profile of LDX was consistent with that of long-acting stimulant use. Based on EESC scores, LDX treatment was associated with a small but statistically significant improvement from baseline in EESC total score and positive changes in all three subscale scores measuring positive emotions, emotional flatness, and lability (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0005). However, the clinical relevance of these findings was unclear. Given the limited availability of methodologically stringent data on emotional expression and the effects of stimulant drugs in ADHD, there was a desire to take advantage of the relatively large data set available to look more closely at these phenomena.</p>
<p>Although encouraging, these findings give little indication of the potential clinical significance or meaning of improvements in emotional expression in patients treated with LDX. Despite describing a lower likelihood that results were obtained by chance, tests of statistical significance address neither the size of the effects nor how meaningful (clinically significant) and reliable those effects may be. Techniques have been developed that describe change in clinical status while taking into account not only the amount of change from baseline but also measures of variability in repeated measurements. This allows one to judge whether the observed change is beyond that which would be typically expected and how such change relates to clinical ratings of improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710389990">Jacobson &amp; Truax, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710389990">Wyrwich, Tierney, &amp; Wolinsky, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710389990">Jacobson and Truax (1991)</xref> addressed the concept by using the standard error of the difference between baseline and endpoint scores as a means to identify patients as changed or unchanged based on clinical significance and further evaluated whether the observed change was reliable. They proposed that clinically significant change, by definition, moved a patient outside the distributional range for a dysfunctional population and closer to the mean for a functional population. To better operationalize the notion of clinically significant change, a model was constructed that evaluated the difference between endpoint and baseline scores as a function of the known variability of the measurement device (e. g., standard error of measurement [SEM]). The SEM is a sample independent measure that encompasses distributional and reliability components taking into consideration possible random measurement error of observed changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710389990">Wyrwich et al., 1999</xref>). A threshold for reliable clinical improvement (reliable change index [RCI]) value of 1.96 was developed (if [endpoint − baseline] / SEM equaled or exceeded 1.96, the observed change was reliably and clinically significant; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710389990">Jacobson &amp; Truax, 1991</xref>). Thus, change scores were evaluated for both clinical significance (movement away from mean of dysfunctional population) and whether the observed change was reliable or not due to measurement error.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this model does not take into account other smaller but potentially clinically meaningful changes observed by clinicians and patients. A degree of change that would not move a patient from an abnormal condition to a fully normal condition might be considered meaningful, or the normal and abnormal ranges may overlap such that the RCI and clinically significant change, as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710389990">Jacobson and Truax (1991)</xref>, might be too strict a definition of meaningful change. To address this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710389990">Wyrwich et al. (1999)</xref> expanded on the use of SEM, comparing this estimate of assessment precision to well-established minimally clinically important differences (MCIDs) in individual patients. They showed that a shift in mean baseline scores in the magnitude of 1 SEM in nearly all cases met an established MCID standard and represented a change in clinical status that was recognizable by clinician or patient—a clinically meaningful change.</p>
<p>The current post hoc analyses of data from the 7-week, open-label, LDX study aimed to describe the reliability and clinical relevance of change in emotional expression, based on the EESC, in children with ADHD taking LDX.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1087054710389990">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>This was an open-label, multicenter, dose-optimization study to assess the efficacy and safety of LDX in children aged 6 to 12 years with ADHD that has been fully described elsewhere. The study had three phases: a screening and a 7-day washout period (including previous stimulant treatment or other sympathomimetics, pemoline, modafinil, or sedating antihistamines, as necessary), a 7-week, open-label treatment phase, and a 30-day follow-up period. For the 7-week, open-label treatment phase, participants began treatment with 20 mg/d LDX. At each subsequent weekly visit, the dose was increased for participants who had not had an acceptable therapeutic response (e.g., ≥30% reduction in baseline ADHD Rating Scale IV [ADHD-RS-IV] total score and a Clinical Global Impressions–Improvement score of 1 or 2) with tolerable side effects. Participants with an adequate response were maintained at their current dose for the remainder of the study. Participants experiencing intolerable side effects were down-titrated to the next available dose. Only one downward adjustment was permitted; if AEs remained intolerable or the reduced dose produced inadequate symptom reduction, the participant was discontinued from the study. No dosage adjustments were made after Week 5. A follow-up telephone call occurred 30 days following the participant’s last dose of study medication to obtain additional safety/tolerability data.</p>
<p>The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each study center, and the study was performed in accordance with the principles of the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice, 18th World Medical Assembly (Helsinki, 1964), and amendments of the 29th (Tokyo, 1975), the 35th (Venice, 1983), the 41st (Hong Kong, 1989), and the 48th (South Africa, 1996) World Medical Assemblies. All participants’ parents or legally authorized representatives read and signed an informed consent form.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1087054710389990">
<title>Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</title>
<p>Participants were children aged 6 to 12 years with a primary diagnosis of ADHD by <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> criteria and a baseline ADHD-RS-IV total score of ≥28. Participants exhibited age-appropriate intellectual functioning and had blood pressure measurements within the 95th percentile for age, gender, and height at screening and/or baseline. Female participants of childbearing potential were required to have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test result at baseline.</p>
<p>Exclusion criteria included comorbid conduct disorder; comorbid Axis I or II psychiatric diagnosis; a history of seizures or tic disorders; abnormal thyroid function; any clinically significant electrocardiographic or laboratory abnormalities; a known history of structural cardiac abnormality or any other condition(s) that affect cardiac performance; a concurrent chronic or acute illness or unstable medical condition; a documented allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to amphetamines; or failure to respond to one or more adequate courses of amphetamine therapy. Also excluded were those with a recent history of suspected substance abuse (≤6 months) and those with a positive urine drug result at screening (except for current ADHD medication). Individuals taking other medications that have central nervous system effects or affect performance, including antipsychotics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, antihypertensives, or norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, within 30 days of screening were excluded. Participants whose ADHD symptoms were well controlled on their current ADHD medication with acceptable tolerability were also excluded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1087054710389990">
<title>Efficacy Measures</title>
<p>The primary efficacy measure of this clinical trial was the clinician-administered ADHD-RS-IV total score at the endpoint and results have been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054710389990">Findling et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1087054710389990">
<title>EESC</title>
<p>At baseline and final study visit (i.e., Week 7 or early termination), the EESC was completed. For the EESC, 29 items, assessing both positive (e.g., confidence and friendliness) and negative (e.g., mood swings and flat mood) aspects of emotional expression over the preceding 2 weeks, are scored from 1 (<italic>not at all true</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very much true</italic>), with an EESC total score range of 29 to 145 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054710389990">Perwien et al., 2008</xref>). All 29 items are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1087054710389990">Figure 3</xref> of the Results section. The EESC has three subscales: Positive Emotions (range = 13-65), Emotional Flatness (range = 10-50), and Emotional Lability (range = 5-25). Responses to the positive emotions subscale are reversed during scoring so that, on all scales, higher scores indicate poorer emotional expression. The EESC has been recently revised; the instrument used in this current study is the original version. The revised version did not include three items that were present in the original version based on psychometric testing. In addition, there were some minor differences between these versions in their correlation with ADHD symptoms scales such as the Conners’ ADHD Index. However, although the original has been validated and its psychometric properties confirmed, the revised scale currently has neither been validated nor its psychometric properties confirmed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1087054710389990">
<title>Safety/Tolerability Assessments</title>
<p>Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital signs, and body weight and height.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1087054710389990">
<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>Efficacy analyses were based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, comprising all participants who took at least one dose of LDX and who had at least one postbaseline ADHD-RS-IV assessment. A one-sample <italic>t</italic> test was used to analyze the change in ADHD-RS-IV total score and in post hoc analyses on EESC total and subscale score change from baseline to endpoint for all LDX dose levels combined. Post hoc analyses on these outcome measures were also performed on participants grouped by gender; presence or absence of history of other psychiatric symptoms including psychiatric diagnosis or condition (including oppositional defiant disorder, depression, insomnia, initial insomnia, and emotional lability) significant enough to be reported on the medical history intake form but not enough to be exclusionary; presence or absence of common TEAEs (i.e., reported by ≥5% of participants); and early discontinuation from the trial. No multiplicity adjustment was performed on the subgroups statistical comparisons. In an additional post hoc analysis, EESC scores at baseline were dichotomized as those “worse at baseline” (&gt; <italic>M</italic> + 1.5 × <italic>SD</italic>) versus all “others” for analysis of treatment effects on endpoint EESC total and subscale scores. Statistical comparisons were by McNemar’s test of symmetry.</p>
<p>Post hoc analyses also evaluated clinical significance of changes in EESC scores using a two-pronged method proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710389990">Jacobson and Truax (1991)</xref>. The EESC, as used in children with ADHD, does not have a normative standard for an abnormal value. Therefore, Part 1 of the approach assessed whether the treatment resulted in scores moving between a normative (functional) distribution and a dysfunctional distribution by categorizing change from baseline at endpoint based on whether they were &lt;2 <italic>standard deviation</italic> or &gt;2 <italic>standard deviation</italic> from the mean at baseline. A decrease to an EESC value &gt;2 <italic>standard deviation</italic> below baseline mean indicated a score within a functionally normal range, whereas an increase to an EESC value &gt;2 <italic>standard deviation</italic> above baseline indicated a score within the abnormal range, irrespective of specific cutoff values for a good or a bad EESC score. Part 2 of the approach used the RCI (i.e., [end score − baseline score] / SEM of the baseline score) threshold &gt;1.96 to determine whether such a score was achieved by a change that was reliable (significant at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 level). The SEM is calculated by multiplying the baseline standard deviation by a factor derived from a reliability index (e.g., based on test–retest reliability) for the measure (i.e., <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-1087054710389990">

<p>Additional post hoc analyses used a method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710389990">Wyrwich et al. (1999)</xref> for calculating a change from baseline SEM that approximated other accepted measures of clinically important change. Changes were categorized based on whether they were &lt;1 SEM or &gt;1 SEM, a threshold value defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710389990">Wyrwich et al. (1999)</xref> as indicating clinically important change. This method was employed in a previous study using the EESC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710389990">Kratochvil et al., 2007</xref>). Because the EESC lacks a definitive normal or abnormal value, this provides an alternative measure of a change that might be considered meaningful by the clinician or participant. Wyrwich et al. compared their results with other measures of MCID, defining meaningful change as that which a clinician or patient might be expected to recognize.</p>

<p>Of the 318 participants enrolled, 316 were included in the ITT population and 278 (87.4%) completed the study. Details of participant demographics and disposition have been described previously. Briefly, mean (<italic>SD</italic>) age of participants was 9.1 (1.9) years, and most were male (70.7%), White (70.7%), and non-Hispanic (82.6%); the majority were diagnosed with ADHD-combined subtype (81.7%).</p>

<title>EESC</title>
<p>A total of 304 participants had both a baseline and an endpoint EESC assessment and were included in post hoc analyses of clinically significant change. The mean (<italic>SD</italic>) baseline EESC total, positive emotions, emotional flatness, and emotional lability scores were 63.1 (17.8), 30.1 (10.1), 18.0 (7.3), and 14.9 (5.1), respectively. At endpoint, mean (<italic>SD</italic>) EESC total, positive emotions, emotional flatness, and emotional lability scores were 55.7 (17.4), 28.1 (9.9), 15.6 (6.0), and 12.1 (4.8), respectively. At endpoint, a statistically significant mean (<italic>SD</italic>) change from baseline was observed in EESC total score of −7.4 (18.3), indicating improvement (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). Statistically significant changes (<italic>SD</italic>) from baseline for each EESC subscale were also observed: −2.1 (9.6) for positive emotions (<italic>p</italic> = .0002), −2.5 (7.7) for emotional flatness (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), and −2.8 (5.2) for emotional lability (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). Similar mean changes were observed when analyzed by gender, history of other psychiatric symptoms, and the presence or absence of common TEAEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087054710389990">Figure 1</xref>). Change scores did not reach statistical significance for participants with a history of other psychiatric symptoms possibly because of the small sample size.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current post hoc analysis examined whether observed changes in emotional expression on the EESC in children with ADHD during open-label treatment with LDX were clinically significant and reliable or clinically meaningful. LDX was effective at reducing ADHD symptoms and resulted in small, yet statistically significant improvements in measures of emotional expression, the clinical meaning of which was unclear. Decreases in EESC scores were consistent regardless of gender, psychiatric symptoms, and reports of common TEAEs. Using two different methods of determining clinically noticeable change—meaningful clinical change and reliable clinically significant change—different estimates for the frequency of clinically notable improvement in emotional expression were obtained. None could achieve this level of improvement using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710389990">Jacobson and Truax (1991)</xref> RCI &gt;1.96 criterion and movement away from baseline mean because the required improvement would be below the minimum score on the EESC. Approximately 30% were identified as improving using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710389990">Wyrwich et al. (1999)</xref> 1-SEM criterion. Clinically significant and reliable deterioration of emotional expression was identified in &lt;2% using the Jacobson and Truax methodology, and clinical worsening in 8.6% to 13.9% with the Wyrwich method. Worsening of emotional expression appeared to be associated with an increased frequency of affect lability and irritability.</p>
<p>Stimulants have been variously reported to both improve and cause worsening of symptoms of emotional lability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054710389990">Ahmann et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054710389990">Gillberg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054710389990">Short et al., 2004</xref>). Few studies, however, have documented these phenomena, and little research has explored them in detail using a validated instrument designed to assess the full range of emotional expression. If such emotional changes do occur, they might be an important consideration when selecting or switching medications, evaluating efficacy and tolerability, and titrating dose. The current investigation showed small but statistically significant mean improvements in emotional expression among children with ADHD given optimized doses of LDX. These results are encouraging in that they suggest worsening of emotional expression did not occur with LDX treatment for many participants and, for some, improvement from baseline was achieved. However, such analyses do not specifically describe whether clinically significant improvements or decrements in emotional expression occurred for individual participants.</p>
<p>In the post hoc analyses based on the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710389990">Jacobson and Truax (1991)</xref> method presented here, most participants (≥99%) showed no clinically significant and reliable change in emotional expression during open-label LDX treatment, whereas none met (or could have met) criteria for clinically significant improvement and ≤1% showed clinically significant and reliable worsening of emotional expression. A number of factors may have contributed to the lack of clinically significant and reliable improvement as measured by the Jacobson and Truax method. The exclusion of participants with comorbid disorders may have resulted in systematic exclusion of participants with high emotional lability. This seems to be borne out by the modest baseline mean scores on the EESC. Mean EESC total scores were approximately 65 on a scale with a minimum score of 29 and a maximum score of 145. Similar to the current study, an earlier clinical trial enrolling children with ADHD demonstrated baseline EESC total scores of approximately 64 to 68 for children randomized to placebo or active treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710389990">Kratochvil et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, there may not have been sufficient room for further improvement (floor effect) in the current study, and population characteristics at baseline limit assessment of degree of improvement. As mentioned above, given the relatively low baseline scores, the criterion set for the current study of movement of &gt;1.96 standard deviations away from the baseline mean would have required a score below 29 to qualify as a statistically significant and reliable improvement. A population sample with higher EESC mean scores at baseline may have been able to demonstrate reliable change. Of note, retrospective parental assessments using the EESC suggest that children requiring treatment changes may have higher EESC total scores, ranging up to approximately 85. Alternatively, a less stringent criterion of perhaps &gt;1.5 standard deviations away from the baseline mean may have resulted in categorization of some proportion of participants with clinically significant and reliable improvement. In addition, the Jacobson and Truax method assumes that the baseline mean of the study population is indicative of a mean score for participants with a clinically relevant abnormality, an assumption that may not be true for this study population as a group.</p>
<p>A slightly different pattern of results was obtained when the less stringent 1-SEM criterion described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710389990">Wyrwich et al. (1999)</xref> was applied. With this approach, approximately one third of participants were categorized as having clinically meaningful improvements in emotional expression during LDX treatment, and 9.2% of participants were categorized as having clinical worsening of emotional expression. Analysis of patient subgroups showed relatively greater improvement in EESC total and subscale scores among those with the worst baseline emotional scores than among the participants with less-severe baseline emotional symptoms. It is not unexpected that frequencies are different using these different methods. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710389990">Jacobson and Truax (1991)</xref> method is more conservative than the Wyrwich et al. method and sets a higher clinical and statistical threshold. These methods can be viewed as complementary, addressing questions of meaningful clinical improvement and clinically significant change from differing perspectives and, thus, providing answers that each method alone would not be able to address. Overall, our findings indicate that emotional symptom worsening during treatment with LDX occurred for a small subgroup of participants, but for the large majority of participants, emotional symptoms were unchanged from baseline after receiving LDX treatment.</p>
<p>The relationship of worsening in emotional expression scores with LDX treatment to the incidence of neuropsychiatric AEs was examined. When participants were categorized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710389990">Wyrwich et al.’s (1999)</xref> 1-SEM criterion into subgroups of those with no change, those with improvement, and those with worsening, relative to baseline EESC total score, most of the neuropsychiatric AEs examined, such as irritability, headache, and initial insomnia, occurred at similar frequencies among these subgroups. Emotional lability and aggression, however, tended to occur more frequently among participants with clinical worsening of emotional expression than among participants with no change or improvement in emotional expression. These findings are consistent with those described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054710389990">Ahmann et al. (1993)</xref> who found little change in the frequency of most emotional AEs among children with ADHD given stimulant therapy. The most common AEs with LDX were consistent with those of other long-acting stimulants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054710389990">Biederman, Lopez, Boellner, &amp; Chandler, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054710389990">Findling et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054710389990">Silva et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054710389990">Spencer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087054710389990">Wilens et al., 2006</xref>) and included decreased appetite, decreased weight, and insomnia. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that for a small subgroup of patients, certain AEs like aggression and emotional lability may be important signals of clinically significant emotional worsening that may warrant the need for treatment regimen adjustments and closer follow-up. As is outlined in current diagnostic criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054710389990">American Psychiatric Association, 2000a</xref>), the emergence of symptoms such as temper problems, irritability, and annoyance may also be related to the development of oppositional defiant disorder. These factors make it difficult to determine causality between medication and changes in affect or behavior. Nonetheless, current ADHD guidelines note that participants with emotional AEs like blunted affect or “overfocus” during stimulant treatment may benefit from a downward dose adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054710389990">American Academy of Pediatrics Subcommittee on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Committee on Quality Improvement, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In the only other published clinical trial of medication effects using the EESC, the effects of atomoxetine were compared with those of stimulants in children with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710389990">Kratochvil et al., 2007</xref>). No differences in emotional expression were observed in participants treated with stimulants versus atomoxetine, and none were observed between short- and long-acting stimulants. This along with the finding that substantial improvements in emotional expression were detected in children experiencing such AEs who switched medications (i.e., from stimulants to atomoxetine or from atomoxetine to stimulants) suggests that emotional symptoms or AEs may occur in a subgroup of patients with either stimulant or nonstimulant medications and that switching to a different medication class may help alleviate those symptoms for that particular patient. In a further analysis of clinically meaningful changes in emotional expression, based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710389990">Wyrwich et al.’s (1999)</xref> 1-SEM criterion compared with those in the current study, similar proportions of patients exhibited a worsening or improvement of emotional expression during treatment with atomoxetine. Unfortunately, the report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710389990">Kratochvil et al. (2007)</xref> does not describe such categorical changes seen in patients given stimulant therapy. Nevertheless, the current report and that from Kratochvil et al. indicate that treatment of ADHD with LDX and atomoxetine is not associated with worsening of emotional expression for the large majority of patients.</p>
<p>Another recent report further suggests that clinically significant ADHD symptom improvements may translate into meaningful functional changes that are salient to both parents and clinicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054710389990">Karpenko, Owens, Evangelista, &amp; Dodds, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054710389990">Karpenko and colleagues (2009)</xref> examined the relationship between clinical significance and functional improvement, using data for each treatment group in the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054710389990">MTA Cooperative Group, 1999</xref>). In that analysis, the only criterion of clinical significance was the RCI (the second step of the Jacobson and Truax method; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710389990">Jacobson &amp; Truax, 1991</xref>). These scores were compared with scores on scales measuring changes in functional improvement such as homework completion, social skills, quality of parent–child interactions, impairment at home, and global impairment. Clinically significant improvement in ADHD symptoms based on RCI &gt;1.96 was reliably associated with ratings indicating functional improvement. It should be noted that this study relied only on the second part of the Jacobson and Truax method, rather than on the prescribed two-part measure, which may limit interpretability of the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054710389990">Karpenko et al., 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, their findings indicate that clinical significance is a measure of treatment outcome that may accurately reflect changes that are meaningful to clinicians, parents, and patients.</p>
<p>An important limitation of the present analyses may be that participants were not recruited specifically based on their problems with regulation of emotion; hence, change may not be as easily interpreted within this context. Another limitation of the current investigation is the open-label study design without placebo comparator, making it impossible to describe the frequency with which de novo emotional expression worsening occurs and to compare it with that observed with active treatment. Interestingly, the rate of clinical worsening detected in the current study based on the 1-SEM criterion (9.2%) is similar to that described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710389990">Kratochvil et al. (2007)</xref> in placebo-treated patients (12.3%) as well as their participants given active treatment with atomoxetine (8.8%). Although cross-study comparisons may not be reliable, such findings clearly demonstrate that not all cases of clinically significant worsening may be attributable to ADHD medication treatment. Another limitation is that this was a post hoc analysis and not a study prospectively designed to assess categorical changes on the EESC. Assessment of change in participants who did not have severe emotional lability at baseline may not yield an accurate reflection of the effects of treatment in children who have more substantial emotional dysfunction. A further limitation was the exclusion of children with significant comorbid psychiatric conditions. This may limit the generalizability of the findings to typically encountered clinical populations. Furthermore, the current study was not sufficiently powered to detect differences in EESC scores among participant subpopulations. Of note, due to the relatively close proximity in time of screening, medication washout, and baseline EESC assessment and the reliance of raters assessing behaviors and affect over the preceding 2 weeks, it is not possible to eliminate the potential for contributions of residual effects of previous treatment for baseline EESC assessments. Finally, the EESC is a relatively new instrument and has not yet been widely used; its utility for clinical research needs further study.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Although there have been reports of treatment-associated worsening of emotional expression in children with ADHD, in this study of open-label LDX treatment, few participants experienced clinical worsening of emotional symptoms as determined by the use of several evaluation methods. The findings of both statistical analyses presented suggest that LDX treatment of children with ADHD is not associated overall with clinical worsening of emotional expression in most children. A sizable proportion of children showed significant improvement in emotional expression and the ability to control negative emotions whereas few manifested worsening.</p>
