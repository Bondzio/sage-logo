<abstract>
<p>The recent Supreme Court decision regarding the constitutionality of Arizona’s Senate Bill 1070 was declared a “victory” by both proponents and dissenters. While the Supreme Court declared three of the laws four provisions unconstitutional, both President Barack Obama and Arizona Governor Jan Brewer framed the outcome in a positive light. Despite three of the four provisions dismantled, the sole surviving provision allows law enforcement to question the immigration status of anyone who violates a non-immigration offense. Although the Supreme Court placed this provision within the parameters of a “wait and see” scenario, whereby, if there are problems/violations in the laws application/implementation, the Court will revisit this provision, I argue that such a provision, despite its “wait and see” clause, invites racial profiling. To illustrate this point, this article will perform a rhetorical analysis of the Court’s majority opinion, before concluding with final thoughts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In a state not averse to political controversy, whether it be the banning of Ethnic Studies courses,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1358229112462858">1</xref>
</sup> banning the teaching and/or usage of certain categorized books in Arizona public schools,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1358229112462858">2</xref>
</sup> or the recent decision upheld by short order by the Arizona Supreme Court that removed Alejandrina Cabrera from the ballot in reaction to a 1910 “English-proficiency” law,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1358229112462858">3</xref>
</sup> these instances have placed Arizona in the crosshairs of much controversy. Now, with the addition of the state’s attempt at immigration reform, resulting in Senate Bill (S.B.) 1070 and House Bill (H.B.) 2162, the controversy continues. Dubbed the nation’s “toughest” immigration law, its unveiling brought immediate attention to the state, causing dissenters to particularly question what some believed was an open invitation for racial profiling. Amidst this storm of political debate, much action ensued, ranging from lawsuits to boycotts against the state from organizations such as the National Alliance of Black Educators, the Los Angeles Gay &amp; Lesbian Center, and the World Boxing Council, amongst many others.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1358229112462858">4</xref>
</sup> In each instance, dissenters articulated that their refusal to conduct business with the state of Arizona was in response to the state’s thinly veiled political endorsement of racial profiling, known simply as S.B. 1070.</p>
<p>As shifting demographics in the state continue to increase its Latino population, much political vulnerability rest at the state’s doorstep.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1358229112462858">5</xref>
</sup> For instance, Rodolfo Espino and David Leal posit, “some worry about the economic cost of Latino immigration, such as job competition, and the educational and medical costs to local governments. Others seem to conflate all Latinos with immigrants in a way that suggests cultural concerns are the real issue.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1358229112462858">6</xref>
</sup> Because “Latinos represent the electorate’s fastest-growing segment[,] both Republican and Democrats depict them as a crucial component of state and national electoral strategies,” so argues Cristina Beltrán, whereas what once was considered a “safe seat” or “safe district,” in many regards, is no longer so.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1358229112462858">7</xref>
</sup> While one can entertain the various possible outcomes a growing Latino population may or may not bring, the rash of state-enforced immigration laws continue to illustrate the hostile political climate now sweeping the nation. Given the initial public perception of S.B. 1070, along with the interest this law drew from the Obama administration, the U.S. Department of Justice filed an injunction against what the administration perceived as a series of unconstitutional provisions. Over the course of this legal injunction, the U.S. Supreme Court declared all but one provision unconstitutional, leading both the President and Arizona Governor to simultaneously declare “victory.” With the Supreme Court’s decision to place §2(B), the provision that allows officers to question the immigration status of those stopped or detained for non-immigration offenses, within the parameters of a “wait and see” scenario, allowing the Court to revisit this provision, much is left to be desired. In what follows, this article argues that, as a result of this decision, the Court has inadvertently endorsed and delivered an open invitation for racial profiling, chiefly aimed at Latinos. To illustrate this point, this article will perform a rhetorical analysis of the Court’s majority opinion, before concluding with final thoughts.</p>

<italic>Arizona</italic> v. <italic>United States</italic>
</title>
<p>S.B. 1070, the “Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act,” was passed by the Arizona Legislature, and signed into law by Governor Jan Brewer on Friday, April 23, 2010. S.B. 1070 includes provisions adding state penalties relating to immigration enforcement, including trespassing, harboring and transporting illegal immigrants, alien registration documents, employer sanctions, and human smuggling.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1358229112462858">8</xref>
</sup> The trespassing provision, for instance, was the first of its kind to be enacted in the United States, illustrating the severity and wide reach of the law. To combat allegations that S.B. 1070 promotes racial profiling, Governor Brewer issued Executive Order 2010-09, requiring the Arizona Peace Officers Standards and Training Board to establish proper training to ensure law enforcement officials and agencies apply S.B. 1070 within the limits of federal laws pertaining to immigration, while protecting the civil rights of all people along with respecting the privileges and immunities of U.S. citizens. This executive order also required clear guidance on what constitutes “reasonable suspicion,” along with a list of the specific forms of identification that provide a presumption that a person is not an alien unlawfully present in the United States.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1358229112462858">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>While talk of racial profiling still consumed much of the debate and protest surrounding S.B. 1070, during the last day of the 2010 legislative session, the Arizona Legislature approved, and Governor Brewer signed H.B. 2162. H.B. 2162 amended S.B. 1070 to specify that  law enforcement officials cannot consider race, color, or national origin when implementing the provisions of the original law, except as permitted by the U.S. or Arizona Constitution.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1358229112462858">10</xref>
</sup> H.B. 2162 sought to clarify the original law’s language around “reasonable suspicion” by requiring state and local law enforcement to “reasonably attempt” to determine the immigration status of a person only while in the process of a lawful stop, detention, or arrest (the original language referred to “lawful contact”). H.B. 2162 also stipulated that a lawful stop, detention, or arrest must be in the enforcement of any other law or ordinance of a county, city, or town of this state.</p>
<p>Combined, both S.B. 1070 and H.B. 2162 set the stage for a new style of immigration enforcement. Despite the state’s efforts to silence the mounting allegations of racial politics from its critics, the passage of H.B. 2162 did very little to accomplish this task, leaving many critics to argue that the foundation of S.B. 1070 stems from racial profiling. To their defense, dissenters highlighted several controversial provisions within S.B. 1070 that they found troublesome, including “enforcement of immigration law,” “willful failure to complete and carry an alien registration document,” “unlawfully picking up passengers for work,” “unlawful transporting or harboring unlawful aliens,” and “employer sanctions,” along with a “miscellaneous” section. For instance, with respect to the “enforcement” clause, Arizona law:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Prohibits state and local law enforcement from restricting enforcement of federal immigration laws.</p>
<p>Requires state and local law enforcement to reasonably attempt to determine the immigration status of a person involved in a lawful stop, detention or arrest in the enforcement of any other local or state law or ordinance where reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien and is unlawfully present, except if it may hinder or obstruct an investigation.</p>
<p>Requires the immigration status to be verified with the federal government for anyone who is arrested.</p>
<p>Stipulates that law enforcement cannot consider race, color or national origin when implementing these provisions, except as permitted by the U.S. or Arizona Constitution.</p>
<p>Specifies a presumption of lawful presence with these IDs: Arizona driver license or ID; tribal enrollment card or ID; valid federal, state or local government issued identification, if the issuing entity requires proof of legal presence before issuance.</p>
<p>Stipulates that these provisions do not implement or authorize REAL ID.</p>
<p>Allows legal residents to sue state or localities that restrict enforcement of federal law. Indemnifies officers unless they acted in bad faith. Violating entities must pay a civil penalty of at least $500 for each day the policy is in effect.<sup>

<p>As seen here, the fairly expansive and questionable legality of Arizona’s attempt at immigration reform left no stone unturned, shadowing, at least to some degree, the political, racial, and ethnic sentiments surrounding early 20th-century U.S. federal immigration policy. It was during this period of U.S. history that national origin quotas were introduced to federal immigration policy in the 1920s. For instance, it was the Immigration Act of 1924 that limited the annual number of immigrants who could be admitted from any country to 2% of the number of people from that country who were already living in the United States in 1890. In doing so, the 1924 Act established preferences for certain relatives of U.S. residents, including their unmarried children under 21, their parents, and spouses aged 21 and over. The law also articulated a preference for immigrants aged 21 and over who were skilled in agriculture, as well as their wives and dependent children under age 16. Non-quota status was accorded to wives and unmarried children under 18 of U.S. citizens; natives of Western Hemisphere countries, with their families; non-immigrants; and certain others. Akin to Arizona’s S.B. 1070, unflattering sentiment toward those perceived as “foreigners” continues to reenact the nativist sentiment surrounding earlier attempts at American immigration reform.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1358229112462858">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>As part of Arizona’s attempt at immigration reform, considerable authority and discretion in the interpretation of these laws are left to local law enforcement. In a state where the Justice Department, through its investigation over allegations of discrimination toward Latino inmates, recently brought suit against Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, considerable doubt exist over the state’s ability to “serve and protect” all, as opposed to some. For instance, according to Arizona law:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>a peace officer, without a warrant, [can] arrest a person if the officer has probable cause to believe:</p>
<p>A felony has been committed and probable cause to believe the person to be arrested has committed the felony.</p>
<p>A misdemeanor has been committed in the officer’s presence and probable cause to believe the person to be arrested has committed the offense.</p>
<p>The person to be arrested has been involved in a traffic accident and violated any criminal section of title 28, and that such violation occurred prior to or immediately following such traffic accident.</p>
<p>A misdemeanor or a petty offense has been committed and probable cause to believe the person to be arrested has committed the offense. A person arrested under this paragraph is eligible for release under section 13–3903.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1358229112462858">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Given the fairly peculiar elasticity of this law and its clearly targeted population, the degree of reasonable doubt raised over local law enforcement’s questionable authority and enforcement tactics comes as no surprise. Siding with the observation made by Rodney Hero, who believes “that the ethnic/racial compositions and configurations of the states have a major impact on state politics and policies,” the state’s growing Latino population, whether deemed “legal” or not, comes under immediate suspicion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1358229112462858">14</xref>
</sup> In context, write Richard Alba and Victor Nee, “of the contemporary immigration groups, the Mexicans have the longest record of significant continuous inflow,” whereby to “preserve” and “defend” the state and the country against the perceived lethality of “foreign” interests and influences the law’s proponents recognize racial profiling as a viable option.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1358229112462858">15</xref>
</sup> As racial balances continue to tilt toward placing Whites as the statistical minority in some parts of the country, Amardo Rodriguez contends that “eventually, the homogenous many develop discursive and material practices to justify the need to engender homogeneity against the threat of diversity.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1358229112462858">16</xref>
</sup> In Arizona’s attempt to control and contain such diverse populations, extreme hierarchical measures have become warranted to supposedly “maintain order.”</p>
<p>At the heart of the legal challenge imposed by the Obama Administration are four key provisions. To illustrate the Obama administration’s perceived severity/over-step of Arizona’s constitutional allowance, their lawsuit targeted Sections 3, 5(c), 6 and 2(b). Section 3 makes failure to comply with federal alien-registration requirements a state misdemeanor; Section 5(C) makes it a misdemeanor for an unauthorized alien to seek or engage in work in the state; §6 authorizes state and local officers to arrest without a warrant a person “the officer has probable cause to believe ... has committed any public offense that makes the person removable from the United States”; and Section 2(B) requires officers conducting a stop, detention, or arrest to make efforts, in some circumstances, to verify the person’s immigration status with the federal government. For the first three sections listed, Justice Anthony Kennedy, in writing on behalf of the Court’s majority, provided clear reasoning for the removal of these provisions. With respect to Section 6, Justice Kennedy writes:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Section 6 attempts to provide state officers with even greater arrest authority, which they could exercise with no instruction from the Federal Government. This is not the system Congress created. Federal law specifies limited circumstances in which state officers may perform an immigration officer’s functions. This includes instances where the Attorney General has granted that authority in a formal agreement with a state or local government. See, <italic>e.g., </italic>§1357(g)(1). Although federal law permits state officers to “cooperate with the Attorney General in the identification, apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not lawfully present in the United States,” §1357(g)(10)(B), this does not encompass the unilateral decision to detain authorized by §6.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1358229112462858">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In condemning the state’s effort toward an expansion of arrest authority, Justice Kennedy minces no words in striking down this provision. The conflict that arises here stems from tension between local and federal authority, whereby, argues Kennedy:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>by authorizing state and local officers to make warrantless arrests of certain aliens suspected of being removable, §6 too creates an obstacle to federal law ... The federal scheme instructs when it is appropriate to arrest an alien during the removal process. The Attorney General in some circumstances will issue a warrant for trained federal immigration officers to execute. If no federal warrant has been issued, these officers have more limited authority.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1358229112462858">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As Kennedy continued his series of arguments against Sections 3 and 5(c), his rationale continued to focus on how Section 3 stands “as an obstacle to the federal regulatory system,” and Section 5 “intrudes on the field of alien registration, a field in which Congress has left no room for States to regulate.” As initially suspected by some, and later confirmed by the Supreme Court, much of the Arizona law overstepped its legal bounds, attempting to perform tasks only permissible by the federal government.</p>
<p>When shifting the Court’s attention to perhaps its most controversial provision, Section 2(B), Justice Kennedy’s rationale takes a rather peculiar turn. , Section 2(B) drew more criticism than all other provisions. It was immediately criticized by dissenters who likened the expanded and unharnessed authority of local law enforcement to a license to racially profile. To make clear, Section 2(B) allows:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>For any lawful contact made by a law enforcement official or a law enforcement agency of this state or a law enforcement official or a law enforcement agency of a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state where reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States, a reasonable attempt shall be made, when practicable, to determine the immigration status of the person, expect if the determination may hinder or obstruct an investigation. Any person who is arrested shall have the person’s immigration status determined before the person is released. The person’s immigration status shall be verified with the federal government pursuant to 8 United States Code Section 1373(c). A law enforcement official or agency ... may not solely consider race, color, or national origin in implementing the requirements of this subsection except to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona Constitution.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1358229112462858">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Of the many problems inherent within both the language and implementation of this law, the first begins with the authority of “reasonable suspicion” that Section 2(B) grants to local law enforcement who believe that a “person is an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States.” Akin to earlier protests and demonstrations of this provision that produced the popular t-shirt reading, “Do I look illegal?,” much of the same sentiment continues to linger. As mentioned above, many questions continue to exist over how or in what ways officers would establish reasonable suspicion that a person may not be in the country legally. While state law affirms that local law enforcement officers “may not solely consider race, color, or national origin” in its implementation, this addendum adds nothing more than a mirage. Through the lens of constructing and implementing a socio-political hierarchy, Amardo Rodriguez contends that, “supposedly, such an ordering is vital to the ordering of human beings so as to stop the onset of social devolution and chaos.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1358229112462858">20</xref>
</sup> Through its wording alone, it arouses enough suspicion to warrant asking more questions regarding the specificities of its implementation and execution, if nothing else.</p>
<p>In deliberating the concerns expressed over Section 2(B), Justice Kennedy acknowledges only part of the unrest surrounding this provision, turning a blind eye to the outcry over the suspicion of racial profiling. According to Justice Kennedy, “some who support the challenge to §2(B) argue that, in practice, state officers will be required to delay the release of some detainees for no reason other than to verify their immigration status.” He further explains, “it would disrupt the federal framework to put state officers in the position of holding aliens in custody for possible unlawful presence without federal direction and supervision.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1358229112462858">21</xref>
</sup> While one may be lead to believe that Justice Kennedy was about to invalidate Section 2(B), he instead argues:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>But §2(B) could be read to avoid these concerns. To take one example, a person might be stopped for jaywalking in Tucson and be unable to produce identification. The first sentence of §2(B) instructs officers to make a “reasonable” attempt to verify his immigration status with ICE if there is reasonable suspicion that his presence in the United States is unlawful. The state courts may conclude that, unless the person continues to be suspected of some crime for which he may be detained by state officers, it would not be reasonable to prolong the stop for the immigration inquiry.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1358229112462858">22</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Again, while Kennedy begins his initial affirmation of Section 2(B), his failure to grapple with exactly <italic>how</italic> officers would validate reasonable suspicion that a person’s presence in the United States is unlawful falls short of recognition. Let’s say a person were stopped for jaywalking in Tucson, or any other city or town within the state, and was unable to produce identification; at what point does an officer satisfy the “reasonable suspicion” burden of proof, allowing the officer to make a “reasonable attempt to verify his immigration status with ICE”? While it is true that the amended law states that officers and agencies cannot “solely consider race, color, or national origin,” race and national origin <italic>can be</italic> one of many variables consulted when establishing “reasonable suspicion.” With such elasticity and great ambiguity, it is not without merit to infer that a person’s accent, along with race, could satisfy “reasonable suspicion” if a person were stopped for a non-immigration issue whereupon the person could not produce identification. Oddly enough, however, this degree of ambiguity within the interpretation of Section 2(B), especially as it pertains to matters of civil rights, receives little attention from Kennedy.</p>
<p>The roaming ambiguity inherent within Section 2(B) received a surprisingly timid reaction from Kennedy, whose chief concern rested upon the possibility of prolonged detention for persons whose immigration status were being verified. In admitting the high probability of varied interpretation, although failing to translate that into varied/questionable enforcement tactics, Justice Kennedy delivers the final verdict that ultimately upholds this provision. Through Justice Kennedy’s eyes:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Even if the law is read as an instruction to complete a check while the person is in custody, moreover, it is not clear at this stage and on this record that the verification process would result in prolonged detention. However the law is interpreted, if §2(B) only requires state officers to conduct a status check during the course of an authorized, lawful detention or after a detainee has been released, the provision likely would survive pre- emption—at least absent some showing that it has other consequences that are adverse to federal law and its objectives. There is no need in this case to address whether reasonable suspicion of illegal entry or another immigration crime would be a legitimate basis for prolonging a detention, or whether this too would be preempted by federal law.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1358229112462858">23</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For Kennedy, the issue at hand pertains not to unlawful detention, or racial profiling, yet his concerns with Section 2(B) rest with the possibility of prolonged detention. What is of severe concern with Kennedy’s rationale can be found in a statement made earlier within the Court’s ruling document. As written, Justice Kennedy argued that “perceived mistreatment of aliens in the United States may lead to harmful reciprocal treatment of American citizens abroad.” Oddly enough, however, public perception regarding the widespread linkage between Latinos and racial profiling with respect to Section 2(B), did not register within his rationale to uphold this provision. If the perceived mistreatment of “aliens,” more specifically, Latinos, be amongst one of the chief concerns when weighing the merits of the Arizona law, Justice Kennedy’s opinion leaves much to be desired regarding the affirmation of Section 2(B), as his decision ends on that note.</p>
<p>Arizona Senate Bill 1070, upon its initial passages, touted itself as a measure to discourage and deter “unlawful entry and presence of aliens and economic activity by persons unlawfully present in the United States,” anchored by four key provisions. While three measures were invalidated, the decision to uphold Section 2(B) was unsettling news for its critics. Immigrants, regardless of legal status, and even American citizens, contend Sahana Mukherjee, Ludwin Molina and Glenn Adams, “whose ethnic or racial identity is associated with popular imagination with the issue of immigration,” face many new challenges under Arizona law, as “law enforcement and other authorities might be more likely to suspect and detain Americans with “suspicious” identities, chiefly Latinos, than Americans of European descent.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1358229112462858">24</xref>
</sup> While Section 2(B) articulates “reasonable suspicion” as a right to investigate a person’s immigration status, given the law’s great ambiguity and elasticity, Mukherjee et al. argue that instances such as Section 2(B) afford law enforcement the ability to equate “suspicious identities” with “reasonable suspicion,” creating a hostile environment of racial profiling masked by Section 2(B) enforcement.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1358229112462858">25</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The correlation between Section 2(B)’s ambiguity and the promotion of subtle bias against Latinos continues to lead some researchers to believe that such a provision, as it stands, is a recipe for disaster. Jason Nier et al., in their study on ambiguity and subtle bias, believe Arizona’s attempt at immigration reform “will require law-enforcement officers to make judgments using ambiguous information as well as ambiguous standards, and as a result, the likelihood of racially biased enforcement of the statute will increase.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1358229112462858">26</xref>
</sup> More specifically, Nier et al. illustrate that, while the instructional material law enforcement officers have received cautions against racial profiling, the documentation itself suffers from a lack of specificity about what constitutes “reasonable suspicion.” According to their findings, Nier et al. illustrate that:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Instructional materials indicate that “dress” can be considered a factor when making a determination of reasonable suspicion of being in the country illegally. Yet, the type of dress that constitutes a “reasonable suspicion” is not clearly specified, and the manner in which this factor should be considered relative to other factors, such as “demeanor” and “location,” is not clearly delineated. Instead, officers are asked to make this judgment based on the “totality of circumstances,” which is an ambiguous standard. This… will likely result in greater reliance on implicit attitudes and stereotypes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1358229112462858">27</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>With a Justice who stakes concerns over perception, yet when given the legal opportunity to nullify a provision that is reliant upon such variables as “location,” “demeanor,” and “dress” to establish “reasonable suspicion” toward enforcement, the writing and ramifications could not be any clearer. The comfort afforded by legal ambiguity extends the benefit of the doubt to officers when faced with charges of racial profiling. In a state where the Governor has argued that the majority of individuals coming into Arizona are “drug mules,” along with accusations of supposed human beheadings by immigrants coming into the state, Section 2(B) then becomes framed as a matter of “defending” the homeland, whereby sometimes public safety, especially following September 11, 2001, trumps civil rights/liberties.</p>
<p>The “cross-deputization” of local law enforcement for matters that rest at the federal level opens a door that leads us down a corridor of uncertainty. The hyper-racialization that serves as Section 2(B)’s foundation, in part, stems from a definitional struggle over “who is and is not American,” along with “what does an American look like?”<sup>

<title>Concluding thoughts</title>
<p>Particularly amidst times of war, attempts at immigration reform and shifting national demographics, do questions of authenticity and belonging surface around defining and articulating national identity. Questions of who is and is not “American” become entrenched talking points, occupying various dimensions within the policy process. Whether these debates and their outcomes are sparked in defense of “national unity,” “homeland security,” or otherwise, how and in what ways “American” national identity is defined and debated continues to be anything but neutral. Given the state’s continual increase in non-White residents, like other states in the South, the sustained interest/linkage to racial politics should come as no surprise. Because ethnicity powerfully determines cooperation and solidarity, writes Benjamin Marquez, it “is reflected in social stratification, and is frequently institutionalized in religion, language, nationality, residential location, and government policy,” whereby analyzing the relationship between race and public policy, especially as it currently continues to evolve, warrants much inquiry.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1358229112462858">30</xref>
</sup> With special attention to recent attempts at immigration reform policies, we uncover disturbing developments that continue to place people of non-White descent in legally vulnerable positions. Whether it be questions of “American” authenticity, deciphering “legal” vs. “illegal” immigrants, or debating the merits of state immigration policies, national identity continues to play a vital role in the reshaping of the American landscape.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1358229112462858">31</xref>
</sup> To some degree, this demographic reshaping has been attributed to both increased political resistance and a heightened sense of awareness regarding the possible implications of targeted policies.</p>
<p>From past to present, “U.S. immigration law and policy have always been influenced by a complex intermingling of exceedingly difficult political, socioeconomic, and racial/ethnic issues,” greatly contributing to the current tension at hand.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1358229112462858">32</xref>
</sup> The growing fear of a declining population of White Americans at the hands of unregulated immigration from Latin America has led individuals such as Samuel Huntington<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1358229112462858">33</xref>
</sup> and Tom Tancredo<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1358229112462858">34</xref>
</sup> to embody restrictive positions on immigration reform that are visible within S.B. 1070. The perceived “political threat”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1358229112462858">35</xref>
</sup> that supposedly accompanies higher trends in immigration continues to produce electoral/political strategies driven by the threat of a socio-political takeover by immigrants from Latin America.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1358229112462858">36</xref>
</sup> From the standpoint of the law’s proponents, diversity represents an end to law and order, whereby, as a result, limits become imposed. As seen throughout S.B. 1070, especially Section 2(B), our understanding and desire for an orderly “American” society stems from a “deep distrust and suspicion of diversity” that fosters a political atmosphere reliant upon racial profiling.<sup>
