<p>Dr Adams’s Commentary on the article entitled “Clinical Trial Outcomes of High- and Extra High–Profile Breast Implants” is the kind of thoughtful discourse and diversity of opinion we encourage in <italic>Aesthetic Surgery Journal (ASJ)</italic>. Such discussions and disagreements are the hallmark of any respected scientific journal. It is my expectation that his hard-hitting Commentary will stimulate even further debate on this issue.</p>
<p>Whether the article was worthy of publication in <italic>ASJ</italic> was based on feedback given during our rigorous peer review process, the integrity of which I have commented upon previously in these pages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13484149">1</xref></sup> The article was evaluated by 7 reviewers, including members of our own Editorial Board. It was immediately clear to me from the reviews that this would be a controversial article. The majority of the reviewers felt that it would add worthwhile scientific information to our literature—not to mention that it would stimulate high-level critical thinking and debate among our readers, the goals of any scientific publication.</p>
<p>With regard to the question of including authors who are employees of the manufacturer, I have addressed conflict of interest and transparency issues in previous editorials,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13484149">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13484149">3</xref></sup> which I would encourage you to read so you can formulate your own opinion on how author relationships affect the overall scientific weight and validity of any article.</p>
<p>I thank the authors for submitting their work to us, and I am grateful to Dr Adams for his Commentary. I look forward to further debate on this issue and invite you to submit Letters to the Editor if you have anecdotal thoughts on high-profile implants in your own clinical practices.</p>
