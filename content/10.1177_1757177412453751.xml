<abstract>
<p>Finding effective ways to change healthcare workers’ (HCWs) behaviour while informing and empowering patients is challenging. Providing patient information at critical points of care delivery may empower them to address lapses and change HCWs’ behaviour. In this study, posters detailing standards required for five high impact interventions were displayed in patients’ rooms. Research groups were: ‘pre-poster’ (months 1–2; <italic>n</italic>=142 patients); ‘poster’ (months 3–4; <italic>n</italic>=59); ‘no-poster’ (months 3–4; <italic>n</italic>=52); and ‘no-poster’ (months 5–6; <italic>n</italic>=104). Poster effectiveness was evaluated by a quantitative questionnaire (<italic>n</italic>=357). Patients were asked if they identified lapses in five interventions by HCWs and whether patients had addressed them. Patient interviews (<italic>n</italic>=10 per group) explored patients’ knowledge of interventions. Only patients with posters addressed lapses. Poster presence was associated with significant increase in noticing lapses in the first two weeks but decreased incidence in noticing lapses in weeks 3–8. There was significant aversion to reporting doctors’ lapses. Interviews showed that posters significantly increased respondents’ knowledge, suggesting that lapses noticed in weeks 1–2 and not noticed in weeks 3–8 by the ‘poster’ group were genuine lapses followed by a change in HCWs’ behaviour. HCW self-interest in avoiding complaints from patients coincides with the aim of the posters in improving standards.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cross transmission of infection through failure to implement best practice accounts for the majority of healthcare associated infections (HCAIs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757177412453751">Pittet, 2004</xref>) and to reduce their prevalence policy makers, government initiatives and hospital infection prevention teams have focused on addressing lapses in practice. In response to the Health Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177412453751">2008</xref>) and epic2 guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177412453751">2007</xref>) the Department of Health (DH) published <italic>Saving Lives; Reducing Infection Delivering Clean Safe Care</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177412453751">DH, 2007</xref>), which grouped High Impact Interventions (HIIs) into so-called ‘Care Bundles’ for areas of particular importance to infection prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177412453751">DH, 2007</xref>). These aimed to ‘significantly reduce HCAIs’ by providing a framework of mandatory best practice for all interventions. Recently, the emphasis on infection ‘control’ has switched to one of infection ‘prevention’, reflected in the document <italic>Board to Ward; How to Embed a Culture of HCAI Prevention in Acute Trusts</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177412453751">DH, 2008</xref>) and the renaming of the Infection Control Nurses Association as the Infection Prevention Society in 2008. Although policies and government initiatives are clear in their guidelines they fail to provide direction as to how to implement these guidelines at grass-roots level, which relies in part on changing individual and group behaviour but also on appreciating the impact of patient perception and empowerment.</p>
<p>Although research on staff education and patient perception and empowerment has focused on hand hygiene, (which is logical because most HCAIs are preventable by ensuring good hand hygiene compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1757177412453751">WHO, 2009</xref>)), there has been little consideration of other interventions where there is potential for infection from a breach in good practice (for example cleaning the patient’s skin prior to peripheral vascular device insertion and port cleansing prior to administering intravenous medication). Furthermore, there are few research studies evaluating the effectiveness of involving patients in challenging their care (for example, there has been no evaluation of patient empowerment potentially arising from Aseptic Non-Touch Technique (ANTT™))</p>
<p>In addition, little is known of the sustainability or longevity of infection prevention initiatives such as poster campaigns. This is a critical aspect as a sustainable intervention minimises the resources that have to be directed to making the intervention effective. There is a clear need for research that takes an integrated approach, incorporating patients in their care. This would entail a method that not only acknowledges and manages healthcare workers (HCWs) self-interests but also equips patients with the knowledge of what to expect with regard to infection prevention (with a wider focus than hand hygiene). Furthermore, since people are generally poor at retaining information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757177412453751">Kessels, 2003</xref>), it must be done in a manner that does not rely on the ability to remember important facts. Prominently displayed posters would be one method, but it seems reasonable that, to be effective, a poster campaign should be coupled with processes that empower patients to address lapses at the time observed and that allow evaluation of success (patient empowerment, increased knowledge, demonstrable reduction in the number of lapses) and sustainability.</p>
<p>Following a pilot study, patients were presented with a large poster (105cm x 126cm) detailing best practice with regard to five care interventions. Patients were divided into a number of poster-related treatment groups allowing the effectiveness and longevity of the poster to be evaluated with a questionnaire and one-to-one interviews.</p>

<title>Ethical considerations</title>
<sec id="section3-1757177412453751">
<title>Ethical approval</title>
<p>The initial research proposal was submitted in line with the Hospital’s Research Governance Framework and given full acceptance. The proposal was then submitted to the University of Essex for approval by the appropriate Ethics Committee and was passed subject to considerations discussed below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1757177412453751">
<title>Consent</title>
<p>The questionnaire (the principal data collection method) was completed anonymously to encourage honest responses. In accordance with the proposal and recommendations of the Ethics Committee, children and patients with learning difficulties were not recruited to this study. Other exclusions were patients who had undergone eye, hand and shoulder surgeries that would make completing the questionnaire difficult. The hospital occasionally undertakes NHS contract work and, in line with the research proposal agreed by the Ethics Committee, these patients were also excluded from this study.</p>
<p>The University of Essex Ethics Committee requested that consideration be given to attaching a consent form to the questionnaire, but following discussion with the Head of Clinical Services it was decided that written consent forms attached to questionnaires could compromise the anonymity of the answers. To counter this, the questionnaire was headed by a statement that completing the questionnaire indicated consent for responses to be used in the study (giving freedom to decline consent at any point, simply by not completing the questionnaire). The consent giving process was also explained to respondents at the time the questionnaire was issued. The questionnaire reinforces anonymity, and gives advice on who to speak to should questions arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1757177412453751">UKDA, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>One-to-one interviews were used at five stages during the study to complement the quantitative questionnaires. No ‘sensitive information’ (as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1757177412453751">UKDA, 2010</xref>) was collected at any stage. Potential respondents were asked if they would be happy to take part in a brief discussion (approximately 15 minutes) and were given some indication of the nature of that discussion (e.g. to explore opinion on some infection prevention issues, and in the pilot stage (Stage 1), poster design). Individuals were assured of anonymity, were informed of how data would be shared, handled and kept, and were given the chance to ask questions. Verbal consent was given by respondents and they were given an advice sheet reiterating the information provided by the researcher.</p>
<p>As no actual physical treatment was administered; no photographs, recordings or video evidence were made; and no ‘sensitive personal data’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757177412453751">Office of Public Sector Information, 2010</xref>) would be used, the proposed consent measures for all stages of the study conform to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1757177412453751">UK Data Archive Requirements (2010)</xref>.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study was carried out in an independent sector hospital located within central England in a relatively affluent area. The hospital predominantly caters for elective surgical patients in single en suite rooms each with separate hand wash sinks.</p>
<p>The study design involved putting a large poster (105cm x 126cm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1757177412453751">Figure 1</xref>), readable from the bed or chair, within patients’ rooms to determine whether the presence of a poster changed staff behaviour and empowered patients to address lapses in the HCAI-related interventions graphically represented on the poster. The research followed a pilot-pre-peri-post design subdivided into five stages. The pilot study (termed Stage 1) involved testing poster designs. It was pivotal to the research design that the poster could be easily read from the patient’s bed or chair space in order that the patient could refer to it when receiving care. The pilot process involved interviewing patients to establish poster legibility and readability (including font size, style, colours and picture clarity), and questionnaire design and validation. Stage 2 was the pre-treatment group of patients in rooms containing no posters (<italic>n</italic> = 142). This allowed baseline data on patient perception, knowledge and empowerment, as well as staff behaviour, to be collected. Stage 3 followed Stage 2 and comprised the treatment group of patients in rooms with posters (<italic>n</italic>=59). This allowed the effect of posters on staff behaviour and patient knowledge and empowerment to be determined. Stage 4 (<italic>n</italic>=52) ran concurrently with Stage 3 and comprised patients in rooms without posters. In other words, Stage 3 patients were exposed to posters and, at the same time, Stage 4 patients did not have posters in their rooms but were cared for by staff visiting poster-bearing (Stage 3 patients) rooms. Thus, Stage 4 enabled the ‘sphere of influence’ of posters to be determined. In other words, were posters in one room affecting staff behaviour in rooms without posters? Stage 5 patients (<italic>n</italic>=104) were similar to Stage 2 patients but were admitted after the poster treatment to rooms with no posters. This stage allowed the longevity of any staff behaviour changes caused by poster exposure to be evaluated (i.e. were any changes noted during the treatment stage carried on when the posters were removed). The overall sample size was 357, with a sample size of 300 being typical for studies of attitudes of consumers and service users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757177412453751">Koenig-Lewis and Palmer, 2008</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The main research (i.e. stages following the pilot study) was conducted over 210 days; Stage 2 (62 days), Stages 3 and 4 (59 days running concurrently) and Stage 5 (61 days). In total, 30 rooms were used and patients were randomly allocated to these rooms through the booking-in process. Eighteen rooms were used for Stage 4 (‘without poster’) and 12 rooms for Stage 3 (‘with poster’). Stage 3 rooms had a large poster on the wall, visible and readable while the patient was lying in the bed. Placing posters in the rooms ensured that patients had the time to read the content fully and also had the additional benefits of having a more-or-less identical impact on each new patient admission.</p>
<p>The poster detailed what the patient can expect from the staff with regard to infection prevention and control. Information on interventions (specifically with regard to hand hygiene, correct use of personal protective equipment (PPE), care of peripheral intravenous cannula and catheter care) was taken from the <italic>Saving Lives</italic> audit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177412453751">DH, 2007</xref>). Information regarding environmental cleanliness was structured around the Infection Control Nurses Association (ICNA) audit criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757177412453751">ICNA/DH, 2004</xref>). The poster informed patients how to address any lapses of infection prevention with staff.</p>
<p>The questionnaire (validated during the pilot study) had 24 questions designed to gather geodemographic data (such as age, sex, postcode) as well as specific data about lapses observed and lapses addressed with regard to the five different care interventions displayed on the poster. Information about lapses observed and addressed were sub-divided into three different groups; doctors, nurses and cleaners. This enabled differences in practice between HCWs to be examined and for patient behaviour with regard to addressing lapses with different types of HCWs to be explored. Reasons behind lapses not being addressed were investigated along with patient feelings (including anxiety level and comfort) associated with noticing and addressing lapses. The questionnaire was given to respondents at the time of discharge for all research Stages (with the exception of the Pilot Stage 1 where responses were obtained from one-to-one interviews). The complementary method of one-to-one interviews (quantitative and qualitative) was conducted with 10 randomly chosen patients during each of Stages 2–5 (giving a total of 40 participants). Interviews lasted up to 20 minutes and were structured around exploring patients’ expectations and knowledge of best practice with regard to the five care interventions. For example, patients were asked ‘in what situations would you expect the consultant/anaesthetist/ward doctor/nurse/cleaner to wash their hands?’ These interviews were particularly important for the Stage 3 poster group because they validated the information provided by patients on the questionnaires. In other words, by determining patient knowledge levels it was possible to be confident that patients claiming to have noticed a lapse actually likely did (or did not) notice such a lapse.</p>
<p>It is recognised that patients with a poster may have changed their behaviour directly as a consequence of being studied (‘Hawthorne effect’), but in practice it is difficult to isolate the effects of exposure to the poster and exposure to the researcher intervention. Furthermore there has been doubt expressed about the extent or existence of such an effect in clinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757177412453751">McCarney et al, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Noticing a lapse</title>
<p>There was a significant increase in the lapses noticed in the first 2 weeks of the respondents with posters compared to the next 6 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1757177412453751">Figure 2</xref>). This stage (Stage 3) has been split into weeks 1–2 and 3–8 and also analysed in its entirety as weeks 1–8. These splits are referred to as sub-stages from this point on. Because some respondents noticed more than one lapse the impact of the presence of a poster was analysed both in terms of the total number of lapses noted by respondents in each stage or sub-stage of the research and the total number of respondents noticing a lapse in each stage or sub-stage of the research.</p>

<p>Lapses within each stage or sub-stage were compared with all other stages and sub-stages using a Fisher’s Exact Test. The results of the full comparison analysis on the total number of lapses are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177412453751">Table 1</xref>. Taking Stage 3 in its entirety (i.e. weeks 1–8), the total number of lapses reported as a proportion of the total number of patients was significantly higher than in Stage 2 (pre-poster), Stage 4 (no poster) and Stage 5 (no poster), supporting the hypothesis that the presence of a poster is associated with an increased incidence of reporting a lapse. Sub-dividing Stage 3 revealed a significant effect of earlier weeks in Stage 3’s influence. There was no significant difference between Stage 2 and Sub-Stage 3 (weeks 3–8) but a significant difference between Stage 2 and Sub-Stage 3 (weeks 1–2), indicating that weeks 1–2 are responsible for Stage 3’s overall significance.</p>

<p>Respondents with a poster were significantly more likely to notice lapses of hand hygiene than any other intervention when compared to respondents without a poster in Stages 2, 4 and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1757177412453751">Figure 3</xref>): total lapses <italic>n</italic>=13, hand hygiene <italic>n</italic>=10, other intervention <italic>n</italic>=3; Poster (Stage 3 (weeks 1–8)): total lapses <italic>n</italic>=48, hand hygiene <italic>n</italic>=19, other intervention <italic>n</italic>=29.

Of the ‘other interventions’, no-poster groups only noticed ‘Gloves and Aprons’ (<italic>n</italic>=2 respondents) and ‘Room Cleanliness’ (<italic>n</italic>=1 respondent), whereas poster group respondents noticed these and ‘Cannula Care’ and ‘Catheter Care’. The differences in the diversity of care interventions noticed between the poster and no-poster groups can be expressed as a diversity index (such as is commonly used in ecology; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177412453751">Begon et al, 1990</xref>).

Consultant/anaesthetist/ward doctor and nursing staff were all noticed making lapses (total number of lapses, <italic>n</italic>=47; consultant/anaesthetist/ward doctor: 16 of 47 (34%) lapses; nursing staff: 27 of 47 (57%) lapses; the remaining 4 of 47 lapses (9%) being made by cleaners). However, respondents only addressed lapses with nursing staff and cleaners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1757177412453751">Figure 5</xref>). Of the total number of respondents that addressed a lapse in this Sub-Stage (<italic>n</italic>=11 respondents addressing a lapse), 10 respondents addressed a lapse that they noticed by nursing staff with the nursing staff member concerned, one respondent addressed a lapse noticed by a cleaner with the cleaning staff member concerned and no respondents addressed any of the lapses noticed with the consultant/anaesthetist/ward Doctor. There was a significant aversion to reporting lapses with the consultant/anaesthetist/ward doctor involved. Sixteen respondents noticed a nursing staff lapse and 10 addressed it, 11 respondents noticed a consultant/anaesthetist/ward Doctor lapse and no one addressed it (FET, <italic>p</italic>=0.0179 two-tailed).</p>

<p>The one-to-one interviews (<italic>n</italic>=10) affirmed that participants who addressed a lapse had a positive outcome from doing so i.e. 100% of staff, when challenged by a patient, changed behaviour and implemented best practice (noticed a lapse <italic>n</italic>=6, addressed a lapse <italic>n</italic>=5, staff member changed practice <italic>n</italic>=5). A typical response, when asked if they had addressed a lapse was: ‘I did address it, and the nurse apologised and used the alcohol gel; she was about to check my dressing and take my blood pressure’.</p>

<title>Patient knowledge</title>
<p>It might be assumed for a null hypothesis that the poster group and the no-poster group had comparable baseline knowledge. Given this, the hypothesis that posters increased respondents’ knowledge of specific care interventions can be tested using a one-tailed sign test. In this case the poster group outperformed the no-poster groups for knowledge on all five interventions, giving a total of five ‘successes’ in five ‘trials’ (the five interventions). Given this, there was a significant effect of the poster on respondents’ knowledge; probability that the poster group would outperform the no-poster group in all five interventions was 0.5<sup>5</sup>, <italic>p</italic>=0.031 (one-tailed).</p>

<title>Systematic bias, anxiety</title>
<p>There was no systematic bias between the respondent group and the entire inpatient group admitted during the survey stages for gender (<italic>p</italic>=0.59) and age (<italic>p</italic>=0.174). There was however a significant difference with regard to length of stay (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001), with patients being more likely to answer the questionnaire if they had a shorter stay.</p>
<p>Respondents’ anxiety scores were rated between 1 and 5 (not at all anxious to extremely anxious). There was no significant difference between anxiety and the presence of a poster (Kruskal Wallis H full factorial test between all research Stages (i.e. 2+3, 2+4, 2+5, 3+4, 3+5, 4+5 ): X<sup>2</sup> = 2.724, df = 3, <italic>p</italic>=0.436).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Patients with posters did notice more lapses than those without. When comparing lapses (both individual and total number noticed), patients with posters in Stage 3 weeks 1–2 noticed significantly more lapses than patients without a poster in Stages 2, 4 and 5. Interestingly, weeks 1–2 of Stage 3 accounted for the majority of total lapses (47/48), with Stage 3 weeks 3–8 being not significantly different from Stages 2, 4 and 5 (i.e. the final 6 weeks of the poster stage were not significantly different to the non-poster stages with regard to noticed lapses). It is noteworthy that it was not possible to establish whether the patients who did not state they noticed a lapse of infection prevention practices actually did not incur one and vice versa.</p>
<p>If the effects identified in the Hawthorne research were translated to this research one might expect an instant reduction in lapses, which in fact was not the case – instead, the lapses reduced significantly after 2 weeks, which tends to be more suggestive of a learning curve perhaps led by patients correcting their care. Equally if the Hawthorne effect was considered, that staff modify behaviour as they are part of an experiment, it fails to explain why the effects seen in the rooms with posters were not translated to the rooms without posters or indeed Stage 4 (no poster group (which ran alongside Stage 3 poster group)). The consideration that the need to mitigate any potential for complaint when a lapse is noticed may be considered as an explanation, which a patient in a room without a poster is less likely to appreciate and subsequently address (substantiated by the qualitative research). The posters, questionnaires and patient interviews were visible high impact reminders to the staff and patients of the research project, and while the impact of the Hawthorne effect cannot be dismissed several studies have found quantifying the extent of the Hawthorne effect challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757177412453751">McCarney et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The one-to-one interviews showed that the knowledge base of patients with posters is reliable, lending credibility to the data. Participants with a poster in Stage 3 offered significantly more correct responses than participants without a poster (Stages, 2, 4 and 5) (4.38 compared to 1.89). The credibility of patients reporting lapses is further substantiated by the fact that patients without a poster were more likely to notice lapses of hand hygiene than any other infection prevention interventions. Furthermore, one-to-one interviews suggested that patients had poor knowledge of what to expect with interventions other than hand hygiene. The poster group (Stage 3) offered nearly three times the number of responses with regard to catheter care and cannula care.</p>
<p>Given increased patient knowledge, the lack of noticed lapses towards the end of the poster stage strongly suggests that fewer lapses had been made. Staff were not introduced, in any way, to the posters or content prior to poster placement in rooms and so it might have taken two weeks for all staff to acquaint themselves with the expectations of the poster and modify their behaviour accordingly. Consequently, it is reasonable to conclude that the posters changed staff behaviour within the first two weeks (which could perhaps be thought of as an ‘unfreezing’ stage (sensu Lewin cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757177412453751">Schein (1996)</xref>) and there were genuinely fewer lapses after this initial period. Therefore, posters not only positively influence patient knowledge but there is also strong evidence for changing staff practice through this increased knowledge and the empowerment that comes with it.</p>
<p>Whilst there is a drive towards empowering patients to be involved in their care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757177412453751">Rowley and Sinclair, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177412453751">Burnett et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757177412453751">Fletcher, 2009</xref>), there is an absence of evaluation of the effectiveness, including longevity, of the measures taken to achieve this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1757177412453751">Williams, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757177412453751">Nishimura et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757177412453751">Pittet et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1757177412453751">Thomas et al, 2005</xref>). The research addressed these gaps through a poster design that encouraged patients to address lapses with staff and through data gathering methods that enabled evaluation of both the effectiveness and longevity of the poster’s effect on patient knowledge and perception. It is important to evaluate the ongoing effect of a poster on staff, however while staff might become blasé about its presence, it is ‘new’ to each patient that sees it. If a poster empowers patients to address lapses with staff, and if addressing lapses in turn reduces lapses (which is supported by the findings discussed above), then the turnover of patients ensures that the poster’s effects are ongoing and unchanging and as such the poster has a covert, patient-dependent longevity.</p>
<p>Posters did influence patient empowerment, with only those patients with posters addressing any lapses with any member of staff. Furthermore, 61% of noticed lapses in the poster group went on to be addressed by patients. Interestingly, and consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757177412453751">Fletcher (2009)</xref>, patients exclusively addressed these lapses with the nursing staff member concerned (or, in one case, a cleaner) rather than with consultants, anaesthetists or ward doctors. That no patients challenged any lapses made by the consultants, anaesthetists or ward doctors and yet felt able to address lapses by nursing staff was seemingly down to a perception of self-interest, with the most common reason given for not addressing a lapse being ‘not wanting to risk compromising my care’. Arguably the patient’s reliance on a single consultant, anaesthetist or ward doctor might influence this; patients may worry less about alienating a single nurse in a team of many than a single consultant (who may be about to perform surgery on them). However, despite respondents not addressing lapses with the consultant, anaesthetist or ward doctors, results from weeks 3–8 in Stage 3 would suggest that the practice of consultants, anaesthetists and ward doctors actually improved. This might imply that the presence of the poster alone is enough impetus to change staff behaviour, and patient challenges in addressing lapses might not have been necessary in achieving improved compliance. There may have been confounding factors which affected this result, such as news items circulating in the media, but none were apparent. This is a suggested area for further research.</p>
<p>The poster deliberately used an amalgamation of a number of behaviour change theories to create a multi-faceted approach to infection prevention and control. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757177412453751">Nishimura et al’s (1999)</xref> study, whereby hand hygiene was ‘encouraged’ by a rule that everyone wash their hands before entering an intensive care unit, was successful but the research poster used here comprised elements of the ‘paternalistic’ biomedical model in an arguably less obvious manner. Here, the poster informed the patient (as well as reminding staff) of the ‘prescribed care’. Operant and social learning models build on the work of Pavlov, Skinner and Tolmen with emphasis placed on the behaviour necessary to achieve compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177412453751">Dworetsky, 1993</xref>). These models repetitively reinforce the link between stimulus and response (classic operant conditioning), gradually shaping the desired response to the point at which the behaviour becomes second nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177412453751">Creedon, 2006</xref>). Positive reinforcement (‘reward’) is usually considered vital to establish the stimulus-response connection but in a review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177412453751">Creedon (2006)</xref> found no evidence of direct reinforcement being used to alter HCWs’ behaviour. Interestingly, a review undertaken by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177412453751">Giuffrida and Togerson (1997)</xref> found that the use of financial incentives reinforced patients’ compliance with their treatment, indicating the importance of practice recognising both HCWs and patients in models of change. The reinforcement of the link between stimulus and response can arguably be seen in the reduction of lapses noted in Stage 3 weeks 3–8 compared to Stage 3 weeks 1–2. The poster can be regarded as the stimulus for the staff to conform to best practice and the stimulus for the staff to change behaviour, a change that in this case can be regarded as the response. Furthermore, the action of patients addressing lapses with staff is a secondary stimulus (and, by being implied criticism, arguably more personal) reinforcing the ‘conditioning’.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757177412453751">Le Grand’s (2003)</xref> concept of self-interest (falling within the model of social marketing as a principle governing behavioural change) suggests that self-interest is a stronger driver of change than altruism. This is particularly applicable here since not conforming to infection prevention best practice does not usually adversely affect the HCW. The driving force for change, as described by Lewin, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757177412453751">Schein (1996)</xref>, is, in this case, the need to obviate any patient complaint by ensuring that best practice (as described on the poster) is provided to the patients. Thus, applying Lewin’s ideas more generally, the risk of a patient lodging a formal complaint eventually dominates any potential resistant forces and so staff are, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757177412453751">Rogers (1995)</xref> might suggest, ‘persuaded’ by the poster, ‘decide’ to change practice and ‘adopt’ this for as long as the poster remains in situ.</p>
<p>The poster’s impact and connection to the theory of social marketing and self-interest is further borne out by the fact that the poster only influenced care for the patients in whose room it was in; the Stage 4 (no poster group) that ran alongside Stage 3 (poster group) had no significant difference in the number of lapses than any of the other groups lacking a poster (Stages 2 and 5). This implies that in order for behaviour to change the poster needs to be in situ, that the sphere of influence of the posters is restricted to the patients who have posters, and, worryingly for policy makers, the behavioural change is not translated to patients without posters.</p>
<p>Economically, a few posters around a hospital would be more attractive than putting posters in every room or treatment bay, but the results of this study strongly indicate that only a blanket-coverage would be effective. As well as being more expensive, such a poster campaign would negatively affect the overall aesthetics of the treatment environment. While appearances might not be a prime driver in healthcare, it is likely to be a consideration in the independent sector, where patients may have greater expectations of their surroundings than in the NHS. However, given the number of HCAI deaths, such blanket coverage is arguably necessary and long overdue. Analogies can be made perhaps to the poster being a ‘silent policeman’ backed up by the watchful patient, arguably not unlike a speed camera’s influence on traffic, whereby car drivers might alter their behaviour, slowing down so as not to ‘get caught’, but revert to speeding when the risk has gone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177412453751">ICM, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Critically, the one-to-one interviews suggested that where patients addressed the lapses they noticed with the staff member the practice was immediately changed (in all cases noted in one-to-one interviews). Practice was consistently challenged at a critical control point prior to compromising the care (before care) and potentially causing cross infection; this is consistent with the findings of the literature review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757177412453751">O’Boyle et al, 2001</xref>). It would be reasonable to assume, in the absence of any complaints, that this was done within the boundaries of the HCW/patient relationship and to the satisfaction of the patient. It would be interesting to explore the staff member’s feelings with regard to being challenged by a patient; however this was considered to be outside the realm of this research. One would question how important staff members’ feelings actually are when staff should be conforming to the requirements of policy and best practice as standard. Also, if the one-to-one interviews are revealing that patient empowerment elicits a behaviour change (that conventional education often fails to achieve (see literature review, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1757177412453751">Pitett et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757177412453751">Rowley and Sinclair, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177412453751">Creedon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757177412453751">Mah and Meyers, 2006</xref>) then it might be asked; does it matter how staff feel about being challenged?</p>

<title>Limitations and suggestions for further research</title>
<p>Patients addressed some of the lapses made by nurses and cleaners but not lapses made by consultants, anaesthetists or ward Doctors, yet in weeks 3–8 in Stage 3 the reduced rate of lapses would suggest that practice of the consultants, anaesthetists and ward doctors improved in addition to that of the nursing staff and cleaners. Further research would be necessary to determine whether the presence of the poster alone, without the physical reminders and challenges made by the patient, would be enough to change practice.</p>
<p>There was no control over the communication staff members had with the patient regarding the poster, which may have impacted on the results.</p>
<p>The results were self- reported by the patient (for both the quantitative and qualitative research) and as discussed this could be unreliable as it was not possible to mitigate all of the potential risk associated with the Hawthorne effect. It was not possible to determine the potential longevity of the posters, but the findings would suggest that for the poster to be effective it needs to be present at the point of care and the ‘newness’ of the patient (as opposed to the poster) determines the poster’s longevity.</p>
<p>It was out of the scope of the research methodology to investigate the underlying reasons for the change in staff behaviour resulting in the reduction of lapses. Understanding the rationale of behaviour is pivotal to changing practice, although, in this case staff are arguably unlikely to state they are more predisposed to best practice when there is a risk of challenge or complaint.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>With increasing emphasis placed on reducing healthcare associated infections and empowering patients to be involved in their care there are arguably fewer, simpler methods that both educate and empower patients at critical control points that also serve to remind staff of best practice than a poster.</p>
