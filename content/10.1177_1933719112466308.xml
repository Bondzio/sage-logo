<abstract>
<p>We did a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess the incidence of infectious complications and the protective effect of antibiotic administration during operative hysteroscopic procedures in an office setting. A total of 1046 consecutively enrolled women with intrauterine lesions were randomly allocated to the reference group (523 patients administered with 1 g of cefazolin intramuscularly) and the study group (523 patients administered with 10 mL of isotonic sodium chloride solution), and treated in office setting by operative hysteroscopy for endometrial polypectomy, uterine septa, submucosal myomas, and intrauterine adhesions. The primary outcome measure was the computation of difference between groups in postsurgical infectious complications occurring in the 5 days after the procedures. The time spent in performing the various procedures did not differ significantly (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05) between the groups. With respect to the overall rate of postsurgical infection, we found that 12 (1.15%) of 1046  patients referred with symptoms related to infective complications, 7 (1.3% of 523 women) in the study—untreated—group and 5 (1.0% of 523 women) in the reference group. Such incidences did not differ significantly between the groups (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). Antibiotics were prescribed in all cases of postsurgical infection and the infective process resolved in few days. None of these patients developed serious infections with adnexal involvement, as confirmed by clinical and ultrasounds evaluation. The results of the current study would support the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommendation not to prescribe routine antibiotic administration in the case of hysteroscopic surgery.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The field of hysteroscopy has been revolutionized by rapid improvements in technology and technique that have increased the widespread use of hysteroscopic evaluation of endometrial cavity/diseases in an ambulatory setting (office hysteroscopy), also because they allowed such an examination to be less invasive and painful, thus reducing the need of inpatient services.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112466308">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112466308"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112466308">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Therefore, the criterion of choice among office or inpatient procedures was no longer solely determined by the type of endometrial/uterine pathology, but clearly by the opportunity of using new miniaturized instruments and new surgical strategies. And the final effect was the creation of a “minimally invasive” approach that is increasing the number of minimally invasive hysteroscopic surgical procedures. This technical, technological, and surgical revolution of diagnosis and treatment of several female reproductive pathologies have gained more and more importance in gynecology, and several studies have clearly assessed that office hysteroscopy may be one of the means to reduce ecclesiological risks, to enhance time–cost-effectiveness as well as improve patient’s satisfaction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112466308">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112466308">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This new approach <italic>(</italic>see &amp; treat hysteroscopy or office operative hysteroscopy) has allowed the treatment of a various of uterine, cervical, and vaginal pathologies in outpatient regimen without cervical dilatation, contributing to reduce the distinction between diagnostic and operative procedures, and thus introducing the concept of a single procedure in which the operative part is perfectly integrated in the diagnostic workup.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112466308">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112466308"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112466308">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>However, doubts on the increased potential risk of local as well as systemic infections may recommend antibiotic prophylaxis during hysteroscopic procedures, the vagina is an area of the body that is abundant with normal bacterial flora and the transcervical route may increase, per se, such a potential risk of infections.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112466308">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112466308"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112466308">6</xref>
</sup> Moreover, repeated hysteroscope insertion and removal may transfer vaginal and cervical flora into the uterine cavity, and also the use of the irrigation fluid may potentially contribute to causing infection by flowing through the fallopian tubes. These considerations, together with the possibility that bacteraemia can be a result of direct fluid absorption through the traumatised endometrial surface, would pose doubts on the fact that office operative hysteroscopy may have an extrapotential for postprocedure infection in the endometrial cavity.</p>
<p>Since no data are available to date on the prevalence of infections after office operative hysteroscopy, the present study was designed to assess the incidence of infectious complications and the protective effect of prophylactic antibiotic during operative hysteroscopic procedures in an office setting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1933719112466308" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted between January and October 2010 in the hysteroscopy units of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the University of Foggia and the Department of Gynaecology, Obstetrics and Human Reproduction of the “Federico II” University of Naples. For the study, which was approved by the institutional review board (University of Foggia, Italy), we consecutively recruited women undergoing office hysteroscopy during the immediate postmenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle (6th-10th day, computed on the base of the last menstrual period as referred by patients), and all provided written informed consent to participate.</p>
<p>In the study, we only enrolled patients who were diagnosed, during the same hysteroscopic session, with intrauterine lesions to be treated in office setting. Those patients who only received purely diagnostic hysteroscopy—with or without target-eye endometrial biopsy—were excluded from the study. Other exclusion criteria were (i) gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogous or other steroid and hormonal therapies (included intrauterine device) in the previous 8 weeks; (ii) vaginal swabs positive for alteration of bacterial flora; (iii) evaluation performed by hysteroscopy in the previous 3 months; (iv) adnexal pathologies; (v) well-known or suspected hypersensitivity or intolerance to cephalosporins; (vi) cardiovascular, hepatic, or renal impairment or any coexisting disease that would require antibiotic therapy during the study; (vii) any condition that would contraindicate the office approach (lesion size and intramural development of the pathology); (viii) pregnancy, lactation, or abortion in the previous 4 months; (ix) known or suspected malignant or premalignant disease and hypersensitivity to any of the study drug compounds, use of antibiotic therapy during the previous 60 days.</p>
<p>A sample size calculation was computed by using a 2-tailed test with an α level of 0.01 and 99% power. Difference in postsurgical infections treated or not with antibiotic prophylaxis was used as the main indicator in the calculation of sample size. The incidence of postsurgical infections was reported to be nearly 2% after resectoscopic surgery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112466308">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112466308"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112466308">9</xref>
</sup> Since office operative hysteroscopy is less invasive than traditional resectoscopic surgery,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112466308">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112466308"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112466308">3</xref>
</sup> we expected the incidence of postsurgical infections without antibiotic prophylaxis to be 1.5% and with antibiotic prophylaxis 0.2%. Detecting a difference of this magnitude requires <underline>&gt;</underline>1000 patients (500 patients per group), and therefore a sample size of at least 500 patients per group was chosen to allow for the possibility of greater variability in postsurgical infections prevalence than was reported in other studies.</p>
<p>Enrolment and randomization were performed by surgeons and physicians, respectively, of the Hysteroscopy Units of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the University of Foggia and, the Department of Gynaecology, Obstetrics and Human Reproduction of the “Federico II” University of Naples. Thus, a total of 3726 patients who underwent office hysteroscopy were invited to participate in the study. Of them, 3137 were judged eligible and gave their informed consent, because 540 declined to participate and 49 did not meet the inclusion criteria. Of the remaining 3137 patients, 154 were not evaluated because diagnostic or operative hysteroscopy failed and in 1851 women only diagnostic hysteroscopy was needed and, therefore, were excluded from the study. Therefore, of the remaining 1149 patients, 86 were excluded from the evaluation, because they underwent diagnostic hysteroscopy with simple endometrial biopsy and/or cervical polypectomy, and thus a total of 1046 women were randomized and included in the final analyses.

<title>Study Protocol</title>
<p>Patients were randomly assigned to the following treatment regimens: reference group, in whom 1 g of cefazolin was intramuscularly (im) administered during hysteroscopic procedure; study group, in whom patients were administered with 10 mL of isotonic sodium chloride solution (the placebo) during hysteroscopic procedure.</p>
<p>Sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes were prepared, each containing a folded slip of paper with the treatment route written on it. The written treatment scheme followed a randomized allocation that was achieved by using the sequential treatment assignment with balancing for prognostic factors. The procedure ensures treatment groups of equal size as well as the balance across the treatments of the effects of prognostic factors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112466308">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Cefazolin and placebo were given by the attending physician, according to routes indicated in the randomization envelope: this was a double-blind randomized study, because the patients, surgeons, and outcome assessors were blinded to patient allocation. Both in cases and control, administration was performed within 30 minutes from the beginning of the hysteroscopic procedure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1933719112466308">
<title>Office Operative Hysteroscopy</title>
<p>Office operative hysteroscopy was performed using a vaginoscopic approach, a 4-mm diameter continuous-flow hysteroscope with oval profile and a 30° fore-oblique telescope and a 5-F operating channel (office continuous flow operative hysteroscopy “size 4”, Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). All procedures were performed by 2 expert surgeons (L. N. and A. D. S. S. in Bari and Naples, respectively). Neither analgesic nor anesthetic drugs were administered to the patients. Saline solution was used as distension medium (NaCl 0.9%), which was provided through an electronic system of irrigation/aspiration (Endomat, Karl Storz). A stable intrauterine pressure of approximately 40 mm Hg was obtained by setting the flow rate on 220 to 350 mm Hg and the negative pressure suction on 0.2 bar and the pressure of irrigation at 100 mm Hg.</p>
<p>With respect to the sterilization process, Statim Cassette Autoclave (Statim 5000, SciCan Ltd, Germany) was used for the sterilization of the endoscopes. The sterilization process started as the steam generator heated to the optimum temperature and a defined volume of distilled water was pumped in and converted to steam. Then, a wall of steam was injected into the pressure chamber and cassette, which was loaded with contaminated instruments. Air was purged as the steam coursed through the cassette and in continuously expelled into a condenser flask (134°C/3.5 min). After the cycle was completed, a small air compressor switched on drying and cooling the instruments rapidly. It took just a little over 9 minutes for a complete sterilization cycles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1933719112466308">
<title>Operative Hysteroscopic Procedures</title>
<p>After panoramic visualization of the entire uterine cavity, the operative procedures were performed with standard techniques using grasping forceps, scissors, and bipolar electrodes (Versapoint bipolar Twizzle electrode, Gynecare, Ethicon). Operative time was recorded from the introduction to the extraction of the scope.</p>
<p>Polypectomy of endometrial polyps <underline>&lt;</underline>0.5 cm was performed using 5-F mechanical instruments (sharp scissor and/or crocodile forceps). The technique consists of grasping polyps base with open jaws, to close them and to gently push toward the uterine fundus. The procedure was repeated several times until the detachment of the polyp from its implant in myometrium.</p>
<p>Polyps &gt;0.5 cm. were removed intact, with the Versapoint Twizzle electrode, only if the internal cervical ostium size was wide enough for their extraction. Otherwise, they were sliced from the free edge to the base into 2 or 3 fragments, large enough to be pulled out through the uterine cavity using 5-Fr grasping forceps with teeth. To remove the entire base of the polyp without going too deep into the myometrium, in some cases the Twizzle electrode was bent by 25° to 30°, enough to obtain a kind of hook electrode.</p>
<p>In the case of metroplasty, the resection of the septum was performed starting in its middle portion by means of Versapoint Twizzle electrode and refining its base with sharp scissors respecting the 3 diagnostic hysteroscopic criteria, previously established by Bettocchi et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112466308">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>For myomectomy, a technique similar to polipectomy was applied on submucosal myomas with the difference that, due to their higher tissue density, they were first divided into 2 half-spheres and then each of these is sliced as described for polyps. Particular attention has to be paid to the intramural part of the myoma, if present. To avoid any myometrial stimulation or damage of the surrounding healthy myometrium, the myoma was first gently separated from the capsule using mechanical instruments (grasping, forceps, or scissor) as already described for “cold loop” resectoscopic myomectomy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112466308">12</xref>
</sup> Once the intramural section became submucosal then it was sliced with the Versapoint Twizzle electrode.</p>
<p>Intrauterine adhesiolysis was performed on intrauterine adhesions, particularly those that are focal and thin were easily divided in the middle with sharp hysteroscopic scissors. Whether diffuse or firm, the Versapoint Twizzle electrode was used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1933719112466308">
<title>Outcomes of the Study</title>
<p>Our primary outcome measure was the computation of differences in incidence of postsurgical infectious complications, if 2 or more of the following signs were found in the 5 days after the office operative hysteroscopy: (i) fever (body temperature greater than 38°C or 100.4°F at repeated measurements over a period of at least 48 hours); (ii) low abdominal pain; (iii) uterine, adnexal, or cervical motion tenderness; (iv) purulent leucorrhoea; (v) vaginal discharge or itchiness; and (vi) dysuria. We chose this definition as there is no international consensus on definition of posthysteroscopic infection.</p>
<p>After the procedure, all patients were counselled and obtained written information to contact the team of the hysteroscopy unit if postprocedural symptoms suggestive for complications occurred. They were recommended to record their temperature twice a day for 48 hours after the procedure. After office hysteroscopic surgery, patients were scheduled to return in 3 weeks for follow-up gynecological examination and any occurred postprocedural complication.</p>
<p>Duration of surgical procedure, intra- and postoperative complications and associated side effects were also recorded.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All data were analyzed with Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, California and were expressed as mean ± standard deviation ([SD] range) or as number (%) of cases. The Kolgomorov-Smirnov test was used to evaluate whether values had a Gaussian distribution, in order to choose between parametric and nonparametric statistical tests. Comparison of proportions and means between groups were done by the χ<sup>

<p>With respect to the time spent in performing the different hysteroscopic procedures, it did not differ significantly (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05) between the reference and study groups; however, the length of operating time was higher for hysteroscopic office myomectomies since, as mentioned above in describing the procedure, it comprises the use of mechanical instruments (grasping, forceps, or scissor) to separate myomas from their capsule and the use of bipolar electrodes (the Versapoint Twizzle electrode) to divide and slice them.</p>
<p>When we moved to analyze the overall rate of postsurgical infection between the study (in whom patients were treated with placebo [10 mL of isotonic sodium chloride solution]) and the reference (where women received 1 g of cefazolin intraoperatively) groups, we found that 12 (1.15%) of 1046 patients referred with the symptoms related to infective complications, in details, 7 (1.3% of 523 women) were patients belonging to the study—untreated—group and 5 (1.0% of 523 women) to the reference group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1933719112466308">Table 1</xref>). Such incidences did not differ significantly between groups (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). Antibiotics were prescribed in all cases of postsurgical infection and the infective process resolved in few days. None of these patients developed serious infections with adnexal involvement, as confirmed by clinical and evaluation by ultrasounds.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Due to the abundance of lower genital tract flora, surgical procedures through or adjacent to this area could be subjected to a moderate to high incidence of infection. Established recommendations suggest that antibiotic administration in major procedures, such as vaginal–abdominal hysterectomy and cesarean section,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112466308">13</xref>

</sup> could help in reducing the incidence of such infections; however, no clear indications exist to whether or not antibiotic prophylaxis might help in preventing infections in minimally invasive surgery.</p>
<p>The available literature on this topic revealed that infectious complications after office hysteroscopy are uncommon,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112466308">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112466308"/>

</sup> and a Cochrane review recently showed that high-quality evidence on the significance of antibiotic prophylaxis before transcervical operative procedures is still lacking.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112466308">17</xref>
</sup> In addition, in recent multicenter randomized controlled study, the prevalence of infectious complications after office diagnostic hysteroscopy performed in a cohort of infertile women was found to be 0.4% (1 of 631 women) and according to these data, the authors did not recommend antibiotic prophylaxis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719112466308">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In a prospective study, Agostini et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719112466308">19</xref>
</sup> investigated a group of women undergoing hysteroscopic surgery without antibiotic administration. Among 2116 procedures, 30 infections (1.42%) were reported—18 endometrial (0.85%) and 12 urinary tract infections (0.57%). Finally, the usefulness of antibiotic prophylaxis before hysteroscopic endometrial laser ablation or resection was also assessed by Bhattacharya et al,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719112466308">20</xref>
</sup> among 116 hysteroscopic procedures, postoperative infection requiring antibiotic therapy was not significantly different between the groups with or without prophylaxis (9% vs 11.4%).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719112466308">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In the present multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, we evaluated whether the incidence of infectious complications may be reduced by the protective effect of antibiotic administration during operative hysteroscopic procedures in an office setting. We found that 12 of 1046 patients referred with symptoms related infective complications, with an overall incidence of 1.15%, nevertheless, infectious complications incidences did not vary between patients (reference group) in whom 1 g of cefazolin im was administered during hysteroscopic procedure (7 of 523; 1.3%) compared to those (5 of 523 patients; 1.0%) that received a placebo treatment (10 mL of isotonic sodium chloride solution). None of those cases with postsurgical infection developed serious infection with adnexal involvement as confirmed by clinical and ultrasonography evaluation.</p>
<p>Although the relatively small surface interested and the little tissue trauma caused, a special consideration should be made for transcervical gynecological procedure, due to the abundance of resident organisms, repeated insertion and removal of the surgical instrumentation, irrigation fluid and endometrial surface trauma. Nevertheless the cervical barrier is no longer active, thus potentially leading bacteria to ascend from lower genital tract directly into bloodstream. Taking these data into account, it is still reasonably questionable whether or not antibiotic administration could represent a benefit for patients undergoing office operative procedures.</p>
<p>Antibiotic administration itself can also be associated with serious side effects such as the rare (0.2%) but lethal occurrence of anaphylactic shock<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719112466308">21</xref>
</sup> or to allow the development of resistant bacteria. Thus, the choice of antibiotic depends largely on the kind of bacteria causing surgical site infection (and not directed at eradicating all the organisms) as well as on the basis of its spectrum of activity, pharmacokinetics, possible side effects, and costs. In the case of cefazolin, it is a first generation cephalosporin, generally accepted as an appropriate antibiotic for infection prophylaxis in most cases, also because it is inexpensive and has a sufficiently long half-life.<sup>

</sup> It has a spectrum of activity against many Gram-positive (<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>, except methicillin-resistant, β-haemolytic streptococci A and B, pneumococcus) and some Gram-negative (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, Klebsiella, <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic>, and Shigella) bacteria.</p>
<p>Office hysteroscopy is an exciting and rapidly advancing field of gynecologic practice that, in contrast with the other techniques, enables direct visualization of the uterine cavity and relevant pathologic disorders.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112466308">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112466308"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112466308">3</xref>
</sup> Until the 1990s, gynecologists performed hysteroscopy in the office setting only for diagnostic purposes, and patients were scheduled to have the lesions removed or treated in the operating room using a resectoscope.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112466308">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112466308"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112466308">3</xref>
</sup> Currently, office operative hysteroscopy has reduced the distinction between a diagnostic and an operative procedure, shifting the focus in health care away from inpatient diagnosis and treatment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112466308">3</xref>
</sup> Data from the present study do suggest that incidence of infectious complications after operative office hysteroscopic procedure is low and it cannot be modified by prophylactic antibiotic administration. Such a clinical result may be due to the fact that hysteroscopic procedures performed in the office setting are (1) reasonable short (generally no more than 20 minutes); (2) less complex than those accomplished in the operating room; (3) associated with the use of miniaturized operative instruments that minimize the risk of trauma and, therefore, of thinning and weakening of the adjacent myometrium<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112466308">3</xref>
</sup>; and (4) performed with constant intrauterine pressure of more than 30 to 40 mm Hg that may contribute by itself in avoiding the overdistension of the muscle fibers and hence myometrial traumatisms and tubal spillage.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112466308">22</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719112466308"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719112466308">24</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In conclusion, considering the low risk of infectious complications after hysteroscopy, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recently recommended not to prescribe routine antibiotic prophylaxis prior to hysteroscopic surgery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112466308">6</xref>
</sup> The results of the current study seem to support this recommendation even when operative procedures are performed in the office setting. However, further larger studies are needed to confirm our findings.</p>
