<p>“Mediactive” will stand as one of this decade’s most important works focused on developing a different kind of media citizen: one who actively and broadly engages with news and information. According to Gillmor, “In a participatory culture, none of us is fully literate unless we are creating, not just consuming” (p. xvii). With some shortcomings, it is a needed primer for news in the Web 2.0 universe and beyond, and a must-read for anyone interested about, or impacted by, today’s media (which means everyone).</p>
<p>While media scholars and professionals will instantly recognize the contemporary themes and abundant examples, they are not the intended audience, and that is the work’s strength. Targeted toward the intelligent nonexpert (which could include students), the accompanying website’s subtitle, “Creating a user’s guide to democratized media,” aptly describes the book’s comfortable, approachable language for topics from the cerebral to the practical.</p>
<p>An early chapter about smart media use suggests being skeptical, while the “Tools and Tactics” chapter covers social media, mashups, and content management systems. In discussing “Trustworthy media creation,” Gillmor distills journalistic values to include thoroughness, accuracy, and transparency. An entire chapter is dedicated to how today’s media consumer should consider media credibility and ways to practice verification. The chapter “Owning your online presence” discusses the now-critical concept of personal online branding, especially vital for students entering the workforce.</p>
<p>This combination of guiding-to-think and helping-to-do sets the work apart from the most published media observations. Unlike many authors and publishers in the new media arena, he clearly “walks the walk.” Calling it a “work” and not just a book seems appropriate because Gillmor explicitly challenges the notion of an unchanging information medium. An initial note mentions how underlined words in the printed version are hyperlinks (and there are many) in the online and e-book versions, the former free (on his site’s pages and as a PDF) and the latter with a $0.99 Kindle version now available.</p>
<p>While these links allow the reader to delve deeper or read primary sources, they do not make up for the work’s overall lack of evidence to support many topics and arguments. For example, Gillmor suggests providing context for information; unfortunately his sometimes quick, dense discussions of media issues and failure to define important terms could leave nonmedia audiences feeling lost. One of those terms is media literacy, an international cultural, and educational movement dating to the 1970s that stresses critical media consumption while encouraging production. Surprisingly, Gillmor does not discuss media literacy until the end of the work, saying the term and current state of the field does not represent participatory media as well does his concept of “mediactive.” By initially placing his excellent ideas within the broader media literacy conversation, Gillmor would prevent the Johnny-come-lately impression some well-meaning professionals promoting ideas leave on the academic community.</p>
<p>Many recognize Gillmor as the author of the 2004 citizen journalism rallying cry “We the media,” as well as through his positions as director of the Knight Center for Digital Media Entrepreneurship at Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication and director of the Center for Citizen Media. In his current work, the chapter on entrepreneurial journalism promotes innovation, experimentation, and a fervent laissez faire approach to potential government funding for journalism. It does not address larger concerns by intellectuals like Robert McChesney about how journalists with small, understaffed, and underresourced operations could effectively report on governments or large, well-funded multinational corporations.</p>
<p>Overall, “Mediactive” is a welcome contribution to the growing dialogue about our relationship with media in an information-saturated culture. Gillmor writes, “Mediactivity is a lifetime practice, a collection of principles and skills that we keep learning and tweaking, in part because the technology and our societal norms have a way of changing, too” (p. 145). “Mediactive” would make an excellent primary or supplementary text for courses in advanced journalism, media criticism, and media’s role in society.</p>
