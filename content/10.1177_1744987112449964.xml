<p>This paper ably outlines the challenges faced by nurses making decisions in clinical practice and the dilemmas that this then poses for educators charged with helping students to proceed more safely, coherently and strategically. At the root of the educators dilemma is that the real-time process of decision-making proceeds with imperfect information, limited resource of time and is often reliant on contextual matters, such as the rapport already established with the patient. The nurse needs to establish a mix of things before the decision is finalised; that mandated as therapeutic, that which seems respectful of the patient and their wishes and that which is viable (decisions happen within an economic as well as a therapeutic context).</p>
<p>Whilst different models of decision making have been proposed within the healthcare sciences, all have their limitations. At one extreme, logical deductive reasoning approaches presume a significant amount of time to answer preliminary questions, to reach a diagnosis. Problem-based learning approaches sometimes premise that the definition of the problem is itself unproblematic. In practice, different practitioners might identify different problems, or indeed debate whether a problem (and, therefore, a need) exists at all. Approaches that model decision making on past case experience presume that practitioners are ready and able to discourse on their discoveries. In reality, within a litigation minded society, there has been less scope for this, less opportunity to examine successes as well as faults and near misses.</p>
<p>It is not surprising then that in many regards the jury is still out as educators determine how best to proceed. Certainly there is a case for raising student awareness of the risks that premature assumptions and habitual reasoning can pose. But this then raises a further question, and that concerns how best to help students to live with the uncertainty and the messiness of learning a vital skill in practice. There may then be a need to acknowledge the imperfections of clinical decision making and to accept that in some contexts (those that involve little risk of harm to the patient) best judgement is necessarily a consultative and sometimes a negotiated process. Decisions are best fit. There is arguably a need to classify different sorts of decision making that nurses engage in, those associated with risk management and those that relate more closely to the aesthetics and interpersonal nature of nursing practice. It may be necessary to adopt a ‘horses for courses’ approach to teaching then, facilitating different ways of reasoning and decision making, that relate to the purpose of the decision. Proceeding in such ways may be as important to student retention and the development of confident practitioners, as it is to improving the work that nurses do, the services that they deliver.</p>

His doctoral research was in the ways in which students learn and negotiate support. He has a long standing interest in practice reasoning used by nurses and other healthcare professionals and is the co author (with Anne Harrington) of <italic>Critical thinking and writing for nursing students</italic> (Learning Matters: 2010). His other interests are in practice skill analysis and the use of patient and practitioner narratives to further the development of more person centred healthcare.
