<abstract>
<p>Over the last few years, intersectionality has become not only one of the most prominent topics of feminist theory in Europe, but also one of its most serious challenges, pressing us to acknowledge that European nations are not homogeneous entities and calling for more complex accounts of gender relations and forms of gender injustice. Currently, many scholars embrace intersectionality as a concept, but there is no consensus about what adequate theoretical accounts of intersectionality with regard to European contexts should look like. Drawing on theoretical positions that have been put forward within the current intersectionality debate in German-speaking countries, this article addresses two questions that are currently at stake: the what-question of intersectionality, asking what it is, which forms of inequality we focus on as intersecting; and the how-question of intersectionality, focusing on how we should conceptualize what is happening when forms of inequality intersect.</p>

<p>Intersectionality, which refers to the assessment of different forms of inequality in conjunction, is one of the most prominent topics of current feminist theory in many European countries, including Germany. It is also one of its most serious challenges, for it presses us to acknowledge that European nations are not homogeneous entities and calls for complex accounts of gender relations and of gender-related forms of injustice. One might even say that the intersectionality paradigm is in the process of moving from the margins of feminist theory to its centre,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1350506811434666">1</xref></sup> thus transforming European gender studies to something like diversity studies or intersectionality studies – a process that is being welcomed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350506811434666">Davis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350506811434666">Lewis, 2009</xref>) as well as problematized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350506811434666">Erel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350506811434666">Rendtorff, 2008</xref>). Compared to the North American academy, from where the concept of intersectionality has travelled, this development seems to have taken off rather belatedly, though. While the feminist theory mainstream west of the Atlantic has been described as focusing on ‘multiple intersecting differences’ since around 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350506811434666">Fraser, 1997</xref>: 180), for many countries in continental Europe, and particularly for Germany, the same can be said only 15–20 years later. And even now, it is fiercely debated what this new emphasis means and implies. According to Kathy Davis, intersectionality is therefore primarily a ‘buzzword’. But she suggests that precisely ‘the vagueness and open-endedness’ of the term was ‘the very secret to its success’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350506811434666">Davis, 2008</xref>: 69). By forcing feminist scholars to raise new questions and to explore uncharted territory, it encouraged complexity, stimulated creativity and avoided premature closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350506811434666">Davis, 2008</xref>: 79).</p>
<p>During the last few years, various attempts at answering these new questions have been undertaken – on both sides of the Atlantic. Many of these answers were put forward by scholars who engage in empirical research, often within the social sciences. This holds true for Leslie McCall, whose differentiation between anti-, intra-, as well as intercategorical approaches to intersectionality has in fact already gained canonical status in the new realm of intersectionality scholarship; McCall embraces intercategorical approaches for conducting quantitative research on wage inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350506811434666">McCall, 2005</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1350506811434666">2</xref></sup> But the tendency to theorize intersectionality with an eye on issues of operationalizability, for addressing intersectionality as ‘theory/methodology’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350506811434666">Gail Lewis (2009</xref>: 209) has named this tendency, is noticeable in many other recent contributions to the debate, as well. It is prevalent in encompassing, book-length accounts of intersectionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1350506811434666">Lykke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1350506811434666">Weber, 2010</xref>) as well as in shorter pieces that address particular issues like equality policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1350506811434666">Marx Ferree, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1350506811434666">Verloo, 2006</xref>) and human rights policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1350506811434666">Yuval-Davis, 2006</xref>), or that focus on particular methods like the analysis of narrative interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350506811434666">Buitelaar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1350506811434666">Ludvig, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1350506811434666">Prins, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, intersectional methodology is applied to disciplines and sub-disciplines beyond gender studies, like the study of social and political inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1350506811434666">Walby, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1350506811434666">Weldon, 2006</xref>), legal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350506811434666">Grabham et al., 2009</xref>), qualitative and quantitative politics research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350506811434666">Hancock, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350506811434666">2007b</xref>) as well as political science subfields like electoral analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350506811434666">García Bedolla and Scola, 2006</xref>) and policy analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350506811434666">Hankivksy and Cormier, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Ann Phoenix and Pamela Pattynama have characterized such contributions with a strong focus on methodology as helpful for refuting of what they had identified as ‘a recurrent criticism of intersectionality – that it does not have any methods associated with it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1350506811434666">2006</xref>: 189). Some of these contributions even go a step further than that, though – they don’t restrict themselves to identifying methods that fit the basic premises and insights of intersectionality, but rather think about ways in which intersectionality can ‘be integrated into mainstream social science ways of conducting research and building knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1350506811434666">Kaur Dhamoon, 2010</xref>: 230).</p>
<p>The current German debate on intersectionality, which the subsequent considerations are based and mostly focused on, is following a different logic. Several positions on intersectionality that have been put forward recently are rather attempts at theorizing the new paradigm of intersectionality itself than efforts to apply intersectional insights to established disciplines, sub-disciplines and research areas. So what is it that is suggested and discussed in this light? Which questions are raised, which conceptual territory is explored?</p>
<p>In what follows, I address and discuss two questions that I hold to be of central concern for current considerations on intersectionality in German gender studies. Furthermore, I present some answers to these questions that I hold to be of interest for the debate outside of the Germanophone context, as well. First, I address the what-question of intersectionality, asking what it is, which forms of inequality it is that we focus on as intersecting. Then, I proceed to the how-question of intersectionality, focusing on how we should conceptualize what is happening when forms of inequality intersect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1350506811434666">3</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section1-1350506811434666">
<title>The what-question of intersectionality</title>
<p>Even though German feminism has a rather long tradition of looking at issues of class and gender in conjunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1350506811434666">Marx Ferree, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1350506811434666">Walgenbach, 2007</xref>), intersectionality in Germany and the other Germanophone countries is mostly seen as a conceptual import from US and – even though to a lesser degree – British black feminism and their respective foci on the interplays of racism, sexism and social inequality. There are various references to the 1977 Combahee River Collective Statement, especially its claim that ‘racial, sexual, heterosexual, and class oppression . . . are interlocking’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350506811434666">Combahee River Collective, 2000</xref>: 272). Furthermore, works by US writers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350506811434666">bell hooks (1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350506811434666">1984</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350506811434666">Audre Lorde (1984)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350506811434666">Patricia Hill Collins (1991)</xref> are variously referred to. Concerning Britain, earlier texts by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350506811434666">Hazel Carby (1982)</xref> and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1350506811434666">Nira Yuval-Davis (1997)</xref> are usually mentioned. Finally, there are publications from Germanophone countries themselves which are taken to be important for the integration of intersectional insights into the core of German feminism – most famously, an edited volume on the history of Afro-German women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1350506811434666">Oguntoye et al., 1986</xref>), but also a statement of a group of feminist migrants that explains why and in which way they see their own situation and struggle as different from those of black feminists in Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350506811434666">FeMigra, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The term intersectionality itself, though, is mainly traced back to critical race theorist Kimberle Crenshaw’s famous 1989 essay, ‘Demarginalizing the intersection of race and sex: A black feminist critique of antidiscrimination doctrine, feminist theory and antiracist politics’, in which Crenshaw compares the discrimination of African-American women to traffic at an intersection. In a much-cited section of this article she claims:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Discrimination, like traffic through an intersection, may flow in one direction, and it may flow in another. If an accident happens in an intersection, it can be caused by cars traveling from a number of directions and, sometimes, from all of them. Similarly, if a Black woman is harmed because she is in the intersection, her injury could result from sex discrimination or race discrimination. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350506811434666">Crenshaw, 1989</xref>: 149)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Using this image, Crenshaw has been advocating change concerning how courts deal with discrimination cases. According to her analysis, the US legal system has adequate mechanisms to deal with <italic>either</italic> sex discrimination – but then taking white women as the norm – <italic>or</italic> with ‘race’ discrimination, but then taking men of colour as the norm. Going through several cases in which the discrimination of black women in the labour market was not addressed because of this one-dimensional either/or logic, Crenshaw has argued that without serious rethinking, black women would slip through the grid of anti-discrimination legislation. Furthermore, she has argued for a combined and intersectional treatment of issues of racism and sexism in feminist theory as well as in black liberation politics.</p>
<p>What is noteworthy is that even though the origins of intersectionality in black feminism and feminist critical race theory are widely referred to in the German debate, intersectionality is usually used in a much broader way than its roots might suggest. It is used as a relational term, which denotes that various forms of inequality have something to do with each other, rather than as a concept referring to the triad of race/class/gender that has been put forward by black feminism, or to the pair race/gender that is central to Crenshaw’s work. The notion’s most important insight is usually seen in the conceptual complexity that it promises, a complexity that seems to allow us to capture the central aspects of the somewhat simpler and, at its core, additive concept of ‘triple oppression’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1350506811434666">Viehmann et al., 1993</xref>) without having to reproduce the shortcomings of this conceptual precursor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1350506811434666">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the basic insight of intersectionality is held to be conceptual complexity, it comes as no surprise that the what-question of intersectionality – which refers to what it is that we look at when we do intersectional research – is highly contested. And there are at least two more factors for why in the German case it is not self-evident which content is to be studied and which forms of inequality and categories of difference receive the focus when intersectional research is done.</p>
<p>The first factor refers to context. When writers and activists at the margins of German feminism started addressing racism and racist exclusion in- and outside the women’s movement, they have not always referred to forms of racism that make use of ‘racial’ differentiations – they have also referred to forms of ‘racism without races’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350506811434666">Balibar, 1991</xref>: 21), to cultural or differentialist forms of racism that work with reference to notions of national belonging as well as to religion. Furthermore, the term ‘race’ itself has only recently been reintroduced into liberal public discourse and its use remains contested.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1350506811434666">5</xref></sup> For these reasons, scholars whose intersectional work includes forms of racism usually specify whether notions of ‘race’, ethnicity, nationality, or religion are relevant to their particular project. Nevertheless, there is no consensus with regard to the respective appropriateness and the mutual substitutability of these terms and categories. In some accounts they are grouped together, but in other accounts they are taken to be the basis of different forms of racism and therefore as in need of being addressed independently from each other. Accordingly, they are employed in intersectional analyses in very differing ways, as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1350506811434666">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second factor for why it is not self-evident <italic>what</italic> is to be addressed when intersectionality is addressed is connected to timing. First of all, the ‘import’ of the concept of intersectionality more or less coincided with the passing of Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz (AGG, German anti-discrimination law), in compliance with EU regulations. This legislation aims at preventing or abolishing discrimination related to <italic>six</italic> different categories or rather sets of categories, namely race or ethnicity, gender, religion or belief, disability, age, as well as sexual identity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bundesrecht.juris.de/agg/">bundesrecht.juris.de/agg/</ext-link>). This list clearly goes beyond the aforementioned triad of race, class and gender – and it does so in an agenda-setting way. For at least in the empirical branches of the social sciences, diversity and intersectionality research is often policy oriented and therefore refers to the new legislation and the categories it put forward; the same can be said for the public debate on multiple forms of discrimination and anti-discrimination that the passing of AGG has initiated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the import of intersectionality took place at a time when various forms of minority studies, or rather critique-of-normality studies like queer theory and disability studies, had already started to proliferate. Scholars engaged in these projects are usually <italic>not</italic> driven by the new anti-discrimination legislation, and in fact often question whether the problems they address can be solved by legal means. But what they clearly do is focus on issues beyond race, class and gender; and as they often do it with a link to gender studies, they do it in an intersectional way (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350506811434666">Dietze et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350506811434666">Hartmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1350506811434666">Waldschmidt, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>So, given this background, what is it that is debated concerning the what-question of intersectionality? One of the open questions most vividly discussed concerns the criteria for the selection of those sets of differences that are held to be the most relevant to intersectional analyses. I would like to mention two opposing positions in this regard. Cornelia Klinger and Gudrun-Axeli Knapp, two very influential contributors to the German debate, work on intersectionality from a background in social theory. Combining nominalist and critical realist considerations, they focus on what they take to be the most relevant ‘structural causes of inequality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1350506811434666">Knapp and Klinger, 2008</xref>: 7, my translation). Thus, they have identified ‘class, race, and gender’ or ‘the structural categories capitalism, patriarchy, and nationalism (including ethnocentrism and colonialism/imperialism)’ as those forms of inequality that, at least with regard to Europe, impose themselves as the main themes of an intersectional social theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1350506811434666">Klinger, 2008</xref>: 42, 54, my translation; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350506811434666">Knapp, 2008</xref>). According to Klinger and Knapp, such an intersectional theory of society and inequality is superior to pre-intersectional social theories, which often focus on economic factors and social status alone and are therefore unable to grasp crucial aspects of the complexity and dynamics of prevalent forms and configurations of inequality and thus of social reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350506811434666">Klinger and Knapp, 2007</xref>: 20–21).</p>
<p>Philosophers Katrin Meyer and Patricia Purtschert, on the other hand, are highly sceptical of any attempt to write an intersectional theory of European modernity and, by this means, to answer the what-question <italic>academically</italic> instead of leaving it to constant <italic>political</italic> contestation. They conceptualize categories of difference as power effects that emerge in the interplay of oppression and its critique. Therefore, to them, the openness of the what-question, which implies the continual opportunity to introduce new categories into the realm of the political, is something like a strategic end in itself, since it allows the constant construction of new political alliances. In this light, they assess the openness of the what-question in intersectional research as one of the constitutive strengths of this new field of studies, rather than as a weakness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1350506811434666">Meyer and Purtschert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1350506811434666">Purtschert and Meyer, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>But even if one stresses the usefulness of the attempt to academically answer the what-question in a theoretically and empirically plausible way, as Klinger and Knapp do, it seems unlikely that it is possible to prevent conflict around the answers. If, for instance, one uses a framework that – drawing on the work of Michel Foucault – focuses on processes of normalization (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1350506811434666">Waldschmidt, 2004</xref>), issues of gender, sexuality, health and ability are likely to be the most relevant. But these clearly differ from those on the list that Knapp and Klinger have produced. Why these categories or rather their intersecting dynamics are historically less relevant than those of the triad of race, class and gender, is something that had to be shown. But even if this was possible – say, with reference to European societies – it was unclear which benefit such a distinction would amount to. Even if for a given context we might be able to distinguish stronger from weaker structural causes of inequality, this would not imply that the weaker ones were not of possibly high significance. Therefore, the degree of historical relevance might not be a helpful yardstick for answering the what-question. It rather seems that normative and theoretical preferences as well as particular research interests determine which sets of categories are taken as most relevant for intersectional projects. In this light, I suggest to consider the what-question as essentially contested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350506811434666">Gallie, 1956</xref>). This implies that any attempt to answer it once and for all is likely to be challenged and met with alternative attempts; because it is not possible to come up with a solution that is not likely to cause rightful or justifiable disagreement. This does by no means imply that such contestation is futile – what is rendered futile by this perspective on the what-question of intersectionality are rather all attempts to <italic>end</italic> such contestation.</p>
<p>I would like to argue that there is a partial way out of the debate around the what-question, though. It stems from intersectionality research in US political science, where scholars more and more move away from centring their studies on a particular social group which is held to be significantly affected by a specific set of categories; instead, they more and more engage in intersectional assessments of political processes and constellations. Ange-Marie Hancock, the most important initiator of this shift, calls the former approach, which she advocates to overcome or at least to supplement, a content-based specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350506811434666">Hancock, 2007a</xref>: 249). When talking about content specialization, Hancock refers to scholarship that focuses on the situation of a specific group of multiply marginalized people – like ‘black women writers, Asian-American female elected officials, or Latin-American women’s movements’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350506811434666">Hancock, 2007a</xref>: 249) – aiming at including them into existing frameworks, which are challenged in the course of that process. An example of this is in fact Crenshaw’s work, which focuses on African-American women and the way in which their experiences of discrimination challenge anti-discrimination legislation. When Hancock argues that US intersectionality research should continue its move <italic>beyond</italic> a content specialization, she refers to the field’s broadening into a body of normative theory and empirical research, which is attentive to complex causalities with regard to all sorts of social processes and patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350506811434666">Hancock, 2007a</xref>: 251–252). An intersectional analysis following this second model would not necessarily focus on a particular group of people but could assess a specific issue or problem, such as the provision of childcare in any given town or city. The researcher could look at the ways in which childcare provision in a particular location is gendered, ethnicized and racialized, but also at the ways in which it reproduces or challenges heteronormativity, how class differentiations come into play, or how religion and nationality are negotiated. What is important to note is that the social groups that are looked at in the course of such a study are not pregiven, but dependent on the concrete situation that is assessed. Similarly, the what-question of intersectionality, the question about which categories to focus on, would be answered ex-post and case by case – even though here, too, a preconception of such categories remains necessary.</p>

<sec id="section2-1350506811434666">
<title>The how-question of intersectionality</title>
<p>Especially when intersectional analyses are planned and undertaken in a problem-based mode, it is all but self-evident <italic>how</italic>, with regard to which aspects, intersectionality should be conceptualized – so here, the how-question of intersectionality comes in. ‘Are feminist theorists pointing to intersections of social structures, or of historical meanings, or of political power relations? Is intersection discursive or institutional or a matter of concrete localized practices?’, US philosopher Ladelle McWhorter asked a few years ago, finding fault with the plurality of planes of reference that she identified in intersectionality scholarship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350506811434666">McWhorter, 2004</xref>: 38). In the German discussion, it seemed until recently that with regard to the how-question there were two camps. One camp was dominated by scholars working within the various disciplines of the humanities who did intersectional studies focusing on issues like language or the effects of categorical differentiations; but even though these studies had a very particular ‘cultural’ focus, their authors claimed that they were of eminent social relevance, as well (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1350506811434666">Walgenbach et al., 2007</xref>). By contrast, the other camp, which united mostly social theorists and social scientists, claimed that the debate should not be reduced to identity issues and patterns of discrimination (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350506811434666">Klinger, 2003</xref>: 15; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350506811434666">Klinger and Knapp, 2007</xref>: 36). People in this camp argued that after the cultural turn that had shaped feminist theory in the 1990s, what was needed for the future and also with regard to intersectional analyses was a ‘social (re)turn’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350506811434666">Klinger, 2003</xref>: 24), a renewed emphasis on social structures.</p>
<p>Lately, there are more and more attempts to go beyond these two options and to think of ways in which intersectionality can be conceptualized in a multi-level way, roughly distinguishing a micro-, meso- and a macrodimension.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1350506811434666">7</xref></sup> With regard to German scholarship, sociologists Nina Degele and Gabriele Winker are among those who have developed such an approach. The book-length version of their work was the first book in German to be titled <italic>Intersektionalität</italic> and quickly gained much attention – in English, a shorter account of this multi-level approach to the what-question was published in this journal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1350506811434666">Winker and Degele, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>With reference to the work of Pierre Bourdieu, Degele and Winker have suggested addressing the intersectionality of ‘classism, heteronormativism, racism, and bodyism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350506811434666">Degele and Winker, 2008</xref>: 195, my translation) or, in a later version, of class, gender, race and body, in a praxeological way – and to analyse it on the levels of identity construction, social structure and representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1350506811434666">Winker and Degele, 2009</xref>). As far as method is concerned, they work on the basis of qualitative interviews with social actors. Hence, the basic reference points of their analysis are identity claims that actors formulate with regard to themselves, including statements concerning structures and norms that they make recourse to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350506811434666">Degele and Winker, 2008</xref>: 198; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1350506811434666">Winker and Degele, 2009</xref>: 63–67, 79–96). In other words, the key to their analysis are statements about the relevance of particular structural and representational elements for individuals’ understandings of themselves and their life situation, and these statements are gathered through narrative interviews.</p>
<p>Beginning at the identity level, Degele and Winker intend to provide theoretical means that help reveal and undo mechanisms that produce and stabilize structures of inequality as well as naturalized stereotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350506811434666">Degele and Winker, 2008</xref>: 206–207). And they have indeed developed a methodology that helps us to overcome simplified notions about the problems and concerns of particular social groups, especially of marginalized groups. Analysing interviews with a diverse set of people who were unemployed, for instance, they identified four very distinct themes that were mentioned as relevant to the experience of unemployment. First, the control over the bodily self – fear concerning the loss of such control to institutions connected to the welfare system was mentioned as a predominant preoccupation with regard to unemployment by a person engaged in drug-related sex work, by a mother of two who was also an alcoholic and by a freelancer who used to be a psychiatric patient. Second, overcoming bureaucratic barriers was mentioned as a prime concern – in this case, the unemployed who were interviewed were migrants. The third issue mentioned in the interviews was the wish for social participation, a desire for a stake in society. The association of unemployment with social isolation and the loss of social rights was predominantly voiced by male interviewees. Finally, the fourth aspect is the search for financial security; two interviewees – an artist and a political activist – did not describe their state of unemployment as being without work, but as being without an income and were mainly concerned with how they could financially back their activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350506811434666">Degele and Winker, 2008</xref>: 202–203; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1350506811434666">Winker and Degele, 2011</xref>: 60–61).</p>
<p>This differentiation of concerns connected to unemployment clearly demonstrates that the experience and the meaning given to being without wage labour can differ considerably, and that a diverse group of interviewees is likely to produce a diverse list of predominant issues connected to it. Nevertheless, I would argue that as an approach to study intersectionality in a three-dimensional way, Degele’s and Winker’s account is too dependent on the level of identity construction. The intersections that they can highlight using their method are only those that the interviewees themselves are aware of and mention in their accounts of themselves, and of what they hold as shaping their lives – intersections on the levels of social structure and of representation are addressed and assessed only via the level of identity and thus merely indirectly. Furthermore, it remains somewhat unclear what intersectionality exactly means in Degele and Winker’s account – apart from their conceptual statement that there were various interrelations between, rather than the addition of, categories of inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1350506811434666">Winker and Degele, 2009</xref>: 14); and other than the finding that empirically, there might always be various and unforeseen connections between the three levels at which they assess forms of inequality. And this openness with regard to the meaning and implications of intersectionality holds for their account of intersectionality theory, as well. In the theory chapter of their book <italic>Intersektionalität</italic>, Degele and Winker assess the implications of class, gender, race and body with regard to the levels of structural domination, symbolic representation and identity construction. They hardly address ways in which these four categories intersect, though. Rather, they point to their similarities – namely, that in capitalist systems they contribute to exploitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1350506811434666">Winker and Degele, 2009</xref>: 51–53). So there is a certain vagueness with regard to how Degele and Winker answer the how-question of intersectionality. They do provide a model for a three-dimensional analysis of social inequality that begins with narrative interviews, but they abstain from any attempt at <italic>theorizing</italic> possible intersections of the four forms of inequality with regard to the three levels that they have differentiated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1350506811434666">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>I what follows I try to show that my own multidimensional answer to the how-question, which I have developed in my previous work on racism and sexism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1350506811434666">Kerner, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350506811434666">2009b</xref>), goes a step further in this regard. Different from Degele and Winker, I use Michel Foucault’s analytics of power as a starting point; furthermore, I claim that concepts of intersectionality do not suffice to give us a full account of the relation of racism and sexism – because apart from such intersections, similarities, differences as well as links between these complex phenomena can be traced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350506811434666">Kerner, 2009b</xref>: 310–376). So what exactly is intersectionality? Drawing on Foucault’s descriptions of how power-knowledge is inscribed and becomes manifest in institutional patterns and how both discourses and the effects of institutional setups affect processes of subject formation, I suggest a three-dimensional account that heuristically differentiates an epistemic, an institutional and a personal dimension of racism, sexism, as well as of their intersections – holding that the three dimensions interrelate and can mutually reinforce and reproduce each other. The epistemic dimension refers to discourses and knowledge, but also includes images and symbols. The institutional dimension refers to institutional settings that cause structural forms of stratification, discrimination and exclusion and affect the distribution of structural privileges. Finally, the personal dimension – the term personal referring to ‘person’ rather than meaning ‘private’ – refers to attitudes and/or perceptions, but also to the identity and/or subjectivity of people; both of those who belong to dominant and those who belong to minoritized social groups along the spectrum of gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, nationality and religion; furthermore, it refers to interpersonal actions and interactions. When suggesting that the three dimensions interrelate and possibly reinforce and reproduce one another, I mean that gendered racist discourse, for instance, can be inscribed in institutions, which then might produce discriminating effects; it can also have effects on processes of subject formation, which might lead to the reproduction of more gendered racist discourse, or to racist and/or sexists acts with effects on subjects, but also on institutions, etc. Among the effects of holding that the relation between the three dimensions is one of multiple interrelations, is the impossibility to grasp racism and sexism by looking at – or attempting to change – only phenomena relating to one dimension by itself; even though I would not argue that such looking and attempts cannot be of major value.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1350506811434666">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>So how can this distinction be applied to intersections of racism and sexism? Concerning the epistemic dimension, intersectionality can be said to imply the existence of gendered racial norms and of racialized gender norms – so here, intersectionality means the pluralization and internal differentiation of common diversity categories, similarly to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350506811434666">Leslie McCall (2005)</xref> has named intracategorical complexity. Stereotypes and gender norms that, for instance, black or Muslim women might have do deal with usually differ from both those pertaining to women of other ‘racial’, ethnic, or religious backgrounds and from those pertaining to black or Muslim men. To give an example of differing female stereotypes: in Germany, white, Christian or secular middle-class women are often portrayed as not having enough children, and if they have any, that they should not become so-called ‘raven mothers’ who do not care for their infants themselves but use daycare provisions or employ other women to care for their children – while Muslim working-class women are said to have too many children and not to be interested in anything else than a domestic live. Muslim women wearing the headscarf are often victimized by the assumption that the headscarf is a symbol of female oppression and of a women-unfriendly religion and culture; by contrast, the role attributed to Muslim men in this logic of othering, or more precisely the Islamization of sexism, is not that of victim, but rather that of sexist oppressor. So here we have an example of how racist ascriptions regarding a religious group can differ internally with regard to gender. Such ascriptions as well as the living conditions and social positions they refer to are often hierarchized. But such hierarchies need to be assessed empirically, since they might differ from case to case. Other than additive models of multiple oppression, which usually involve generalized claims about the configuration of such hierarchies, the conceptually more tentative point of intersectionality theory is the indication that such ascriptions differ from each other.</p>
<p>With regard to the institutional dimension, intersectionality amounts to a complex interplay of institutional settings; concerning, for instance, the labour market, migration regulations and family life. Its effects include the continued feminization of housework in many societies, despite rising labour market participation of middle- and upper-class women. Even in those economically well-off heterosexual families that do not reproduce the breadwinner/housewife model but follow dual-career paths, housework often does not get internally redistributed but rather externalized – and those who are employed to do it, often under precarious conditions, are oftentimes female migrants. The externalization might seem <italic>necessary</italic> to a particular family, because career jobs often come with extensive office hours. And the externalization might be <italic>financially possible</italic> for a particular family because they do not pay any benefits. That there are people, mostly women, who are willing to undertake work in private households under such conditions might be related to the difficulties in obtaining a proper work permit that many migrants in a country like Germany face. So in this example, specific settings referring to the organization of labour combine with particular regulations concerning migration and with ways of organizing family life and the domestic division of labour to produce certain effects. And these effects might not be restricted to a continuous feminization of domestic labour, but could be taken to also include the creation of an informal, precarious and ‘migrantized’ domestic labour market as well as the delay of a serious reconsideration and reform of formal and informal regulations concerning normal working hours for those who are regularly employed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1350506811434666">10</xref></sup> All in all, we can say that with regard to the intersectionality of racism and sexism, the institutional dimension of intersectionality amounts to the interplay or interlocking of institutional racism with institutional sexism.</p>
<p>Finally, concerning the personal dimension, intersectionality means, among other aspects, processes of subject or identity formation with multiple intersecting reference points – processes that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350506811434666">Encarnación Gutiérrez Rodríguez (1999</xref>: 205) has helpfully called ‘gendered ethnicization’. Studying processes of identity formation of women who have migrated to Germany, Gutiérrez Rodríguez has shown that the personal formation of a gender identity always implies processes of ethnicization – because gender norms do not come in ethnically neutral forms. Whether individuals experienced their ethnicization as such would furthermore depend on their societal position; members of ethnic minorities would be perceived as more ethnic, or ethnically distinct, than members of ethnic majorities. What is relevant about this for thinking about the personal dimension of intersections of racism and sexism is the fact that we cannot clearly separate processes of gender identity formation from processes of racial or ethnic identity formation – they are intertwined.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1350506811434666">11</xref></sup> Something similar can be said about individual and collective action, including political action. Here, action based on claims concerning gender relations often has racial or ethnic implications, as well – likewise, action based on claims concerning racial or ethnic relations can have gender implications. Politics engaged in the othering of sexism, the claim that other groups are more sexist than one’s own group, are a case in point – and it does not matter whether these politics are feminist or not. In fact, conservative forces and radical feminists or gay and lesbian rights activists often meet when, for instance, Muslim communities in European countries are said to generally suppress women and homosexuals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1350506811434666">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>So what are the conceptual benefits of multidimensional accounts of intersectionality with regard to the how-question? I would argue that first of all, they point to the limits of one-dimensional answers to it – since the multidimensional answers are more nuanced. My own suggestion with regard to the intersectionality of racism and sexism implies counting with pluralized difference and diversity categories, norms and ascriptions, with forms of institutional interlocking with differentializing and hierarchizing effects, as well as with multifaceted forms of identity formation and with multiple implications of (political) action. Furthermore, I suggest supposing that there can be interrelations and mutual reinforcements between aspects pertaining to the three dimensions. Assuming that the different dimensions of intersectionality possibly interrelate gives us a reason to abstain from analyses that focus on issues like language, the effects of categorical differentiations, identity issues, patterns of discrimination, or social structures alone; and if we nevertheless undertake such studies, to abstain from assuming that they provide us with a complete account of how intersectionality works and becomes relevant.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The Germanophone debates on the what- and the how-question of intersectionality, the question about <italic>what</italic> it is that we focus on as intersecting, on the one hand, and the question of <italic>how</italic> we can conceptualize what happens when forms of inequality intersect, on the other hand, have one aspect in common: they demonstrate that the buzzword of intersectionality stands for very different issues and accommodates very different approaches – and that its contestedness is unlikely to ever go away, regardless of how well established the paradigm will become in mainstream scholarship. Therefore, gender studies as the primary ‘guardian’ of the new concept of intersectionality should not only focus on giving it a sound methodology. They should also keep assessing what of intersectionality is being mainstreamed and how that is being done – to be able to outline, if needed, which of the paradigm’s insights and impulses might be lost in that process.</p>

<p>In 1984, US feminist bell hooks published her landmark work on feminist theory, <italic>Feminist Theory from Margin to Center</italic>. In this book, she problematized that much feminist theory emerged from the experiences of ‘privileged women who live at the center’ and argued that feminist theory therefore lacked wholeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350506811434666">hooks, 1984</xref>: x). Do reverse this lack, she strongly advocated the integration of perspectives of women and men who live at the margin, especially black people. Feminism would thereby become broader and more complex. hooks described an enlarged feminism as a struggle to end sexist suppression and therefore as a struggle ‘to eradicate the ideology of domination that permeates Western culture on various levels as well as a commitment to reorganizing society so that the self-development of people can take precedence over imperialism, economic expansion, and material desires’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350506811434666">hooks, 1984</xref>: 24). In which ways current ‘mainstream’ intersectionality research is a realization of hooks’ ideas, remains an open question.</p>

<p>There is a particular German concept of ‘triple oppression’ that, having being developed in West Germany’s radical left engaging with US black feminism, had a certain prominence there for a while. It had reached feminist theory in that country, or rather its margins, long before the current intersectionality discourse ever started. At its core, the concept constructs parallels between the three forms of oppression, despite the use of the multiplication metaphor.

<p>The term ‘race’ has been reintroduced into liberal public and critical academic discourse via debates on anti-discrimination legislation like the AGG, where the term is used, and through the reception of race and ethnicity studies scholarship from the US and Great Britain. With regard to legal texts, including the constitution, the German Institute for Human Rights has repeatedly suggested to replace formulations like ‘discrimination because of race’ by formulations like ‘racist discrimination’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.institut-fuer-menschenrechte.de/de/presseverteiler/pressemitteilung-menschenrechtsinstitut-begriff-rasse-im-grundgesetz-durch-rassistisch-ersetzen.html">www.institut-fuer-menschenrechte.de/de/presseverteiler/pressemitteilung-menschenrechtsinstitut-begriff-rasse-im-grundgesetz-durch-rassistisch-ersetzen.html</ext-link>).

<p>As is shown below, Cornelia Klinger is an author who employs rather broad difference categories in her intersectional work; she refers, for instance, to ‘nationalism (including ethnocentrism and colonialism/imperialism)’ where in US analyses one would mostly find the terms ‘race’ or ‘racism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1350506811434666">Klinger, 2008</xref>: 54). Helma Lutz and Norbert Wenning, on the other hand, have produced a list of 13 bipolar difference categories that can possibly be employed in intersectional studies; concerning issues of racism, the list contains the seven separate categories of ‘race’/skin color, ethnicity, nation/state, culture, sedentarism/origin, north–south/east–west as well as stage of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1350506811434666">Lutz and Wenning, 2001</xref>: 20).</p>

<p>A prominent example for such an account from the US would be Evelyn Nakano Glenn’s framework concerning the social construction and institutionalization of gender and race, where she distinguishes the levels of representation, micro-interaction and social structure in order to understand the ways in which gender and race are mutually constituted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350506811434666">Glenn, 1999</xref>).

<p>A similar framework has been put forward by US sociologist and black feminist Patricia Hill Collins, who has suggested analysing what she calls the ‘matrix of domination’, which is any given society’s specific organization of hierarchical power relations. According to Collins, every matrix of domination consists of a particular arrangement of intersecting systems of oppression and a particular organization of its power domains. Matrices of domination embrace four different kinds of aspects: structural aspects, like laws and policies of institutions; disciplinary aspects, which refer to bureaucratic hierarchies and techniques of surveillance; hegemonic aspects, or ideas and ideologies; and finally interpersonal aspects, discriminatory practices of everyday lived experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350506811434666">Collins, 2000</xref>: 289–290). From the perspective that I employ, the distinction between structural and disciplinary aspects of domination is conceptually unnecessary – for both aspects are institutional, and in fact, bureaucracies and surveillance techniques often rely on laws, policies and institutions. Nevertheless, I hold Collins’ work as explicitly helpful for the task of thinking about what intersectionality might imply with reference to the three dimensions of racism and sexism, because the insights she presents with reference to her four aspects can easily be matched to my three dimensions, as well.</p>
