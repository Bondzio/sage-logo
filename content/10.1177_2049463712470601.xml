<p>I am very aware of the strong association between back pain and controversy so I am assuming that the management of patients diagnosed with ‘failed back surgery syndrome’ (FBSS) would elicit a spectrum of views about what is the most appropriate management of this group of patients from the multidisciplinary team. I can hear the pencils being sharpened as I type.</p>
<p>Thanks are due to Dr Sam Eldabe, British Pain Society Council member, for helping to commission articles for this themed issue, which focuses on FBSS. We are pleased to publish some original research in this issue from Puvan Tharmanathan and colleagues from the York Trials Unit, who have mapped the diagnosis of and provision of care for patients with FBSS using a cross-sectional survey of specialist pain clinics. Stephan Schild von Spannenberg from the University of Bremen in Germany together with Gareth Jones and Gary Macfarlane from the University of Aberdeen have written a review that explores the evidence base for managing lower back pain in older people. Also this month we have an opinion piece from Andrew Lucas, who leads the health psychology department at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in Stanmore. Andrew proposes that it is time to discard the term FBSS as it is not helpful to either the surgeon or the patient.</p>
<p>Also this month I am pleased to report that we have published the abstracts from the September 2012 meeting of the Interventional Pain Management Special Interest Group (SIG), which was held in Manchester. I hope that publishing this set of abstracts will encourage other SIG committees to consider publishing theirs.</p>
<p>A recent meeting with our publisher, SAGE, provided an opportunity to learn more about who is accessing the <italic>British Journal of Pain</italic> online (UK readers lead the way, followed by US, Australian, Indian and then Canadian readers), what the top 20 downloaded articles were (not surprisingly opioids featured very strongly) and citation comparisons made against competing titles. I am pleased to report that the <italic>British Journal of Pain</italic> will remain an open-access journal until at least the end of 2013 and that articles are often available online prior to hard copy publication.

<p>I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to the success of the first year of the <italic>British Journal of Pain</italic>, with special thanks to the reviewers, contributors and production team. Not forgetting the readers, of course.</p>
