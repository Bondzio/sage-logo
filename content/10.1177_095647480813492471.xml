<p><italic>Innovation in technology allows a single citizen to reach out to millions of people without the mediation of professional media</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Does journalism still require training or is anyone with an opinion and a publishing platform now a reporter? Coverage of the Boston bombings in April has given us a clearer idea of the successes and failures of “citizen journalism”. It has also demonstrated the uneasy relationship between social and mainstream media, with at least one newspaper accused of joining the social media frenzy in publishing pictures of alleged suspects without the evidence to do so.</p>
<p><italic>Samaritans with smartphones:</italic> First, let us look at the conditions that have given citizen journalists their opportunity. Two things currently define the potential – the internet and smartphone. The internet needs no introduction – masses of information at the fingertips of most people (and, in Boston, practically all of the people) with wide-open accessibility to any information posted.</p>
<p>Next the smartphone, a source of glee to its owner, a customisable utility with a camera's eye, whose range of add-ons or apps benefits from a massively competitive marketplace. Those apps that become most popular tend to have a social function, including a “self-publishing” platform, such as statuses for Facebook or tweets in Twitter. Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram – all allow self-expression with social interaction. A golden rule of any incoming apps today is – make it social. To-do lists (Wunderlist), screen-grabbing (Glui) and bookmarking apps (Pocket) all have tagged-on share or social functions incorporated. Moreover, everyone has a camera – and the ability to send pictures immediately.</p>
<p>With so much sharing of information across so many platforms, it is no wonder that events such as the Boston bombings reach millions digitally. How does this information spread? Through words, photographs and video content, mounted on a publishing platform such as Twitter or Instagram, from where it is rapidly appraised (“favourite” or “like”) and passed on (“retweet” or “share”).</p>
<p>Generally, content must be short. Twitter limits its tweets to 140 characters. Vine (a video capture app) limits the time of each video to six seconds, playing in a loop that means information is compacted but impactful. Longer content tends to appear on blogging platforms, such as Blogger or WordPress. Smartphones make all this possible at the time of the event – instant capture, sharing and interaction of information. Generally, of course, the kind of stuff that is shared is of interest only to few. In Boston the interest was great and this was no longer information going public for amusement, but information being seized on by worried family members and friends, police, emergency services and mainstream media.</p>
<p><italic>After the bombs went off:</italic> Much was captured and disseminated during the chaos of the initial hours, some of it rapidly picked up by traditional media and passed on – as we shall see – without the checks that we might expect from the professional players. Over the following hours and days we saw a host of bloggers responding to the incident. Blogging platforms such as Tumblr soon featured well-compiled photos and chronicles of the events built by amateurs. There were other measured responses, but also a large number of emotive spasms of content.</p>
<sec id="sec1-095647480813492471">
<title>Uploads included doctored stills from a movie</title>
<p>We also saw professional journalists using social feeds to inform their coverage. A good example was the Reuters Live Blog, with live but filtered coverage of what was happening that built on information from Twitter but eliminated the background noise to provide a clear, if stripped down, version of events. So what aspects of amateur coverage went well? There were fewer attempts to hoax than had occurred in connection with the last two incidents to shape social media and citizen journalism in the United States, Hurricane Sandy and the Newtown school shootings of 2012. During Hurricane Sandy, about 10 photos a second were uploaded during peak times on the photo-sharing app Instagram, while many other camera uploads went straight to Twitter. Among the multitude of accurate photos taken of the hurricane as it moved up the East Coast was a series of doctored or misrepresented photos, including screen grabs from the disaster film <italic>The Day After Tomorrow</italic>. How to differentiate? It didn't happen in Boston, possibly because there was video available, which is harder to falsify.</p>
<p>After Newtown, Twitter accounts popped up purporting to offer money for the victims in exchange for re-tweets. One received some 90,000 re-tweets before people realised it was a sick prank. A site appeared after Boston but was quickly recognised as a hoax. In Boston we saw a far greater degree of connectedness. Just as people have learned to use social media more effectively, so the authorities understood the benefits – and pitfalls – of social interaction with citizens as a means of intelligence gathering. Boston policemen tweeted praise to helpful twitterers providing information on site, and used the same medium to tell off less helpful citizens who tweeted police whereabouts during the manhunt.</p>
<p>But what about objectivity? One thing that can always be said in support of professional journalists is their belief in the need for objectivity and fact-checking. Opinions, when offered, are fenced off from news and at least informed by some semblance of the facts. After an event such as Boston we could expect a considered response from the professionals. This is not and never has been the case for citizen journalists. They have not been brought up in the traditions of the trade and they are not inhibited by the fear of losing a job. Many are happy to tweet, update their status and blog without consideration of the implications of passing on a rumour rather than a fact. Some do it even while taking to task traditional media for being biased.</p>
<p>Nowhere during Boston did this happen more frighteningly than on the social news website Reddit. Forums sprang up quickly with the goal of establishing the responsible party. Posts on the site accused a slew of (mostly Arab) men who appeared in photographs taken by citizen journalists. A young man called Sunil Tripathi – who was missing from home – was falsely identified in this vigilante hunt and became a trending topic on Twitter. One Twitter user said Tripathi was a police suspect – a claim apparently based on using Broadcastify, an online service that provides live streams of police radios.</p>
<p>News crews descended on his parents' home. After Tripathi was found drowned his family issued this sad statement: “The last 18 hours have generated tremendous and painful attention – on social media platforms Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit, as well as from television media inquiries – linking Sunil to the video-stills released by the FBI yesterday afternoon. Unequivocally, we have known that neither individual suspected as responsible for the incident in Boston was Sunil.” Another young man also found himself in the limelight, appearing on the cover of the <italic>New York Post</italic> under the headline “Bag Men”. His picture had been circulated the day before by online message boards. Critics accused the <italic>Post</italic> of publishing without bothering to check. The <italic>Post</italic> said it was merely printing a picture that had been circulating among law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>Users of Reddit listed and tracked down many more “suspects” in what critics termed a “digital witch hunt”. Many postees appeared to be driven by “internet arrogance” – the belief that the internet provides solutions to the problems the government and other agencies such as the police can't solve. Rumours have always circulated rapidly among communities – the difference now is the speed with which those rumours can reach very wide audiences, including traditional media that are anxious to run with news.</p>
<p><italic>A force for good?</italic> If swift dissemination of information appears to be the chief virtue of citizen journalism, then mob mentality and a paucity of effective filters seem to be its key vice. The number of platforms available to anyone is now so great, and the efficiency of it all so streamlined, that if you blink you will, literally, miss something. Citizen journalism is now a potent and very active force. It's a cheap accusation that citizen journalists are simply journalists that don't get paid to do it “properly” – Boston showed that there are broadcast channels and newspapers that don't do it properly as well. As some of the professional players backtracked from reports written or aired too early, it could be said that the professional sphere did not fare too much better than the amateur. If they had been doing their job properly, the information flying around internet sites would have been used in the same way as a rumour picked up from a passer-by – an item that might or might not be important, an item that needed to be investigated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-095647480813492471">
<title>Corrupt information designed to misinform</title>
<p>Certainly, we can say what citizen journalism is capable of: absolutely anything. If there's something to send out, someone will be sending it. On the up side it will be information to authorities, to friends and concerned loved ones, to the public at large. On the down side, it will be corrupt information designed to misinform, stuff that hinders the authorities because it clogs up information channels, angry people taking the opportunity to be trolls online.</p>
<p>Much will be designed to be in the first category, but, owing to mistakes, end up in the second – the kind of mistakes that professional journalists make too. What does citizen journalism mean for traditional journalism, if we dare still call it that? One of the reasons citizen reporting is so popular can be attributed to the decline in faith in traditional reporting and an increasing reliance on our own social networks for news updates. Traditional media have not been their own best press over the past two years.</p>
<p>Yet just as we have become sceptical of things we read in the professional media, so we are learning to be more suspicious of things we read online, even when they purport to be first-hand accounts. This is not a perfect world, so the reader must learn to filter the massive and valuable information this platform offers.</p>
