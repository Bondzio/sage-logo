<p>Using data from the Philippine Quality Improvement Demonstration Study, QIDS, this study evaluated the associations between General Self-Reported Health Status (GSRH) and height, weight, hemoglobin, red blood cell folate, C-reactive protein, and blood lead levels.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Two general approaches for assessing health status in population studies are commonly used. The first is self-reported subjective health status measures such as General Self-Reported Health Status (GSRH) and/or self-reported Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL). The second is objective clinical measures, or biomarkers, which provide specific clinical information on a particular disease state.</p>
<p>HRQOL and GSRH in particular have been attractive in large population-based surveys and are gaining favor in individual health assessments because of their ability to predict utilization and important health outcomes such as mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510390204">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539510390204">2</xref></sup> Self-reported health measures are single- and multi-item measures that ask individuals to rate their overall health or answer a variety of questions targeting multiple aspects of functionality or well-being. Single-item measures are known to be stable and responsive to changes in health status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539510390204">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510390204">4</xref></sup> They perform as robustly as multi-item measures of self-rated health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510390204">1</xref></sup> Others have demonstrated the predictive power of self-reported health for future morbidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539510390204">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539510390204">6</xref></sup> and functional decline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510390204">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539510390204">8</xref></sup> Moreover, the Short Form-36 (SF-36) multi-item self-rated health measure, which includes the single-item GSRH, has been found to be valid in Southeast Asian cultures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539510390204">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539510390204">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Clinicians have long relied on clinical biomarkers to measure specific health functions. Although routinely collected in the physician’s office, biomarkers have increasingly become feasible in population-based surveys, even in developing countries where obvious logistic and resource constraints make this a particular challenge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539510390204">11</xref></sup> One attraction of biomarkers is their objectivity and seeming reliability. Another is that they have been widely standardized among various populations and in different parts of the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539510390204">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the past, self-reported measures were not considered as robust as objective clinical measures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539510390204">13</xref></sup> However, self-reported measures are increasingly recognized as often more valuable predictors of health than isolated clinical biomarkers. For instance, in a study among adults in Bangladesh, self-reported health measures were better predictors of mortality than observable disability on activities of daily living.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510390204">14</xref></sup> Another study found self-reported health was significantly associated with multiple clinical measures and was a better overall predictor of diverse aspects of well-being.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539510390204">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Measuring health status and outcomes in young children is especially critical in developing countries. Resource constraints necessitate identifying high-risk individuals before embarking on expensive interventions. Such constraints also underscore the need for less costly yet effective methods of screening. It would be particularly useful to know if subjective health measures of children, especially those reported by parents, are also reliable. The existing literature focuses mostly on adults, with limited applicability to children.</p>
<p>By extension, comprehensive interventions need to be monitored and evaluated to determine if policy has the desired impact on outcomes. And since policy is concerned with both those that are sick in a health care facility and those that <italic>may</italic> become ill and potentially seek care, measurements ideally need to capture the health status of both the hospitalized and the general population. Health is therefore viewed as a continuum from being ill to being well. Accordingly it is important to look at those who have been hospitalized (in this analysis at the time of discharge) and some time postdischarge (in this analysis 4 to 10 weeks after hospitalization). Increasingly, studies have found self-reported health status to be among the most sensitive measures of health status: They are negatively affected by hospitalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539510390204">16</xref></sup> and they change over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539510390204">17</xref></sup> as health status improves. This article thus uses GSRH to directly compare assessments of health in 3 different times: in the (well) population, at the time of discharge, and at an intermediate time postdischarge.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section6-1010539510390204">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>In 2003, we initiated the Quality Improvement Demonstration Study (QIDS) in collaboration with the Philippine government (funded by the US National Institutes of Health: NICHD R-01 HD042117). This ongoing social experiment evaluates the health outcomes of children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1010539510390204">
<title>Sample Frame</title>
<p>Province inclusion criteria were (<italic>a</italic>) voluntary participation in the indigent program of the social health insurance program (PhilHealth) and (<italic>b</italic>) having at least 3 PhilHealth-accredited district hospitals or a single accredited provincial hospital. A total of 11 of 14 provinces met these criteria. From all government-owned facilities in these 11 provinces, 30 accredited district or provincial level hospitals were recruited. A total of 1500 children living in the population surrounding the hospitals were randomly selected and constituted the sample frame for the population-based sample. In total, 3000 children (100 per facility) admitted to these facilities were serially sampled and constituted the patient-based sample. To ensure equal representation in the analysis of the combined random and patient samples, children who sought care from a facility were weighted using the reciprocal of a child’s probability of being hospitalized.</p>
<p>We surveyed 6-month- to 5-year-old children at either the time of their hospital discharge for the patient sample or for the random sample, at the time of the household interview. Parents or guardians of all children provided voluntary written informed consent prior to enrollment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1010539510390204">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data were collected in 2004. The data were checked for completeness and accuracy, coded and keyed by project staff at the University of the Philippines in Manila using double keyboard entry on a Microsoft Access platform. The self-reported health measures were obtained through interviews conducted by trained medical technologists using a standardized protocol in 1 of 3 local dialects.</p>
<p>The biomarker measures used in this study included height, weight, hemoglobin, red blood cell folate, C-reactive protein (CRP), and blood lead levels. These were selected because they represented a range of tests in terms of cost and ease of collection, and all have key relevance to child health. Height and weight are both easy to obtain and are probably the most common assessment of child health made worldwide. Hemoglobin measures anemia, which reflects nutritional status and overall health and there are good easy field methods for obtaining an assessment. Red blood cell folate is a more complex and expensive test but provides information on underlying, longer term nutritional status than hemoglobin. CRP provides a relatively easy way to screen for current underlying infection, an important piece of health information in this study since we had children who were exiting the hospital and others in the community. Blood lead levels were included because we also tested the developmental status of children and high blood lead levels are well known to threaten overall health and development of young children in the developed world, and others have documented the impact of lead on cognitive scores in Southeast Asian populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539510390204">18</xref></sup></p>

<title>Data Collection Instruments</title>
<sec id="section10-1010539510390204">
<title>Parent-reported health status</title>
<p>We used the most widely used version of GSRH: “How would you rate your health?” with a 5-point response scale from “poor” to “excellent.” It is brief and easier to administer than multi-item measures of self-rated health and has strong predictive validity that is as robust as the SF-36 physical component score (PCS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510390204">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539510390204">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539510390204">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since for practical reasons it is impossible to ask this question of the very young children included in our study, we followed the practice of previous researchers and the 1999 National Survey of America’s Families and used parental reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539510390204">20</xref></sup> Parental reports are known to be well correlated with children’s self-reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539510390204">21</xref></sup> and better than the reports of other proxies such as doctors or teachers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539510390204">22</xref></sup> We adapted it for use with children by rephrasing it as “How would you rate your child’s health?” The possible responses were “poor,” “fair,” “good,” “very good,” and “excellent.”</p>
<p>We also collected data in the same survey instrument on socioeconomic background, health care utilization patterns and insurance coverage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1010539510390204">
<title>Anthropometrics</title>
<p>We measured height using stiff measuring tapes, lying down (for children younger than 2 years) or standing up. We measured weight with a 25-kg Salter scale designed for field use, or with standing hospital scales in patient exit surveys. Weight and height were measured twice for each child.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1010539510390204">
<title>Blood tests</title>
<p>We used established clinical procedures for obtaining venous blood samples. Blood draws occurred on the day of discharge for hospital-based subjects and during the home visit for population-based subjects.</p>
<p>Venous blood was drawn and placed in tubes transported the same day to a provincial level lab where hemoglobin and CRP testing was performed and sample preparation was completed for lead and folate analysis. Lead and folate samples were stored at appropriate temperatures and shipped twice weekly to a centralized lab in Manila, where lead analysis was performed, and to Singapore for folate analysis.</p>
<p>Hemoglobin levels were tested using the HemoCue Blood Hemoglobin Photometer (Cypress, CA). CRP levels were tested using a semiquantitative latex agglutination test manufactured by Concept Diagnostics. Positive samples were further tested by serial 8-fold dilution to get semiquantitative results. Blood lead levels were analyzed using the LeadCare Analyzer (ESA Inc, Chelmsford, MA), with appropriate positive and negative controls. Red blood cell folate was measured, along with hemoglobin for standardization, using the Architect system by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott Park, IL). All tests were performed by licensed medical technologists.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1010539510390204">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>All analyses use the combined random population and patient samples. We first generated descriptive statistics for the GSRH and all biomarkers. For the univariate analysis, sampling weights were applied to the patient sample to account for the increased likelihood of an ill child being selected. Means were computed for GSRH, all biomarkers, and an aggregate biomarker that defines “not normal” as having anemia, folate deficiency, positive CRP, or being wasted. For purposes of comparability, the range of abnormal values for GSRH includes “fair” and “poor” ratings.</p>
<p>We use multivariate regression analysis to examine the ability of GSRH (rating “fair” or “poor”) to predict the probability of a child having a poor health score on the biomarker tests. For these analyses, we use a pooled sample of the hospital patients along with the population sample. No statistical differences in any of our measured socioeconomic or health indicators were found between these 2 groups. Analogous to the use of sampling weight adjustments in the univariate analysis, we use a method proposed by Heckman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539510390204">23</xref></sup> for correcting any possible sample selection bias that may occur in the pooled analysis when combining the random and patient samples. The Heckman correction is a 2-stage model wherein the first stage corrects for selection and the second stage estimates the probability of obtaining a poor biomarker outcome conditioned on the parental GSRH.</p>
<p>We used a probit model to control for various patient characteristics in both stages, namely, age, mother’s education, whether households were urban, and whether they had insurance coverage. The insurance variable serves as the identifying instrument and is thus the variable that will affect biomarkers indirectly through hospitalization. The probit model yields coefficients for the biomarkers that we used to calculate marginal effects, thus describing the impact of GSRH of “fair” or “poor” on the likelihood that a child would have an abnormal biomarker (these results are presented in a table later). To explore the stability of these relationships over time, we used 2 measurements for hemoglobin, CRP, and GSRH typically collected at patient discharge and 1 to 2.5 months later and compared the differences between these measures (<italic>t</italic> tests and variance ratio tests). STATA version 8 was used for the analyses.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In our combined sample of 2972 children, 21% of parent respondents reported that their child’s health status was either excellent or very good and another 68% reported their child’s health as good; only 11% reported their child’s health as poor or fair, and were considered “not normal” in our study (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1010539510390204">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Based on biomarker assessment, the percent of children in the population with anemia, defined as hemoglobin &lt;11.0 µg/dL, was 23%.

<p>We next looked at the changes over time to see if the biomarkers and GSRH changed together. Children were tested at the time of discharge and again 1 to 2.5 months later for repeat measurements of hemoglobin, CRP, and GSRH. Both hemoglobin and CRP showed relative improvements that were statistically significant: Whereas 77% had normal hemoglobin levels at discharge, this increased to 82% at follow-home. Similarly, 78% had negative CRP at discharge, which increased to 94% by the time of the follow-home survey. In contrast, GSRH responses did not improve after discharge (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1010539510390204">Table 4</xref>). In all, 34% of those exiting the hospital replied that their child’s health status was excellent or very good; however, at follow-homes, only 20% of the patient sample rated their child’s health as excellent or very good. By comparison, 40% of the randomly sampled respondents replied that their child’s health status was excellent or very good. (Thus, recently hospitalized patients are more likely to rate their health at poor both at discharge, and 2.5 months later than the general population using GSRH.) These results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1010539510390204">Table 4</xref>) were statistically significant and were not biased by being an index condition (screened in) or not (screened out).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Public policy makers and payers require evidence that shows health policies affect health outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539510390204">24</xref></sup> Traditional determinants, such as cost, utilization, staffing levels, and insurance coverage do not provide adequate information to evaluate the impact of policy on the health outcomes of a population. Typical outcome measures, such as mortality rates, though concrete and important, are limited and unable to provide real-time policy feedback. Therefore, researchers have increasingly turned to self-reported health measures and biomarkers as intermediate outcomes in population-based assessments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539510390204">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539510390204">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539510390204"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1010539510390204">27</xref></sup> Despite the importance of measuring health outcomes and the availability of different methods to determine patient illness, little work has been done to compare clinical versus subjective methods in the developing country setting.</p>
<p>We first note that GSRH identified a similar proportion of children in fair or poor health compared to an aggregate biomarker measure for below normal health. We found a statistically significant correlation between biomarkers and GSRH for several objective health status measures: hemoglobin (anemia), an acute phase reactant CRP, wasting, stunting, and a combined biomarker. The exception of lead and folate to this overall rule indicates to us that more acute conditions such as anemia and infection are better captured by GSRH than chronic deterioration as seen in lead poisoning. Overall, these findings support the work of others who find GSRH to be correlated with biomarkers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539510390204">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>GSRH, however, does not perform well in identifying <italic>all</italic> sick children (ie, akin to having a low specificity). Importantly, it is useful at the individual level as a screening test because it can eliminate from further screening those with “good,” “very good,” or “excellent” reported health status. As measured by the marginal effects shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1010539510390204">Table 3</xref>, a “poor” of “fair” health rating increases the likelihood that a child will have an abnormal biomarker by 3% to 5%. Since 87% of our randomly selected population had a parental reported rating of “good,” “very good,” or “excellent,” using the GSRH will greatly reduce the overall number of people who receive the more expensive biomarker tests, which is obviously an important consideration in a resource-constrained setting.</p>
<p>By demonstrating its correlation with objective health measures, our findings strengthen the nascent body of knowledge by demonstrating that the proxy assessment by a parent of a young child is equally valid, at least for such a simple, overall measure of health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1010539510390204">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1010539510390204">30</xref></sup> In a sample of children younger than 5 years, self-report of health status is impossible. Researchers working with children old enough to self report on HRQOL measures and have found strong correlations between parental and child reports in such diverse groups as populations of patients with cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1010539510390204">31</xref></sup> and obese teens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1010539510390204">32</xref></sup> Although self-report is preferable when children are able to provide it, researchers have found strong correlations between parental and self-reports of HRQOL and recommend using parental reports for children who are too young to provide self-reports, such as those in our sample.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1010539510390204">29</xref></sup> Researchers have found that parents are better proxy reporters than other caregivers for young children and their assessments correlate better on measures of physical well-being than social and emotional well-being.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539510390204">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>The fact that GSRH declines after hospitalization while biologic outcomes are improving, reinforces how important context is in understanding comparative findings. Specifically, others have pointed out that GSRH reflects a more holistic measure that may be a better predictor of overall well-being.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539510390204">3</xref></sup> Many factors constitute health status on a self-reported measure such as GSRH, including such diverse constructs as physical and mental health, social support, financial strength, and family longevity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1010539510390204">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1010539510390204">34</xref></sup> Undoubtedly, a mother is able to assess overall characteristics such as weight, height, energy level, and feeding and sleeping patterns. She also likely observes clinical measures that are related to biomarkers and that also have some observable manifestation such as acute illness and a positive CRP. In addition, a mother can take into account information about current or past illnesses and hospitalizations. Finally a mother can observe changes in health status associated with recent health related events. For example, mothers are more likely to give their child an excellent or very good rating at discharge than when interviewed again in the follow-up visit, in spite of the fact that their biomarkers actually improve. This may be explained if the mother has assimilated the information of her child having been ill enough to be hospitalized more fully into her conception of the child’s health status. She may also be more aware that the child has lost weight, has less energy, or is in other ways still recovering. Finally, the child may have relapsed, deteriorated or remained ill in a less than fully recovered state, thereby reducing the mother’s likelihood of giving the child an excellent or very good heath rating. Most importantly, the decline in parental assessment of health status following hospitalization signals to us the need to put any health status measure in context and compare it with information about recent health events. Thus, our results introduce a note of caution by showing us that, just as expected, a limited set of biomarkers do not always identify children in poor health, likewise, parental assessment of GSRH does not always identify every child with anemia, folate deficiency, elevated CRP, and especially elevated blood lead. This underscores the necessity of distinguishing from an aggregate population effect and an individual health effect particularly as it relates to health transitions from ill to well.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study is necessarily limited by the fact that it contains only cross-sectional data. In addition, it is important to bear in mind that clinical and self-reported measures of health, in fact, measure different constructs of health. Our comparison illustrates the advantages and pitfalls of using different methods to measure health outcomes to policy makers seeking tools to evaluate the impacts of health policy.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Parentally reported health status as measured in a single-item measure is effective as an assessment of overall health in populations when compared to a combination of clinical blood tests and anthropometric measures. GSRH also appears to serve as a reliable screening of individual health status, particularly for good health, as these are found to be correlated with the clinical measures of hemoglobin, folate, and CRP in venous blood samples. GSRH did not correlate with lead levels among healthy populations seemingly because lead exposure is a chronic and more indolent neurotoxin. We found, however, that biomarkers and GSRH change differently in the weeks immediately following hospital discharge, reflecting the importance of taking into account the timing of such measures.</p>
<p>In places with scarce resources, GSRH appears to be a useful screening tool to economize on the collection of biomarkers. In a large population survey with limited resources, a rating less than or equal to fair health on the GSRH is indicative of a population in which the biomarker evaluations are likely to point to poor health.</p>
