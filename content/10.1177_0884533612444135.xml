<abstract>
<p>Despite acute myocardial infarction and cardiac surgery accounting for 2 of the most common reasons patients are admitted to the intensive care unit, little attention and investigation have been directed specifically for these patients. This patient population therefore deserves special attention as they are often malnourished but require emergent interventions, making nutrition intervention challenging. This article reviews current medical interventions implemented in critically ill cardiothoracic patients and discusses evidence-based nutrition therapy, including enteral and parenteral feeding, glycemic control, and antioxidant provision.</p>

<body>
<p>In the United States, heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death and contributes to increased healthcare costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612444135">1</xref></sup> According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates for 2007, 16.7 million visits to physician offices and hospital outpatient and emergency departments were due to heart disease issues, excluding ischemic heart disease; 13.9 million visits were due to ischemic heart disease as the primary diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612444135">1</xref></sup> Although the average length of inpatient stay for heart disease issues is 4.4 days,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612444135">1</xref></sup> if a patient develops complications and requires intensive care unit admission (ICU), the length of stay and cost increase dramatically.</p>
<p>Critical illness often involves varying degrees of dysfunction of a single organ or multiple organs and/or systems. In addition to alterations in cardiac status and circulation, critically ill patients in a cardiac/cardiothoracic ICU experience different clinical factors that may contribute to alterations in circulatory system homeostasis. Preexisting comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and malnutrition can exacerbate the individual’s response to stress and complicate the medical care. This article reviews the common challenges that exist with providing optimal nutrition therapy for the cardiothoracic critically ill patient.</p>

<title>Acute Heart Failure</title>
<p>Abnormal cardiac function may be related to diastolic dysfunction, abnormal cardiac rhythms, or preload and/or afterload mismatch (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612444135">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612444135">2</xref></sup> It may be precipitated by cardiac or noncardiac factors and involves either or both ventricles and requires immediate care as it is life-threatening. Common causes of acute heart failure include acute coronary syndromes, decompensation of preexisting chronic heart failure, acute arrhythmias, acute valvular regurgitation, and postcardiotomy shock.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612444135">2</xref></sup> Initial management includes monitoring of vital signs, ventilator assistance as needed, and medical treatment consisting of morphine, anticoagulants, vasodilators, and diuretics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612444135">2</xref></sup> Inotropic therapy consisting of β-agonists and/or phosphodieterase inhibitors is typically instituted if patient hemodynamic status worsens. Vasopressor therapy is initiated if inotropic support and fluid management fail to restore blood pressure and end-organ perfusion. This includes addition of α-agonists and/or vasopressin and can be accompanied by intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) counterpulsation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612444135">2</xref></sup> If these interventions are unsuccessful, then mechanical circulatory support remains the only option for survival.</p>

<p>Despite even the earliest efforts of resuscitation and support, by definition, severely ill patients in cardiogenic and circulatory shock often have some degree of baseline visceral and/or renal ischemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612444135">3</xref></sup> Vasopressors increase blood pressure by causing vasoconstriction and redistributing the blood away from the splanchnic and peripheral organs (eg, bowel, skin, kidney, bone marrow) to the vital organs, consequently creating a low blood flow state to the gut. Common vasopressors used to increase systemic arterial blood pressure and cardiac output can also have profound effects on the splanchnic microcirculation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612444135">4</xref></sup></p>

<title>Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery</title>
<p>Since 1967, coronary artery bypass has been performed to treat angina and reduce the risk of death from coronary artery disease. Atherosclerotic narrowings of the coronary arteries are bypassed with arteries or veins harvested from elsewhere in the body and grafted to the coronary arteries to improve the blood supply to the coronary circulation supplying the heart. This procedure may be performed with or without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).</p>
<p>The CPB technique temporarily assumes the function of the heart and lungs during surgery, thus maintaining blood circulation and oxygen content in the body. CPB is extracorporeal circulation that mechanically circulates and oxygenates blood for the body while bypassing the heart and lungs. A heart-lung machine is used to maintain perfusion to other body organs and tissues while stopping the heart for the bypass surgery grafting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612444135">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cardiac surgery with CPB carries negative impacts on the patient ranging from risk of stroke to subtle changes in mental status, as well as changes in inflammatory and immune markers; off-pump CPB is thought to decrease the negative impact on the renal and central nervous systems, but this remains controversial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612444135">5</xref></sup> CPB provokes systemic inflammation, which is linked to multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612444135">6</xref></sup> Various humoral cascades and blood components are activated from a resultant inflammatory response caused by exposure to foreign materials used in the bypass circuitry, which can lead to ischemic damage in sensitive organs such as the intestine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612444135">7</xref></sup> Alterations in gut permeability can allow for bacterial translocation, thus exacerbating the inflammatory response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612444135">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612444135">8</xref></sup> This mucosal damage and resultant bacterial translocation are likely caused by ischemic-reperfusion injury and appears to predominately affect the colon, where the majority of the gut microbiota reside.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612444135">6</xref></sup> In addition, normothermic CPB increases splanchnic oxygen consumption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612444135">8</xref></sup> The movement towards multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome is associated with prolonged CPB or perioperative hemodynamic complications, preexisting debilitating diseases, cardiovascular risk factors, or a “second hit” such as a serious complication in the postoperative period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612444135">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation</title>
<p>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is instituted for the management of life-threatening pulmonary or cardiac failure (or both), when no other form of treatment has been or is likely to be successful. It is used as a temporary support while waiting for organs to recover.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612444135">9</xref></sup> The most common indications are postcardiotomy (for those unable to be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass following cardiac surgery), post–heart transplant (due to primary graft failure), and severe cardiac failure due to almost any other cause.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612444135">9</xref></sup> For respiratory failure, the most common indication is for adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, trauma, or primary graft failure following lung transplantation. ECMO is used in pediatrics and in neonates for treatment of immature lungs and insufficient surfactant.</p>
<p>ECMO is modeled after the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit used routinely in cardiac surgery. Blood is removed from the venous system either peripherally via cannulation of a femoral vein or centrally via cannulation of the right atrium and oxygenated, and carbon dioxide is extracted and then returned back to the body, either peripherally via a femoral artery or centrally via the ascending aorta.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612444135">9</xref></sup> The circuit is smaller than a standard cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, transportable, and closed to the atmosphere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612444135">9</xref></sup> Improvements in oxygenators and medical management have allowed for several weeks of ECMO support if needed.</p>
<p>Complications of ECMO include bleeding, coagulopathy with patients requiring low-level heparinization, leg ischemia, air embolism, thromboembolism, and neurological sequelae.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612444135">9</xref></sup> Nonpulsatile perfusion provided by ECMO can pose a problem to organs at most risk such as the kidneys and gut. Reports indicate susceptibility of the splanchnic circulation with gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration, and perforation as well as liver impairment occurring in those supported with prolonged periods of nonpulsatile perfusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612444135">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612444135">8</xref></sup></p>

<title>IABP</title>
<p>The intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation is a frequently used mechanical circulatory support device for surgical and medical patients with well-documented beneficial hemodynamic and metabolic effects. IABP support reduces left ventricular afterload and improves coronary and systemic perfusion. IABP improves coronary blood flow by improving diastolic blood pressure of the systemic and coronary arteries and increasing cardiac index by decreasing cardiac workload. It is also associated with lower extremity ischemia in up to 33% of surgical patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612444135">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>IABP is rarely used long term due to several drawbacks, including immobility, limb ischemia, and limited effectiveness in the face of severe cardiogenic shock and low aortic pressures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612444135">10</xref></sup> Although lower extremity ischemia is relatively easy to identify by clinical examination, early detection of visceral ischemia is more challenging. Acute abdominal condition in critically ill patients commonly expresses only irreversible and fatal organ damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612444135">3</xref></sup> Malposition of the IABP balloon may result in compromise of the visceral arteries, further exacerbating malperfusion, which is poorly tolerated in these patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612444135">3</xref></sup> Despite strict adherence to placement protocols, a recent study indicated malpositioning of IABP in 97% of patients, with 90% of patients having compromise of 2 vessels (celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery), and nearly 70% had compromise of 3 visceral vessels (celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, and renal artery).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612444135">3</xref></sup> This caused a need for laparotomy for bowel ischemia in nearly 25%, renal replacement therapy in &gt;80%, and an overall hospital mortality of 60%.</p>

<title>Gut Perfusion in Normal vs Shock States</title>
<p>Arterial perfusion of the splanchnic regions comes from the celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery, and inferior mesenteric artery with the most metabolically active organs’ (eg, liver and small intestine) receiving blood supply coming from branches of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612444135">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612444135">11</xref></sup> The intestinal villi are the most vulnerable part of the intestinal wall to ischemia as they receive the least amount of oxygen, but it is the section exposed to nutrients that requires oxygen for digestion. A countercurrent exchange of oxygen exists within the villus as oxygen is exchanged from the artery to the vein along the course of the villus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612444135">4</xref></sup> About one-fourth of the cardiac output is dedicated to the hepatosplanchnic circulation and increases 2-fold postprandially.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612444135">12</xref></sup> Because of the high metabolic activity of the hepatosplanchnic region, the oxygen extraction ratio is lower than any other tissue bed in the body. Therefore, in conditions of shunted blood flow, this region becomes oxygen deprived and vulnerable to ischemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612444135">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>During cardiogenic and circulatory shock, there is a redistribution of blood supply shifting away from the hepatosplanchnic bed. As described above, medical interventions further exacerbate shunting of the blood supply from the gut. The reduction in blood and oxygen to the intestine can lead to increased gut permeability and bacterial translocation, which is linked with multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612444135">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612444135">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612444135">14</xref></sup> Once the patient is adequately stabilized and resuscitated, nutrition intervention needs to become part of the medical plan. Determining the optimal quantity, route of feeding, and quality of nutrients is an important component of the nutrition care plan.</p>
<p>Acute renal failure is a common occurrence in critically ill cardiothoracic patients due to ischemic events not only to the heart and gut but also to the kidneys. Guidelines state that protein and energy provision should not be limited in critically ill patients with acute renal failure and that renal replacement therapy should be implemented. A select number of patients cannot tolerate renal replacement therapy. These patients should be treated with a tolerated amount of protein, fluid, and electrolytes until replacement therapy can be implemented or renal function returns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612444135">15</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section7-0884533612444135">
<title>Nutrition Assessment</title>
<p>Malnutrition increases patient morbidity and mortality following cardiac surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612444135">16</xref></sup> Unfortunately, oftentimes patients are evaluated for cardiac surgery during emergent or emergency conditions after having undergone extensive series of diagnostic procedures to identify, triage, and stratify their heart disease. Valuable nutrition assessment information is not typically obtained during this evaluation. Nutrition status should be a strong consideration in assessing whether patients should be selected for surgery. Several studies have indicated that thin patients with very low body fat stores have an elevated risk for surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612444135">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533612444135"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533612444135">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Serum albumin has a longer half-life (~21 days), and levels are lowered for multiple reasons, including inflammation and fluid status. Therefore, monitoring serum albumin levels for nutrition risk in the acute care setting is not recommended as altered levels do not reflect nutrition status. However, preoperative serum albumin level and body mass index (BMI) have been shown to be strong independent predictors of morbidity and mortality in cardiac surgery patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612444135">17</xref></sup> In one large study, 5168 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac operations were prospectively evaluated to determine a correlation between preoperative BMI and serum albumin levels and postoperative morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533612444135">18</xref></sup> Low BMI (&lt;20 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and low serum albumin levels (&lt;2.5 g/dL) were each independently associated with increased mortality after cardiopulmonary bypass (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0005). Regardless of BMI, operative mortality was higher when serum albumin was &lt;2.5 g/dL; likewise regardless of serum albumin levels, operative mortality was highest when BMI was &lt;20 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Both low parameters were associated with greater comorbidites, length of stay, and risk factors. BMI &gt;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> significantly increased the incidence of deep sternal wound infection and saphenous vein harvest site infections (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0005) without any increase in overall length of stay. In multivariable analysis adjusting for potential confounders, serum albumin levels &lt;3.5 g/dL significantly increased risk of renal failure, postoperative atrial fibrillation, and length of stay. Serum albumin &lt;2.5 g/dL increased risk of mortality, low cardiac output, and reexploration for postoperative bleeding. BMI &lt;20 kg/m<sup>2</sup> increased risks of mortality, cerebral vascular accidents, transient ischemic attacks, renal failure, pneumonia, and reoperation for bleeding. The mortality rates were independent of the type of surgical procedure performed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533612444135">18</xref></sup> Preoperative unintended weight loss of 10% or greater is associated with serious adverse effects following cardiac surgery independent of body mass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0884533612444135">20</xref></sup> Patients with cardiovascular disease are prone to edema.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0884533612444135">21</xref></sup> Therefore, it is essential to carefully assess weight status accurately in cardiothoracic patients so as not to overestimate weight.</p>
<p>Patients with longstanding valvular heart disease, either acquired or congenital, and nonischemic disease of the myocardium resulting in heart failure often exhibit cardiac cachexia, a specific form of protein-calorie malnutrition frequently seen in end-stage or neglected cardiac disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533612444135">22</xref></sup> Increased plasma levels of cortisol, epinephrine, and activation of the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines assist in the development of a catabolic state due to an imbalance in anabolism and catabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533612444135">23</xref></sup> Approximately 10% of patients with chronic heart failure manifest cardiac cachexia, and therefore a goal should be to predict cardiac cachexia development and attempt to stop the wasting process to avoid significant weight loss because once cardiac cachexia is detected in patients with chronic heart failure, the 18-month survival is approximately 50%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0884533612444135">24</xref></sup></p>

<title>Nutrient Requirements</title>
<p>A depletion of cardiac energy plays a major role in chronic heart failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533612444135">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533612444135">26</xref></sup> Consuming more energy than any other organ in the body, the heart cycles roughly 6 kg of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) daily, equivalent to 20–30 times its own weight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533612444135">25</xref></sup> Beating about 100,000 times/d and pumping nearly 10 tons of blood throughout the body daily, the heart performs a huge amount of work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533612444135">25</xref></sup> To fuel this work, the heart converts chemical energy stored in fatty acids and glucose to mechanical energy of the actin-myosin contractile interaction of the myofibrils.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533612444135">25</xref></sup> Therefore, mechanical failure results when there is failure to provide this necessary energy.</p>
<p>Providing appropriate amounts of energy and protein is therefore important for critically ill cardiothoracic patients. If indirect calorimetry is available, it should be used; otherwise, several predictive equations have now been validated for estimating energy requirements. The best predictive equation is the Penn State equation and the modified Penn State equation, which both can be used in ventilated patients, with the latter being more accurate for elderly (&gt;60 years old) and obese patients (BMI &gt;30).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0884533612444135">27</xref></sup> Critically ill cardiothoracic patients are catabolic and have fairly hefty protein requirements at 1.5–2.0 g/kg/d of ideal body weight if at BMI &gt;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and usual body weight if BMI ≤25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. These should be adjusted based on renal and hepatic failure and medical interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612444135">15</xref></sup> Presently, except for judicious preoperative and postoperative nutrition support of patients with cardiac cachexia, there are no controlled therapeutic strategies for improving outcomes in cardiac cachexia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533612444135">22</xref></sup></p>

<title>Feeding Low Flow State/Hemodynamic Instability</title>
<p>According to Critical Care Guidelines from the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition and Society of Critical Care Medicine (A.S.P.E.N./SCCM) and the American Dietetic Association’s Evidence Analysis Library (EAL), gastrointestinal (GI) rather than intravenous (IV) feeding should be used in critically ill patients whenever possible, ranking this recommendation highly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612444135">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0884533612444135">31</xref></sup> As indicated in both documents, when EN is compared with parenteral nutrition (PN), reductions in infectious morbidity and complications are noted, resulting in reduced costs.</p>
<p>Although EN appears beneficial to critically ill patients, it should not be initiated until patients are adequately resuscitated and hemodynamically stable, and thus it is withheld when high-dose vasopressors and/or significant amounts of fluid and blood products are required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612444135">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0884533612444135">31</xref></sup> Critically ill cardiothoracic patients may be challenging to feed enterally due to hemodynamic instability and requirements for medical and mechanical circulatory support, which can reduce the blood supply to the splanchnic bed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0884533612444135">32</xref></sup> Hypoperfusion results in potential bowel ischemia, increased mucosal permeability, translocated endotoxins, and elevated incidence of organ failure, which contributes to an increased mortality rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0884533612444135">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>EN has both a positive and negative impact on the hypoperfused GI tract, depending on how and when it is provided. Hypoperfusion results in a reduced oxygen supply, and vasopressors promote vasoconstriction, which may worsen hypoperfusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612444135">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612444135">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0884533612444135">33</xref></sup> If nutrients are infused, the demand for oxygen increases due to added needs for digestion and absorption. This demand may exceed the amount of available oxygen, resulting in bowel ischemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0884533612444135">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, using the GI tract for feeding may be desirable as small amounts of nutrients may vasodilate mesenteric arteries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0884533612444135">33</xref></sup> Several studies have examined the influence of EN during vasopressor and inotrope support. Revelly et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0884533612444135">34</xref></sup> studied 9 cardiac surgery patients provided EN on the first postoperative day. Patients received 3 hours of continuous EN at 130% of measured energy expenditure while requiring dobutamine (mean 420 µg/min) and norepinephrine (range, 6–30 µm/min) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 70 mm Hg. Using blood glucose as an indicator of EN absorption, levels rose with EN administration. Other favorable results were increased cardiac index and splanchnic blood flow, decreased MAP by 10% (78 to 70 mm Hg), reduced systemic vascular resistance, stable heart rate, and tolerance of the enteral tube feeding.</p>
<p>Berger et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0884533612444135">35</xref></sup> started patients (n = 70) on nutrition within 2–3 days of either cardiac or thoracic-abdominal aortic surgery using a variety of feeding routes (oral, EN, or PN, or in combination). EN was advanced slowly so that goal rates were obtained in 4–6 days. For patients on dopamine and norepinephrine, their EN intake correlated inversely with vasopressor or inotropic requirements while continuing to receive EN with good tolerance. Another study examined the effects of early EN (within 48 hours) vs late EN on length of stay and hospital rate in mechanically ventilated, nonsurgical patients requiring vasopressors (norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, or phenylephrine) for at least the first 2 days on mechanical ventilation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0884533612444135">36</xref></sup> In this large study (n = 714), lower hospital mortality occurred in patients receiving early EN compared with matched patients on late EN (34% vs 43%; <italic>P</italic> = .01). Patients were considered to be sicker if they required more than 1 vasopressor. The sicker patients who received early EN had lower mortality than the ones on late EN (odds ratio [OR], 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15–0.85), thus indicating that improved outcomes in sicker patients may be associated with early EN. These positive outcomes are not without concern as the authors did not indicate the amount of EN or vasopressors the patients received. It is much more likely a patient will receive the recommended volume of EN while on a low-dose vasopressor than a patient who is requiring larger amounts of vasopressors.</p>
<p>In summary, on the basis of these few studies, patients receiving vasopressors could be candidates for EN. Unfortunately, there are no definitive guidelines for the initiation of EN while on vasopressors. A.S.P.E.N./SCCM and EAL state that the patient should be resuscitated and stabilized prior to starting EN,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612444135">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0884533612444135">31</xref></sup> but this can be difficult to identify. Patients must be monitored for the risk of bowel ischemia while hemodynamically unstable. Those at risk tend to require mechanical ventilation, exhibit low cardiac outputs, or require vasopressor support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0884533612444135">33</xref></sup> Circumstances that can promote bowel ischemia are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0884533612444135">Table 2</xref>.

<p>Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is also a potential indicator of bowel ischemia; a pressure of 15 mm Hg or greater indicates a risk of bowel ischemia, and bowel ischemia is likely occurring if the pressure is 20 mm Hg or greater.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0884533612444135">32</xref></sup> Clinically significant intra-abdominal hypertension may be present in the absence of abdominal distension and vice versa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0884533612444135">37</xref></sup> There are multiple methods for obtaining IAP, some with more accuracy than others, and the discussion of these methods is beyond the scope of this article, but the reader is referred to a review article on various techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0884533612444135">37</xref></sup> Basically, the techniques can be categorized into bladder and manometry techniques. Traditionally, the bladder has been used as the method of choice for measuring IAP. One bladder method involves disconnecting the patient’s Foley catheter and instilling 50–100 mL saline. After reconnection, the urinary drainage bag is clamped distal to the culture aspiration port. For each individual IAP measurement, a 16-gauge needle is then used to Y-connect a manometer or pressure transducer. The symphysis pubis is used as a reference line.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0884533612444135">37</xref></sup> Manometry techniques give rapid and cost-effective feedback on the magnitude of IAP and can be done easily together with and without interfering with urine output measurements. When a patient has no Foley catheter in place, or when accurate bladder pressures are not possible due to the absence of free movement of the bladder wall, IAP can be measured indirectly by the stomach, by means of a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube. There are also methods for estimating IAP using rectal pressures, uterine pressures, and inferior vena cava pressures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0884533612444135">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, for patients at risk for bowel ischemia or increased IAPs, it is suggested that enteral feedings be initiated at a low rate (10–20 mL/h) and that patients are monitored for signs of feeding intolerance such as abdominal distention, increasing nasogastric tube output or gastric residual volumes, decreased passage of flatus or stool, hypoactive bowel sounds, increasing metabolic acidosis, and/or base deficit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612444135">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612444135">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612444135">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0884533612444135">35</xref></sup></p>

<title>Gastric vs Small Bowel Feeding</title>
<p>A.S.P.E.N./SCCM and EAL state that critically ill patients can be fed either gastrically or into the small bowel but that small bowel feeding should be pursued if the patient has at least one of the following: high risk for aspiration, supine position requirement, heavy sedation, and elevated gastric residual volumes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612444135">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0884533612444135">31</xref></sup> GI dysmotility is likely to occur in cardiothoracic critically ill patients due to anesthesia, sedatives, opioids, and mechanical ventilation used during surgery and the recovery period, as well as a consequence of cardiogenic shock.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0884533612444135">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, it has been shown that nutrients are absorbed when cardiac output is low, defined as cardiac indexes of 2.0–2.5 L/m<sup>2</sup>/min, with the tolerance of EN dependent on the location of the feeding infusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0884533612444135">32</xref></sup> According to Berger and Chiolero,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0884533612444135">32</xref></sup> more volume of formula is absorbed when delivered postpylorically than gastrically, 1.5 L vs 1 L, respectively. During persistent unstable hemodynamics, there could be an energy deficit due to intolerance of EN volume, but this should not deter attempting to provide EN, even at small amounts, due to its benefits of improving splanchnic perfusion and immune function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0884533612444135">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Placing feeding tubes in patients with ventricular assist devices (VADs) can be challenging. Some types of VADs are positioned on top of the stomach, so gastric feeding tubes may be hidden behind the VADs on abdominal radiographs. In addition, using traditional methods for placing small bowel feeding tubes either by blind placement or with the use of an electromagnetic device can be skewed as proper abdominal assessment and auscultation are altered and an abnormal waveform is generated on the electromagnetic device. Because of the gastric location of VADs, placement of gastrostomy or jejunostomy tubes may be prohibitive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533612444135">23</xref></sup> Even with the challenge of placing feeding tubes, patients with VADs should be fed enterally if there is no GI dysfunction.</p>

<title>Timing of EN</title>
<p>A.S.P.E.N./SCCM and EAL recommend initiating EN within the first 24–48 hours of ICU admission following complete fluid resuscitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612444135">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0884533612444135">31</xref></sup> The initiation of EN for the critically ill cardiothoracic patient is dependent on the status of the GI tract and patient hemodynamic stability.

<title>Type of Formula</title>
<p>The critically ill cardiac surgery patient frequently has more than one dysfunctional organ as virtually every organ can be impaired due to the injury, its complications, and the medical intervention, and injury may be exacerbated by the patient’s comorbid conditions. This is challenging when developing an enteral feeding plan as a “disease-specific” formula for cardiothoracic patients per se is lacking, but several disease-specific formulas are available, making the choice of the optimal formula a thoughtful one. Data evaluating disease-specific formulas solely in critically ill cardiothoracic patients are lacking, and the few studies that do include these patients fail to analyze the results for this specific population.</p>
<p>A.S.P.E.N./SCCM guidelines recommend use of immune-modulating formulas containing arginine, glutamine, nucleic acid, ω-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants for surgical ICU patients with major elective GI surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612444135">15</xref></sup> The immune-modulated formulas are the best studied of all formula categories. When a standard product is compared with one containing immune nutrients, the latter has been correlated with reduced ventilator days, infectious morbidity, and hospital length of stay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612444135">15</xref></sup> Interestingly, the EAL does not recommend routine use of immune-modulating formulas, interpreting different outcomes from the same studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0884533612444135">31</xref></sup> Both A.S.P.E.N./SCCM and EAL note that there may be increased mortality in severely ill ICU patients or patients with severe sepsis with a concern with the arginine additive. A recent meta-analysis evaluated the impact that immune formulas had in altering hospital mortality, nosocomial infections, and length of stay in critically ill patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0884533612444135">39</xref></sup> When compared with a standard formula, an immune formula supplemented with fish oil without arginine improved the outcome in medical ICU patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, or ARDS. In attempts to improve immune function for better postoperative outcomes, a prospective, randomized, double-blind study compared an immune formula with a standard formula provided 5 days preoperatively in high-risk patients scheduled to undergo coronary artery bypass (n = 50).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0884533612444135">30</xref></sup> Eligible patients were &gt;70 years old, had an ejection fraction &lt;.4, or were scheduled to undergo mitral valve replacement. Patients receiving the immune formula had improved immune parameters preoperatively, which remained better until hospital discharge.</p>
<p>Critically ill cardiothoracic patients may develop acute lung injury (ALI) or ARDS. A.S.P.E.N./SCCM guidelines recommend using an enteral product containing ω-3 fatty acids, borage oil, and antioxidants for patients with ALI/ARDS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612444135">15</xref></sup> Since these guidelines were published, 2 new studies have been reported with conflicting outcomes. Rice et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0884533612444135">40</xref></sup> showed that ω-3 fatty acids and antioxidants did not benefit patients with ALI/ARDS and could even be harmful. In this study, patients diagnosed with ALI or ARDS received boluses of ω-3 fatty acids and antioxidants or an isocaloric placebo containing carbohydrate and protein. Those who received the ω-3 fatty acids and antioxidants had a higher mortality rate (26.6% vs 16.3%; <italic>P</italic> = .054), fewer ventilator-free days (14.0 vs 17.2; <italic>P</italic> = .02; difference: −3.2; 95% CI, −5.8 to −0.7), fewer ICU-free days (14.0 vs 16.7; <italic>P</italic> = .04), and fewer nonpulmonary organ failure–free days (12.3 vs 15.5; <italic>P</italic> = .02) compared with the group with the placebo. The authors thought the outcomes were different for several reasons: in previous studies, not all patients randomized into the studies were analyzed due to underfeeding resulting from intolerance of the experimental product, the control product in previous studies contained significant amounts of proinflammatory ω-6 and ω-9 fatty acids, and there was no indication in the previous studies that adherence to protocols for treatment of ARDS/ALI were followed.</p>
<p>Pontes-Arruda et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0884533612444135">41</xref></sup> completed a study with different methodology and different results from the Rice et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0884533612444135">40</xref></sup> study. Patients in the early stages of sepsis (n = 115) requiring EN were randomized to receive a high-fat formula (55% calories) rich in eicosapentenoic acid and gamma-linoleic acid or an isocaloric, isonitrogenous lower fat (29% calories) control formula with no EPA/GLA for 7 days. Fed continuously, the goal was to provide at least 75% of basal energy needs × 1.3 factor. A daily organ failure screening was performed to evaluate the progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock. Patients receiving the EPA/GLA formula developed less severe sepsis and/or septic shock (26.3% vs 50%, <italic>P</italic> = .0259) and had a lower incidence of cardiovascular (36.2% vs 21%, <italic>P</italic> = .0381) and respiratory (39.6% vs 24.6%, <italic>P</italic> = .0362) failure than did the control formula group. Fewer patients in the study group required mechanical ventilation, and this resulted in less ICU days compared with the control group. There was no difference in 28-day mortality between the groups. Based on these recent conflicting data, high-fat formulas enriched with EPA/GLA need further investigation regarding their effectiveness in patients with ALI/ARDS.</p>
<p>It is common for critically ill cardiothoracic patients to develop acute kidney injury (AKI). A.S.P.E.N./SCCM guidelines recommend using standard enteral products for patients with AKI, reserving the use of renal products if the patient develops electrolyte abnormalities that are unable to be corrected by medical therapy (eg, dialysis).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612444135">15</xref></sup> Continuous renal replacement therapy is frequently implemented, and this therapy is very catabolic to the patient and therefore elevates protein and fluid needs of the patient. Thus, a standard enteral product can be prescribed reserving provision of renal products that are limited in free water and electrolytes (eg, potassium, phosphorus) for patients experiencing hyperkalemia or hyperphosphotemia that is unresponsive to treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0884533612444135">33</xref></sup> Otherwise, using renal products may underfeed the critically ill cardiothoracic patient, particularly if the product contains small amounts of protein.</p>
<p>Some critically ill cardiothoracic patients may have diabetes mellitus prior to their entry into the ICU and/or may be hyperglycemic as a result of their injury. Although it is imperative to maintain good glycemic control (see section), it is not recommended to provide these patients with an enteral product developed for persons with diabetes. Although these products are lower in carbohydrate, they are higher in fat and may contain fiber that may not be well tolerated by the critically ill cardiothoracic patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0884533612444135">33</xref></sup> Ideally, treatment of hyperglycemia in the ICU should include implementation of an insulin infusion therapy protocol to maintain blood glucose levels within an optimal range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0884533612444135">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Critically ill cardiothoracic patients commonly have fluid limitations due to medical conditions (eg, pulmonary edema, congested heart failure). A fluid-restricted formula providing 1.5–2.0 kcal/mL may be beneficial (A.S.P.E.N./SCCM Grade E).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612444135">15</xref></sup> As these formulas are lower in protein, protein modulars may be supplemented to meet the patient’s protein requirements.</p>

<title>Rate/Monitoring Parameters</title>
<p>Although it is important to implement EN early, it is equally important to advance feeds toward goal as tolerated. There are no studies about advancing feeding rates for the critically ill cardiac surgery patient. A.S.P.E.N./SCCM suggests advancing EN to goal within 48–72 hours after its initiation (Grade E).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612444135">15</xref></sup> Berger and Chiolero<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0884533612444135">32</xref></sup> suggested starting EN at 20 mL/h if the patient has circulatory failure; otherwise, EN can be started at 30 mL/h. The feeding rate can be advanced every 12–24 hours, depending on tolerance, so that goal rate can be achieved in 3–5 days. If the patient has abdominal compartment syndrome, EN use is limited, but if provided, Berger and Chiolero recommend limiting total EN volume to ≤500 mL/d. However, as important as it is to prevent gut ischemia during low gut perfusion, hypocaloric feeding for extended periods of time can result in energy deficits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0884533612444135">42</xref></sup> To obtain clinical benefits of EN, patients should receive at least 50%–65% of goal calories during the first week.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612444135">15</xref></sup> In situations when EN is unable to be advanced to achieve these targets, then supplemental PN may be implemented to support energy requirements and minimize energy deficits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612444135">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Implementation of early EN in critically ill cardiothoracic patients necessitates close monitoring of tolerance to avoid complications. According to Berger and Chiolero,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0884533612444135">32</xref></sup> the worse GI complication following cardiac surgery is splanchic ischemia with bowel necrosis.

Also, patients at high risk (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0884533612444135">Table 2</xref>) are more likely to be intolerant of EN than those at lower risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0884533612444135">33</xref></sup></p>

<title>Parenteral Nutrition</title>
<p>A common indication for the use of PN in critically ill cardiothoracic patients is in the event of mesenteric ischemia resulting from peripheral vascular disease or some types of aortic aneurysms and abdominal compartment syndromes. Patients with dysfunctional GI tracts or who are unable to tolerate adequate energy intake from EN are candidates for PN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0884533612444135">38</xref></sup> PN may be provided alone or in combination with EN depending on nutrition assessment and energy department.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0884533612444135">42</xref></sup> According to A.S.P.E.N./SCCM guidelines, PN should be withheld for the first 7 days following surgery in a previously well-nourished patient but can be initiated earlier in someone with poor nutrition status prior to surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612444135">15</xref></sup> Resuscitation and stabilization of the patient must be completed prior to initiating PN. The risks of infections related to PN have been reduced through the use of intensive insulin therapy and protocols for preventing central line–associated bacteremia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0884533612444135">38</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section17-0884533612444135">
<title>Volume</title>
<p>Critically ill cardiac surgery patients are often at high risk for hypervolemia due to decreased ejection fractions and impaired ability of heart function such as cardiac cachexia and valve issues and tend to retain fluid. Also, patients receive fluids and blood products during surgery and in the postoperative period. PN volume should be minimized but typically is liberal enough to not interfere with provision of adequate nutrients. Physical examination of the patient assessing edema, urinary output, pulmonary congestion, heart failure, and ascites is essential to determine the need to restrict PN volume.</p>

<sec id="section18-0884533612444135">
<title>Glycemic control</title>
<p>Glycemic control of critically ill cardiac surgery patients has been an area of controversy during the past decade. Stress hyperglycemia is a result of the inflammatory process that accompanies surgical trauma, and its absence in the postoperative period is associated with increased mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0884533612444135">38</xref></sup> Normalizing blood glucose levels in the postoperative period may improve outcomes. van den Berghe et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0884533612444135">43</xref></sup> conducted a large study (n = 1548 ICU patients) that included primarily cardiac surgery patients investigating an intense insulin therapy protocol in comparison to standard therapy in controlling stress hyperglycemia. Patients randomized to the intensive insulin group had blood glucose levels maintained at 80–110 mg/dL, whereas the conventional group did not receive insulin until blood glucose level exceeded 215 mg/dL, and then blood glucose levels were maintained at 180–200 mg/dL. Both groups were fed 200–300 g IV dextrose on the first postoperative day and then started on EN, PN, or a combination of both on the second postoperative day with goal intakes of 20–30 nonprotein calories/kg body weight. The patients receiving the intensive insulin therapy had lower mortality and morbidity rates than the ones with conventional therapy and also realized cost savings. Because of the results of this study, various ICUs began implementing intensive insulin protocols and discovered some problems with this type of therapy. The tight glucose control resulted in greater incidences of hypoglycemia, difficulties in maintaining normal blood glucose levels, and an increase in resources needed to implement the protocols.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0884533612444135">44</xref></sup> Also, the patients were fed far more energy than what is usually recommended.</p>
<p>Consequently, another study was developed, the Normoglycemia in Intensive Care Evaluation–Survival Using Glucose Algorithm Regulation (NICE-SUGAR).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0884533612444135">44</xref></sup> In this large study of medical and surgical ICU patients (n = 6104), blood glucose levels were maintained at either 81–108 mg/dL (intensive control) or 180 mg/dL or less (conventional control). Patients received EN, PN, or a combination of both with average calorie intake of 891 nonprotein calories for the intensive control group and 872 nonprotein calories for the conventional group during the first 14 days in the study. The results indicated that the mortality rate was higher in the intensive control group (27.5% vs 24.9%; OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.02–1.28; <italic>P</italic> = .02), and this group had more incidences of severe hypoglycemia (6.8% vs .05%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) than did the control group. There were no differences in ICU and hospital length of stays and number of days on mechanical ventilation. Comments about the validity of this study were focused on the lack of standardization among the various protocols, glucometers, and infusion pumps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0884533612444135">38</xref></sup> Also, patients in this study may not have received adequate nutrition.</p>
<p>Haga et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0884533612444135">45</xref></sup> performed a meta-analysis of 7 randomized control trials focusing on tight blood glucose control in cardiac surgery patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0884533612444135">45</xref></sup> For the purposes of the meta-analysis, intensive insulin control was defined as blood glucose levels of 80–200 mg/dL and conventional therapy with blood glucose levels &gt;180 mg/dL. Compared with the patients with conventional therapy, intensive insulin control resulted in a lower mortality rate (19 vs 37 deaths; OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.30–0.91; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .02), less time on mechanical ventilation, and a shorter ICU length of stay. The authors commented that tight glucose control seems to be beneficial, but more studies are needed, using a variety of blood glucose levels and examining a variety of outcome measures.</p>
<p>More recently, Frioud et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0884533612444135">46</xref></sup> examined the correlation between blood glucose level on the first postoperative day and clinical outcomes in a retrospective study of patients (n = 642) who had cardiac surgery, carotid endarterectomy, or bypass of lower limbs. Blood glucose levels &gt;158 mg/dL were associated with death (OR, 10.16; <italic>P</italic> = .0002), infectious complications (OR, 1.76; <italic>P</italic> = .04), and extended ICU length of stay (OR, 3.10; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Mortality rate increased if there were more than 3 episodes of hypoglycemia, defined as blood glucose &lt;74 mg/dL.</p>
<p>At this time, there is no definitive recommendation for glycemic control in cardiothoractic critically ill patients. A.S.P.E.N./SCCM guidelines were developed prior to the publication of the NICE-SUGAR study, and the authors of the guidelines were aware of this study, acknowledging that the A.S.P.E.N./SCCM recommendation may soon be outdated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612444135">15</xref></sup> It has been proposed that tight glycemic control with blood glucose maintenance of 80–110 mg/dL should be the ideal, and if that is not possible, then maintenance levels could be raised to 140–180 mg/dL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0884533612444135">38</xref></sup> Patients in the van den Berghe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0884533612444135">43</xref></sup> and NICE-SUGAR studies were fed while receiving intensive insulin therapy, indicating that critically ill cardiac surgery patients need not only intensive blood glucose control but also nutrition for blood glucose maintenance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0884533612444135">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0884533612444135">38</xref></sup></p>

<title>Lipids</title>
<p>IV lipids provide similar advantages and disadvantages for critically ill cardiac surgery patients as they do for any critically ill patient with one exception.

All laboratory values were altered by surgery, thus indicating that cardiac surgery causes severe inflammation. It is suspected that the low antioxidant levels that occur with cardiac surgery promote multiple-organ failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0884533612444135">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Glutathione is a glutamine containing tripeptide and is the body’s most potent endogenous antioxidant system, being a scavenger of free radicals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0884533612444135">48</xref></sup> Glutamine is also a fuel source for rapidly dividing cells, such as immune cells and intestinal epithelial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0884533612444135">52</xref></sup> Therefore, glutamine is considered a conditionally essential amino acid during critical illness as the endogenous supply cannot keep up with the metabolic demand. Serum glutamine levels are decreased following cardiac surgery, so providing glutamine supplementation may be beneficial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0884533612444135">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>The effectiveness of glutamine supplementation in cardiac surgery patients varies. One study (n = 27) evaluated postoperative outcomes in patients receiving 0.5 g glutamine dipeptide/kg body weight/d or standard PN for about 12 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0884533612444135">52</xref></sup> The glutamine-supplemented patients had increased serum glutamine levels, reduced incidence of nosocomial infections, and reduced mechanical ventilator days and mortality compared with the patients receiving standard PN. In 2 other studies (n = 78; n = 60), patients received an amino acid infusion containing 0.5 g glutamine/kg body weight/d; an isonitrogenous, isocaloric, isovolemic infusion of amino acids without glutamine; or 0.9% normal saline solution for 3 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0884533612444135">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0884533612444135">53</xref></sup> All infusions were started during cardiac surgery and were continued through postoperative day 3. Serum glutamine levels rose in the supplemented group compared with the other groups in both studies. Other results included for the glutamine-supplemented group compared with the other groups were as follows: elevated glutathione levels but no difference in daily Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA); ICU length of stay; levels of interleukins-1, -6, and -8; tumor necrosis factor; C-reactive protein; or time on mechanical ventilation.</p>
<p>Even though glutamine supplementation in critically ill cardiothoracic patients has shown mixed results, A.S.P.E.N./SCCM guidelines recommend glutamine supplementation for critically ill patients (Grade B for EN; Grade C for PN), citing studies showing reductions in length of hospital and ICU stays, infectious complications, and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612444135">15</xref></sup> The authors of the guidelines acknowledged glutamine’s beneficial roles in maintaining the integrity of the GI tract, inducing the heat shock protein, and providing a fuel source.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612444135">15</xref></sup></p>

<p>Atrial fibrillation is common in cardiothoracic surgery patients, occurring in 20%–40% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0884533612444135">54</xref></sup> Reasons for developing atrial fibrillation include inflammation and oxidative stress in addition to other etiologies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0884533612444135">55</xref></sup> Vitamin C supplementation is associated with preventing atrial fibrillation when prescribed prior to surgery and continued through the postoperative period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0884533612444135">54</xref></sup> One group of authors reviewed numerous studies about the effectiveness of vitamin C in preventing atrial fibrillation and selected 5 that most likely have the best evidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0884533612444135">55</xref></sup> In these studies, patients received 2 g vitamin C within 2 days of cardiac surgery and 1 g vitamin C daily for 1–5 days postoperatively. Vitamin E was also administered in several studies. The incidence of atrial fibrillation decreased in patients receiving vitamin C, and the combination of vitamin C and β-blockers was more effective in prevention than β-blockers alone. Vitamin E had no effect on the incidence of atrial fibrillation. The authors concluded that vitamin C may be effective in reducing the incidence of atrial fibrillation, but better quality studies that are large scale and adequately powered are needed.</p>
<p>Because a variety of antioxidants seem to reduce inflammation and cardiac surgery is a source of severe inflammation, administration of several antioxidants pre- and postoperatively was investigated. In 1 study, patients received 2 g ω-3 fatty acids for 7 days and 1 g vitamin C and 400 IU vitamin E for 2 days prior to cardiac surgery; the supplements were continued in the postoperative period until discharge from the hospital.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0884533612444135">49</xref></sup> Interestingly, the supplemented group had less atrial fibrillation, reduced hospital length of stay, lower C-reactive protein and leukocyte levels, less oxidative myocardial tissue damage, and elevated levels of glutathione compared with the nonsupplemented control group.</p>
<p>Selenium, zinc, and copper are cofactors for enzymes that neutralize reactive oxidative species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0884533612444135">56</xref></sup> Serum levels of these micronutrients were measured in patients (n = 60) before and after cardiac surgery, and levels were significantly lower postoperatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0884533612444135">56</xref></sup> Low selenium levels, but not zinc levels, correlated with an increased incidence of postoperative multiple-organ failure (<italic>P</italic> = .0026) and ICU length of stay. Supplementation of these micronutrients has limited investigation. One study (n = 200) randomized patients to receive 270 µg selenium, 30 mg zinc, 1.1 g vitamin C, and 100 mg vitamin B<sub>1</sub> or a placebo for 5 days following cardiac surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0884533612444135">50</xref></sup> The supplement doses were doubled the first 2 days after surgery. There were no differences in the incidence of AKI, number of ventilator-free days, number of infections, ICU and hospital length of stays, and mortality. However, the change in C-reactive protein indicated that inflammation was reduced in the supplemented group compared with the control group. The authors concluded that antioxidants did not reduce organ failure but did have a desirable impact on inflammation in this patient population.</p>
<p>A.S.P.E.N./SCCM guidelines recommend supplementation of antioxidant vitamins and selenium for critically ill patients (Grade B).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612444135">15</xref></sup> The authors of the guidelines noted improved outcomes in patients receiving mechanical ventilation and sepsis or septic shock.

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Cardiothoracic surgery patients frequently are critically ill. Depending on the type of cardiothoracic procedure performed, normal physiology is skewed and the patient becomes hypercatabolic. Surgery is now more commonly performed on elderly patients who typically have comorbidities that can lead to increased postoperative complications. Malnutrition and/or cardiac cachexia are among these comorbidities. Screening and assessing patients preoperatively for nutrition risk and providing preoperative nutrition therapy are ideal but often not feasible due to unstable angina and other acute coronary syndromes. In these situations, early aggressive nutrition intervention should be a priority in the postoperative patient. EN should be initiated whenever feasible, but in situations where energy requirements cannot be met enterally, PN should be added to avoid excessive caloric deficits. Attention to meticulous metabolic management, including glycemic control, should be certain, and specialized nutrients may be considered. This patient population deserves further investigation for provision of optimal nutrient quantity, quality, and timing.</p>
