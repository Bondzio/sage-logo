<p>This article calls attention to the importance of time as a vantage point from which the intersection between finance, media, and information can be critiqued. The neoliberal temporality is constituted by both abstract time and historical time of the media. The sense of abstract time constructed by financial television is critiqued: the paradox of low production cost of television programs and high commercial value of advertisement spots illustrates the inherent contradictions of capitalism. The existence of financial television relies on the creation of new financial markets and the centralization of information to financial transaction—both phenomenon ought to be understood in the context of the historical time marked by neoliberalism since 1970s.</p>

<p>This article calls attention to a political economic examination of the intersection between finance, media, and information. Existing studies on the relationship between the media and the financial industry respond to the surge of specialist financial, business, and economic (hereafter, financial) media, to the inclusion of financial news in mainstream media, and to the pervasive advertising and marketing of financial products and services. These studies see the rise of financial media as a consequence of the advancement of information technologies, of the acceleration of finance capital, and of the deregulation of the financial sector.</p>
<p>This article critiques the neoliberal temporality through examining how financial television constitutes both historical time and abstract time. Time is a crucial category in Marxian social theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0196859912459654">Heydebrand, 2003</xref>); it serves as a vantage point to critique the inherent contradictions in capitalism: The survival of capitalism relies on the continuous flow of capital, which is threatened by an overaccumulation of surplus commodities, capital, and labor. Massive unemployment and an oversupply of goods are two syndromes of an economic slowdown. To combat the problem of overaccumulation, the expansion of credit to accelerate production and to stimulate consumption has been employed to battle the sluggish economy in the West since the 1970s.</p>
<p>An analysis of the existence, aesthetics, and economy of financial television offers a glimpse of how the notion of time is reconfigured in an economy that is dominated by finance capital. The first sense of time is historical time or the trajectory of capitalism that is regularly punctuated by ruptures. Television is one of the latest platforms to relay financial information. The existence of financial television cannot be solely explained by audience demand or technological advancement; it has to be situated in the evolving nature of capital and financial markets. The technology of information transmission and financial instruments has become more dematerialized; that is, little labor power is used to transform resources into goods. Consequently, prices have become more volatile, making financial markets more like a live spectacle.</p>
<p>Closely related to the notion of historical time is that of abstract time. Abstract time is a quantitative, objective measure of labor time and labor power. To Marx, abstract time is crucial to the process of capital accumulation because the creation of surplus value relies on workers selling their labor time to capitalists. The economy of financial television illustrates that another kind of abstract time dominates labor time—advertising time that is produced during circulation. In fact, television stations employ a number of cost-cutting strategies to ensure that as little labor power be bought as possible.</p>
<p>Marxist political economists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0196859912459654">Foster &amp; Magdoff, 2009</xref>) believe that growing the “real” economy is essential to the sustainability of the overall economy. An analysis of the sense of historical time and abstract time constituted by financial television reveals that media corporations run full steam ahead to the wrong direction. This article therefore aims to first examine the evolution of financial television by contextualizing it as a platform to relay financial information and by situating it in the latest stage of financial markets and, second, understand the abstract time constituted by financial television by focusing on the contradictory cost-cutting and value-maximizing strategies. In the following, literature on media and the financial market is reviewed.</p>
<sec id="section1-0196859912459654">
<title>Literature on Media and the Financial Market</title>
<p>There is a fuzzy line between business, economic, and financial media, often as a matter of emphasis rather than of essence. Financial media are often seen as synonymous with financial press, but they also include advertising and marketing, and information and communication technologies. Existing literature is categorized into three groups: (a) journalistic production of news; (b) content, genre, and rhetoric; and (3) social and financial ramifications.</p>
<p>Financial journalists were once marginalized in news organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0196859912459654">Simons, 1999</xref>). During the Great Depression, there was no news about finance and economics, only news about business and commerce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0196859912459654">Suttles, 2010</xref>). The expansion of finance capital in the 1980s raised the status of financial journalists from the second class to the first. The most ambitious recruits now choose to write about the financial world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0196859912459654">Simons, 1999</xref>). However, the expertise of financial journalists is questioned because they often rely on the opinion and interpretation of financial analysts and experts, and on corporate PR releases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0196859912459654">Doyle, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0196859912459654">Tambini, 2010</xref>). The dependence on corporate PR decreases the diversity of news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0196859912459654">Davis, 2007</xref>). The objectivity of financial journalists is also questioned, given that they sometimes own the stocks that they report on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0196859912459654">Simons, 1999</xref>) and avoid negative news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0196859912459654">Doyle, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0196859912459654">Schiffrin, 2011</xref>). Financial professionals found information from financial media less important than that from analyst reports, fellow professionals, and news wire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0196859912459654">Davis, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0196859912459654">Clark, Thrift, and Tickell (2004)</xref> believe that financial broadcasters and entertainment media producers employ the same tactics, two of which are the hiring of celebrity newscasters, and the embracing of high theatrical and emotional values. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0196859912459654">Corner (1998)</xref> believes that financial television news has its own specific language and imagery. For example, financial news programs are highly statistical, are highly relational (i.e., needs to be situated historically and among other ongoing events), and are lacking direct visualization (e.g., the unemployment rate is illustrated by an image of a job center or a crowd in the street). Adding to both studies, this article points out that the aesthetics and content of financial television are often a result of cost-cutting.</p>
<p>Financial news reflects a dominant economic ideology. Financial news in Australia was framed within a neoclassical economic ideology in the 1970s, monetarism in the 1980s, and neoliberalism in the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0196859912459654">Greenfield, Williams, &amp; Beadnell, 2004</xref>). American press coverage in the 1920s and the 1980s packaged economic ideology as stories that are immediately recognizable and convincing. In both eras, the economy was seen as a self-functioning machine as well as a work of nature with seasonal cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0196859912459654">Suttles, 2010</xref>). Advertising and marketing of financial products reinforce the “ownership society” ideology, in which individuals are asked to be responsible for their financial security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0196859912459654">Greenfield &amp; Williams, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0196859912459654">Chakravarty and Schiller (2010)</xref> noted that print news media shifted their attention to business and finance from economy and society in the mid-1980s. The proliferation of financial media has social and economic implications, such as the creation of the subject position of the audience. The interpellation effect situates the audience member to be an amateur investor who actively follows the economy and makes swift financial decisions. This constructed audience/investor has the “economic man” characteristics: autonomous, calculating, rational, and motivated by self-interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0196859912459654">Greenfield &amp; Williams, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0196859912459654">Hirsto, 2011</xref>). The ideal investor wants instant gratification but is able to defer pleasure and enjoyment for a later day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0196859912459654">Greenfield &amp; Williams, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0196859912459654">Clark et al. (2004)</xref> suggested that the media have changed the financial industry because financial management is conducted under the watchful eyes of the media, the value of financial products is dependent on media images, and new rhetoric is imposed on the financial industry by the media. The media has also changed the type of trust by shifting from a “process-based” to an “institutional-based” trust. Interpersonal relationships are no longer that important because financial media help organizations to establish abstract and impersonal knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0196859912459654">Leyshon, Thrift, &amp; Pratt, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The majority of existing literature has problematized the media as a social institution, a workplace, and a content provider, but it has not problematized the financial market and finance capital. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0196859912459654">Hope (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0196859912459654">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0196859912459654">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0196859912459654">2011</xref>) has filled in the gap by looking at the temporality of finance from a communication perspective. He believes that both finance capital and new information and communication technologies contribute to global capitalism. The notion of “real time” financial information ought to be critiqued as a sociohistorical construct. To Hope, the temporality of global capital flow is at odds with that of the nation-states; thus, the latter cannot plan a long-term capital accumulation. Hope focused on technologies in general rather than one specific medium. Because different media involve different time-specific consumption practices, they constitute different temporalities of the financial markets. By focusing on a time-sensitive medium, this article seeks to understand the neoliberal temporality in cable television.</p>

<title>The Historical Time of the Rise of Financial Media</title>
<p>Financial media proliferated during the 1980s in the context of the financialization of the economy. Two characteristics are the financial sector accounting for a larger percentage of profits in the economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0196859912459654">Krippner, 2011</xref>) and manufacturing companies branching out to the financial sector. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0196859912459654">Martin (2002)</xref> believes that financialization has implications on the perception of the self; it asks individuals to be self-managing, risk-taking entrepreneurs. However, the rise of financial television should not be seen as a novel phenomenon but as the latest stage of information technology.</p>
<p>In the trajectory of capitalism, trading technologies, and financial instruments evolve because of the changing nature of capital. The history of financial television starts with Reuters (now part of the Thomson Reuters Group). The history of Reuters shows that both technologies and financial instruments have become more dematerialized and more devoid of human labor. Furthermore, its history shows how information has become more integral to financial markets. While Reuters can be seen as one of the first companies that provided financial information to professionals the company only self-identified as an information enterprise in the late 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0196859912459654">Read, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The mid-19th century belongs to the first phase of financial globalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0196859912459654">Heydebrand, 2003</xref>). In 1851, Paul Julius Reuter established a firm to transmit prices between stock exchanges in Europe and London. Britain was the leading world’s financial power, as it absorbed exports from the rest of the world. In addition, Bank of England created the “gold standard” by which all monetary transactions and currency exchanges were measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0196859912459654">Arrighi, 1994</xref>). When Reuters was launched, telegram and messenger pigeon were used to transmit information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0196859912459654">Read, 1992</xref>). Both technologies required the attention from a skilled laborer. The financial instruments traded were related to production (i.e. a transformation of natural resources occurs through appropriating labor), such as stocks of companies in transportation and trade.</p>
<p>The year 1914 marked the beginning of the second phase of globalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0196859912459654">Heydebrand, 2003</xref>). During this period, the circulation of finance capital slowed down because of the two world wars and the Great Depression. At the end of World War I, the U.S. economy prospered. US dollar replaced gold standard as the international currency. In 1970s, the Smithsonian Agreement signed at the end of World War II was overturned in order to solve the stagflation problem. The collapse of the Bretton Woods system severed the tie between US dollar and gold standard. The floating exchange rates led to a surge of foreign direct investment. Because foreign money became an instrument to trade, there arose a need for constantly updated exchange rates. Reuters launched the Monitor Terminal, which allowed for the display of prices in different markets (foreign money, commodity, stock and bond, etc.). In fact, the company claimed that it has invented the electronic marketplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0196859912459654">Tunstall &amp; Palmer, 1991</xref>). Later the Monitor Terminal became a dual-use technology that simultaneously displayed prices and facilitated financial transaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0196859912459654">Palmer, Boyd-Barrett, &amp; Rantanen, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The urge to create new financial markets expanded the information network on which the price system is perceived to depend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0196859912459654">Parsons, 1989</xref>). Reuters expanded its business and became a public company in 1984. The company’s competitiveness is reasoned by its early adoption of technologies. However, in 1981, Bloomberg LP was established and the newcomer challenged the domination of Reuters. Former staff members and critics of Reuters believed that the company lost its market shares to Bloomberg because it was slow at adopting advanced communication technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0196859912459654">Bartram, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0196859912459654">Matloff, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The year 1992 marked the beginning of the third phase of financial globalization, which is characterized by global trade liberalization and deregulation of state-owned industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0196859912459654">Heydebrand, 2003</xref>). In 1999, the Glass-Steagall Act of the Great Depression era was repealed, replaced by the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 that allowed commercial banks to become investment banks. Bankers suddenly found themselves flushed with cash to invest. Neoliberalism leads to the financialization of everything (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0196859912459654">Harvey, 2005</xref>). Because investment is more detached from production, anything can be a trading platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0196859912459654">Leyshon &amp; Thrift, 2007</xref>). In 2008, Reuters was acquired by the Thomson Group and became one branch of the information conglomerate. Financial information, to Thomson Reuters, is like any other kinds of information—medical, scientific, education—which exchange value depends on the technologies. At present, the commodity markets (such as the trading of precious metals and food crops) are seen as less exciting than the derivative markets (the trading of repackaged consumer debts and mortgages). To cope with the explosion of information created by and for the financial markets, computing technologies are adopted for writing story updates at Reuters and are used for algorithm trading. Technologies are believed to reduce labor costs and to shorten the time to produce information.</p>
<p>The existence of financial television needs to be understood in the historical time of capitalism, and in the contexts of both the creation of new financial markets and the centralization of information to financial transaction. Its existence cannot be solely explained by cable technology and audience demand. Because of the dematerialization of finance, prices have become more volatile, the rise and fall of prices have become a live spectacle, and the markets have become an object of scrutiny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0196859912459654">Craig, 1999</xref>). Since 1981 when the first financial television FNN was launched, the Dow Jones Index had increased close to 14 folds—from 1,024 to 14,164 points (at the height in 2007) within 26 years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0196859912459654">1</xref></sup> In contrast, it had taken 75 years, from 1906 to 1981, for the Dow Jones Index to increase by 14 times.</p>
<p>The expansion of finance capital has not completely eased the 1970s economic crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0196859912459654">Arrighi, 1994</xref>); instead it has created other problems—the most obvious ones are the unpredictable and large-scale financial market failure. Financial television channels were launched during the “recovery” periods after sudden financial collapses. FNN was launched in 1981, 3 years after the Dow Jones Index plummeted in 1978; CNBC was established in 1989 in the midst of the dotcom boom but after a sharp drop in stock prices in 1988. Last, Bloomberg Television was established in 1994 after a sharp drop in stock prices in 1991. Financial television is created to confirm the spectacular nature of financial markets, not to provide an introspection why they fail. Financial media tend to censor bad news, even during a financial crisis. Financial advisors tend to recommend more buying than selling in their shows. Fox Business wanted to stand apart from its competitor CNBC by providing more optimistic news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0196859912459654">Dana, 2007</xref>)—even though a casual CNBC viewer would not miss the newscasters’ sanguine tone.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the financial television market is tripartitely shared by CNBC (owned by General Electric and Comcast), Bloomberg Television (privately owned by Bloomberg LP), and Fox Business (established in 2007, owned by News Corporation). Among the three, CNBC is available on basic cable in the United States, the other two are available on premium cable packages, and on satellite television in rural areas. Three financial television channels were shut down: FNN (privately owned by Infotechnology) was closed in 1991 after being acquired by NBC, CNNfn (established in 1995, owned by CNN) was shut down in 2004, and Reuters Financial Television (launched in 1994) that was only available to trading floor dealers was halted in 2002 due to high installation fee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0196859912459654">Bartram, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0196859912459654">Craig, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Financial television can be considered a niche media because of the subject matter and the small number of viewers. There is no regular publicly available data of the viewership size. The most watched channel, CNBC, had a daily average of 310,000 viewers in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0196859912459654">Hempel, 2008</xref>). Its top shows, <italic>Mad Money</italic> and <italic>Fast Money</italic>, attracted half a million viewers daily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0196859912459654">Dana, 2007</xref>). In comparison, another niche cable channel, Food Network, consistently draws more than a million viewers daily. However, the actual number of viewers may be much larger because financial television is watched in the workplace—a site where Nielson does not measure.</p>
<p>The financial television market is so small that CNNfn and Fox Business both fared poorly despite being backed by conglomerates. CNNfn never attracted enough audience to have a viewership measurable by Nielson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0196859912459654">Flint, 2000</xref>) and was consequently shut down in 2004. Fox Business only attracted a daily average of 6,300 viewers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0196859912459654">Steinberg &amp; Steler, 2008</xref>). The viewership size of financial television is pale when compared to the readership size of financial papers. The second most read national newspaper in the United States, <italic>The Wall Street Journal</italic>, has a circulation of 1.6 million (or a readership of 6.4 million if each copy is read by four).</p>
<p>The financial television market is noncompetitive with one channel dominating the market. Although channels often describe each other as rivals and competitors, they are also partners who feed business to each other as long as they do not directly compete with each other. One illustrative example is that the content-sharing agreement between CNBC and Dow Jones had not been overturned since News Corporation acquired Dow Jones. In addition, CNBC Asia was once broadcast on STAR TV, which was owned by News Corporation. Publicly traded transnational companies have to maintain an above-average financial performance to attract investors. As a result, financial television stations need to cut cost and to increase commercial value.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0196859912459654">
<title>The Paradox of the Economy of Financial Television: Abstract Time</title>
<p>To Marx, the creation of surplus value relies on the deployment of labor power to transform resources into goods. The adoption of technology only increases productivity, but not surplus value. Media executives believe the otherwise: that surplus value is created through consumption, not through production. To frame it in a temporal term, as little labor time as possible is bought to produce content, but as much commercial time as possible is created. To critique the sense of abstract time in financial television, it is imperative to first review the relation between value, time, and labor.</p>
<p>From a historical materialist approach, labor, time, and value are not discrete but are dialectical. Each of the three concepts has a duality: concrete labor versus abstract labor, general time versus abstract time, and use value versus exchange value. While concrete labor, general time, and use value are qualitative, abstract labor, abstract time, and exchange value are quantitative. When labor is sold to capitalists, it becomes a commodity which value is measured by time. The exchange value of labor time is objective. A laborer who works twice as fast as others is more valuable. In turn, once time is quantitatively measured, it becomes a commodity. Socially necessary labor time is a standard-setting yardstick: “It is the labour-time required to produce any use value under the prevailing socially normal conditions of production and with the prevalent socially average degree of skill and intensity of labor” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0196859912459654">Postone, 1993</xref>, p. 190). Because abstract time is socially and historically constructed, a rupture in a socioeconomic system challenges a conceived notion of abstract time. Using a sluggish economy as an excuse, neoliberal technocrats devalue labor time and overvalue consumption time. Media executives place their faith in neoclassical economics (aka supply-side and exchange-based economics), which is reflected from the temporality of financial television.</p>
<sec id="section4-0196859912459654">
<title>Low Production Cost</title>
<p>Launching a new channel does not mean the parent media company would hire extra labor to produce 24-hour new programming. Cost-cutting tactics include content sharing, repetitive formatting, recycling old materials, globalizing operation, and highlighting well-known television personae.</p>
<p>The parent companies of CNBC, Fox Business, and Bloomberg Television had already owned either television channels or financial information services (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0196859912459654">Table 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0196859912459654">Parsons (1989)</xref> suggested that the financial newspaper is increasingly seen as a source of data for the economic communication network, not just a product on a printed page. When Fox Business was launched in 2007, News Corporation was in negotiations with the Bancroft family about acquiring Dow Jones. At that time, News Corporation had no financial newspaper. Buying Dow Jones opened up two income streams for the company. First, News Corporation is to profit from <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic>, which remains a profitable newspaper and maintains a subscription-based website. Second, News Corporation is to launch a new financial television channel that may reuse the materials produced by the newly acquired paper. Needless to say, Fox TV uses content from <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic>.</p>

<p>Financial information companies are expanding into the media markets, and media companies are expanding to provide financial information services. Bloomberg LP was already an established financial information company that provides terminals to institutional investors before it moved to the media market. On the other side, CNBC ventured into the financial business by buying an electronic stock exchange that matches buyers with sellers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0196859912459654">Ip &amp; Beatty, 1999</xref>). News Corporation, now the owner of Dow Jones news wire, was said to have plans to move aggressively into the business of financial information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0196859912459654">Peers, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Content sharing by setting up agreements with other news organizations is a tactic to lower costs. CNBC has content sharing agreements with the <italic>New York Times</italic> and Dow Jones Co. (owner of <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic> and <italic>Barron’s</italic>). Because News Corporation bought Dow Jones in 2007 it is unclear whether Dow Jones would continue supplying news to CNBC when the agreement expires in 2012. Therefore, CNBC was in negotiations with London-based <italic>Financial Times</italic> for content sharing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0196859912459654">Patrick, 2007</xref>). Producing original content, apparently, is not considered a viable option for CNBC. An implication of content sharing is that in the name of flexible labor, journalists have to produce materials for different platforms. For example, when Dow Jones launched Asia Business Network in 1993, print journalists of <italic>Wall Street Journal Asia</italic> and <italic>Far East Economic Review</italic> were required to work for the new television channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0196859912459654">Shrikhande, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0196859912459654">Miller (2006)</xref> pointed out the dire working conditions of cable news journalists: “Cable news has pioneered nonunionized, multitasked, low-wage news labor, with workers required to write, speak, and appear in multifarious formats and genres, without increases in numbers, resources, or pay scales” (p. 20).</p>
<p>The second tactic to cut cost is to use repetitive formatting and to recycle old materials. CNBC, Fox Business, and Bloomberg TV are all 24-hour channels, but there is hardly enough material to fill the weekday programming, let alone the weekend one when the stock markets are closed. All prime time programs take place inside the studio from 6.00 a.m. to 8.00 p.m. The studio scenes are regularly cut to reporters stationed in the White House and on the New York Stock Exchange trading floor. Because the program format is essentially the same, the shows blend into one. Non–prime time slots during the week are filled with reruns and recaps. During the weekend, financial television is a wasteland with endless reruns. CNBC only has 2.5 hours of new programs during the weekend; the remaining hours are filled with reruns and paid programming. Fox Business has no new program during the weekend.</p>
<p>CNBC produces “original” documentaries in the style of investigative journalism. But these documentaries are hardly results of years of muckraking. They repackage old footage from the NBC library with newly conducted interviews and narration by CNBC anchors. When CNBC had the lowest rating in 2001 after the dotcom bust, the airtime was filled with programs that had no relationship to finance, such as reruns of National Geographic and sports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0196859912459654">Beatty, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0196859912459654">Lewis (2010)</xref> said television news is about newness, not about new ideas. The format of financial television is tediously conventional. It relies on formats that have been proven harmless in other kinds of television. Many breaking news stories are predictable, routine, and repetitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0196859912459654">Lewis, Cushion, &amp; Thomas, 2005</xref>). It presents the familiar rather than the obscure. Two television executives once rightfully said: “Business news is general news” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0196859912459654">Dana, 2007</xref>); “we covered the markets just like a sporting event all day long” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0196859912459654">Pope, 1998</xref>). The convention of reporting finance is the conventions of general news and sports.</p>
<p>The third tactic to cut cost is globalizing operation. While globalization is viewed as an expansion of space, it is also an expansion of time. Time difference between countries allows capital to move continuously. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0196859912459654">Harvey (2010)</xref> calls globalization a spatial fix to the problem of capital accumulation. The constant search for new markets eases the woe of excessive surplus. Globalization is also a temporal fix because time difference is exploited to speed up production and to increase productivity. Outsourcing and just-in-time production are two examples of a temporal fix. A 24-hour news cycle relies on a continuous supply of news from other countries. Bloomberg TV has a more global financial market outlook than CNBC and Fox Business. Reporters from rented studios in London and Hong Kong update the European and Asian markets from midnight to morning during the week. In the early evening, it provides news from the West Coast studio. Globalizing operation does not necessarily lead to globalized content because the news reporting convention is the same. Similarly, content produced in North America can be replayed in overseas stations that are owned by the parent companies and partner organizations.</p>
<p>The last money-saving tactic is to emphasize the high-profile cast and television personae even though they occupy very little airtime. Their shows are strategically placed in nontrading hours to boost ratings during periods of slow traffic. As a result, their shows are repeatedly run. For example, CNBC airs personal finance “guru” Suze Orman’s talk show during the weekend. The same show will be rerun 4 more times in North America, 3 times in Asia, and 6 times in Australia during the same weekend. To attract an audience who may not habitually watch financial television, Fox Business signed a deal with controversial radio talk show host Don Imus in 2009 to boost the early morning ratings (CNBC has 10 times as many viewers as Fox Business for that time slot). Imus, who is known as a conservative commentator, is not commonly regarded as a financial expert. His presence is as bizarre as the talk show host Charlie Rose on Bloomberg TV in the weekday evening.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0196859912459654">
<title>High Commercial Value</title>
<p>Despite the low production value of financial television, its commercial spots have a hefty price tag. CNBC is the second most profitable among all NBC Universal channels because commercial spots on the channel are expensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0196859912459654">Hempel, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The abstract time of circulation is independent of how hard and how intense the television workers labor but is dependent of how affluent the audience is presumed to be. On the other hand, renowned news anchors and high-profile talk show hosts are compensated in a different way from workers such as news directors, camera operators, and electricians. They are not paid by how much time they work, but by how large an audience their names can draw. Moreover, to financial advisors like Suze Orman and Jim Cramer, television is another platform for them to enhance the star expert status so that they can sell more books, DVDs, and tickets to speaking events.</p>
<p>The blindspot debate has questioned what television stations sell to advertisers. It has been agreed that time, value, and labor are related even though there has not been an agreement on how these three concepts should be understood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0196859912459654">Smythe (1977)</xref> suggested that the advertisers buy the audience commodity as both products and labor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0196859912459654">Jhally (1982)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0196859912459654">Jhally and Livant (1986)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0196859912459654">Livant (1982)</xref> suggested that the media sell objective time to advertisers and that both the audience and the networks produce the commodity audience’s watching time. Last, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0196859912459654">Maxwell (1991)</xref> suggested that advertisers buy the imaginary price of the audience commodity. This article concurs with Maxwell that the audience—as an aggregate—is the imaginary commodity that TV executives sell to advertisers.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, financial television is a niche media. A few television channels folded despite being backed by conglomerates. Popular demand does not explain why financial television exists, the imaginary audience commodity does. The audience commodity is created through financial television supplying abstract time for advertisers to buy.</p>
<p>The value of the audience commodity can be extracted by highlighting the affluence of the audience. Bloomberg Television said their viewers have “high index in areas that matter most,” which are the job title CEO and an individual income of US$200K and above. The majority of financial website users are highly desired by advertisers: male who are between 25 and 54, highly educated, and with an above-average median household income. The <italic>normative</italic> user however fares much better than the average viewer. The benchmarks that CNN Money sets for the normative users are those with a household income above US$150K, those with a portfolio valued more than 1 million dollar, those who own securities, and those who own a platinum credit card. Although only a small percentage of visitors fit into the above criteria, CNN Money implies that only those viewers matter. Much as the mainstream media construct the <italic>middle-class American</italic>, the financial media create the <italic>top 1% American</italic>. Because financial news broadcast allows the audience to imagine living in the same world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0196859912459654">Martin, 2002</xref>), viewers may feel they belong to the world of the 1%.</p>
<p>The value of the audience commodity can be further extracted by promising the undivided attention of the audience members. Exclusive ad, or “road block” as the industry calls it, ensures undivided attention. An online brokerage company, Ameritrade, bought all commercial breaks for 1.5 hours on CNBC and its competitor Bloomberg TV.</p>
<p>Undivided attention can also be achieved through crowding out competitors. Financial television understands that TV distributors play a paramount role in deciding what the viewers watch. The first ever financial television FNN had an audience size comparable to today’s CNBC. In 1989, when newcomer CNBC was launched, it leveraged the power of its parent company and signed an agreement with a few cable operators. This resulted in FNN being dropped by some cable operators and losing 2 million subscribers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0196859912459654">Cox, 1989a</xref>). FNN was brought back by some operators after viewers complained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0196859912459654">Cox, 1989b</xref>). One year into operation, CNBC had less than half of FNN subscribers, so it offered an incentive to cable operators by paying 3 dollars per subscriber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0196859912459654">Goldman, 1990</xref>). In 1996, when another outsider and newcomer, Bloomberg TV, was launched, Time Warner Cable refused to carry it in the New York City market. The then mayor Rudy Giuliani lobbied to carry Bloomberg TV as government programming in New York City public television (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0196859912459654">Levy, 1996</xref>). Time Warner Cable threatened to discontinue broadcasting in the city if Bloomberg was aired on a government channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0196859912459654">Jensen, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>When a media conglomerate launches a new cable channel it wants to ensure that the new channel is blessed by cable operators. In 1985, when CNN planned to launch CNNfn, it formed a board consisting of big cable carriers, including Time Warner and Comcast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0196859912459654">Brannigan &amp; Robichaux, 1995</xref>). Similarly, when News Corporation investigated a launch of Fox Business, it wanted to ensure Time Warner cable would carry it in the New York City market.</p>
<p>Television stations create more abstract time by blending content with advertising and by delivering the same content across platforms. Infomercials help to create more abstract time by blending commercial with editorial contents. In 1996 during the high-tech boom, IBM sponsored a documentary series called <italic>Scan</italic>, which celebrates the positive impact of technology on people’s lives. The production board consisted of IBM, the advertising agency Ogilvy and Mather, and NBC. The documentary series shared the same theme with a concurrent IBM advertising campaign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0196859912459654">Beatty, 1996</xref>). Presumably, experts on CNBC also pushed high-tech stocks during the boom. When being questioned the series being an infomercial, CNBC defended the editorial independence of the series.</p>
<p>Last, online presence matters to financial media because the Internet appears to create seamless abstract time by making the content available to anyone who has access to the Internet. After the shutdown of CNNfn cable channel, CNN retained the CNN Money website. Even though websites attract more traffic than cable television, visitors spend less time on any single website. The average visitor only spends 6 minutes on Fox <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Business.com">Business.com</ext-link> and 12 minutes on CNN Money.com <italic>per month</italic>. In order to ensure visitors notice the advertisements, sponsors’ names are placed next to the information that matters, namely stock quotes, major indices, interest rates, and job advertisements. Breaking news and headlines attract no sponsorship. To ensure more online traffic, financial media deliver their content on new platforms such as iPad and Android phone. As Fox Business.com suggested, the ads will connect the audience wherever they are: “at home, at work, online, on the go, and around the world.” Advertisements no longer passively wait to be watched, they actively follow the viewers from television to the Internet and on to the mobile device.</p>
<p>Although financial television attracts a small-size audience when compared to other cable television channels, media executives create more abstract time by moving content online, by blending advertising with editorial content, and by crowding out competitors. In addition, more value is extracted by highlighting the wealth of the viewers.</p>
<p>The economy of financial television may be similar to that of other cable channels: keeping production cost low and selling advertising time dear are the dual strategies to create surplus value. The only anomaly in the landscape of financial television in the United State is the existence of the privately owned Bloomberg Television. Instead of seeing Bloomberg as a challenger to the established power in the industry, it is more useful to see how media, information, and technologies companies collude by crossing over into each other’s industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0196859912459654">Craig, 2001</xref>). Bloomberg Media (consists of television, radio, magazine) are more like the promotional and branding tool of the company. Crossing over to the consumer market costs the company nearly nothing as it already has the labor and the infrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0196859912459654">Freeland, 2010</xref>). The company gave <italic>New York Times</italic> and other news organizations the pricey Bloomberg Terminal in exchange for having its name mentioned in the mainstream media. The majority of Bloomberg revenue comes from the sales of financial information, analysis, and business “solutions” to the financial sector. The crossing of a financial information company over to the terrain of the media market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0196859912459654">Palmer et al., 1998</xref>) and vice versa may show that financial information is a valuable commodity.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>This article calls attention to time as an analytical concept to understand the intersection between finance, media, and information. Because the expansion of credit is a temporal fix to the problem of capital overaccumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0196859912459654">Harvey, 1982</xref>), it is of interest to analyze financial television as both a content provider and an economic institution. This article looks at the notions of historical time and abstract time that financial television constitutes to the neoliberal ideology. Financial television ought to be understood in relation to other technologies and institutions that relay financial information. The existence of financial television reinforces that financial markets are a live spectacle. The evolution of financial media shows that the technologies to transmit information and the financial instruments traded are increasingly dematerialized. The economy of financial television is characterized with low production cost and high commercial value. Television executives believe that surplus value is created by selling advertising time—a kind of abstract time of circulation.</p>
<p>The neoclassical economic assumption that surplus value is created at the end of consumption urges political economists to rethink Marx’s notion of abstract time in the neoliberal ideology. From the standpoint of labor, abstract time is a social construct. The survival of capitalism relies on the constant transformation of resources; therefore, concrete labor has to be commodified into abstract labor, and general time has to be commodified into abstract time. As a commodity, abstract labor time is assigned with an exchange value, which is the sum of surplus value and the price at which labor is bought by the capitalists, which in turn is the cost that is “necessary to maintain and reproduce the life of the worker and the subsistence of labor, in general” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0196859912459654">Heydebrand, 2003</xref>, p. 151).</p>
<p>However, the standpoint of labor has its own limitation. Marx’s conceptualization of abstract time is necessarily embedded in the labor process. He did not conceptualize abstract time as one of circulation. This kind of abstract time is independent of the labor process: How hard and how long a camera operator works has little bearing on how much a commercial spot is sold. However, the abstract time of circulation has implications on the abstract labor time: The livelihood of a camera operator may be endangered if the advertising rate is low.</p>
<p>Marxist scholars overlook the abstract value of circulation because to Marx, labor—more precisely manual labor—is the only source to create surplus value. As such, workers are the only kind of productive workers. Hinted at in <italic>Capital</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0196859912459654">Marx, 1894/1999</xref>) and elaborated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0196859912459654">Baran and Sweezy (1966)</xref>, professionals in the industries of marketing, advertising, accounting, and finance are unproductive workers because their work is counted as transaction costs that absorb the surplus value produced by laborers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0196859912459654">Harvey, 1982</xref>) and because their work does not create new value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0196859912459654">Chernomas &amp; Baragar, 2011</xref>). In this sense, workers are exploited twice: the first time by the industrialists who own the means of production and the capitalists who buy the abstract labor time, and the second time by the financiers who want the capitalists to repay the loans in a shorter time frame. In a financialized economy, the integration of production and finance capital means that workers need to intensify their production so that publicly traded companies can report healthy profits.</p>
<p>The claim that advertising and financial professionals are unproductive workers is refuted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0196859912459654">Schiller (2007)</xref>. He argued that many professionals in the “surplus eater” categories are self-employed individuals who broker services to capital in exchange for money. Moreover, information workers of specialized service corporations are productive wage laborers. Although Schiller has pointed out how information workers produce surplus value, a time perspective would show how the wealth creation process of information workers differs from that of manual workers.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, “socially necessary labor time” is the abstract time required to produce use value under a normal circumstance with socially average degree of skills and intensity of labor. While entry-level salaried information workers (such as bank tellers and data entry workers) sell their abstract labor based on the time that they work, the top-level professionals are not compensated based on the number of hours that they work. Hedge fund managers, investment bankers, famed talk show hosts, and renowned news anchors are compensated with bonuses and commission. Furthermore, they make money from endorsement and sponsorship. Do these top earners make more money because they have above-than-average skills and they work more intensely? Moreover, how can the surplus value produced by these top earners be measured? Both questions point out that the sense of abstract time in the financial and media industries is different from that in material production. However, rather than suggesting that the concept of abstract time does not apply to nonmaterial production, it can be suggested that abstract time is an ideology in itself; it was made objective and was naturalized to be a yardstick to measure value.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0196859912459654">Harvey (2010)</xref> suggested, abstract labor is measured by a “phantom-like objectivity”: Who is to suggest that the exchange value of the labor time of a factory worker is lower than that of an investment banker? If labor time is measured by the social value that a worker produces, a factory worker may have a much higher exchange value than an investment banker. The time of an investment banker appears to be more valuable than that of a worker because the notion of abstract time—as an objective measurement—has masked the unequal power relationships between the wealthy and the nonwealthy. Because time is a resource that every social being has and experiences, time, in addition to labor, provides a clearer picture of social relationships in a financialized economy.</p>
