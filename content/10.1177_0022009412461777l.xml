<sec id="sec1-0022009412461777l"><title>Rana Mitter, <italic>Modern China: A Very Short Introduction</italic>, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2008, 153 pp.; US$11.95; ISBN 9780199228027</title>
<p>Anyone with an interest in China, and anyone who teaches about China, knows the importance of a brief and reliable introduction to the topic of contemporary China. For the last few years students have turned up for university classes painfully misled having read either Jung Chang and Jon Halliday’s <italic>Mao: The Unknown Story</italic> for the most recent period of China’s history, or Gavin Menzies’s <italic>1421: The Year China Discovered the World</italic>, and sometimes both, but thinking they are properly and fully informed. This book is not only a far more reliable overview, and the product of a serious historian, but it is an immensely enjoyable read.</p>
<p>Those who engage professionally in China Studies have long come in one of two types: those for whom China ended in 1911, with the end of the imperial system, and the fading out of the customs and practices that had previously characterized its social and political system; and those for whom China only begins in 1912, when the term China was first used formally by the state to describe itself as the Republic was declared, and as modernist ideas, especially those with Western origins began to have purchase. Indeed, there have been many for whom China can only be either Chinese or modern, but not both. One of the great strengths of Rana Mitter’s introduction is to demonstrate that this is essentially a false dichotomy. The attempt to introduce the modern – notions of progress, industrialization, rationality and self-awareness – into China has been a major theme in its development since the late nineteenth century. But it has inevitably been overlaid on and merged with different aspects of Chineseness in various ways, and it is these syntheses which are more interesting. At the same time, there were many modern characteristics of the earlier Imperial system, including the development of bureaucracy, meritocracy in government appointments and a commercial economy.</p>
<p>The book opens with a discussion of the meaning of both China and the modern. Rana Mitter makes the not unimportant point that ‘China is a continent not just a country. It is a series of identities, some shared, some differentiated, and some contradictory: modern, Confucian, authoritarian, democratic, free, and restrained. Above all, China is a plural noun’ (11). He then goes on in the same chapter to discuss the dimensions of the modern, avoiding the simple equation with recent times.</p>
<p>Two chapters follow next on the political history of China. The first starts with the interaction between the countries of the West and China in the nineteenth century and goes through to the assumption of power in the Republic of China by Chiang Kai-shek. The second of these two chapters starts in 1928 and takes the reader into the reform era of the last three decades. One of the great services the book performs for the early reader on China is to highlight the extent to which both Communists and Nationalists had similar goals in terms of their goals for modern Chinese nationalism. The observation that ‘the Communist Party of today has essentially created the state sought by the progressive wing of the Nationalists in the 1930s rather than the dominant, radical Communists of the 1960s’ (73) is convincing enough. But even 30 years after the Cultural Revolution and 20 years after the end of the Cold War it remains slightly provocative to give pause for thought.</p>
<p>Three final chapters look in turn at each of society, economy and culture, exploring the interplay of the modern and the pre-modern. The narrative emphasizes the dynamic of the various processes that have integrated China into itself, as well as into the global since the later nineteenth century. There is room here for compelling observations about some aspects of modern China’s history that are more usually less developed in other accounts. These include the impact of war on China’s development from the mid-nineteenth century through to the establishment of the People’s Republic in 1949, which was both a catalyst for change and a significant brake on the modern nationalist project. They also include discussion of the extent to which Mao’s approach to economic development, despite its limitations, nonetheless laid the foundations for the later remarkable economic growth of the last three decades; and the chapter on culture deals not only with literature and art, but also with the more recent development of film and television, which highlights the impact of global influences on China.</p>
<p>Writing a short introduction is inherently difficult and Rana Mitter has provided such an excellent service that it might seem somewhat churlish to be a little particular about any of his observations. Nonetheless there were a couple that seemed strangely out of place, and which remain a puzzle. It is claimed that China now, like China a hundred years ago, is characterized by political instability and economic crisis (5). Between 1949 and Mao’s death in 1976 there was certainly a high degree of political instability. All the same, this has been replaced by an equally high degree of policy consistency and political institutionalisation during the last three decades, albeit in a changing system. Even stranger is the claim of economic crisis. China’s GDP has grown at 9–10 per cent per annum for three decades. During that same period Mexico’s GDP, another hopefully developing economy, also experimenting with institutional reform and global integration has grown at 0.9 per cent per annum.</p>
