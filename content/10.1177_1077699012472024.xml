<p>It is easy to get caught up in the idea that the Internet has changed everything. Despite regularly assigning my History of Journalism students Michael Schudson’s 1997 <italic>JMCQ</italic> article, “Toward a Troubleshooting Manual for Journalism History,” I still occasionally find myself unconsciously arguing for the technological determinism of the Internet and, increasingly, smartphones.</p>
<p>But I think I’ve turned the corner after reading the engaging <italic>Amateur Images and Global News</italic>, edited by Kari Andén-Papadopoulos and Mervi Pantti. Andén-Papadopoulos is an associate professor in the Department of Journalism, Media and Communication at Stockholm University, and Pantti is an associate professor in the Department of Social Research, Media and Communication Studies at the University of Helsinki. Their carefully selected chapters historicize and contextualize the use and circulation of amateur photographs in a nuanced way that ultimately leads to more provocative questions not about how the Internet has supported amateur photographers, but about how the web has changed and will continue to change the distribution and meaning of amateur and professional photographers alike.</p>
<p>The book begins with three chapters exploring the historical use of amateur photographs in the pre-Internet, pre-video era. For example, in chapter 1, Karin Becker describes how private family photos of Titanic victims were incorporated into mainstream newspapers. Then Stuart Allan describes the early history of war reporting in a chapter that will become required reading the next time I teach journalism history. Allan’s contribution, paired with Liam Kennedy’s later chapter on the distribution of personal photos by soldiers in the war in Iraq, highlights that although pocket cameras have been marketed to soldiers since World War I, authorship is now more transparent and mechanisms of distribution and publication are more diverse.</p>
<p>Part II of the book, which includes a chapter by the editors on the incorporation of citizen footage of Iran’s Green Movement in the international press, presents a series of case studies on how various news organizations organize and describe amateur photographs and videos. Here the establishment of journalistic authority is expressed vis-à-vis the contributions of eyewitness amateurs, whose pictures may lack the aesthetic quality of professional journalists.</p>
<p>Finally, part III includes contributions on the dissemination of citizen media and their interpretation by audiences. We learn that, in general, audiences are more supportive of citizen journalists than the mainstream media. Liina Puustinen and Janne Seppänen conclude in chapter 10 that audience reading of user-generated content as more authentic “reflects a more profound cultural condition in which authenticity works as a part of late modern life politics.” While this logic jives with the recent popularity of plainspoken politicians—particularly in the United States, as the authors point out—audiences may fail to understand how the process by which amateur images appear in the mainstream press is still guided by professional journalism norms like editing and framing, which was the subject of part II. Indeed, one thing I appreciated immensely about this book is how each section was clearly defined by theme (“Histories,” “Practices,” and “Circulations”), yet each chapter felt informed by every other one in the book.</p>
<p>While overall I found <italic>Amateur Images and Global News</italic> provocative and informative, I finished it contemplating a couple of curious omissions. First, the book might as well have had the subtitle “Case Studies on Violence and Tragedy.” All of the case studies looked at violent events, like natural disasters and school shootings. Even more, in all these cases, the emphasis was on disturbing or eyewitness use of amateur photos. What is the commemorative role of amateur photographs in the aftermath of a tragedy, for example? Can they be cathartic and build community? More broadly, what are some positive or even more mundane uses of amateur photographs?</p>
<p>Another related area for future improvement concerns the media analyzed in the case studies. CNN’s iReport appears several times; a wider breadth of examples would have been useful. I also would have liked a better sense of whether the editors and authors thought the cases studied were exceptional, or indicative of larger trends.</p>
<p>Finally, the most curious omission in the book is a critical discussion of the role of nationality in citizen reporting. Although I did not mind that many of the studies were Scandinavian in origin, I wondered how or if national identity played a role, for example, in the narratives mainstream media weaved around user contributions and/or how audiences interpreted the use of such images. Many of the case studies, after all, looked at events related to national identity, such as war reporting or Iran’s Green Movement. Because research has emphasized the media’s role in reinforcing national identity, particularly in relationship to big media events such as the ones described, the case studies presented seem to beg a discussion of nationality.</p>
<p>This criticism aside, I appreciated the perspectives shared in <italic>Amateur Images and Global News</italic>. Taken together, the chapters pick up familiar themes relating to amateur images, such as aesthetic quality, authority, and eyewitnessing, but put them together in a series of applied case studies that ultimately provide a rich and fresh analysis to what turns out to be an old practice.</p>
