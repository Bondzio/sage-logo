<abstract>
<p>National Basketball Association home teams produce more defense and more wins the more consecutive games they play at home, suggesting home games serve as on-the-job training for future games during the same homestand. Home teams produce less defense and fewer wins the more days off during a homestand, suggesting training intensity increases productivity. A possible explanation is that teams develop communication skills specific to their home environments and/or adapt to referee bias toward home teams as homestands progress. Homestand training significantly weakens as the season progresses. Visiting teams show similar, but weaker, training effects with respect to roadtrip length and productivity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The human capital model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527002511433856">Becker, 1964</xref>) theorizes that on-the-job training increases worker productivity, thereby increasing worker wages. Early empirical studies of human capital theory seemed to support its validity: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527002511433856">Mincer (1974)</xref> found that wages indeed rose with labor market experience (a proxy for general on-the-job training), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527002511433856">Mincer and Jovanovic (1981)</xref> found that wages rose with both firm tenure (a proxy for firm-specific training) and labor market experience. Later, theoretical models like the agency theory of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527002511433856">Lazear (1979)</xref> noted, though, that wages could grow with job tenure for reasons unrelated to worker productivity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1527002511433856">
1
</xref></sup> Empirical studies of human capital were challenged by these alternative models: Since wage changes did not necessarily reflect productivity changes, regressing wages on measures of experience or tenure was an insufficient test of human capital theory.</p>
<p>More advanced empirical analyses of human capital theory required more accurate measures of worker productivity. In the labor economics literature, such analyses have been fairly rare and give the theory mixed support. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527002511433856">Medoff and Abraham (1980)</xref> found that tenure with a firm did not significantly improve a subjective (supervisor-based) measure of productivity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527002511433856">Flabbi and Ichino (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527002511433856">Dong, Jones, and Kato (2007)</xref> found that tenure with a firm did not significantly improve more objective measures of worker productivity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527002511433856">Hellerstein, Neumark, and Troske (1999)</xref>, though, imputed worker productivity from plant-based data and determined that higher wages for older workers were correlated with higher productivity.</p>
<p>Finding accurate measures of productivity can be difficult for labor economists, but productivity data are readily available in sports economics, and much sports economics research has found that experience increases labor productivity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527002511433856">Kahn (2006)</xref> found that head coaches in the National Basketball Association (NBA) had higher winning percentages the more years they had coached either as an NBA assistant or as a professional head coach in a non-NBA league, even when controlling for their career winning percentage as an NBA head coach. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527002511433856">Sommers (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527002511433856">Fair (2008)</xref> found that baseball players' batting averages rose over their first several years in the major leagues, even when controlling for individual ability. Other research has found insignificant effects of on-the-job training on productivity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527002511433856">Berri, Schmidt, and Brook (2006)</xref> did not find significant evidence that NBA players improved early in their careers. Neither <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527002511433856">Kahn (2006)</xref> nor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527002511433856">Berri et al. (2006)</xref> found that NBA head coaches with more NBA head coaching experience won more games.</p>
<p>This article furthers the research of on-the-job training in sports. Unlike the previously mentioned articles, it examines within-season, <italic>immediate</italic> changes in labor productivity rather than between-season changes in productivity. Fixed-effects estimations show that the defensive production of an NBA home team significantly increases the more consecutive games it has played in its home arena. This suggests that individual home games train NBA teams for subsequent games played during the same uninterrupted homestand. But defensive production of home teams worsens the more days a homestand lasts, controlling for the number of games the homestand lasts. This result indicates that on-the-job training <italic>intensity</italic>—the frequency of actual games played during a homestand—is positively correlated with defensive production, that is, the more days off a team has had during a homestand, the less intense its recent on-the-job training has been, and the more its productivity has depreciated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1527002511433856">
2
</xref></sup> These significant changes in defensive production translate into significant changes in home team win production. Effects remain significant when controlling for the number of games played in recent days and weeks. Further estimations reveal that effects significantly weaken as the season progresses, suggesting a concave training profile like that espoused by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527002511433856">Becker (1964)</xref>.</p>
<p>Since the training is significant for defense only, the observed training must be related to factors that disproportionately affect defensive production. One possible explanation is that, over a homestand, teams develop communication skills suited to their home arena and its specific level of crowd noise. Another possible explanation is that teams adjust defensively to referees' pro-home-team bias, which also has been shown to vary with crowd noise.</p>
<p>The effects of roadtrip length on visiting teams' defensive production mimic the effects of homestand length on home teams' defensive production but are weaker. They do not translate into changes in win production nor do they significantly change over the course of the season.</p>
<p>The rest of this article is organized as follows: Theoretical Model section outlines a theoretical model. Data section details the data set and lists summary statistics. Empirical Strategy section discusses the empirical strategy, and Results section discusses results. Conclusion section concludes.</p>

<p>Some <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1527002511433856">Table 1</xref> values of variables are transformed when estimating <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1527002511433856">Equation 2</xref>. GAMES variables are transformed into their natural logs, resulting in HOME_LN_GAMES and VISITOR_LN_GAMES variables. CUMDIST variables are also transformed into their natural logs, resulting in HOME_LN_CUMDIST and VISITOR_LN_CUMDIST. The integer value of 1 is added to the arguments of LN_CUMDIST variables to permit identification of all observations.</p>
<p>Factors involving the team’s most recent game, which may be heavily correlated with fatigue and recovery, are separated from the other homestand/roadtrip factors. That is, HOMESTAND_DAYS_SO_FAR is taken net of HOME_DAYS_SINCE, ROADTRIP_DAYS_SO_FAR is taken net of VISITOR_DAYS_SINCE, and ROADTRIP_DIST_SO_FAR is taken net of VISITOR_DIST. Homestand/roadtrip TO_GO variables are included in the right-hand side to capture whether the anticipated length of a homestand/roadtrip affects team production of offense, defense, and wins.</p>
<p>For each NBA team in each season, the α<sub>
<italic>ht</italic>
</sub> (home teams) and γ<sub>
<italic>vt</italic>
</sub> (visiting teams) represent fixed effects capturing unobserved team quality, that is, each team’s season-specific average performance. Having both α<sub>
<italic>ht</italic>
</sub> and γ<sub>
<italic>vt</italic>
</sub> allows a team’s quality to vary by its status as a home or road team, for example, the effect of the 1990-1991 Chicago Bulls as a home team is included in α<sub>
<italic>ht</italic>
</sub>, but their effect as a visiting team is included in γ<sub>
<italic>vt</italic>
</sub>. This controls for teams with strong home-court advantages or poor road performances. Team fixed effects vary over seasons because of personnel changes and factors such as stadium changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1527002511433856">Quinn, Bursik, Borick, &amp; Raethz, 2003</xref>). By including fixed effects for each home team and each visiting team, and by classifying dependent variables as applying to either the home team or the visiting team, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1527002511433856">Equation 2</xref> accounts for home-court advantage per se, whatever its causes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527002511433856">Moskowitz &amp; Wertheim, 2011</xref>). ϵ<sub>
<italic>ghvt</italic>

<p>When the dependent variables are HOME_SCORE and VISITOR_SCORE, estimations of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1527002511433856">Equation 2</xref> are performed using a two-equation Seemingly Unrelated Regression system to account for game-specific correlations in the error terms, with α<sub>
<italic>ht</italic>
</sub> and γ<sub>
<italic>vt</italic>
</sub> being estimated via vectors of dummy variables on the right-hand side. When the dependent variable is HOME_WIN, the estimation is an ordinary least squares linear probability model with standard errors robust to heteroskedasticity, and α<sub>
<italic>ht</italic>
</sub> and γ<sub>
<italic>vt</italic>
</sub> are estimated via vectors of dummy variables on the right-hand side. A linear probability model is used because the 915 variables on the right-hand-side render convergence in a probit or logit maximum likelihood estimation difficult.</p>

<p>The column 2 coefficient on HOMESTAND_GAMES_SO_FAR shows that home teams produce significantly more defense—about 0.5 fewer points allowed—for each consecutive game they have played at home. HOMESTAND_DAYS_SO_FAR in column 2 shows that home teams produce significantly less defense—about 0.2 more points allowed—for each consecutive day they have spent at home (net of the days since their most recent game). Column 3 shows that these effects on production of defense significantly affect home teams' win production. Home teams produce significantly <italic>more</italic> defense and <italic>more</italic> wins the more consecutive <italic>games played</italic> at home, but significantly <italic>less</italic> defense and <italic>fewer</italic> wins the more consecutive <italic>days spent</italic> at home.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1527002511433856">

</xref></sup> That each additional consecutive game played in a team’s home arena improves defense and win production suggests that home games serve as on-the-job training for future games during the same homestand. That each additional homestand day where a game is <italic>not</italic> played depreciates the home team’s defensive productivity indicates that more intense on-the-job training—that is, more frequent actual home game play—increases defense and win production at home.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1527002511433856">

</p>
<p>In column 1, ROADTRIP_GAMES_SO_FAR shows that visiting teams produce significantly more defense the more consecutive games they have played on the road, and ROADTRIP_DAYS_SO_FAR shows they produce significantly less defense the more consecutive days they have spent on the road. Thus, the effects of roadtrip length on defensive production are analogous to the effects of homestand length, and it appears that visiting teams train during roadtrips much the same way home teams train during homestands. But roadtrip-induced changes in visiting teams' defensive production do not translate into significant changes in win production in column 3.</p>
<p>None of the HOMESTAND_TO_GO, ROADTRIP_TO_GO, or ROADTRIP_DIST variables significantly affect production of offense, defense, or wins. Visiting teams with more days off since their most recent game produce significantly more defense (VISITOR_DAYS_SINCE is significantly negative in the column 1 HOME_SCORE equation), offense (it is significantly positive in the column 2 VISITOR_SCORE equation), and wins. For home teams, additional days off since their most recent game improve offensive production (column 1) and win production (column 3), but not defensive production (column 2).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1527002511433856">

<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1527002511433856">Table 3</xref>, HOMESTAND_GAMES_SO_FAR and HOMESTAND_DAYS_SO_FAR still significantly impact VISITOR_SCORE and HOME_WIN in a manner consistent with defensive training over homestands. ROADTRIP_GAMES_SO_FAR and ROADTRIP_DAYS_SO_FAR still significantly impact HOME_SCORE in a manner consistent with defensive training over roadtrips. Thus, homestand/roadtrip training is not merely a function of overall games played over recent days and weeks. DAYS_SINCE variables become insignificant in all three columns, presumably because they are highly correlated with the added variables. Results from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1527002511433856">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1527002511433856">3</xref> are maintained when the LN_GAMES and LN_CUMDIST controls are replaced with linear GAMES and CUMDIST controls (not shown, available from the author upon request).</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1527002511433856">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1527002511433856">3</xref> indicate that homestand games train teams for future games in the same homestand and that roadtrip games, to a lesser extent, train teams for future games in the same roadtrip. This suggests that NBA players grow accustomed to playing defense either as a home team or a visiting team during homestand/roadtrip stints. When there is a break in constancy—either by beginning a new roadtrip or returning home—team defense requires time to adjust to its new situation. A more accelerated adjustment—that is, fewer days off in between games—improves team productivity more quickly.</p>
<p>This subsection hypothesizes answers to three questions:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Why are the on-the-job training results significant for defense, but not offense?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Why are the results stronger during homestands than roadtrips?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Why does defensive production change with each new homestand/roadtrip?</p>
</list-item>
</list>Themes that may help answer these questions include <italic>team communication skills</italic> and <italic>referee bias toward home teams</italic>.</p>
<p>Basketball figures consider communication to be a critical part of defensive production. Writer Bill <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527002511433856">Simmons (2009)</xref> says,<disp-quote>
<p>Whenever I see the Spurs in person, that’s the first thing I always notice: how well they talk on defense (pp. 574–575).</p>
</disp-quote>Similarly, NBA coach Mike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527002511433856">Fratello (2009)</xref> lists communication as one of the four crucial components of playing defense,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1527002511433856">
10
</xref></sup> and writes<disp-quote>
<p>We created a defensive terminology that we use all the time, both in practice and games. Consistent terminology helps defenders move in a synchronized way; it alerts teammates that a screen is coming, where help is needed on the court, and how to play the pick-and-roll.</p>
</disp-quote>The language in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527002511433856">Fratello (2009)</xref> is remarkably similar to that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527002511433856">Lazear and Shaw (2007)</xref>, who discuss teamwork in the context of labor economics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527002511433856">Lazear and Shaw (2007)</xref> write<disp-quote>
<p>[T]eamwork requires communication, which can involve both common jargon and personal knowledge of each other. Communication costs are likely reduced over time as individuals learn to speak each other’s languages.</p>
</disp-quote>Home games, during which teams presumably play defense while communicating over home crowds that are loudly and enthusiastically trying to disrupt the visiting team’s offense, may require different communication skills than road games. Teams can develop home-specific/road-specific communication skills by playing multiple consecutive games as either a home or a road team, improving their defensive productivity. Communication skills can be developed more quickly when games are more frequently played.</p>
<p>Findings that referees make calls in a manner biased toward home teams (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527002511433856">Moskowitz &amp; Wertheim, 2011</xref>) may also explain the evidence of homestand/roadtrip training in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1527002511433856">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1527002511433856">3</xref>. Over the course of a homestand or roadtrip, teams may adapt to referees' home-team bias. More frequently played games as a home or road team would help a team grow accustomed to the bias more quickly. Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527002511433856">Moskowitz and Wertheim (2011)</xref> state that forced turnovers and charge/block calls—both which can concern defense—are the primary focus of referees' bias, it is likely that the training that occurs over homestands/roadtrips would be defensive in nature.</p>
<p>Both the communication skills and referee bias hypotheses are consistent with the finding that training is stronger—in terms of its effect on win production—over homestands that roadtrips. A home crowd is presumably more consistent in its size, noise, and general atmosphere than the many different crowds a team entertains during a roadtrip. Therefore, on-the-job communication training could be more specific and productivity increasing in home settings than road settings. Over a homestand, a team may develop a communication set well-suited to its home arena, but communication skills developed during a road game at, for example, Atlanta may not translate well to a game played at New York during the same roadtrip, because the crowds are quite different.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527002511433856">Garicano, Palacios-Huerto, and Prendergast (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527002511433856">Dohmen (2008)</xref> find that soccer referees' home-team bias increases with game attendance and therefore, presumably, crowd noise. A home crowd consistent in its attendance and noise should create a more consistent level of referee bias, and a longer homestand would allow a team to train itself for the referee bias specific to its home arena. Training would be less steady during roadtrips because games in front of different crowds with different noise levels would yield a less consistent referee bias, making training more difficult.</p>

<p>The significant column 2 coefficients on HOMESTAND_GAMES_SO_FAR × HOME_GAMES and HOMESTAND_DAYS_SO_FAR × HOME_GAMES show that home teams' defensive production becomes significantly less responsive to homestand length, in both games and days, as the season progresses. These results appear to support the concave age/productivity profile espoused by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527002511433856">Becker’s (1964)</xref> human capital theory. Over the course of the season, home teams have trained for their specific home environment, and the training component of each additional home game becomes less significant. In column 3, both HOMESTAND_GAMES_SO_FAR × HOME_GAMES and HOMESTAND_DAYS_SO_FAR × HOME_GAMES are significant, showing that the reduced impacts of homestand length on defensive production in column 2 translate into a significantly reduced impact on win production in column 3. The columns 1 and 3 coefficients on the ROADTRIP interaction terms show no significant evidence that the impacts of roadtrip length on visiting teams' defensive production and win production change as the season progresses.</p>
<p>That defensive performance becomes less responsive to home training over the course of the season provides additional evidence that teams train, whether via improved communication skills or an increased ability to adjust to referee bias, in front of their consistent home crowds. In late-season homestands, a team has experienced its own crowd enough so that the arena-specific training component of playing another home game is negligible. By contrast, road crowds are more variable, so the relationship between roadtrip training and defensive skills does not significantly dilute as the season progresses.</p>
<p>Other interaction coefficients in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1527002511433856">Table 4</xref> are also significant. In column 1, both HOMESTAND_GAMES_SO_FAR × HOME_GAMES and HOMESTAND_DAYS_SO_FAR × HOME_GAMES are significant, suggesting that the effect of homestand length on home teams' offensive production changes as the season progresses. But the changes in offensive production do not change win production in the proper direction—the positive column 1 coefficient on HOMESTAND_GAMES_SO_FAR × HOME_GAMES does not correspond with a positive coefficient in column 3, and the negative column 1 coefficient on HOMESTAND_DAYS_SO_FAR × HOME_GAMES does not correspond with a negative coefficient in column 3. The significantly negative column 2 coefficient on VISITOR_DAYS_SINCE × VISITOR_GAMES shows that visiting teams' offensive production becomes significantly less responsive to days since their most recent game as the season progresses. This does not significantly affect win production in column 3, though.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article provides evidence that on-the-job training and its intensity immediately and significantly increase labor productivity, in support of human capital theory. Home teams in NBA games see improved defense and win production the more consecutive games they have played at home, but worsened defense and win production the more consecutive days spent at home. Furthermore, the training effects of homestand length weaken as the season progresses, mimicking the concave age-productivity profile of human capital theory. The training effects of roadtrip length on visiting teams' defensive production during roadtrips mimic the effects of homestand length on home teams' defensive production, but roadtrip length does not significantly affect visiting teams' win production, nor does it change over the course of the season. The importance of on-the-job training on defensive production may be related to the role communication skills play in basketball teams' production of defense. It could also be related to teams' adjusting to referee bias associated with home teams and road teams.</p>
<p>Further research regarding on-the-job training and team defensive production could extend the analysis to other sports, such as National Hockey League (NHL) hockey, whose game schedule is closest to that of NBA basketball. Research could also examine what aspects of defensive production constitute the “black box” of improved defensive production associated with homestand and roadtrip length. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527002511433856">Berri et al. (2006)</xref> showed that over 90% of NBA game outcomes can be explained via in-game statistics, so it is probable that improved defense corresponds with improvement in specific defensive statistics such as field goal percentage allowed, rebounding, fouls committed, or turnovers induced. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527002511433856">Moskowitz and Wertheim (2011)</xref> note that most of referees' bias toward home teams is accounted for by differences in foul calls and turnover calls, so changes in these variables would suggest teams adapt to referee bias over homestands and roadtrips. Additionally, game attendance data or crowd noise data could be used to more thoroughly examine the relationship between on-the-job training during homestands and roadtrips.</p>
<p>Research might also determine whether the defensive training that occurs over NBA homestands is team-specific or general. Specific training would consist of defensive production being related to a team’s specific system of defense. General training would presumably manifest itself via players improving their individual defensive skills or further familiarizing themselves with defensive systems common to NBA teams. Estimations including player-level NBA data—such as that used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1527002511433856">Price and Wolfers (2010)</xref>—might be able to use in-season player transactions and individual player fixed effects to identify whether a team’s defensive production improves faster with on-the-job training when it acquires a new player. Such a result would support the existence of specific training, as a newly acquired player acclimates himself to his new team’s defensive system.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that these effects are determined by overtime periods, which are unobserved in the data set. If, for example, additional consecutive home games improved the home team’s defensive production only by reducing the number of overtime periods played, it is likely that the home team’s offensive production would also significantly fall with each consecutive game played at home. Instead, the effect of additional consecutive home games on home teams' offensive production is insignificant. Additionally, if the observed improvement in defensive production occurred only because of fewer overtime periods, improved defensive production would not translate into improved win production.</p>

<p>There is anecdotal evidence that days off during homestands yield more skill depreciation than those during roadtrips. David Halberstam’s classic book <italic>The Breaks of the Game </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527002511433856">1981</xref>) contains the following quote about Bill Walton: “He loved, unlike most professional basketball players, playing on the road, because he was able to focus his entire day on basketball, with fewer distractions” (p. 126).</p>

<p>Estimations interacting the relevant variables with each team’s average years of NBA experience (weighed by minutes played) show no significant evidence that more-experienced NBA teams have a different amount of on-the-job training than less-experienced ones. Thus, the training documented in this article appears to be entirely within-season, and does not carry through the off-season. Results from these estimations are available from the author upon request.</p>
