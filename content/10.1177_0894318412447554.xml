      <p>In a recent volume of <italic>Nursing Science Quarterly</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318412447554">Fawcett (2012)</xref> encouraged the discipline of nursing to “consider whether nursing is more than empirical activity” (p. 112) and if the development of alternative theories should be considered sciencing. Those interested in pursuing the latter can begin by reviewing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447554">Fawcett and Garity’s (2009)</xref> text, <italic>Evaluating Research for Evidence-Based Nursing Practice</italic>, the subject of this edition’s book review. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447554">Fawcett and Garity (2009)</xref> concentrate on demystifying the evaluation of research, they spend a fair amount of time addressing the relationship with what they consider the three components for research: conceptual-theoretical-empirical. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447554">Fawcett and Garity (2009)</xref> middle range theories generated or tested by nursing research are indeed sciencing. As members of the discipline of nursing are well aware, it is the empirical component of this research triad, not the conceptual or theoretical components that is generally the focus of evidenced-based practice. Furthermore, many doctoral nursing students are encouraged to pursue the empirical component when contemplating their own body of research and opportunities to be funded. In this day and age it takes courage to continue to propose that the generating and testing of middle-range theories is sciencing. Bravo! to all in nursing that have and will continue to include both the conceptual and theoretical as imperative components of nursing sciencing.</p>
      <p>Dr. Cheryl Lefaiver has been asked to review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447554">Fawcett and Garity’s (2009)</xref> tangible textbook and its accompanying CD, <italic>Evaluating Research for Evidence-Based Nursing Practice.</italic> Dr. Lefaiver has participated in nursing research from a variety of perspectives including her work as a nursing research assistant, conducting her own doctoral research, as adjunct faculty responsible for master’s level research courses, and as a professional nurse researcher encouraging and supporting direct care nurses conducting research at the bedside. This column welcomes her thoughts on this textbook. Please make a note that this textbook may also be purchased as an electronic book and that Amazon’s Kindle version does not include the information and examples contained in the CD.</p>
