Methods: Seven-day-old Wistar rats underwent ligation of the left common carotid artery followed by 80 minutes hypoxia in 8% oxygen inducing an ipsilateral brain damage. Seven days later (d14), brains were analyzed quantitatively using a macroscopic and microscopic score for structural damage, hemisphere volumes were calculated, and immunohistochemistry for cleaved-caspase-3 (marker for apoptotic cells) was performed. Animals from the study group (n = 19) received 17β-estradiol (0.05 µg/g  body weight intraperitoneally) before (−64, −40, and –16 hours) and after (+3 hours) the hypoxia (hour 0: start of the hypoxia) and the control group (n = 21) received mock treatment. Results: Of the 21 pups, 13 in the NaCl group had macroscopically a severe brain damage and 7 of 19 animals in the study group encountered only discrete to mild lesions. Microscopic brain damage in the study group was significantly lower (score 1.5 ± 0.7 vs 2.8 ± 0.8, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). The determined volumes of the affected hemisphere were significantly lower in the NaCl group than in the treatment group. The numbers of apoptotic cells in both hemispheres was equal in the estradiol group, but in the control group, there were significantly more apoptotic cells in the affected hemisphere (control group: ipsilateral: 1435 ± 653 vs contralateral: 143 ± 57 cells, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Discussion: 17β-Estradiol protects newborn rat brains from hypoxic–ischemic injury, in terms of both microscopic cell injury and apoptosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>estradiol</kwd><kwd>hypoxia–ischemia</kwd><kwd>neonatal</kwd><kwd>neuroprotection</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-1933719112452471"><title>Introduction</title><p>Encephalopathy in premature infants is of enormous public health importance due to the large number of affected infants and its major cause for cerebral palsy. The 2007 preterm birth rate in the United States was 12.7% and the low birth weight reached 8.2%. The subsequent occurrence of altered brain development resulting in long-term physical, cognitive, and behavioral deficits in 25% to 50% and major motor deficits in 1% to 5% in this group underlines the importance of this event.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112452471">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112452471">2</xref></sup> The evolving process of brain injury starting during intrapartum hypoxia–ischemia and reaching into the first postnatal days is a complex amalgam of destructive and developmental disturbances. It involves white and gray matter injury to varying degrees, depending on the gestational and developmental stage.</p><p>The immature brain seems to sustain less damage when exposed to lack of oxygen or nutrient, as compared to an adult brain. To induce profound brain damage, immature mice or rats are typically exposed to hypoxia–ischemia for 70 minutes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112452471">3</xref></sup> In contrast, only 25 minutes are necessary to induce a similar brain damage in the adult mice brains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112452471">4</xref></sup> This observation may indicate that some specific factor or group of factors are present in an immature brain and figure as neuroprotective agents.</p><p>Of potential interest are steroids, especially 17β-estradiol.

Mimicking injury of a neonate human brain has been established in numerous animal models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719112452471">20</xref></sup> Mechanisms underlying disease and consequently therapeutic interventions have been explored. The developmental stage of the rat brain on postnatal day 7 is similar to the term human infant and it is also similarly susceptible to hypoxic–ischemic injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719112452471">20</xref></sup> The combination of ischemia, obtained by unilateral carotid artery ligation, and subsequent exposure to hypoxia in 7-day-old rat pups is the most accepted animal model of perinatal asphyxia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719112452471">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112452471">22</xref></sup> Pathological progressive cascade of consequences in the ipsilateral hemisphere to the occlusion are observed in cerebral cortex, subcortical and periventricular white matter, striatum, and hippocampus. Excito-oxidative events take the form of selective neuronal necrosis (glia and blood vessels spared) or infarction (all elements destroyed).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112452471">22</xref></sup></p><p>Nuňez et al applied this animal model and administered 17β-estradiol using either single or repeated dosing paradigm prior to the hypoxia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719112452471">23</xref></sup> Repeated administration showed a neuroprotective effect. Gerstner et al reported that a single dose of 17β-estradiol 12 hours prior to the injury on postnatal day 6 protects against hypoxic–ischemic white matter damage. Furthermore, 17β-estradiol produced significant protection against oxygen–glucose deprivation induced cell death in primary oligodendrocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719112452471">24</xref></sup></p><p>So there is still much controversy regarding the differing doses, time, treatment schedules, or the effect of estrogen in a neonatal brain after a hypoxic–ischemic injury. Despite the encouraging data, in vivo studies testing 17β-estradiol as a neuroprotective agent on hypoxic–ischemic insults in an immature brain are rather few. Prior to clinical trials, further investigation is necessary to assess and confirm the possible use of 17β-estradiol. The experiments that we herein report was designed to test the neuroprotective action of 17β-estradiol in the immature 7-day-old rat brain after hypoxic–ischemic injury.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1933719112452471" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="section3-1933719112452471"><title>Animals Groups and Treatment</title><p>The experiments were performed on 7-day-old neonatal Wistar rats (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) of either sex taken randomly from their litters.</p><p>Because day 7 in rat life is considered equivalent to term in humans as far as brain development is concerned, day 7 was chosen for the day of the hypoxic insult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719112452471">20</xref></sup></p><p>Three groups of animals were treated or studied at time point −64, −40, −16, −1 hour (carotid artery ligation; day 7 of life), 0 hour (onset of 80 minute-induced hypoxia), +3 hours, and day 14 of life.</p><p>Group 1 (9 animals) received different amounts of 17β-estradiol intraperitoneally (at −64, −40, and −16 hours), no ligation or hypoxia, but were sacrificed at −1 hour to measure 17β-estradiol serum levels.</p><p>Group 2 (control group; n = 25) received NaCl intraperitoneally (at −64, −40, −16, and +3 hours), left carotid ligation, and hypoxia and were sacrificed on day 14.</p><p>Group 3 (study group; n = 23) received 0.05 μg/g body weight 17β-estradiol intraperitoneally (at −64, −40, −16, and +3 hours) but were otherwise treated identical to group 2.</p><p>The animals stayed with their dams and controlled conditions were assured.

Further variability in brain function such as neuronal survival, axonal projections, dendritic branching, and synaptic patterning can be dramatically influenced by our neuroprotective effort.</p><p>To manage hypoxic–ischemic injury in preterm infants, it is required to early identify the infant at high risk. In case of acute brain injury, cellular energy failure, acidosis, glutamate release, lipid peroxidation, intracellular calcium accumulation, and nitric oxide toxicity lead to cell death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719112452471">30</xref></sup> It may involve mitochondrial dysfunction and be influenced by inflammatory mediators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1933719112452471">31</xref></sup></p><p>During the third trimester of pregnancy, the human fetus is exposed to high levels of estrogen. Thus, in premature delivery, newborns had a deprivation of estrogen and progesterone. Similarly in rats, the hormones are decreasing slowly at the end of the first postnatal week. Several authors indicate equivalent developmental stage of 6 to 14-day-old rats brain to the human newborn at term with major growth spurt occurring postnatally in the rodent brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719112452471">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1933719112452471">32</xref></sup> Investigating neuroprotective effect of estrogen and hypoxic–ischemic injury with pups at day 7, we established a model without physiologically decreased levels of 17β-estradiol at the time of the planned injury. In our study, repeated administrations of 17β-estradiol prior to the insult could maintain high levels of this hormone at the time of hypoxic–ischemic injury. The fourth application of 17β-estradiol mimics postnatal treatment. Human serum levels of 17β-estradiol in infants strongly depend on the gestational week of delivery. Application of 17β-estradiol and maintenance of high physiological or therapeutic serum levels could be achieved by dose-tailored estradiol administrations based on cord blood or serum levels measurements.</p><p>Recently, Nuňez et al observed that repeated administration of 17β-estradiol exerts a neuroprotective effect in a neonatal rat brain after a hypoxic–ischemic injury.<sup>23 </sup>In contrast, single administration of 17β-estradiol 24 hours prior to hypoxia–ischemia conferred little protection. He hypothesized that the relatively short pretreatment activates rather the rapid, nongenomic actions of 17β-estradiol and multiple injections initiate long-term, genomic mode of protection. In his study, all administrations were done prior to the insult, which makes it rather impossible to translate it to clinical use because the identification of fetuses at risk at term prior to birth is hardly possible and elevated levels of 17β-estradiol are physiologically present. In our experiment, we not only used repeated administration of 17β-estradiol prior to the induced damage but also a fourth administration after the damage was afflicted. Consensual to his results, we observed a significant reduction of the induced lesion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1933719112452471">Table 1</xref>). It also needs to be considered that the dose of 17β-estradiol used in our experiment was 10-fold lower than the single or repeated administrated doses in Nuňez’s study and still we observed a significant neuroprotective activity.</p><p>Another recent study investigated the role of 17β-estradiol on white matter injury in rats on postnatal day 6.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719112452471">24</xref></sup> In vivo, they observed that a single dose of 0.3 or 0.6 µg/g body weight of 17β-estradiol applied 12 hours prior to the injury protects against hypoxic–ischemic white matter damage in the neonatal rat brain. Furthermore, 17β-estradiol produced significant protection against oxygen–glucose deprivation-induced cell death in primary oligodendrocytes. Again the dose paradigm and dosage are the main difference to our study. Both of the single administered doses in Gerstner’s study were higher than in our regime. All injections were applied prior to the injury, and second, in contrast to our work, the experiment was designed to investigate a relatively selective white matter injury with minimal neuronal damage in male pups only (day 6). In our experiment, both sexes were investigated and several differences detected.</p><p>Animal and human studies had been published concerning sex differences in neonates after brain injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1933719112452471">33</xref></sup> Equivalent brain damage produces a far greater damage in male compared with female animals and also a poorer functional recovery. In our study, microscopically evaluated damage in cortex cerebri (NaCl group) was significantly greater in male than in female pups. No statistical differences were detected in the therapy group. Interestingly, the evaluation of hippocampus showed no statistical differences between both sexes indicating a higher sensitivity to hypoxic–ischemic brain damage of hippocampus than cortex cerebri. Furthermore, both male and female neonates were sensitive to 17β-estradiol therapy.</p><p>So there is still much controversy regarding the differing doses, time, treatment schedules, or the effect of estrogen in a neonatal brain after a hypoxic–ischemic injury. It seems that a certain balanced level of 17β-estradiol is needed to exert the neuroprotective effect and it may be attained by long-term administrations. 17β-Estradiol application starting during the first 24 hours of neonatal period could prevent the physiological decrease of the hormone. Information concerning a possible “window of opportunity” or a secondary increase of estradiol serum levels during the postnatal period is still missing and should be addressed in future studies.  </p><p>Apoptosis is an important factor influencing estrogen-mediated neuroprotection. The balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors is very delicate. BAD (BCL2 antagonist of cell death) or BAX (BCL2-associated X protein) is the inducer of apoptosis. In contrast, BCL2 and BCLX<sub>L</sub> are inhibitors of apoptosis. The neuronal vulnerability is determined by the fragile balance between those factors and influencing apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1933719112452471">34</xref></sup> Gene promoters of BCL2 and BCLX<sub>L</sub> contain estrogen response elements and their transcription is induced by estrogen in vitro. Further in vivo experiments confirmed that estradiol exerts neuroprotection after focal cerebral ischemia and there was an increased level of BCL2 in the peri-infarct region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1933719112452471">35</xref></sup> Apoptotic cascade reaction is regulated by caspase inhibitors and can be influenced by estradiol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719112452471">36</xref></sup> Caspase-3 is a critical executioner of apoptosis. It is either partially or totally responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of many key proteins. Caspase activation is by far the most specific indicator of cell suicide mechanism and a prolonged role of apoptosis in  hypoxic–ischemic brain damage has been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1933719112452471">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1933719112452471">38</xref></sup> In our experiments, we determined the number of CC+ (executioner) cells in different parts of the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1933719112452471">Figure 3</xref>). Animals of the control group had significantly more CC+ cells in the affected ipsilateral hemisphere compared with the contralateral side. In group 3, there were no significant differences between both hemispheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1933719112452471">Figure 3</xref>). It still needs to be considered than we did not differentiate if these cells were neuronal or glial cells and the chosen planes represent a part of the brain. On the other hand, the planes were selected according to the expected insult site and neuroprotective effect of 17β-estradiol should similarly affect both types of cells.</p><p>The measured hemisphere volumes and the volume difference between both hemispheres additionally indicate a protective effect of 17β-estradiol (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1933719112452471">Table 2</xref>). In group 2, there was a 32% volume reduction of the affected hemisphere after the induced damage. In contrast, the application of 17β-estradiol resulted in a reduction of only 12%. A negative aspect of the measurement is that we measured the volume of the entire hemispheres not differentiating the hippocampus. The volume reduction of the hippocampus would also be of interest but the induced cystical lesions made it impossible to calculate a representative area.</p><p>Other studies have assessed potential neuroprotective means in animal models. These studies used different agents like magnesium sulfate, allopurinol, deferoxamine, calcium blockers, minocycline, or erythropoietin and showed a neuroprotective effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719112452471">30</xref></sup> Additionally, possible interactions have to be considered. During perinatal period, high levels of α-fetoprotein are present and may influence the neuroprotective effect of 17β-estradiol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1933719112452471">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1933719112452471">40</xref></sup></p><p>Currently, therapeutic hypothermia is a standard of care for neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) brain injury. Survival and neurodevelopment in newborns with moderate and severe HI encephalopathy is improved but newborns which are profoundly asphyxiated will not likely profit from hypothermic therapy. In addition, current evidence is limited to a 18-month follow-up and a long-term prediction is difficult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719112452471">18</xref></sup> Another recent systematic review confirmed the potential use of magnesium sulfate given to women at risk of preterm birth.

The neonatal risk of cerebral palsy and the rate of substantial gross motor dysfunction were significantly reduced, but long-term evaluation is still lacking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1933719112452471">41</xref></sup> Another approach is neural regeneration.

In a neurodevelopmental follow-up, Trotter et al showed normal psychomotor development in infants born less than 30 weeks of gestation and given estradiol and progesterone after a premature delivery compared with untreated infants, where a trend toward delayed development was detected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1933719112452471">45</xref></sup> A recent Cochrane review showed that further investigation is needed to determine whether the supplementation of estradiol or progesterone alone or in combination or in different doses represents a risk or benefit to a preterm infant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1933719112452471">46</xref></sup> Another important aspect is that data addressing supplementation of sex steroids in term infants are lacking. Again properly conducted randomized controlled trials are needed. Trials could include premature or term infants receiving individualized estradiol and/or progesterone supplementation and neurodevelopmental follow-up should be included.</p><sec id="section19-1933719112452471"><title>Limitations of This Study</title><p>A limitation of the study is the use of the animal model itself. Conclusions from animal studies cannot be transferred to human neonates without intensive investigation. Generally, no single animal model can replicate the complex condition of a human brain. However, the immature rat model has gained wide acceptance in studying basic physiology, brain injury mechanisms, and therapeutic interventions after perinatal brain damage. Furthermore, therapeutic intervention in this animal setting is providing valuable information regarding the neroprotective effect of agents like 17β-estradiol. Extensive investigation in animal models is inevitable before clinical trials in human neonates can be initiated. Another weakness of our study is the lack of assessment of functional neurologic outcome and lack of a sham group. Nevertheless, our morphological findings are in line with other studies, showing a correlation between the outcome parameters used in our study and functional outcome. In conclusion, the results of our study show that 17β-estradiol protects the immature rat brain from hypoxic–ischemic damage and reduces the number of CC+ cells significantly. Further studies are needed to show the long-term neurodevelopmental effect, before clinical studies can be initiated.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn1-1933719112452471"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn2-1933719112452471"><label>Funding</label><p>The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: DFG Be 1688 and approved by LANUV (Das Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz Nordrhein-Westfalen) Recklinghausen, Germany, Az. 50.8720 Nr.
