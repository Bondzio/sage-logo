<p>It is difficult in a short review such as this to do justice to the riches of English Catholic writing to be found in this ambitious anthology which begins at the dawn of the age of printing with a single-sheet prayer for forgiveness dating from 1484, printed by William Caxton, and ends with a reflection on the role of Mary in pointing us to her Son, which was penned by the late Cardinal Basil Hume in the closing years of the 20th century. The editors have organized the collection by way of three parts (1483–1688, 1688–1850, and 1850–1999, respectively) with separate introductions of several pages for each period in addition to a general introduction to the work as a whole at the beginning.</p>
<p>Much as one might expect, the Reformation period includes writings by well-known figures such as Dean John Colet, St John Fisher, Cardinal Reginald Pole, Cardinal William Allen and, indeed (momentarily departing from the selection criteria of the editors on account of its pivotal nature), the infamous letter of a non-English ecclesiastic, namely Pope Pius V, <italic>Regnans in Excelsis</italic>, which released English Catholics from the duty of civil obedience to Queen Elizabeth I and actively encouraged them to overthrow her. However, the editors recognize that high ecclesiastical politics should not be seen to dominate the tradition and thus they have included a number of examples of material from prayer manuals of the period, among them a set of instructions for praying the rosary which date from 1589 and advice on preparing for confession from 1650. There are also some religious poems by Richard Crashaw and extracts from an English translation of the life of St Elizabeth of Portugal by one Catharine Greenbury, a third order Franciscan abbess based in Brussels. Indeed, it is good to see that throughout the collection popular religiosity (manifested in entries that express both concern for it and its concerns) is given its due. There is a nice set of rhyming verses to be found in one prayer manual from 1686 which functioned as an <italic>aide-mémoire</italic> for the various feast-days of the saints to be commemorated throughout the liturgical year. Issues touching popular piety were also at the centre of polemical tracts and apologetic works such as those of John Gother (d. 1704) who published <italic>A Papist Misrepresented and Represented</italic> in 1685, treating of the familiar contentious questions of devotion to the Virgin Mary and the saints and belief in transubstantiation. Works of spiritual guidance, such as that produced by Helen More (alias Sr Gertrude), a great-great-grand-daughter of St Thomas More and one of the founding members of Stanbrook Abbey, also feature. In one example, she cautions against religious scruples advising her readers to ‘answer nothing to them, be not troubled with them; but still go on thy way and tend to the love of thy God, which will overcome all and make all right with thee’ (p. 209). The Dominican, Margaret Mary Hallahan (1803–68), of Irish stock, would put it more simply still: ‘it keeps you always more busy with yourself than with God …’</p>
<p>Throughout the collection one is struck by the number of connections between many of the individuals featured, whether personal or, indeed, by way of association with educational institutions—the English colleges on the Continent and, latterly, their successors at home. For instance, Sr Gertrude More’s spiritual director was Augustine Baker (1575–1641) who also features in the anthology; Hugh Tootell (1671–1743), nephew of Christopher Tootell (1662–1727), studied with Edward Hawarden (1622–1735) at Douai; John Gother (d. 1704) would receive Richard Challoner (1691–1781) into the Church; the Cisalpine Charles Butler (1750–1832) would cross pens with Bishop John Milner (1752–1826); Henry Weedall (1788–1859) was a student at Oscott when it came under Milner’s control and later became its president (the future Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman preceded him in the role) and it would be John Henry Newman who would preach Weedall’s funeral sermon; moreover, Gerald Manley Hopkins (who, as one might expect, also features in the anthology) would be received into the Church by Newman. The luminaries of English Catholicism at home and abroad formed a relatively small community indeed. There are many other examples one could cite. It is interesting to note, for example, that the convert, Frederick William Faber’s (1814–63) father was secretary to Bishop Shute Barrington of Durham with whom the Catholic scholar John Lindgard (1771–1851), president of Ushaw, engaged in extended controversy over the veneration of images: both Faber and Lindgard are represented in the collection.</p>
<p>One of the strengths of the anthology is that a number of figures whose work is represented will not be well known. One thinks of the 18th-century novelist, Jane Barker (1652–1732), for instance, a convert to Catholicism who followed James II into exile and was a staunch Jacobite, believing, at one point, that a relic of the exiled king had cured a tumour in her breast. Readers will also be interested in the work of Elizabeth Inchbald (1753–1821), actress, editor, and novelist, who wrote on the challenges for dramatists of portraying morally upright characters as something more than dull and one-dimensional, a perennial problem that continues to beset script writers for modern series. Some individuals will be perhaps best known for their contribution to the tradition of popular carols as in the case of Canon Frederick Oakley (1802–80) who translated <italic>Adeste Fidelis</italic> and the Oratorian, Edward Caswall (1814–78), who wrote <italic>See amid the winter’s snow</italic>. Both, incidentally, were also converts. The work of other figures, meanwhile, will strike some as pre-figuring recent revisionist Reformation historiography. Cardinal Gasquet (1846–1929) argues, in one piece, for the ‘contented Catholicity of the English people in early Tudor times’ while Charles Butler’s (1750–1832) question ‘What was lost in the Reformation?’ could well have been the title of one of Eamon Duffy’s monographs.</p>
<p>Given the polemical nature of much of the religious material of earlier periods, one should not be surprised to find views that some may find offensive. However, this goes with the territory of reading works written in a different age. The Dominican, Bertrand Wilberforce’s (1839–1904) quip regarding Protestant churches that ‘the real absence is so painfully obvious’ is a case in point. However, what is far more alarming is when the editors allow statements such as the following, which appears in the biographical introduction to the convert Ronald Knox (1888–1957), to slip through: ‘the prospect of death in the trenches moved several of his Oxford friends and protégés to turn from the vagueness of official Anglicanism and the frivolities of Anglo-Catholicism to the divine solidity of the Catholic Church’ (p. 618). This wording is, needless to say, unfortunate, ill-advised, and simply offensive.</p>
<p>The strict criteria employed by the editors as to which writers should be included in the volume are outlined at the beginning of the volume. Those featured are Catholics who ended their lives fully incorporated into the Catholic Church, professing the Church’s faith and having received or had the capacity to receive the last sacraments (i.e. not having been excluded from these by canon law). This criterion automatically excluded, for instance, the works of Jesuit, George Tyrrell, who died unreconciled with the Catholic Church. Moreover, all the writings included have their origin in the Catholic phase of the individual writer’s life. Since a large number of individuals featured were converts to Catholicism, this means that their earlier writings which, by various paths, led them to this point of conversion are necessarily excluded. Thus we do not hear the pre-Roman Catholic voice of Newman or Chesterton, for example. This is also, one surmises, what excludes a figure such as Malcolm Muggeridge (1903–90) whose most well-known work, <italic>Something Beautiful for God</italic>, which did much to popularize the figure of Mother Teresa, was published in 1971, some years before he was received into the Catholic Church. This just gives one the impression, however, that what is important is the destination, not the journey; in short, never was ‘Rome, sweet home’ as at home with itself. In the case of Tyrrell, the ‘destination’ ensures that what preceded it gets effectively blotted out as if having little to offer on account of that fact. Yet it strikes this reviewer that if similar criteria were applied to the writings of the Church Fathers, for instance, we should all be the poorer for it. Unfortunately for one of the most brilliant 20th-century English theologians and communicators, Herbert McCabe OP, he died two years too late for inclusion (2001; the cut-off date was 1999); his absence is nevertheless keenly felt.</p>
<p>These observations aside, the editors are to be warmly congratulated on producing a wonderfully rich treasury of English Catholic writing which will be an invaluable resource for many years to come.</p>
