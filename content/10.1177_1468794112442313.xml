<p>This book deals with a topic of real interest and relevance given the anecdotal and the empirical evidence about self harm and the underlying suffering that is its companion. It looks at the issue from the perspective of those who injure themselves, critiques some of the professional approaches to addressing the issue and gives some perspectives of what it may be like to work with people who self harm. It is an unusual book in that it doesn’t take the usual academic approach to the subject and neither does it act as a self help book. The approach could be refreshing were it not tied down in disjointed and often wordy prose. The book is a series of stories or experiences, the first of which is Faggott. This is a profound and painful story of cruelty and inhumanity which is marred by novella type language that distracts from the real issues that the chapter tries to spotlight. Similarly the next chapter, ‘Trust Me 1’ is littered with redundant words and descriptions which hide the real story and distract from what should be the real point of the chapter. Simpler prose are usually more powerful than a clutter of words. ‘Flashback One’, the third Chapter is a mixture of story and an academic interlude which looks as if it’s been cut and pasted form somewhere else. ‘Normal’ the next chapter gets the reader back on track and describes disturbing treatment inflicted on the vulnerable by the venerable (health professionals) whilst quietly telling another and more muted story of suffering and self harm. ‘In Between’ describes an enlightening interaction between the health professional and patient which reflects the chasm of understanding so often at play in interactions of this kind. It also describes the fixation the health system has on labelling everything with a name and a firm diagnosis. And so this book unfolds varying between the use of unnecessary words and redundant descriptions to the powerful descriptions of what it is like to suffer self-harm and the unintended and sometimes intended cruelty of those who are there to help.</p>
<p>After the rocky journey of the main chapters, the appendices provide some solace in that they do explain concepts like harm reduction and descriptions of what might and what doesn’t work in the treatment of those who self harm. I found the first appendix helpful and instructive and made perfect sense even to those of us who do not research or work in this field. In fact, here there is a clear message about acceptance and hope. From a purely academic perspective I found the final appendix on methodology interesting in its description as this methodology can be translated into so many other areas when we research sensitive issues. It is all about respect really. However, despite the fact that I wholly accept that traditional academic approaches are limited when they try to describe people’s lived experiences I am not sure that this book has managed to fully convince me that ethnographic fiction really works, at least in the way it is practiced here. Simpler descriptions and not trying to write using so many adjectives would have strengthened the power and impact of the stories in this book.</p>
