<abstract>
<p>Hydrophobic silyl-urea/urethane methacrylates (UHM-1, UHM-2) and a modified BisGMA derivative (BisGMA-UMA) were synthesized and used as photopolymerizable co-monomers in the preparation of dental composites, besides other urethane dimethacrylates containing oligoethylene oxide segments and carboxylic groups. The homo- and copolymerization behaviour of the synthesized monomers were investigated by FTIR spectroscopy using camphorquinone (CQ) and 4-(dimethylamino)-phenylacetic acid (DMPheAA) as a photoinitiating system, as well as by photo-DSC. The first hybrid monomethacrylate, N-(methacryloyloxyethyl-N’-diethoxymethylsilylpropyl)-urea showed the highest value for the maximum polymerization rate (0.117 s<sup>−1</sup>) followed by BisGMA analogue (0.085 s<sup>−1</sup>) and N-methacryloyloxyethyl-N’-bis(triethoxysilylpropylcarbamoyloxyethyl)-urea (0.069 s<sup>−1</sup>), whereas the degree of conversion decreased from 75.1% (UHM-2) to 41.6% (BisGMA-UMA). Polymerization shrinkage (PS) measured by picnometry for the mixture BisGMA-UMA/TEGDMA (4.78 vol.%) was lower than that exhibited of the control organic matrix BisGMA/TEGDMA (6.85 vol.%) at the same dilution. The addition of one of the obtained monomers into a mixture based on urethane oligomers led to a polymerization shrinkage varying between 8.33 and 6.97 vol.%. A number of properties of the composites formulated with our urethane methacrylates, a urethane dimethacrylate, BisGMA, and glass filler (Zr/Sr glass, quartz, and diatomite) were also determined including the surface damage caused by the Vickers indentation to establish their utility in dentistry.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311414071" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the field of dental materials, copolymers based mainly on diglycidyl methacrylate of bisphenol A (BisGMA) have been extensively used as the organic matrix in restorative applications for nearly 50 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311414071">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311414071">2</xref></sup> Usually, the resin composites contain a mixture of relatively viscous photopolymerizable monomers taken in combination with reactive diluents such as triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) and various inorganic fillers (up to 80 wt.%) to provide greater rigidity and toughness. Most studies have shown that the choice of the organic structures implied in the formation of interpenetrating polymer networks in tandem with the filler (nature, size, loading, shape, distribution, adhesion, etc) could significantly improve the properties of the resulting materials. In spite of several practically validated advantages, the main deficiencies of current resin composites are polymerization shrinkage which occurs when the material is cured, the relatively high percentage of unpolymerized (meth)acrylate functions and the susceptibility to water sorption,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311414071">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311414071">4</xref></sup> all leading to a deterioration of the physical/mechanical properties of the materials, for instance, marginal leakage, insufficient abrasion and inadequate resistance to wear, degradation and fatigue, toxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311414071">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311414071">6</xref></sup> To surmount these critical aspects, one of the approached strategies proposed the use of novel basic monomer systems such as, modified BisGMA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311414071">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311414071">8</xref></sup> fluorinated and spiro-orthoesters,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311414071">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311414071">10</xref></sup> liquid crystallineor hyperbranched monomers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311414071">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311414071">11</xref></sup> Other research tasks aimed at developing urethane di(meth)acrylates (UDMA) for use as organic matrix in polymeric composites with substantially enhanced mechanical properties and minimized polymerization shrinkage, resulting from the effective binding ability of the urethane structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311414071">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311414071">14</xref></sup> Moreover, some of these urethane dimethacrylates can be used alone, or in combination with TEGDMA and/or BisGMA to formulate new efficient dental adhesive systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311414071">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even though the resin composites are versatile, these adhere poorly to dentine/tooth substrates reason for that, they need to be used together with adhesives for achieving strong bonding between hydrated dentine and resin composites. Consequently, new acidic monomers with phosphate or carboxylic groups have been designed, prepared, and successfully tested as adhesive resins, owing to the strong hydrogen bonds formed by the acid moiety, promoting thus adhesion to tooth structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311414071">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311414071">17</xref></sup> Because of this feature, the use of more adhesive bonding agents may counteract volumetric shrinkage and the resulting stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311414071">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Within the family of multifunctional methacrylates, our attention has been focused on the synthesis of poly(oligo(ethylene oxide) urethane dimethacrylate)s with carboxylic acid moieties on the backbone to be reacted with specific monomers and inorganic particles for generating materials suitable for dental restorations or adhesives. Compared to the non-acid dimethacrylates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311414071">19</xref></sup> it is expected that the latter to exhibit better characteristics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311414071">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311414071">21</xref></sup> but in this case, there is no sufficient information that allow us to draw a correlation between properties and structural/compositional factors of the involved monomers in the formation of dental composites.</p>
<p>In this contribution, we describe the behaviour of three new monomers like hybrid monomethacrylates with urea/urethane moieties and Si(OR)<sub>3</sub> end groups, and urethane methacrylate-modified BisGMA inside the dental formulations, where acid/nonacid urethane oligodimethacrylates and other partners (BisGMA, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), fillers) are incorporated in a conventional manner. In addition, the effect of the chemical structure of the monomers and mixtures of mono- and dimethacrylates on the relevant physical properties of the photo-cured composites has been investigated.</p></sec>

<p>The commercial monomers used in this study are BisGMA, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), and triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.). Polyethylene glycol (PEG, Mw = 400), 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl) propionic acid (HMPA), L-tartaric acid (TA), isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), 2-isocyanatoethyl methacrylate (IEMA), 3-isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane, 3-aminopropyl(diethoxy)methylsilane, and dibutyltin dilaurate were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Chemical Co. and used without further purification. The initiators used were 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone (Irgacure 651), camphorquinone (CQ), and 4-(dimethylamino)-phenylacetic acid (DMPheAA) (from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.). The fillers used were Zr and Sr glass (1:1): granulation under 5 μm (about 97%); density 2.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, quartz: granulation -40 μm (about 97%) and diatomite (granulation 500–45 μm), all kindly supplied from Gr. T. Popa University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Iasi, Romania. The Zr and Sr glass was silanized by using the silane coupling agent 3-methacryloyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTS) from Sigma Aldrich Chemical Co. For silanization, the glass was mixed with 1.0 wt.% water and 5.0 wt.% MPTS at room temperature over a period of 2 h, the modified filler being subsequently dried at 50 °C for 4 days, according to a method described in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311414071">22</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0021998311414071"><title>Synthesis</title>
<p>Methacrylate derivative with silane and urea groups (UHM-1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311414071">Scheme 1</xref>) was synthesized starting from 3 g (15 mmol) 3-aminopropyl(diethoxy)methylsilane dissolved in 30 mL anhydrous THF and 2.26 mL (15 mmol) 2-isocyanatoethyl methacrylate, the mixture being stirred at 40 °C for 24 h in the presence of 100 μL dibutyltin dilaurate (0.15 mmol) used as catalyst. The course of the reaction was followed through the infrared absorption of the isocyanate stretching band (2260 cm<sup>−1</sup>), the reaction being considered completed after the disappearance of the NCO band from spectrum. To remove the catalyst, the monomer solution in methylene chloride was stirred with 2% HCl solution (4:1 v/v) at room temperature. After separation of the organic phase and the evaporation of solvent under vacuum, the silane methacrylate UHM-1 was collected as colourless viscous oil.

<p>For the preparation of the second urethane methacrylate UHM-2, 4 g (38 mmol) diethanolamine coupled with 5.5 mL (38 mmol) IEMA, which subsequently was functionalized with 18.7 g (76 mmol) 3-isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane. Also, the reaction was followed through FTIR, the final compound being a pale yellow liquid. In the case of the BisGMA derivative, 5 g (10mmol) BisGMA were dissolved in 20 mL THF and 2.53 mL (18 mmol) IEMA were added, the reaction being conducted at 40 °C for 24 h. The calculation was made for the attaining of a 90% functionalization degree, the consumption of isocyanate groups being determined by FTIR. The purification of the final product (BisGMA-UMA) was performed as for the silane derivatives, this being collected after solvent evaporation as a colourless viscous liquid.</p>

<p>For the assessment of the photopolymerization by FTIR spectroscopy, mixtures of dimethacrylates and photosensitizer CQ (0.5 wt.%)/DMPheAA (1 wt.%)/ were homogenized and coated manually on the KBr plate, the thickness of the monomer mixtures being of about 12 μm (appreciated by means of a calibrated wire-wound applicator).

<sec id="sec11-0021998311414071"><title>Synthesis of monomers</title>
<p>To further extend the application of some photopolymerizable monomers in dental composites, new urethane (di)methacrylates have been prepared through an addition reaction of 2-isocyanatoethyl methacrylate (IEMA) to BisGMA resulting a derivative with urethane methacrylate groups (BisGMA-UMA), while the incorporation of silane structure into methacrylates involved the same addition of isocyanate group to amino or aminoalcohol functions in suitable conditions, avoiding the polymerization of methacrylate sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311414071">Scheme 1</xref>). The motivation behind the synthesis of inorganic-organic hybrid monomers was the hydrophobic nature of silyl fragment used in our formulations, known being that such structures have potential to improve the properties of restorative composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311414071">8</xref></sup> Thus, reacting IEMA with 3-aminopropyl(diethoxy)methylsilane in the presence of dibutyltin dilaurate used as the catalyst, a silyl methacrylate, N-(methacryloyloxyethyl-N’-diethoxymethylsilylpropyl)-urea containing urea group was obtained (UHM-1). Inasimilar manner, N-methacryloyloxyethyl-N’-bis (triethoxysilylpropylcarbamoyloxyethyl)-urea has been prepared through a step by step process, which assumed the reaction of IEMA with diethanolamine, followed by the condensation of 3-isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane with the formed product in the first step. Under these conditions, the formed methacrylate (UHM-2) has in its structure a urea group, two urethane units and two final fragments of triethoxysilyl. The structures of the dimethacrylates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311414071">Scheme 2</xref>) usedas co-monomers in our dental formulations consisted of urethane dimethacrylates based on (poly(ethylene oxide), M<sub>n</sub> = 400) with one or two carboxylic groups (CUDA-1, CUDA-2), and a non-acid analogue (UMO-1). All monomers, BisGMA-UMA, UHM-1, UHM-2, CUDA-1,2, and UMO-1 are viscous liquids at room temperature, and are soluble in acrylic monomers (TEGDMA, HEMA). The structures and purity of the synthesized products have been confirmed by the spectral analysis. For example, the <sup>1</sup>H NMR analysis of the BisGMA modified with urethane methacrylic groups (BisGMA-UMA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311414071">Figure 1</xref>) sustained that the degree of functionalization of the hydroxyl groups from the starting monomer was around 90%, as was initially established from the amount of reactants used in synthesis. This value which confirms the existence of 3.6 methacrylic functions on each molecule of BisGMA was obtained from the area ratio of the aromatic proton signal (6.81 and 7.11 ppm) to the olefinic proton signal (5.57 and 6.1 ppm). The FTIR spectrum of BisGMA-UMA (unshown here) exhibited absorption bands at 3376 cm<sup>−1</sup> due to urethane NH stretching vibration, while the stretching vibration of C-H can be identified in the region 2929–2962 cm<sup>−1</sup>. Also, the urethane carbonyl and ester functions appeared at 1720 cm<sup>−1</sup>, methacrylate units at 1637 and 815 cm<sup>−1</sup>, and C-O ether group gave absorption band at 1169 cm<sup>−1</sup>, all these sustaining the expected structure for BisGMA-UMA. Similarly, the structures of UHM-1 and UHM-2 were also confirmed.

<sec id="sec12-0021998311414071"><title>Photopolymerization of the urethane methacrylate monomers</title>
<p>In order to establish the photopolymerization behaviour of some reactive monomer mixtures in the absence of any filler, formulations incorporating urethane dimethacrylates, BisGMA, silyl methacrylate, and the CQ/DMPheAA system were irradiated with UV/visible light, and the progress of the curing reaction was monitored by FTIR spectroscopy. Practically, the disappearance of the stretching vibration ascribed to the double bond at 1637 cm<sup>−1</sup> during UV/vis exposure was followed, as a clear indicator of the photopolymerization of the monomer combinations. Thus, the decrease of the double bond absorption for the first mixture of four monomers namely, UMO-1 (18.5 wt.%), CUDA-1 (10 wt.%), BisGMA (40 wt.%), HEMA (30 wt.%) and CQ (0.5 wt.%)/DMPheAA (1wt.%) is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311414071">Figure 2(a)</xref>. For the given system containing acid and non-acid oligomers, the decrease of this peak area is consistent with the reducing of the molar concentration of double bonds, which initially was calculated to be of 1.31 [C=C]/mol. Therefore, it may be noted that the phototransformation degree of the double bonds attained upon 40 s of irradiation is of about 78%, confirming thus the high reactivity of this formulation. A gradual decay of the double bond absorption at 1636 cm<sup>−1</sup> after well-defined irradiation durations was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311414071">Figure 2(b)</xref>) for the monomer mixture based on UHM-1 (28.5 wt.%), BisGMA (40 wt.%), HEMA (30 wt.%), and CQ/DMPheAA, where the starting molar double bond concentration was of 1.20 [C=C]/mol. In this case, the conversion degree of the methacrylic function measured after 40 s of irradiation was of only 54.8%, but we should neither exclude the possibility that a post-curing (‘dark post-cure’) to occur for such composites within the first 24 h (Reference 15).
<fig id="fig2-0021998311414071" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Illustration of the decay in the double bond absorbance as a function of polymerization time for two formulations upon irradiation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311414071-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Complementary, data regarding the photoreactivity of the above monomers tested in dental formulations could be obtained by photo-DSC analysis, therefore therates of polymerization, conversion degrees and measured polymerization enthalpies are included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311414071">Table 1</xref>. The photobehaviour of these monomers was investigated under identical conditions of temperature, initiator concentration (1 wt.% Irgacure 651) and light intensity. The first set of experiments was carried out for the monomers CUDA-1, CUDA-2, UMO-1 and BisGMA-UMA, the photopolymerization rate profiles and the double bond conversions as a function of time being illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311414071">Figure 3(a)</xref>. As observed in the figure, the photoreactivity of UMO-1 reflected by the maximum polymerization rate (R<sub>p</sub> = 0.074 s<sup>−1</sup>) is increased in this noncarboxylic oligomer comparatively with the carboxylic homologues CUDA-1 (0.030 s<sup>−1</sup>) and CUDA-2 (0.046 s<sup>−1</sup>). On the other hand, the conversion degree decreases with the incorporation ofcarboxylic groups in the structure of urethane dimethacrylate possessing oligoethylene oxide segments and thesame concentration of double bonds per moles.Thus, the conversion degree for UMO-1 (DC: 75.3%) was found to be higher than in the case of dimethacrylate oligomers with one or two carboxylic groups (CUDA-1, CUDA-2), when conversion values of 53.5% and 46.1%, respectively, were attained. The observed behaviour can mainly be attributed to the increased number of hydrogen bonds which reduces the mobility of the dimethacrylate oligomers at the irradiation site,taking into account that the polymerization of the methacrylic functions is a diffusion-controlledprocess.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998311414071">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021998311414071">28</xref></sup>

<p>The monomer BisGMA-UMA which contains both urethane and methacrylate moieties showed the highest rate of polymerization (0.085 s<sup>−1</sup> after 3 s), most probably due to the high content in photopolymerizable groups and its more voluminous structure. Further rapid decrease of the polymerization rate with the development of cross-linking points, led to a final conversion of only 41.6%.</p>
<p>Influence of the hybrid structure on their photopolymerization was also investigated by examining the rate profiles of UHM-1 and UHM-2, which have one or two inorganic functionalities attached to the organic molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311414071">Figure 3(b)</xref>). In these conditions, the maximum rate of photopolymerization for UHM-1 reached even after 3 s of polymerization was found to be R<sub>p</sub> = 0.117 s<sup>−1</sup>, whereas for UHM-2 the maximum polymerization rate was lower (R<sub>p</sub> = 0.069 s<sup>−1</sup> after 4.6 s), since in the second hybrid monomer the double bond is sterically hindered by two silyl fragments connected on the chain end through urethane linkages. Additionally, the concentration of double bonds in UHM-2 is twice lower for the same amount of sample, taking into account that the molecular weight of the latter is almost double related to UHM-1. From the data illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311414071">Figure 3b</xref>, it can be observed that the UHM-1 monomer has a more rapid onset of the polymerization ascribed to the higher rate of polymerization although its final conversion is of only 65.9%. It is evident that for UHM-2 a better conversion is achieved (75.1%) at a lower rate of polymerization. This observation may be also attributed to the increased number of double bonds per gram in UHM-1 leading to a denser network, where the double bonds are less accessible to polymerization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021998311414071">29</xref></sup> Therefore, excepting UMO-1, all the urethane monomers exhibited an inverse relationship between the polymerization rate and the degree of conversion, which may be assignable most probably to the microviscosity changes appeared during the photopolymerization process.</p>
<p>However, in addition, the behaviour of the monomer mixture by photo-DSC must be considered. We began by examining the monomer combinations used in FTIR experiments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311414071">Figure 3(c)</xref> shows the photo-DSC plots for the mixture UMO-1 (18.5 wt.%), CUDA-1 (10 wt.%), BisGMA (40 wt.%), HEMA (30 wt.%), and for UHM-1 (28.5 wt.%), BisGMA (40 wt.%), HEMA (30 wt.%). The maximum rate of photopolymerization in the presence of CQ (0.5 wt.%)/DMPheAA (1 wt.%) increased slightly with the incorporation of hybrid methacrylate (0.0403 s<sup>−1</sup>) as compared to the first mixture (0.0327 s<sup>−1</sup>). Unfortunately, the degree of conversion (after 40 s irradiation) resulted by photo-DSC was lower in the case of first mixture (57.3%) than that obtained by FTIR, whereas for the second combination (DC: 50.4%) no significant difference in behaviour was observed. These results may be explained by the different power of the irradiation sources.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec13-0021998311414071"><title>Polymerization shrinkage</title>
<p>Given that polymerization shrinkage (PS) of a composite is related to multiple factors, such as curing intensity and time, the structure, molecular weight and amount of monomer, as well as the degree of conversion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021998311414071">30</xref></sup> is needed to clarify how the chemical structure of our monomers affects this parameter (PS) that accompanies polymerization of the organic matrix. Under these circumstances, only two aspects were varied, the methacrylate chemical structure and the weight ratio of the monomer units in the polymer network. Firstly, we determined the volumetric shrinkage due to polymerization of the monomer mixture based on BisGMA-UMA diluted with TEGDMA (60:40), compared with BisGMA and TEGDMA (60:40), the latter mixture being chosen as control organic matrix. Notably, a significant decrease in curing shrinkage in the mixture BisGMA-UMA/TEGDMA (PS = 4.78 vol.%) relative to BisGMA/TEGDMA (PS = 6.85 vol.%) has been found after 60 s of curing, but such finding is not surprising considering the fact that photopolymerization was carried out in the absence of any kind of filler. Moreover, the addition of TEGDMA to modified/non-modified BisGMA at a given mass fraction, had only a limited impact on the resin mobility, and therefore, TEGDMA does not provide an increased PS, as expected according to literature data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021998311414071">31</xref></sup> The relatively low volumetric shrinkage in our monomer mixture can be attributed to the specific structure of BisGMA modified with urethane methacrylic moieties, which have a dominant role in the diffusion-controlled photopolymerization reaction affecting thus its conversion. Ultimately, for each monomer composition given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311414071">Table 2</xref>, polymerization shrinkage was also determined. From the data included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311414071">Table 2</xref>, it is evident that the incorporation of BisGMA-UMA (40 wt.%) in the comonomer mixture of S3 formulation, composed of UMO-1 (18.5 wt.%), CUDA-1 (10 wt.%), and HEMA (30 wt.%) had as result a decrease in volumetric shrinkage from 8.33 vol.% (in S1) to 7.33 vol.% (inS3). By replacement of CUDA-1 with CUDA-2 inS4,polymerization shrinkage is slightly lower (S4: 6.97 vol.%) than that obtained for S3. When the composition derived from S6 (PS: 8.08 vol.%) that contains the hybrid monomethacrylate UHM-1 (23.5 wt.%), CUDA-2 (5 wt.%), BisGMA (40 wt.%), and HEMA (30 wt.%) was analyzed from this point of view, a modest decrease in PS was found comparatively with that shown of the polymers produced in S1, suggesting that the organic-inorganic nature of UHM-1 could be responsible for the observed effect. Hence, the influence of monomer resin composition, the molecular weight of the monomers and their conversion is not reflected through important differences concerning PS in our systems. In terms of volumetric shrinkage of the polymer matrix, these values are relatively high due primarily to the content of HEMA used as co-monomer, but they are comparable with those reported for photopolymerized highly crosslinked polymers, especially, incase of the adhesive resins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021998311414071">32</xref></sup> The conclusion drawn from these results would indicate a more advantageous choice of comonomer compositions for wanted adjustments in resin formulations, but for this, further research is required.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec14-0021998311414071"><title>Surface properties</title>
<p>Useful information about the properties and capacity of these materials to be employed as dental resin composites are provided through the inclusion of (di)methacrylates, along with commercial derivatives used frequently in such formulations, where an important amount of filler has to be added. In this point, it should be mentioned that although HEMA is well known as a hydrophilic monomer, it is often used in dental applications, both in adhesive systems and resin composites.<sup>26,30,33</sup> Contextually, the resin composites presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311414071">Table 2</xref>, were characterized by SEM analysis and contact angle measurements. Additionally, for the same compositions, we have prepared discs specimens which were stored in water, at 37 °C, in order to determine the water sorption and water solubility of thesamples, important parameters for the material viability. For a composite formulated with the monomermixture UMO-1, CUDA-1, BisGMA, HEMA, CQ/DMPheAA and 70% silanized Zr/Sr glass (S2, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311414071">Table 2</xref>), SEM examination of the unpolished specimen surface revealed a regular and smooth appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311414071">Figure 4(a)</xref>), however, on the surface being visible some filler particles, attributed to an incomplete mixing of the components. The SEM picture recorded on the same composite after 21 days of water treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311414071">Figure 4(b)</xref>), reflected the formation of cracks, suggesting a relatively poor adhesion between the methacrylic components and the inorganic filler, although the organic matrix contain carboxyl groups and silanized filler.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021998311414071">34</xref></sup> Furthermore, the study was extended to other composites investigated by SEM, namely S6 and S7, in which the UHM-1 monomer having silyl end groups was introduced alongside a small quantity of carboxylic oligomer CUDA-2. The employing of silyl methacrylate monomers in this type of composites is motivated by their ability to participate to polycondensation reaction between the silane groups besides the photochemical cross-linking through the double bonds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021998311414071">35</xref></sup> In the case of composite S6 (fracture), in which the filler employed was quartz, the surface is relatively homogeneous, with a small number of quartz particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311414071">Figure 4(c)</xref>). The use of new filler like diatomite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311414071">Figure 5(a)</xref>) led to the formation of a highly irregular surface for the S7 composite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311414071">Figure 5(b)</xref>), owing to the large interval of granulation. On the other hand, by storing in water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311414071">Figure 5(c)</xref>) the cracks appeared on the composite surface S7 are more pronounced reflecting a poor adherence between the organic matrix and diatomite filler.

<p>The water contact angle results, which are indicative of the wetting properties of the resin composites, are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311414071">Table 2</xref>. It can be seen that generally, a modification of the concentration of carboxyl groups in composite formulations is not an essential element for a significant variation of the contact angle values. The comparison between the contact angle values determined for the composites S1-S7 allowed us to affirm that their hydrophilicity is mainly influenced by the nature of filler. As can be remarked, the abundance of PEG and HEMA sequences in the first 5 formulations (27.2–41.3°) induces an increase of the hydrophilicity comparatively with S6 (68.16°) and S7 (63.28°) samples, where the percent of urethane monomers used is only of 5 wt.%. Also, it may be noticed that the use of quartz filler caused a modest increase of the contact angle, due to its hydrophobic nature.</p>
<p>Furthermore, another significant feature responsible for the viability of such materials into a wet environment by ensuring adequate mechanical properties and a non-porous and smooth surface has to be evaluated. Water sorption is a diffusion-controlled process that occurs in the organic resin matrixes and primarily depends on hydrophobicity and crosslinking density of the cured resins. The results of water sorption given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311414071">Table 2</xref>, revealed that the composite resins comprising urethane oligomers, modified/nonmodified BisGMA and HEMA have been characterized through a value of water sorption ranging from 1.13 to 1.69 wt.%. Compared to S1-S5 composites incorporating the silyl-urea monomer and a small amount of CUDA-2, more reduced values were determined for S6 (0.43 wt.%) and S7 (0.75 wt.%), the single difference between the latter being the nature of filler (quartz, diatomite). This behaviour is a consequence of the high hydrophilicity generated by means of the poly(ethylene oxide) spacer which may be compensated by using of variable quantities of BisGMA or other hydrophobic derivatives. On the other hand, the leaching of small molecules in the presence of water is a usually occurring process which takes place when composite resins are in contact with water and oral fluids. The values obtained for water solubility in the samples S1-S7 (0.28–1.21 wt.%) are in good agreement with data reported in the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311414071">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311414071">26</xref></sup> and these may be correlated with the water sorption and contact angle data. Once more, the reduced values concerning water sorption and water solubility experiments indicated good water behaviour of all resin composites S1-S7 formulated with our monomers and other commercial components.</p>
<p>To observe the surface damage caused by the Vickers indentation, polarizing optical microscopy (POM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used in this study. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311414071">Figure 6(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311414071">b</xref>) depicts the characteristic Vickers indents on the S6 composite surface, where four specific lines are visible, but these did not produce at microscopic level the radial and lateral cracks alongside the four main lines generated of indentation. Varying then the nature of composite, it clear that both methods support the formation of a linear crack developed from an edge within the pyramid, with effect on the surface behaviour, observable at microscopic level. Since such observation is important for explaining the first cracks appeared in these dental resin composites, additional investigations will be further taken into consideration in our laboratory.

<list-item><p>the photopolymerization results obtained by photo-DSC suggested that the most reactive monomers are hybrid monomethacrylates, BisGMA modified with urethane acrylic groups followed by the non-acidic urethane dimethacrylate and the acidic dimethacrylates;</p></list-item>
