<sec id="sec22-0961203313476360"><title>Objective</title>
<p>Fatigue in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is burdensome and must be assessed using validated scales. Although the psychometric properties of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy–Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) scale in SLE have been evaluated previously, its content validity in this disease remains to be evaluated. The study objective was, therefore, to evaluate content validity of the FACIT-Fatigue in SLE.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-0961203313476360" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Three SLE focus groups (<italic>n</italic> = 21) in the United States were conducted using semi-structured interviews. Participant comments were categorized by response type, and relative response strength was qualitatively assessed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec24-0961203313476360" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Participants were mostly female (90%; <italic>n</italic> = 19), white (57%; <italic>n</italic> = 12) with a mean age of 43.7 years (range = 28–70). Most scale items were considered relevant with the exception of four items for which participant interpretations varied<italic>.</italic> Consistent with the scale’s measurement model, “listless” on item 3 (“<italic>I feel listless</italic> (‘<italic>washed out</italic>’)”) was interpreted as physical or mental impairment. Participant responses to item 8 (“<italic>I am able to do my usual activities</italic>”) sometimes included influence of other health conditions, which is acceptable because it is difficult to separate disease-specific and general fatigue. Some participants found item 7 (“<italic>I have energy</italic>”) irrelevant and most could not relate to item 10 (“<italic>I am too tired to eat</italic>”). However, both items were intended to capture the extreme ends of fatigue (item 7, ceiling; item 10, floor).</p>

<sec id="sec1-0961203313476360" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fatigue is the most common symptom of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and affects between 50% and 80% of patients with SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313476360">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313476360">2</xref></sup> Although the causes of fatigue in SLE are unknown, numerous contributing factors have been implicated such as disease activity, mood disorder, poor sleep patterns, low levels of aerobic fitness, and fibromyalgia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313476360">2</xref></sup> Fatigue in SLE can be debilitating and can affect a patient’s ability to work, function, or perform daily activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313476360">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313476360">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because fatigue places considerable burden on SLE patients, routine assessment of fatigue using a questionnaire validated for SLE patients is important for optimizing disease management. The North American Nursing Diagnosis Association defines a nursing diagnosis of fatigue as an overwhelming sustained exhaustion resulting in decreased capacity for physical and mental work at the usual level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313476360">3</xref></sup> Thus, a holistic approach to fatigue assessment must include both physical and mental aspects of fatigue.</p>
<p>In the context of clinical trials, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) acknowledges fatigue as an important symptom of SLE and recommends inclusion of fatigue as an endpoint in SLE clinical trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313476360">4</xref></sup> An ad hoc committee for SLE response criteria for fatigue recommended that the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) be used for measurement of fatigue in SLE clinical trials based on a systematic literature review of fatigue instruments used in SLE from 1970–2006 that showed that the FSS was the instrument most commonly used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313476360">5</xref></sup> The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy–Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) is a 13-item patient-reported questionnaire that assesses self-reported aspects of physical and mental fatigue and their effects on function and daily living.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313476360">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313476360"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313476360">8</xref></sup> FACIT-Fatigue was not assessed in the ad hoc committee review because it had not been used in SLE at that time. Goligher et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313476360">9</xref></sup> compared seven fatigue questionnaires, including FACIT-Fatigue, FSS, and the SF-36 Vitality domain, and found FACIT-Fatigue demonstrated greater sensitivity to subjectively detectable differences in fatigue levels compared with the FSS and the SF-36 Vitality domain. Since then, Lai et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203313476360">10</xref></sup> have demonstrated acceptable measurement properties of the FACIT-Fatigue scale for evaluation of fatigue in SLE patients.</p>
<p>For instruments assessing endpoints in clinical trials, the FDA patient-reported outcomes (PRO) guidance recommends that PROs be validated for content and measurement properties in the population of interest for the evaluation of specific outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313476360">11</xref></sup> Content validity refers to the extent to which an instrument measures the concept of interest. The International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research PRO good research practices task force recommends that the content of an instrument be validated through the conduct of individual interviews or focus groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313476360">12</xref></sup> The evidence generated from such qualitative studies is used to support the appropriateness and comprehensiveness of the instrument relative to its intended measurement concept, population, and use. Lai et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203313476360">10</xref></sup> have evaluated the measurement properties of the FACIT-Fatigue in the assessment of fatigue in SLE patients using clinical trial data and established its construct validity; content validity still remains to be established. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to evaluate the content validity and appropriateness of the FACIT-Fatigue scale in assessing fatigue among adult patients with SLE using focus groups. The use of focus groups was relevant here because it allowed participants to compare their own fatigue-related experiences with those of others and allowed the use of others’ ideas to express their own views.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313476360">12</xref></sup> This made possible the collection of qualitative data to gauge participant acceptance of the content and format of the existing instrument and to explore any concepts that were relevant to the majority in their experience of fatigue in SLE.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0961203313476360" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>Three focus groups were conducted by NorthStar Research, Inc. (Bremerton, WA, USA) with subjects within the United States who suffered from SLE. Each site selected by NorthStar Research, Inc. maintains a site-specific database of potential participants. Focus group participants were recruited by telephone, and their eligibility was determined based on responses to predefined screening questions. Eligible participants were men and non-pregnant women aged 18 to 74 years who were fluent in the English language. A diagnosis of lupus/SLE after the age of 16 years and duration of SLE for ≥6 months were also required.</p>
<p>Participants were excluded if they were ever treated for, or diagnosed with, end-stage renal disease/dialysis, seizures, HIV infection, hepatitis infection, active herpes infection, scleroderma, or neuropsychiatric disorders where concentration and memory are affected. Those who had experienced depressive symptoms (felt sad, blue, depressed; or had loss of interest in activities that were previously of interest) lasting ≥2 weeks in the past year, had been treated with anticonvulsants, or had participated in a focus group or in-depth interview for research purposes within the last three months were also excluded. There were no exclusion criteria based on gender or ethnicity.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0961203313476360"><title>FACIT-Fatigue</title>
<p>The FACIT-Fatigue scale assesses the impact of fatigue over the previous seven days (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203313476360">Table 1</xref>). The questionnaire assesses physical fatigue (e.g., “I feel tired”), functional fatigue (e.g., “trouble finishing things”), emotional fatigue (e.g., “I am frustrated by being too tired to do the things I want to do”) and social consequences of fatigue (e.g., “limits social activity”). Subject responses are on a Likert scale and range from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). Final scores are the sum of responses and range from 0 to 52; higher scores indicate less fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313476360">8</xref></sup>

<sec id="sec5-0961203313476360"><title>Study design</title>
<p>Three 90-minute focus groups were conducted at three sites in the United States (Baltimore, MD; Chicago, IL; Los Angeles, CA) from 30 November to 3 December, 2009. All three focus groups were conducted by one moderator (Don Saunders from NorthStar). Each focus group included 6–8 participants. The study was approved by the New England Institutional Review Board.</p>
<p>Before beginning the focus group, written informed consent for participation was required. Participants were then rescreened for eligibility. If they qualified, demographic information was collected. Participants then completed the 13-item FACIT-Fatigue questionnaire and marked questions that were most and least relevant to their experience with SLE. Participants were then asked for their views regarding clarity of the instrument’s directions, the assessment time frame, the relevance and wording of each item, and the response choices using a semi-structured format based on best practices outlined by Brod et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203313476360">13</xref></sup> The focus groups also discussed new topics, questions, or domains that could be added to provide more relevant content regarding fatigue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0961203313476360"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Comments regarding specific instrument items were categorized by response type and compiled across sites by the same moderator who conducted the three focus groups (Don Saunders from NorthStar). Relative response strength across participants was assessed qualitatively using qualifiers such as “most” or “many” to indicate the greatest strength of unanimity amongst participants, “some” and “several” to indicate moderate strength, and “few” and “a couple” to indicate lowest strength. When no qualifier was present, it was assumed that the comment reflected participants’ overall beliefs.</p>

<sec id="sec9-0961203313476360"><title>Experience with fatigue in SLE</title>
<p>Fatigue was considered to be the most debilitating and pervasive symptom in participants’ daily lives. Fatigue was described by participants as feeling “drained”, “weak”, or “worn out”. The cognitive impact of fatigue was described as being unable to concentrate or think clearly, with terms such as “between coma and brain dead”, “a huge weight pressing down”, “brain tired, can’t think”, or feeling as if they had been “overdosed with muscle relaxants”. When assessing the impact of fatigue on their lives, participants were more often focused on the inability to perform physical tasks rather than on cognitive impairment.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0961203313476360"><title>FACIT-Fatigue scale evaluation</title>
<sec id="sec11-0961203313476360"><title>Instructions</title>
<p>Participants found the instructions clear and easy to follow. About one-fourth of the participants based their responses on their SLE experience; in most other cases, participants based their responses on health conditions either related or unrelated to SLE (e.g., fibromyalgia, thyroid) or on external circumstances (i.e., job stress or family illness).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0961203313476360"><title>Seven-day evaluation period</title>
<p>Several participants (8/21) felt the seven-day evaluation period was ideal. One stated,<disp-quote>
<p>Because it's narrowed down to the past seven days, that helped me in answering this question … if you had [asked] me that, you know, a couple years ago, it would have been totally different ‘cause what I usually did then I cannot do now.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Two participants suggested a two-week recall and six indicated that a month would more appropriately reflect average fatigue levels. For example, one participant commented, “a month, I think, is more consistent ‘cause you have highs and lows but then you’re averaging it out”. It was also suggested that the instructions explicitly ask participants to average their responses over the evaluation period. Other participants based their responses on their fatigue level at the time of completing the instrument. Only two of 21 participants indicated that a one-day time frame would be desirable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0961203313476360"><title>Item evaluation</title>
<p>Overall, participants found the FACIT-Fatigue items to be relevant to SLE and easy to comprehend and interpret. Although some participants held somewhat different perceptions from others in their group, their overall perceptions were consistent based on their agreement in how they responded to the items.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Item 1: I feel fatigued</italic></bold>. Participants unanimously agreed that this item was relevant and important. Participants also commented that as fatigue levels could vary over a seven-day period, their response choice was based on their average fatigue experience over the evaluation period.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Item 2: I feel weak all over</italic></bold>. Many participants identified the feeling of being weak as an indicator of being fatigued. Weakness was also not always distinguishable from fatigue or listlessness. For example, one respondent remarked,<disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes the fatigue and the weakness are separate. Sometimes they merge together. You’ve got energy but just don’t have any to get up and go … There’s a separation in it. Get up and go is desire or maybe even having the physical strength to do it.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Many participants interpreted feeling weak as not having the strength to engage in the physical tasks they normally would have been able to engage in; it caused them to require help with even simple tasks. Others viewed feeling weak as a mental state and that giving into such a feeling led to reduced physical capabilities.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Item 3: I feel listless (“washed out”).</italic></bold> Participant interpretations of “listless” varied. Some participants (6/28 comments) considered listlessness an emotional or mental state in which they were uninterested in engaging in activities. For many (15/28 comments), listlessness was interpreted as a physical state in which they lacked energy and were incapacitated.</p>
<p>A few participants were uncertain regarding interpretation of the meaning of listlessness. Some relied on the secondary phrase “washed out”, which was interpreted as a physical state similar to the physical interpretation of “listless”. However, some commented (3/28 comments) that the two terms had dissimilar meanings, making comprehension of the item more difficult. Participants commented “I feel I'm tired, I'm fatigued, but I don't equate that with washed out” or “the word ‘washed out’ … can mean so many different things”.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Item 4: I feel tired</italic></bold>. Feeling tired was considered a relevant aspect of fatigue by participants; however, it was distinct from fatigue in that it is milder and does not impair one’s ability to engage in normal activities. One participant commented, “Tired is I haven’t had enough sleep. Fatigued is I had sleep, but I just don’t have enough energy to get up and walk across the room”. Several participants suggested that being tired preceded fatigue. They indicated that once they had become very tired, they often entered into the fatigued condition. Some participants further suggested that while they were not always fatigued, they were unlikely to be not tired during a seven-day period.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Item 5: I have trouble starting things because I am tired</italic></bold>. A variety of factors contributed to participants’ responses to this item, and not all were related to SLE. Some participants indicated that having trouble starting things was due to tiredness. For example, one stated that “I have trouble starting things because I’m tired. That happens to me quite a bit … my mind is like ‘Yes, let's go’, and my body’s like ‘No, not today’”. Others reported that they did not want to begin because they were fearful of becoming tired and fatigued and not being able to finish. One respondent commented, “It’s that it’s going to be a process, and you won’t be able to finish so why bother starting?” Still others had trouble starting things owing to non–SLE-related factors (i.e., procrastination, other health conditions, or emotional reasons).</p>
<p><bold><italic>Item 6: I have trouble finishing things because I am tired</italic></bold>. Participants associated not finishing tasks primarily with SLE-related tiredness. Finishing tasks was generally more difficult than getting started; as one respondent commented, “I can start something, but not finish”.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Item 7: I have energy</italic></bold>. Some participants felt this item was not sufficiently relevant to living with SLE, given that they constantly felt tired. Even those who felt the item was relevant found it difficult to answer because it did not capture their experience of daily fluctuations in energy. One participant responded,<disp-quote>
<p>Well, when you don’t have any symptoms you have this burst of energy and you feel invincible. There are no aches. There’s no pain. There’s no mental fatigue. And then that lift that you have that’s been sitting to the side of things to do, all of a sudden that looks good, and you just go at it full force because you know at some point you’re going to crash and you’re going to not have that energy.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><bold><italic>Item 8: I am able to do my usual activities</italic></bold>. This item was viewed as relevant to living with SLE given that most participants were at times unable to complete their usual activities. Usual activities for most meant their normal activities of daily life including housework, professional work, and social activities. However, some comments (7/21) indicated this item was not sufficiently linked to fatigue or SLE or did not capture the modification of their usual activities over time as a result of SLE. Additionally, the time frame of reference varied among participants. Some comments (5/21) indicated that responses were based on current activities. Other comments (8/21) indicated that their responses would change over time as they modified the intensity of their “usual” activities with disease progression. For instance, several respondents said, “my usual activities are not the usual activities that somebody else who doesn’t have lupus are … In the past five to 10 years I don’t do things that I would usually do” and “my usual certainly is not what my usual was 10 years ago or so”.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Item 9: I need to sleep during the day.</italic></bold> Participants felt that this item accurately reflected living with SLE. Most participants indicated that they would nap during the day to prevent fatigue onset but that this strategy failed at times.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Item 10: I am too tired to eat</italic></bold>. A few participants (2/16 comments) associated being too tired to eat as a result of SLE. However, most participants indicated that meal avoidance was not due to their SLE-related fatigue; rather, it was the effort required to buy and prepare food that was more relevant to SLE-related fatigue (10/16 comments), as illustrated by the comment, “I would say the preparation part because if somebody else fixes it for me then, you know, it's not so much an issue. But if I have to get up and fix it then … I'd just as soon skip it”.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Item 11: I need help doing my usual activities</italic></bold>. Participants agreed that sometimes they needed help with activities such as personal hygiene or food shopping. One participant remarked, “I can go to the grocery store. And I can buy all the stuff. But then I can’t get it into the house”.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Item 12: I am frustrated by being too tired to do the things I want to do</italic></bold>. Participants agreed that the inability to engage in activities and complete tasks was frustrating. Factors affecting this sense of frustration included disappointment and having to rely on others. One respondent commented that<disp-quote>
<p>sometimes I can have this list of things I want to do, and I can wake up and be like, “Nope, not going to happen”. And that just frustrates me because if I want to run here, I want to go there, but I just don’t have the energy. And it’s frustrating because then you’re just prolonging it. You’re putting it off for another day, just increasing; your list is just getting longer and longer.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Another participant emphasized the impact her fatigue had on others, commenting, “Yes, I’m very much frustrated that I’m too tired … I try to make plans and I end up upsetting a lot of people because, even though I make them, … I end up cancelling”.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Item 13: I have to limit my social activity because I am tired</italic></bold>. Participants expressed that much of their frustration with SLE was based on their inability to engage in social activities as much as they would like. Many commented on the impact this had on their personal relationships:<disp-quote>
<p>My friends have a really hard time understanding that I have to take a nap and that I can’t stay out until four o’clock in the morning. And I can’t drink really … The people that are my age, they’re still out partying, they’re still out having fun and, of course, I want to do all those things, but I learned when I was first diagnosed that I’m not physically capable of doing that. And if I don’t rest I will be in the hospital.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>and<disp-quote>
<p>Now that my kids are older, I can hang out more with my girlfriends and things like that, but sometimes I just don’t have the energy to do it, especially in the evening.</p></disp-quote></p>

<sec id="sec14-0961203313476360"><title>Response options</title>
<p>Participants indicated that they did not struggle to choose from the response options; this was confirmed by the fact that they did not attempt to select multiple response options for an item when first asked to complete the questionnaire before beginning the interview. Participants, however, did express that the meaning of some of the text options was uncertain. For instance, they were unclear about the difference between “a little bit” and “somewhat” or between “quite a bit” and “very much”. Thus, to some degree they tended not to rely on the verbal cues but rather rely on the numeric option. They viewed their response options on a five-point scale and assumed equidistance between the response options.</p>

<p>Fatigue is recognized as a highly prevalent and debilitating symptom of SLE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate content validity of Version 4 of the 13-item FACIT-Fatigue scale in three focus groups of SLE patients. Additionally, the focus groups were allowed to discuss any concepts that were relevant to the experience of fatigue in SLE in an open-ended way.</p>
<p>Overall, study participants found the format of the FACIT-Fatigue scale satisfactory for reporting their fatigue-related experiences. When responding to items, most participants based their responses with reference to health conditions that were related or unrelated to SLE or on external circumstances. However, this does not limit the validity of subject scores on the FACIT-Fatigue scale. Although the FACIT-Fatigue scale is a general instrument that does not instruct patients to consider their SLE in responding to items, we believe that most SLE patients are likely to have worse fatigue scores regardless of their point of reference (i.e., SLE, SLE-related and non–SLE-related) because of the debilitating nature of fatigue that is experienced by most. To date, there are no data to suggest that SLE-specific fatigue questions would capture fatigue level or change over time better than general fatigue questions as they are applied to patients with SLE. Additionally, instructing patients to consider their SLE while responding to the items assumes that patients are capable of separating their disease-related fatigue from treatment-related fatigue, or from other sources of everyday fatigue. We believe that this is not a skill that is widely prevalent or evenly distributed across patients. Moreover, in a clinical trial setting where the tool would be administered to SLE patients to evaluate effect of a treatment for SLE (vs placebo) on fatigue, this may be a non-issue. Using a generic tool also provides the opportunity to ask the same questions of other groups and therefore compare disease burden and treatment impact scores across conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203313476360">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>In evaluating adequacy of the seven-day recall period, some participants (<italic>n</italic> = 8/21) suggested that a longer evaluation period may be beneficial to capture events that occurred in prior weeks or months. An even smaller number of comments (<italic>n</italic> = 2) indicated that respondents’ lives change daily and that a shorter period would be more accurate. However, participants were able to adequately recall and average their experiences over seven days when responding to the items, suggesting that the seven-day evaluation period provides a good level of response validity. Although there is increased momentum towards use of daily and momentary assessments for measuring patients’ reported symptoms in clinical trials, the fact that patients preferred longer recall challenges the movement towards daily and momentary assessments. Daily assessments are much more cumbersome and costly to implement in trials. Previous reports have shown a high degree of correlation between momentary and seven-day recall periods,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313476360">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203313476360">16</xref></sup> although seven-day recall ratings were inflated compared with momentary assessments. In clinical trials, such reporting bias will be consistent across treatments being compared, which does not affect interpretation of treatment effect on fatigue as an outcome. Further, a criticism of momentary assessments is that such assessments can miss “peaks” of worsening during the day resulting in lower “mean” values, thereby affecting interpretation of treatment benefits.</p>
<p>Most participants found FACIT-Fatigue items relevant to their SLE experience. However, there were some items where issues with comprehension were identified. For instance, the third item on the FACIT-Fatigue scale corresponds to “I feel listless (washed out)”. The feeling “listless” was interpreted in different ways by participants. Most of the respondent comments (15/28 comments) focused on a lack of energy as the interpretation of “listless”. They expressed a lack of energy as an inability to complete physical movements or tasks. Some participants (6/28 comments) believed that being listless measured an emotional or mental weakness and inability, which is consistent with the scale’s measurement model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313476360">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313476360"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313476360">8</xref></sup> Further discussion within the focus groups indicated that some items in the FACIT-Fatigue scale were also related to the concept “listless”. Participants indicated that item HI7 “I feel fatigued” most often meant mental or cognitive impairment and that the item HI12 “I feel weak all over” related to the lack of physical energy. Used together, the item An1“I feel listless” is supported for measuring the overall construct and the items for “Fatigue” and “Weakness” provide insight into the dimensions of the “listless” construct.</p>
<p>A majority of the participants relied primarily on their interpretation of the term “listless” to respond to the item and a few (4/28 comments) indicated their reliance on the phrase “washed out”. A few participants (3/28) commented that “washed out” was a confusing phrase to clarify the term “listless”. Interpretation of being “washed out” by those relying on the term to respond was based on some combination of physical and mental impairment. Others felt that being “washed out” did not relate well to being “listless”. Because the clarifying term “washed out” was suggested by patients during the original development of the scale, it was retained in the questionnaire. The term “washed out” was meant to indicate “lack of energy”. Inclusion of the term “washed out” instead of “lack of energy” would not affect patient responses because the scale also includes an item that measures patients’ level of energy (An5: “I have energy”). Because the majority of patients in the focus groups did not rely on the term “washed out” to interpret the term “listless”, modification of this item would not affect the content validity of the instrument.</p>
<p>Some participants felt that item 7 of the scale that corresponds to “I have energy” was not relevant to SLE given that they were constantly tired. However, the true meaning of content validity hinges on the fact that an instrument covers an entire range of the concept being measured.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203313476360">17</xref></sup> This item extends the measurement of item 4, which is “I feel tired”, into the positive well-being range of fatigue. As treatments become more effective in controlling the symptoms of SLE, restoring energy may be a plausible outcome. If such an item were left out of the instrument, then there would be no means for capturing that benefit and there is a high likelihood of observing ceiling effects on item 4. This item is, therefore, relevant for inclusion in the FACIT-Fatigue scale.</p>
<p>Item 10 of the scale, which is “I am too tired to eat”, presented a concern similar to that with item 7. Most participants responded to the item without regard for the accuracy of their response to the actual item phrase. A few participants (<italic>n</italic> = 2 of 16) indicated that their responses were based on their inability to physically eat. However, the remaining responses (<italic>n</italic> = 10 of 16) were not based on the physical inability to eat, but rather on participants’ inability to prepare meals due to fatigue. Most participants concluded that they were able to eat if someone were to prepare the meal for them. From discussions with Dr Cella, this item was intended to be a floor item that captured fatigue severe enough to prevent patients from doing the basic function of eating. Content validity is best characterized by inclusion of a representative set of questions with regard to the range of content covered by a given domain, such as fatigue. In the case of being too tired to eat, the content is meant to cover the very high end of fatigue where even life-sustaining activities such as eating are impaired by fatigue. The item is therefore relevant for inclusion in the FACIT-Fatigue scale. As a floor item, it provides information on the extreme end which is important to understand the distribution of fatigue in any patient population.</p>
<p>Item 8 of the scale, “I am able to do my usual activities”, suffered from two concerns. First, participants did not always address the item based on their SLE experience. They answered based on the effect of other conditions on their ability to complete activities. Second, some participants referred to the question based on their pre-SLE “usual activity” level and indicated that range of their “usual activities” had been reduced. These issues suggest that patients may need to be provided with a direct reference to SLE if we want to understand the contribution of SLE to their fatigue. Similar to the discussion with instructions this assumes that patients are capable of separating their disease-related fatigue from treatment-related fatigue, or from other sources of everyday fatigue. Even experts have recommended that, “If possible, patients should not be asked to attribute their symptoms to a cause”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313476360">12</xref></sup> In a clinical trial setting in which the tool will be administered to SLE patients to evaluate the effect of a treatment (vs placebo) on fatigue, this may be a non-issue because patients will be provided with an informed consent form that provides information about the intervention at hand (for SLE) providing patients adequate context when responding to scale items.</p>
<p>In selecting a response category, we observed that many participants relied on the numerical value associated with a response option whereas some referred to the response option title. An explanation for the difference in approach was that those participants relying on numeric value were not confident in their ability to assign “quantity” of experience in selecting an appropriate response option.</p>
<p>This study had some strengths and limitations. First, we used focus groups to evaluate content validity of the instrument. This allowed us to gauge collective acceptance of the content of FACIT-Fatigue and explore any fatigue-related concepts that were important to the majority of responders. However, one limitation with focus groups compared with individual interviews is that data generated with such methodology can sometimes be difficult to analyze because a participant’s response can itself be a response to comments of other group members.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313476360">12</xref></sup> Another limitation is that the presence of one highly vocal group member can sway the direction of discussions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313476360">12</xref></sup> Because our findings were consistent across all three focus groups, we believe that some of these limitations may have been mitigated.</p>
<p>The study also included participants from different ethnicities although diversity in sociodemographic characteristics such as education may be underrepresented. No participants below high school diploma or general education diploma (GED) participated in the study. Although there is no evidence to suggest that fatigue levels vary by education level, empirical evidence suggests that, in general, subjects with higher education levels have better coping and acceptance of their disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203313476360">18</xref></sup> As a consequence, participant responses in this study may have been biased due to better coping. However, the FACIT-Fatigue scale was originally developed for cancer patients who experience comparatively worse fatigue. As discussed earlier, therefore, the scale adequately includes items that capture fatigue at its worst (floor effect).</p>
<p>Another strength of the study was that it represented geographical diversity within the United States; the study was conducted in Baltimore, Los Angeles and Chicago, which also limits the study generalizability to SLE patients within the United States. Future studies must evaluate content validity of the FACIT-Fatigue scale among SLE patients from other countries to evaluate any variation in interpretation as a result of cultural differences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313476360">19</xref></sup> Similarly, in following the FDA PRO guidance that requires questionnaires to be validated in a specific population of interest to support endpoints in clinical trials, numerous exclusion criteria such as the presence of neuropsychiatric SLE and age &gt;74 years applied. This too, limits the generalizability of our study to SLE patients that meet our inclusion criteria.</p>
<p>In conclusion, all 13 items of the FACIT-Fatigue scale were considered relevant and sufficient for assessing fatigue among participants with SLE. Participants did not reject the items as being outside their range of experience. Participants were also provided the opportunity to provide any additional content that described their fatigue experience in SLE. They, however, did not offer any additional content for consideration. This suggests that from a content perspective, the FACIT-Fatigue scale instrument is valid and appropriate for the assessment of fatigue in SLE.</p>
