<body>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is a leading cause of adult disability and is a significant global health problem. In 2011, 25.8 million people were estimated to have diabetes in the United States and this figure is expected to rise to more than 40 million by 2050.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721713479144">1</xref></sup> More specifically, type 2 diabetes contributes to 90% to 95% of this number. Fatigue is a persistent and distressing complaint among people with type 2 diabetes. While fatigue also occurs in other medical disorders, the importance of fatigue may be greater in individuals with type 2 diabetes due to the complex management strategies that must be continually maintained. Fatigue can take a considerable toll on individuals with diabetes, yet there is little empirical research describing the severity of the problem. Defining fatigue is a challenge because there is a great discrepancy among causes and indicators. In general, fatigue is recognized as a complex phenomenon including physiological, psychological, and situational components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721713479144">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721713479144"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721713479144"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721713479144"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721713479144"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721713479144">7</xref></sup> Since fatigue itself is difficult to define and is such a complex phenomenon, it becomes very challenging to transform fatigue into a quantifiable measure. To date, the most accurate or appropriate fatigue scales remain controversial. However, there are few a scales that appear to adequately identify and measure fatigue in individuals with diabetes; these scales include Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS), and Visual Analog Fatigue Scale (VAFS),</p>
<p>Fatigue can result from various physiological factors associated with diabetes, such as hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and the wide swings between the two.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721713479144">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721713479144">9</xref></sup> Polypharmacy, referring to the numerous medications this population has to take, can result in a number of complications and side effects including fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721713479144">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721713479144"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721713479144">12</xref></sup> Numerous complications such as sleep disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721713479144">13</xref></sup> or chronic neuropathic pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721713479144">14</xref></sup> can add to the burden of fatigue. The presence and number of diabetic complications have been shown to have a significant impact on quality of life in a number of studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721713479144">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721713479144"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721713479144"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721713479144">18</xref></sup> Fatigue can also result from various lifestyle issues, such as lack of physical activity or high body mass index (BMI), which is commonly seen in people with type 2 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721713479144">19</xref></sup> Certain psychological factors like depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721713479144">20</xref></sup> or stress resulting from the diagnosis of diabetes or from the management of diabetes can also result in fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721713479144">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721713479144"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721713479144">23</xref></sup> Therefore, it is very important to further explore this issue and identify the potential contributors of fatigue.</p>
<p>In an epidemiological study of 1137 subjects with type 2 diabetes, the prevalence of fatigue was found to reach 61%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721713479144">24</xref></sup> Despite this high frequency and the impact of fatigue on the persons’ treatment efficacy, few studies have explored this symptom dimension in patients with diabetes, and most have been limited to nonspecific symptoms of fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145721713479144">25</xref></sup> Fatigue studies done in the past were either tested in subjects with additional comorbidities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145721713479144">26</xref></sup> or with additional challenges of maintaining employment status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145721713479144">27</xref></sup> Therefore, future studies need to be done to find out how diabetes itself plays a role in fatigue levels of these individuals.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the presence and severity of fatigue in people with type 2 diabetes as compared to a group without diabetes and to identify the relationship between fatigue and certain variables of diabetes. An additional purpose was to compare three standardized measures of fatigue, the Fatigue Severity Scale, Fatigue Assessment Scale, and Visual Analog Fatigue Scale, to determine which would be the most appropriate tool to measure fatigue in this population.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section10-0145721713479144">
<title>Measures of fatigue</title>
<p>The Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) is a reliable scale for detecting the presence and severity of fatigue in terms of both physical and mental domains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145721713479144">28</xref></sup> It focuses on the physical and mental domains of fatigue. FAS is a 10-item questionnaire that requires a subject to choose 1 out of 5 answer categories varying from never to always (1 = never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = regularly, 4 = often, and 5 = always). Responses for each question are summed to generate a score ranging from 10 to 50. Higher scores indicate more fatigue.</p>
<p>The FAS has previously been shown have good reliability, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.90 for employed subjects (n = 351). The measure also demonstrates good validity, with factor analysis demonstrating strong construct validity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145721713479144">28</xref></sup> and concurrent validity with other fatigue scales, such as the Check List Individual Strength subjective experience of fatigue (<italic>r</italic> = .76, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145721713479144">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) emphasizes the impact of fatigue on daily life in terms of accumulation of functional fatigue effects, which appears suitable for detecting the presence and the severity of fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145721713479144">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145721713479144">30</xref></sup> FSS is designed to differentiate fatigue from clinical depression, since both share some of the same symptoms. The FSS tests different domains, including motivation, exercise, and interference with work, family, or social life. It emphasizes the impact of fatigue on daily life in terms of accumulation of functional fatigue effects, which appears to be suitable for detecting the presence of chronic fatigue. It has 9 item questionnaires, and scoring is done by adding up the responses (numbers) and dividing by 9. A score of less than 4 is considered as having no fatigue, scores of 4 to 4.9 are considered as having moderate fatigue, and scores of 5 or more are considered as having severe fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145721713479144">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>The FSS has previously shown to have good reliability measures with a Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89 for subjects with systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 28), 0.81 for subjects with multiple sclerosis (n = 25), 0.88 for normal healthy adults (n = 20), and 0.88 for total sample of 74 subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145721713479144">29</xref></sup> The measure also demonstrates good validity. Results of factor analysis show strong construct validity when tested in cancer patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145721713479144">30</xref></sup> demonstrating strong construct validity. Additionally, FSS has strong concurrent validity with other scales, such as visual analog scale (n = 74) was <italic>r</italic> = 0.68; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145721713479144">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Visual Analog Fatigue Scale (VAFS) is a modified form of a visual analog scale that was designed to assess acute or transient fatigue in patients with stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145721713479144">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145721713479144">32</xref></sup> It consists of a 10 cm unmarked vertical line with written descriptions of “no fatigue” and “very severe fatigue” at each end. Subjects are asked to mark on the line the point where they feel their perception of fatigue is. Scores range from 0 to 100 and are measured in millimeters on the 10 cm vertical line. Scoring is done by measuring the line from no fatigue to the point indicated by the subjects. The higher the VAFS score, the higher the fatigue. VAFS has a major advantage among the other fatigue tests in that it avoids recollection among subjects. Rather, it requires subjects to base their answers on intuitive response at the moment, which helps avoid recollections of previous references.</p>
<p>The VAFS has been shown to have good reliability, with intraclass coefficient values for the VAFS = 0.851 (95% CI, 0.673-0.936, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) for subjects post stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145721713479144">32</xref></sup> The measure also demonstrates good validity, demonstrating strong concurrent validity, with significant co-relationships with heart rate and systolic blood pressure (<italic>r</italic> = 0.632, <italic>P</italic> = .02).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145721713479144">32</xref></sup></p>

<title>Medical history form</title>
<p>Participants completed a medical history form, consisting of questions about age, gender, height, weight, year of diagnosis of diabetes, and a list of possible complications from diabetes that included: nerve problems, kidney disease, blindness or eye problems, heart attack or heart disease, stroke, amputation, high blood pressure, dental problems, problems with pregnancy, and problems with sexual function.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section12-0145721713479144">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test and Wilcoxon signed rank test were used to test for differences in fatigue measures between participants with diabetes and those without. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S test) was used to compare the distribution of FSS, FAS, and VAFS scores in participants with diabetes and those without to a standard normal distribution curve. Potential floor and ceiling effects of the three measures were also analyzed. Spearman rank correlation coefficients were also calculated to explore the relationships between fatigue scores with age, gender, weight, height, year of diagnosis, and number of complications in participants with diabetes. Number of complications was calculated by adding up the number of yes answers in the list of complications. A significance level of .05 was utilized for all testing.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>Participants with diabetes in this study appeared to have higher fatigue levels when compared to controls without diabetes at a comparable age. Although fatigue is a common complaint among patients with type 2 diabetes, few studies have directly tested the presence and severity of fatigue in people with type 2 diabetes. Our results are in agreement with previous studies that have used FSS as a primary measure to assess fatigue.</p>
<p>For example, Ceullar et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145721713479144">26</xref></sup> conducted a study evaluating fatigue, sleep, glycemic control, and depression in subjects with type 2 diabetes, both with and without restless leg syndrome (RLS). FSS was used to test fatigue and it was found that the mean FSS score for subjects with RLS and diabetes was 3.8. These results are in accordance with our pilot study, in which the mean FSS score in the diabetes group was 4.28 ± 1.49, representing a moderate level of fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145721713479144">29</xref></sup> This compared to a mean FSS score of 2.60 in the control group, which represents a low level of fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145721713479144">29</xref></sup> In another study examining subjects with immune mediated polyneuropathies, FSS was used as the primary tool to determine the prevalence and severity of fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145721713479144">33</xref></sup> Mean FSS score was 5.6 ± 1.4 in the patient group, which represents severe fatigue. These results may be relevant to our study because patients with diabetes often have similar symptoms resulting from neuropathy.</p>
<p>Merkies et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145721713479144">33</xref></sup> defined severe fatigue as a FSS score above the 95th percentile of FSS in healthy controls, or a score of 5.0 or more. Following this criteria, severe fatigue was demonstrated in 13 of 37 (35%) individuals in our survey. Additionally, over 45% of the diabetic survey participants scored 5 or more on the 7-point scale for question 8 (“Fatigue is among my three most disabling symptoms”) compared with only 12% (4/33) of the healthy controls.</p>
<p>Of the 3 fatigue measures used in this study, all 3 indicated that individuals with diabetes exhibited significantly greater levels of fatigue than control subjects. Since fatigue is such a complex phenomenon and is difficult to measure, 3 different tools were used to assess fatigue. All these tools have different conceptual definitions: FAS tests the presence and severity of fatigue in terms of both physical and mental domains, FSS emphasizes the impact of fatigue on daily life in terms of accumulation of functional fatigue effects, and VAFS assess acute or transient fatigue at the moment. Thus, although these tools have different conceptual definitions, all tools appear to be valid in measuring fatigue in people with diabetes.</p>
<p>Further, analysis of distribution curves revealed that FSS was normally distributed, even in this small sample, which may indicate that FSS is the most appropriate test to use in this population. None of the fatigue measures showed ceiling or floor effects, as the scores were widely spread over a broad range and not clustered at the either end of the scoring range.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, we were not able to identify any relationships between fatigue and the diabetic variables, such as BMI or years since diagnosis. Fatigue was only found to be significantly associated with number of complications. This finding supports previous studies that the number of complications can affect quality of life of individuals with diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721713479144">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721713479144"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721713479144">17</xref></sup> The relationship between fatigue and the number of complications is understandable, as more complications can logically result in more tiredness or fatigue. Our survey participants reported high blood pressure and neuropathy as the most common comorbidities and/or complications resulting from diabetes. Both high blood pressure and neuropathy can cause general tiredness and fatigue. Neuropathy was the most common complication reported by our survey participants, and foot pain (resulting from neuropathy) has been previously found to be positively correlated with symptoms of general fatigue (<italic>r</italic> = 0.63, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721713479144">14</xref></sup> in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Our study also showed a surprising negative direction in the relationship of fatigue (VAFS) with age. In contrast, we would expect a positive relationship between fatigue and age. This could be due to the small sample size of the study and the complexity of fatigue with potential causative factors.</p>
<p>Although this survey successfully identified the presence of fatigue in people with type 2 diabetes, there are several limitations associated with this study. The first and most obvious limitation is the small sample size, which may have influenced the lack of significant relationships between fatigue and variables such as duration of diabetes. This relationship may also be complicated by the fact that there is often a period of unawareness prior to a diagnosis of diabetes being established.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145721713479144">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145721713479144">35</xref></sup> Future studies should incorporate other variables, such as fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin measures, and inclusion of other common comorbidities like depression, pain, and sleep problems. This may substantially clarify the relationships and contributing factors to fatigue in diabetes.</p>
<p>Another limitation of the study was the use of anonymous surveys, as we were unable to verify the data or follow up with the subjects. Further, fatigue is such a complex phenomenon that questionnaires alone will not capture the whole picture of fatigue. Therefore, there is a need to incorporate more rigorous methods to capture the whole phenomenon of fatigue in patients with diabetes.</p>
<p>As a part of diabetes management, individuals with diabetes are highly encouraged to engage in physical activities. However, due to the presence of fatigue, people with diabetes may have difficulty starting or continuing exercise programs. Exercise may actually reduce fatigue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145721713479144">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145721713479144">37</xref></sup> as aerobic fitness improves, and this is an important area for future study.</p>
<p>In conclusion, people with type 2 diabetes appear to have greater levels of fatigue, and the number of the complications resulting from diabetes may be related to this tiredness. FSS is recommended for measuring fatigue in people with diabetes. Overall, these results appear to support previous research suggesting that individuals with diabetes suffer from general tiredness and fatigue, which may be linked to complications from diabetes. As this may be an important area for patient education and diabetes management, further investigation is warranted to examine fatigue and its contributing factors in people with type 2 diabetes.</p>
