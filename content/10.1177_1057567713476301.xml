<title>Reframing Concepts of Sex Trafficking in the Global Commercial Prostitution Marketplace</title>
<p>Over the last 15 years, human rights advocates and victim service workers contended that sex trafficking is globally pervasive, is facilitated by large, organized criminal groups, and adult female victims are lured into the global commercial sex trade through fraud, force, and coercion. But with so few rescues of victims and even fewer self-reports of victimization, criminologists now question whether sex trafficking is very well understood. Are the full dimensions of the problem clear, especially as they relate to “push and pull” factors involved with global immigration patterns, women’s rights, poverty, inequality, and self-determination? What really is known about the demand side and diversification in the commercial sex marketplace? Why do government policies and law enforcement strategies appear ineffectual when the problems are supposedly widespread? Is the problem more country-specific than originally thought?</p>
<p>To date, research that was focused solely on adult female sex trafficking as compared, for example, with the trafficking of children, has been limited to just a few countries or regions. In the absence of hard data, political ideologies have shaped criminal definitions of sex trafficking and stereotypes of who commits the crimes. The hidden nature of trafficking has meant that policy makers relied on anecdotal stories either from victims rescued by nongovernmental agencies or from those women who came forward to report their experiences, but probably did so at great physical, emotional, and financial risk. While there is agreement that victims’ voices should be heard, there is concern that using them as the sole source for sampling has delimited research outcomes because of selection bias.</p>
<p>Polarized, political agendas have further complicated investigation into the true nature of trafficking. Some factions believe women are victims of their circumstances while others maintain prostitutes make specific choices. These moral and philosophical differences have tended to reduce opportunities to investigate prostitution and trafficking, and in some cases, jeopardized funding that could have been used to conduct robust inquiries.</p>
<p>Many policy makers assume the transnational movement of sex workers is directly linked to human trafficking, but few studies have provided evidence of how these network connections are effectuated and by whom. The antitrafficking policy literature continues to discuss the business of moving women in terms of origin, transit, and destination countries, but many prosecutors have had difficulty proving that “movement” was as an element of the crime or that “movement” was coerced.</p>
<p>Central and timely to all of these concerns then, are the new findings from ethnographic work conducted by Ko- lin Chin and James O. Finckenauer. Over a 2-year period (2006–2008), the researchers examined various aspects of the Chinese adult, female commercial sex industry as it operates on the mainland as well as in destination locations including: Hong Kong, Macua, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia as well as two American cities, Los Angeles and New York.</p>
<p>In <italic>Selling Sex Overseas Chinese Women and the Realities of Prostitution and Global Sex Trafficking</italic>, the authors compile the results from over 300, in-person interviews that were conducted mostly in Mandarin Chinese and on-site in commercial sex venues. Sex workers, sex ring operators, human traffickers, law enforcement agents, government personnel, and victim service agencies were included in their interviews. Chin and Finckenauer rejected previously used sampling methodologies that focused only on trafficking victims. Instead, they sampled and interviewed prostitutes first. Then from that group, they attempted to identify trafficking victims using internationally accepted definitions of sex trafficking crimes and victimization.</p>
<p>Most of their findings run counter to current thinking about prostitution and trafficking. They expected to find multiple trafficking victims in the sample of Chinese women, but only a few were identified. There was virtually no fit when the stories and experiences from the interviewed women were analyzed and compared with the characteristics associated with trafficking crimes such as recruitment, transport, sale, control, levels of victimization, debt bondage, and other forms of exploitation.</p>
<p>Most women indicated they had rationalized their work in the sex industry finding financial gains and material successes outweighed any cultural or personal biases that might have deterred them from participation. And with just a few exceptions, most sent their earnings back to family members and relatives. The researchers did uncover different patterns within the business of prostitution dependent upon the destination country, and certainly relevant to questions surrounding the level of organized crime involvement in the transnational movement of Chinese women, they saw little evidence of any large-scale organizational facilitation of the prostitution industry. More often, a single “snakehead” or individual gang member recruited female prostitutes or made arrangements for their passage from the mainland to other countries.</p>
<p>Chin’s and Finckenauer’s research raises serious and alarming issues about current global anti-trafficking efforts as it relates to adult women prostitutes and trafficking victims. But they also offer new directions for research and policy analysis. In the later chapters of the book, they argue that the current paradigm of adult-trafficked women is based in myth rather than in reality, and therefore, does not serve fair public policy objectives. They believe more focus should be placed on the “demand” side since economic factors appear to be pushing women from their homelands. They call for more investigation of the business enterprises, practices, and facilitators involved in the movement of adult women such as document forgers and transportation operators. To reduce gender bias in the investigative process, they suggest more women should be involved in conducting studies of prostitution and trafficking. In sum, they argue for a new, far more grounded framing of the issues, using a discourse that is unbundled from politics and moral posturing. If they are right, and additional country-specific research supports their positions, then legislators, policy makers, and enforcement agents should move quickly to readjust anti-trafficking strategies.</p>
