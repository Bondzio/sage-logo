<title>Summary points</title>
<p>1. The group of patients with so-called ‘failed back surgery syndrome’ (FBSS) is very diverse. Published studies evaluating the outcome of surgical treatment vary widely in terms of surgical interventions that were performed. Results from these papers cannot be generally applied to all people who have persisting complaints after low back surgery.</p>
<p>2. The literature search that was performed demonstrated that the articles that scored as acceptable on assessment bias demonstrated a low to moderate patient-perceived recovery percentage. The only randomized controlled trial on this topic did not demonstrate a difference between instrumented fusion and cognitive intervention and exercise.</p>
<p>3. Current research does not show repeat surgery to be successful in ‘FBSS patients’, but clinical practice indicates that, in a small, carefully selected group, repeat surgery can yield rewarding results. However, parameters that make a patient prone to recover from a subsequent surgical intervention cannot be found in the literature.</p>
<p>4. The term ‘failed back surgery syndrome’ implies a causative role of surgery in a problem situation; failed back surgery syndrome is frequently regarded as failed back surgery. The literature does not, however, provide evidence for this.</p>
<p>5. It is important to inform the patient adequately to shape realistic expectations. Preoperative evaluation of parameters evaluating the psychological condition could help to better predict the outcome of surgery.</p>
<p>6. The term ‘failed back surgery syndrome’ has been demonstrated to be an ill-defined term, serving as a container for all kinds of back and leg problems, and wrongly implying a definite role for the surgical intervention in the aetiology. We suggest shifting the paradigm to ‘failed back syndrome’. With this term we suggest defining those patients with back and radicular leg pain without a structural deficit, or with a structural deficit that has a low a priori chance of benefiting from a surgical intervention.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The term ‘failed back surgery syndrome’ (FBSS) is used to describe a clinical condition defined by persistent or recurrent complaints of leg pain and/or back pain regardless of one or more surgical procedures of the lumbar spine. The definition of FBSS is modified by some authors by adding that at least one surgical intervention was to be performed and that pain should persist after the last surgical intervention, for at least one year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2049463713479095">1</xref></sup> The term implies that the surgery plays a role in the cause of the pain, although in most cases the surgical intervention was technically successful. It is known that nearly 20% of patients undergoing spine surgery will require secondary surgery for persistent pain or surgery-related complications during the subsequent years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2049463713479095">2</xref></sup> Success rates have been reported to drop to 30% after a second spine surgery, 15% after a third and approximately 5% after a fourth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2049463713479095">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>If back and/or leg pain persists for too long or if the patient is psychologically unable to deal with the pain, the medical care-giver is confronted with a desperate patient with persistent disabling chronic pain. This patient category is typically referred to as FBSS in most studies. Nevertheless, the term is often incorrectly used for low back pain that is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Factors contributing to FBSS include misdiagnosis of the original condition, divergent outcome expectations between surgeon and patient, wrong surgical technique, surgical complications, recurrent disc herniation and psychosocial problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2049463713479095">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2049463713479095">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2049463713479095"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2049463713479095"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2049463713479095">7</xref></sup> A specific cause of pain cannot be identified in many patients with FBSS. Pain may arise from viscera, blood vessels, nerves, bones of the spine and pelvis, muscles, or joints.</p>
<p>In order to place the entity of FBSS into perspective, one should realize that there are many patients with chronic low back pain. A simple classification of low back pain and leg pain is proposed by Waddell et al.:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2049463713479095">4</xref></sup> (1) pain caused by specific spinal pathology, e.g. tumour, infection or trauma, (2) nerve root or radicular pain and (3) nonspecific low back pain. The last group constitutes a large heterogeneous group of patients and concerns about 85% of the total number of cases.</p>
<p>Every human being will demonstrate degeneration of the lower back upon aging. In most people progression of degeneration will lead to some extent of low back pain. Whenever the degeneration cascade also affects neural structures that are subsequently decompressed, the back pain may remain present. Surgical interventions aiming at relief of nonspecific low back pain have a low a priori chance of being successful. There is a huge variation in aging patients, implying that several factors may play a role. Some of these factors are strictly medical, whereas others are socio-economic. ‘Workers’ compensation’ for instance, is an economic incentive for spinal stenosis surgery. Patients will not benefit medically from such economically driven incentives, and surgery for these motives is likely to result in poor outcomes. This may be a reason for figures in the literature stating that 13–20% of patients undergoing spine surgery require secondary surgery during subsequent years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2049463713479095">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2049463713479095">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The common factor in patients with FBSS is that they continue to seek treatment to relieve their pain. However, patients and treatments vary and so do the results. An overview will be presented of the literature describing the surgical treatment of patients suffering from FBSS; thereafter we will discuss our view of the term FBSS.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-2049463713479095">
<title>Search methods for identification of studies</title>
<p>A search was conducted by an epidemiologist (WJ) in PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science up to May 2012 for English-language papers by entering ‘fbss’ OR (‘failed back’ AND ‘surgery’) OR ‘post laminectomy syndrome’ OR ‘failed back surgery syndrome’. This resulted in 629 hits. Four hundred and eighty-seven non-clinical studies were excluded and 135 articles were full text screened. Communication with experts (MA, WP) yielded one more article.</p>
<sec id="section4-2049463713479095">
<title>Criteria for considering studies for this review</title>
<p>We included studies reporting on surgical interventions for FBSS with a follow-up period of at least 6 months (at least one surgical low back intervention in the past and persistent pain complaints). Exclusion criteria were absence of outcome measures of the specific treatment, cost-effectiveness study, review, conference proceeding, preliminary results, no indication mentioned, fewer than 10 patients included, and follow-up of less than 6 months.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2049463713479095">
<title>Assessment of risk of bias for the included studies</title>
<p>One author (CV-L) conducted the risk-of-bias assessment. Selection bias, patient selection and outcome scoring were evaluated. If selection bias was absent, three points were assigned: one point was subtracted for retrospective data analysis, one point was subtracted for intentionally omitting patients and one point was subtracted for more than 20% lost to follow-up (LTFU). Patient selection is crucial in judging the outcome of surgery on FBSS patients, and if the selection was correct two points were assigned. If rediscectomy or restenosis surgery was included one point was subtracted and if spondylodesis was performed for recurrent complaints with a self-limiting character or for complaints that could have been solved with a simple surgical decompression one point was subtracted. Outcome scoring with validated parameters was scored as two points: one point was subtracted for evaluating outcome with a non-validated parameter, and one point was subtracted if no patient-reported outcome measure was applied. One point was awarded for including a control group. The number of positively scored items was added up for each study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-2049463713479095">
<title>Data collection and analysis</title>
<p>From each study, both descriptive data (e.g. study population, types of treatment, types of outcome assessment, sample size, age, gender, follow-up duration) and quantitative data regarding outcome were extracted by one reviewer (CV-L). With sufficient clinically and statistically homogeneous and comparable reported outcomes, data were pooled with the aid of RevMan 5 for studies with control group and Excel for case series. To identify publication bias, funnel plots were examined.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 43 studies met the inclusion criteria. Fifteen of these studies reported on surgical interventions for FBSS. From three studies, only the abstract was available, and they were excluded from this review.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2049463713479095">9</xref>

<title>Demographic data</title>
<p>The number of men and women in most studies was more or less comparable, and the mean age of the described patients was about 50 years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2049463713479095">Table 1</xref>). The mean preoperative duration of complaints was documented in only a few articles; in all articles it was more than 6 months, according to our inclusion criteria. The mean follow-up varied from 12 months to 11 years.</p>

<p>Many of these articles described a group of patients who can be judged as FBSS patients, since they had undergone a lumbar spine surgical intervention and they still had complaints. However, a distinction should be made between patients with structural deficits and those without. The a priori chance of improvement after surgery increases with the presence of a straightforward indication, such as a first recurrence of a disc hernia or a second level of spinal stenosis. In this overview, this lack of distinction introduces bias.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper the term ‘failed back surgery syndrome’ is reserved for patients with persistent leg and/or low back pain regardless of one or more surgical interventions in the past. There was a wide variation in the type of surgical interventions that were performed in the included studies. The term FBSS is used for patients who had a recurrent herniated disc but also for patient who endured several instrumented low back surgeries. It is obvious that the group of patients is thus very diverse, and that results from these papers cannot be generally applied to all subjects with persistent complaints after low back surgery.</p>
<p>The term ‘failed back surgery syndrome’ has been demonstrated to be an ill-defined term, serving as a container for all kinds of back and leg problems, and wrongly implying a definite role for the surgical intervention in the aetiology. We suggest shifting the paradigm to ‘failed back syndrome’. We suggest using this term to refer to those patients with back and radicular leg pain without a structural deficit, or with a structural deficit that has a low a priori chance of benefiting from a surgical intervention.</p>
<p>Currently, the gold standard in the treatment of FBSS involves conservative management. Pain medication and pain intervention such as medial branch block, epidural steroids, intrathecal drug administration and spinal cord stimulation (SCS) need to be evaluated. Preferably, these approaches should be carried out by an interdisciplinary team.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2049463713479095">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Evidence-based guidelines on various treatment regimes of patients with FBSS are lacking since high-quality randomized controlled trials on this topic are scarce. The results of Brox et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2049463713479095">12</xref></sup> were discussed in this paper, concluding that lumbar fusion did not show any superiority over cognitive intervention and exercise. Kumar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2049463713479095">25</xref></sup> randomized 100 patients with FBSS in conventional pain medication management with or without spinal cord stimulation. Patients treated with additional SCS reported better pain relief, functional ability and patient satisfaction. However, given the large number of crossovers, the results should be interpreted carefully. North et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2049463713479095">26</xref></sup> randomized 50 patients with FBSS in reoperation and SCS. Similarly, it was found that significantly more patients from the reoperation group crossed over to the SCS group. Patient satisfaction and pain control were significantly higher in the SCS group, both randomized and crossover, making SCS more successful than reoperation.</p>
<p>The literature search that was presented in this paper demonstrated that there are not many articles that evaluate surgical intervention in patients with FBSS, that most of these articles are subjected to selection bias, that the variation in the applied surgical re-interventions and the indications is wide, and that the evaluation of outcome is often of poor quality. Only three articles score acceptable on assessment bias, and those articles demonstrate a low to moderate patient-perceived recovery percentage. It should be noted that Arts demonstrated that the perceived recovery is scored low, while the VAS leg and back pain and the ODI scores were acceptable. This tones down the outcome scores of most articles that did not include patient-reported outcomes. Current research does not show repeat surgery to be successful in this group of patients but clinical practice points out that in a small, carefully selected group repeat surgery can yield rewarding results. It would be interesting to know what parameters make a patient prone to recover from a subsequent surgical intervention. The literature, however, does not provide an answer. However, it seems reasonable to expect that those patients with a clinically correlating structural abnormality are most likely to benefit from a surgical intervention.</p>
<p>The term ‘failed back surgery syndrome’ implies a causative role of surgery in a problem situation. Generally, however, the term is reserved for patients who are operated on for low back problems, with or without neurological symptoms, in which the outcome of surgery was not satisfactory for the patient. It is possible that the complaints got worse after surgery, but a causative role for the surgical intervention is not obligatory for FBSS, or FBS as we suggest calling it. It has to be added, though, that the trend to treat spinal stenosis with complex fusion procedures is associated with increased risk of major complications, as described by Deyo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2049463713479095">27</xref></sup> A bad outcome of that type of surgical intervention does contribute to the negative view on the role of surgery in FBS patients.</p>
<p>If a patient continues to have persistent leg and/or back pain after a surgical intervention, it is caused either by inadequate performance of the applied surgical intervention or by additional factors that could not be solved with the performed intervention. It was documented before that long-term patient satisfaction after low back surgery for a herniated disc is absent in around 20–30% of subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2049463713479095">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2049463713479095">29</xref></sup> If the initial surgical intervention was inadequate, a further surgical procedure can be performed to achieve the original aim. If additional factors play a role, it is often difficult to pinpoint the causative factor. If a mechanical (sagittal balance) or dynamic (stability) component plays a role, spondylodesis can be a solution. It is, however, important to inform the patient adequately to shape realistic expectations. The psychological status of the patient plays an important role in this. It is very important to evaluate this condition before surgery is performed. Appropriate patient selection is mandatory to prevent unnecessary surgery and unsatisfactory outcome. If recurrent back surgery is evaluated, outcome parameters evaluating this psychological condition, such as the HADS (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scales), IPQ-K (measuring illness perception), and/or DS-14 (type D personality questionnaire) should be scored. (A type D personality has a tendency towards both negative affectivity and social inhibition.)</p>
<sec id="section14-2049463713479095">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The term ‘failed back surgery syndrome’ as it is used nowadays applies to a group of patients with a broad variation in surgical history and indication, wrongly implies a causative role for the surgical intervention, and is not subject to a clearly defined solution for the problems. The term should therefore be avoided, and replaced by ‘failed back syndrome’. This term should be reserved for patients with back and radicular leg pain without a structural deficit, or with a structural deficit that has a low a priori chance of benefiting from a surgical intervention.</p>
<p>If a patient was subjected to a low back surgical intervention and still has significant complaints, pain management should be dealt with in a multidisciplinary team, considering pain medication or pain intervention, for instance SCS. Psychological evaluation in the work-up is mandatory. Only in a small minority of patients, a surgical intervention should be considered if clinically correlating structural abnormalities are present.</p>
