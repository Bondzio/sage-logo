<p>Despite the push for fostering reflective practices in teacher education in the last 20 years, true reflection remains rare (Farr, 2011). Based on a detailed analysis of four mentor-teacher meetings in a graduate TESOL program, I show how specific mentor practices generate teacher reflection without explicit solicitations. Findings of this study provide some much needed specifications of what transpires at the level of interaction in mentor-teacher meetings in the context of second language teacher education. By engaging video as opposed to audio data, the study also offers an important methodological extension to the existing work.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The drive for fostering reflective practices in second language teacher education has gained great momentum in the last 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0033688212473296">Bailey, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0033688212473296">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0033688212473296">Brandt, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0033688212473296">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0033688212473296">Farrell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0033688212473296">Mann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0033688212473296">Wallace, 1991</xref>). Despite the strong focus on reflection, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0033688212473296">Copland, Ma, and Mann (2009)</xref> note the rarity of genuine reflection and call for a dialogic approach to feedback. In fact, improving the quality of post-observation conferences and understanding how teachers learn are two of the persistent problems in recent second language teacher supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0033688212473296">Bailey, 2009</xref>: 272). Beyond perceptions and abstractions, however, systematic inquiries into how reflection is pursued and produced in the details of actual mentor-teacher interaction remain rare, rendering it difficult to bridge the gap between theory and practice. On the broader landscape, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0033688212473296">Wright (2010</xref>: 288) notes the paucity of research on the work of teacher educators themselves, calling attention to the larger trend of SLTE (second language teacher education) lagging behind developments in general education, and he calls for in-depth study of ‘the encounters experienced by participants in SLTE programs’ so as to reach a greater understanding of how teachers learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0033688212473296">2010</xref>: 289). The current project answers this call by undertaking an in-depth investigation of how reflective practices are managed in post-observation conferences in a graduate TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) program using the methodology of conversation analysis, thus building upon and contributing to the small body of work in this area both conceptually and methodologically.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0033688212473296">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Important work on post-observation conferences can be found in the fields of both general education and second language teacher education (SLTE), where theoretical considerations have revolved around models of supervision or supervisory styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0033688212473296">Freeman, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0033688212473296">Gebhard, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0033688212473296">Wallace, 1991</xref>). Much attention has been devoted to the direct vs. indirect style of supervision, where teachers have been shown to either prefer a direct approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0033688212473296">Copeland and Atkinson, 1978</xref>) or exhibiting a greater preference for an indirect approach as they gain more experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0033688212473296">Copeland, 1982</xref>). Studies on the actual mentor-teacher conversations have also generated crucial insights into a wide range of issues such as sequential moves (Arcario, 1995; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0033688212473296">Keogh, 2010</xref>), types of discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0033688212473296">Zeichner and Liston, 1985</xref>), nature of feedback (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212473296">Christensen, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0033688212473296">Strong and Baron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0033688212473296">Tang and Chow, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0033688212473296">Vasquez, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0033688212473296">Wajnryb, 1998</xref>), characteristics of teacher talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0033688212473296">Waite, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0033688212473296">1995</xref>), negotiation of face, topics and speaking rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0033688212473296">Copland, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0033688212473296">2012</xref>), and the danger of giving advice without identifying the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0033688212473296">Timperley, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Particularly relevant to the current study is the body of work that focuses specifically on issues of reflective practices in post-observation conferences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0033688212473296">Fanselow (1988)</xref> argues that the aims of supervision should be to explore and to see things differently, not to evaluate and to help – an orientation very much in line with the reflective approach that is ‘emerging as a dominant theme’ in second language teaching education (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0033688212473296">Bailey, 2009</xref>: 275). Suggestions for promoting reflection include, for example, talking less and being less directive (Ma in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0033688212473296">Copland et al., 2009</xref>), withholding value judgments or unsolicited feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0033688212473296">Brandt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0033688212473296">Zepeda, 2007</xref>), asking mediational questions such as ‘how do you think the lesson went?’ (Costa and Garmston in Myer-Mork, 2010), and making open-ended statements about some aspects of teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0033688212473296">Zepeda, 2007</xref>). Aside from writings on the difficulty of achieving reflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0033688212473296">Copland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0033688212473296">Orland-Barak and Klein, 2005</xref>), what might have contributed to the absence of true reflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0033688212473296">Copland, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0033688212473296">Holland, 2005</xref>), or whether the timing of the post-observation briefing affects the quality of reflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0033688212473296">Williams and Watson, 2004</xref>), prior work has also provided useful descriptions of the nature of reflective talk itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0033688212473296">Urzua and Vasquez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0033688212473296">Vasquez and Urzua, 2009</xref>). Much is left unknown (aside from abstract principles), however, regarding the role of mentor conduct in promoting or prohibiting teacher talk. So far, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0033688212473296">Chamberlin (2000)</xref> has alerted us to the importance of the mentor’s nonverbal behavior in inducing the teacher’s self-disclosure, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0033688212473296">Vasquez and Reppen’s (2007)</xref> carefully designed longitudinal study has produced compelling evidence of how teacher talk, when explicitly solicited, can increase dramatically in volume.</p>
<p>This study extends the existing literature by describing certain mentor practices that generate reflection without explicit solicitations. It is also hoped that my endeavor will complement the existing work on post-observation meetings methodologically by utilizing (1) video as opposed to audio data, upon which the work so far (to my knowledge) has been based and (2) conversation analysis (henceforth CA) as an analytical tool, the power of which is yet to be fully harnessed to elucidate the complexities of mentor-teacher interaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0033688212473296" sec-type="methods">
<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>Data for this study comprise four post-observation meetings video-recorded in a graduate TESOL program in the United States. The participants are course instructors and students in four practicum courses (2 Novice Practica and 2 Advanced Practica) required by the MA program. For simplicity, in this paper, I will refer to the graduate student as ‘teacher’ and the course instructor as ‘mentor.’ All four meetings were fully transcribed using the conversation analytic conventions (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0033688212473296">Appendix</xref>). A line-by-line analysis of all four transcripts in their entireties was then conducted with no specific focus except for capturing what is going on as experienced by the participants on a turn-by-turn basis. For each line in the transcript, I asked ‘why that now?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0033688212473296">Schegloff and Sacks, 1973</xref>). One of the dominant themes that emerged from this analysis is how teachers sometimes engage in reflective talk without being invited to do so. A collection was then made to gather all the instances of mentor practices that generate teacher reflections without explicit solicitations. Such instances turned out to be absent in one of the Novice Practica and most dominant in one of the Advanced Practica (extracts involving M1 and Ava below). A second-round analysis was then conducted for each extract with a focus on how each mentor turn generates reflective talk from the teacher, deploying a range of analytical tools. The categories of mentor practices to be presented below only became manifest during and after this second round of analysis. Although decades of conversation analytic research have successfully generated crucial insights into the professional competencies in a wide range of institutional contexts (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0033688212473296">Antaki, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0033688212473296">Drew and Heritage, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0033688212473296">Sarangi and Roberts, 1999</xref>), the particular approach to data as outlined above has not been, to my knowledge, fully and faithfully applied to the work on post-observation conferences. This study fills that gap.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, it may be useful to briefly consider how reflection is conceptualized in the literature. Whether it is ‘a recapturing of experience in which the person thinks about it, mulls it over, and evaluates it (Loughran in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0033688212473296">Brandt, 2008</xref>: 43), ‘ongoing conversation about teaching that gives teachers the opportunity to uncover the implicit beliefs and experiences that guide their pedagogy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0033688212473296">Chamberlin, 2000</xref>: 353), or ‘the ability to analyse an action systematically and to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the action in order to improve practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0033688212473296">Copland et al., 2009</xref>: 18), there is no doubt that much of this enterprise hinges, minimally, upon mentors’ ability to create a space that allows for the open sharing of teacher perspectives – a space that features trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0033688212473296">Chamberlin, 2000</xref>) or teacher-centeredness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0033688212473296">Vasquez and Reppen, 2007</xref>). In this paper, I detail how this space is installed via practices other than explicit solicitations. As such, reflection is loosely operationalized as the sharing of teacher perspectives, which may not always manifest the depth of analysis we seek in ‘true’ reflection but constitutes at least a basis for or beginning towards achieving that end. Finally, although I am aware that whether reflection truly leads to change remains inconclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0033688212473296">Griffiths, 2000</xref>), my goal in this paper is not to engage that debate but to offer a descriptive account of certain mentor practices that are potentially conducive to teacher reflections.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0033688212473296">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Within the current data set, the mentor practices that lead to the sharing of teacher perspectives without explicit solicitation can be placed into two major categories (1) assessment and (2) advice. In the analysis below, I use M1, M2, and M3 to distinguish among the three mentors. In the transcripts, the mentor’s assessment or advice turn is in bold and pointed to with a single arrow, and the teacher’s response/reflection turn with a block arrow.</p>
<sec id="section5-0033688212473296">
<title>Assessment</title>
<p>One environment in which teachers volunteer their perspectives is in response to mentors’ assessment, be it positive or negative. As the following segment begins, M1 is reading her observation notes that describe the purpose of the spelling bee activity and the students’ level of engagement. These descriptions are interspersed with both internal (‘engaged,’ ‘negotiation’) and external (‘I thought that was a nice combination’) evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0033688212473296">Labov and Waletsky, 1967</xref>) that are positively-valenced (lines 64, 66 and 69):

</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In lines 64 and 66, M1’s first positive assessment ‘nice combination’ is not particularly oriented to by Ava as good news, who acknowledges the comment with a nod, shifts her gaze to M1 but quickly back to the notes, keeps her gaze on the notes, and tilts her head with a scowl as M1 brings her assessment to a completion (lines 65 and 67), thus perhaps registering the possibility of ‘more to come’ and the ‘more’ as not particularly positive.</p>
<p>In line 70, M1 shifts her gaze from the notes to Ava and at the same time transitions from reading to talking, thereby treating this particular portion of written notes as worthy of direct delivery. It is in response to this gaze shift that Ava in line 73 takes a large inbreath that signals speakership incipiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0033688212473296">Jefferson, 1993</xref>). A few more supportive tokens ensue as M1 brings her positive assessment to its completion. In line 82, Ava’s second inbreath incurs transitional overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0033688212473296">Jefferson, 1983</xref>) as M1 goes beyond the possible completion point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0033688212473296">Sacks et al., 1974</xref>) in line 81. Once in the clear, in line 83, Ava produces a ‘large’ agreement token ‘yeah’ with dramatic pitch movements as well as vowel lengthening. This prosodic packaging along with the frown appears to embody the range and depth of Ava’s appreciation for M1’s observation so far and index a heightened sense of shared-ness in this assessment.</p>
<p>As the sequence continues to develop, we see Ava treating M1’s positive assessment so far as an opportunity, if not an invitation, to share her perspective, i.e. to provide an account of her mental process behind the activity. In lines 85-88, she does thinking discursively via the cut-offs, the ‘<italic>uh</italic>’s,’ the repetitions, the parenthetical epistemic downgrader, the painstaking delivery of ‘collaboratively’ in company with hand gestures, and finally, the thinking face. In line 92-93, she solicits M1’s confirmation of her interpretation with a rising intonation plus a hand-gesture, which M1 gives with the emphatic ‘yes’ – a supportive stance M1 takes throughout the telling (lines, 89, 94, 98 and 99) – in overlap with Ava’s explanation of the term she has proposed. Ava then produces a <italic>so</italic>-prefaced upshot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0033688212473296">Raymond, 2004</xref>) of her talk so far: ‘That was the idea’ in <italic>sotto voce</italic> (lines 97 and 100). What Ava’s term ‘collaboratively competitive’ highlights is her independent interpretation of what M1 has observed to be ‘engagement’ and ‘negotiation.’ By advancing such an independent interpretation, Ava also manages to assert her identity as a reflective practitioner.</p>
<p>In the next segment, the teacher produces a different type of uptake in response to the mentor’s positive assessment. In line 159, M2 begins a positive assessment on Fay’s management of timing. She goes on to detail exactly what she likes about it, i.e. having a set time limit and being strict about it (lines 163-65):
<disp-quote>

</p>
<p>In line 166, Fay produces a lengthened ‘yeah’ that serves less as an agreement to M2’s assessment and more as a preface to the upcoming talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0033688212473296">Jefferson, 1993</xref>). A disaffiliative stance begins to emerge as she shifts her gaze down to the notes along with the quick utterance of the contrastive marker ‘but’. With the restarted and then completed ‘I should’ clause (lines 166-70), Fay puts forward what, from her perspective, would be the desirable course of action, i.e. ‘give them more time’ rather than being ‘strict’ especially with writing. In so doing, she implicitly rejects the premise of M2’s positive assessment.</p>
<p>Earlier in the interaction (not shown here), M2 has alluded to the possibility of speeding up the lesson by <italic>not</italic> doing writing. At this point, it becomes clear that Fay does not view the time taken by writing as a problem. Rather, the problem for her is not allotting enough time to writing. In other words, Fay questions her own decision on the time allotment as well as the policy of adhering to the pre-set time, i.e. a moment of reflection that goes against the mentor’s proposal and assessment. In lines 173, 175-76 and 178, M2 aligns with Fay’s ‘rethinking’ and offers her own support for the soundness of Fay’s retrospective analysis.</p>
<p>In the final segment of this section, the mentor’s assessment is negative rather than positive. As the segment begins, M3 is in the midst of discussing her concerns. She topicalizes ‘teacher fronting’ in line 379, after which a positive assessment is produced to preface the observation that is more negatively valenced. The negative assessment is carefully mitigated not only with the positive preface but also with the downgrader ‘a little bit of’ and the cut off ‘like-’ (line 386). The core negative descriptor (‘controlling’) itself is delivered with a slight emphasis as well as its attending nonverbal iconic gesture:

</p>
<p>In line 388, immediately upon hearing ‘controlling,’ Amy shifts into incipient speakership with the ‘yeah’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0033688212473296">Jefferson, 1993</xref>) followed by an assertion of effort. A noticeable floor struggle emerges in lines 388-91: as Amy continues, M3 proceeds to specify ‘controlling’ with ‘lack of wait time’ (line 389). Amy drops out soon after the simultaneous talk starts (line 388) but picks up immediately upon M3’s completion of ‘wait time’ and manages to bring her ‘try to’ phrase to its completion. In lines 391-95, M3 interruptively produces a <italic>so</italic>-prefaced upshot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0033688212473296">Raymond, 2004</xref>) of her assessment. In line 396, Amy utters a ‘yeah’ along with nods immediately after M3’s lengthened ‘sti:ll,’ displaying her understanding of what is possibly coming up, and in this case, ‘controlling’ or perhaps one of its variations. In the meantime, the ‘yeah’ also appears to be a redoing of the ‘yeah’ back in line 388, as evidenced in the repetition of ‘I’m trying to back off’ in line 398. In other words, there appears to have been multiple attempts on Amy’s part to provide an account from her perspective, most of which have been ‘drowned’ in overlap so far.</p>
<p>In lines 395 and 397, M3 produces the query ‘so you noticed that also?’ immediately upon completing her <italic>so</italic>-prefaced summative assessment, thereby passing the floor to Amy. Note that the query solicits Amy’s confirmation of M3’s assessment without clearly attending to her account of ‘struggle.’ In the meantime, in line 398, Amy reinitiates her <italic>yeah</italic>-prefaced claim of effort upon the earliest possible completion point of M3’s query, which incurs transitional overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0033688212473296">Jefferson, 1983</xref>) as the latter continues with the adverb ‘also’ (line 397). In lines 398-401, Amy is finally able to bring her account to its full completion, where she reports her effort with an upgrade (‘a lot’) as well as the difficulty it involves. Amy’s account is supported by M3 with the nod (line 400) and an upgraded second assessment delivered in affiliative laughter (line 402). M3 then produces an extended analysis (lines 403-10 and 413) that specifies the nature of the difficulty as reported by Amy. No further response from the latter (except for slight nods) is observed from the rest of the sequence as M3 brings her analysis to a completion and proceeds to suggest self-videotaping as a means to reduce wait time (not shown here).</p>
<p>In sum, in these data, the mentor’s assessment appears to be treated by the teacher as an opportunity to share their own perspectives. A positive assessment can garner either affiliative or disaffiliative uptake, where the teacher presents an independent analysis of her success or reconsiders a pedagogical practice that has just been deemed favorable by the mentor. In the case of negative assessment, the teacher produces an account that asserts her effort at minimizing the undesirable. Such an assertion can constitute the beginning of further in-depth considerations of the nature of the difficulty as well as potential solutions.</p>

<sec id="section6-0033688212473296">
<title>Advice</title>
<p>A second environment in which teachers volunteer their perspectives is in response to mentors’ advice. Prior to the segment below, M2 topicalized ‘purpose of reading’ as she drew attention to a specific activity, where Fay asked the students to read an article and write down answers to a set of questions that required scanning. The activity took much longer than Fay had planned for (as alluded to in Extract 2 above). At one point in her comments, M2 raises the possibility of ‘speeding it up’ (‘if you want to speed it up’) and suggests ‘having them not write it down’ (not shown here). An intervening sequence transpires in response to some noise from outside, and as the segment begins, M2 in line 78 resumes her advising by raising the alternative possibility of doing just skimming:
<disp-quote>
<p>(4) skimming</p>
<p>77 M2:  ((<italic>turns to window</italic>))- oh it’s from outside? (0.2)</p>

<p>98 M2:  and <underline>I</underline> would jus’ expl↑ain it to them,</p>
<p>99  at the beginning.</p>
<p>100 Fay:   mmm.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In lines 81 and 85, Fay receives M2’s advice with ‘okay’ and nodding. In line 85, with a jumpstart, M2 rises above the specifics and makes a more general statement regarding the fit between the goal of the activity and the procedures that implement that goal, thereby returning to the topic of the purpose of reading she initiated earlier. In the meantime, the advice itself has gone from ‘do skimming’ to ‘do whatever that would fit with your objective.’ It is in response to this general piece of advice that we hear Fay’s report of her goal in designing the activity (lines 88-89). She does so by invoking the general-to-specific semantic relationship: using M2’s general mention of ‘what you were practicing’ as a springboard, Fay volunteers what she specifically was practicing without any explicit acceptance or rejection of the essence of the advice itself, thereby completing a stepwise topic shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0033688212473296">Wong and Waring, 2010</xref>: 120). In the next few lines (91-97), some confusion regarding skimming vs. scanning is resolved, and the sequence ends with the stating and acceptance of M2’s ‘I would’ advice.</p>
<p>The next segment also involves the teacher volunteering her purpose in designing an activity, except that in this case, rather than employing any stepwise topic shift, the teacher offers her perspective directly as an account for why she did not do the advised in the first place. Prior to the segment, M1 has suggested that with the spelling bee activity, Ava could have written the correct spelling down on the board. As the segment begins, M1 reformulates the gist of her advice so far with an amendment regarding the timing of the suggested course of action (lines 139-41 and 143), which Ava repeats immediately thereafter along with the supportive assessment ‘that’s true’ (lines 142 and 144-45):
<disp-quote>

</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Ava then proceeds to offer an account that to some extent defends her decision of not writing down the spelling. In particular, she produces a counter version of what M1 has interpreted as a missed opportunity for the other students, i.e. the others could find the answers on their own after all without the board display (lines 144-50; 152-56). M1 receives the counter-version with ‘m:::↑:::’ twice, which registers Ava’s thinking as interesting and noteworthy without either accepting or rejecting it. Ava rounds up her defense with a re-acceptance of M1’s suggestion although the word ‘extra’ diffuses M1’s point somehow by treating it as less than critical. What Ava does is therefore an example of ‘accept with account’ that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0033688212473296">Waring (2007)</xref> identifies as a practice deployed by advice recipients to minimize the asymmetry in the advising encounter. It is through this account that we catch a glimpse of Ava’s thinking in making a particular pedagogical decision.</p>
<p>In line 161, upon hearing Ava’s re-acceptance, in contrast to the equivocal ‘m:::,’ M1 produces a specific agreement token plus some incipient elaboration. Thus, it is Ava’s acceptance that M1 explicitly aligns with, not her version of the events that account for not writing on the board. The re-acceptance also allows M1 to rise above the account and counter-account tangle to a level of abstraction regarding ‘fun games,’ which serves as a pre-closing of the sequence that leads to an actual closing as both turn their gazes back to the notes (lines 174-75).</p>
<p>In the final extract, in response to M1’s advice, Ava offers a different type of account – one that foregrounds her independent struggle with but failure in achieving the advised. Prior to the segment, M1 made the suggestion to include some more communicative activities, and a great deal of discussion then revolved around what a communicative activity entailed (not shown here). As the segment begins, we arrive at a point where M1 is winding down on the discussion, and in lines 525-27, she articulates the benefits of having the students complete a communicative task:
<disp-quote>
<p>(6) more communicative</p>

</p>
<p>In line 528, Ava receives M1’s advice with ‘I definitely see what you mean,’ after which she asserts comparable thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0033688212473296">Waring, 2007</xref>) by framing what M1 has proposed as what she ‘struggled with’ independently. She offers a specific example of her struggling (i.e. her consulting the textbook) while admitting her tardiness in planning. She goes on to assert her competence by critiquing that textbook task (lines 540-52), which M1 endorses in lines 551 and 553-54. Ava brings her account to a close in lines 555-57.</p>
<p>In sum, the mentor’s advice, like assessment, also appears to be treated by the teacher as an opportunity to share her own perspectives that are constitutive of or conducive to reflection, and such sharing may be implemented through a revelation of one’s pedagogical purpose via a stepwise topic shift, an account for having opted for an alternative course of action other than the advised, or an extended telling of having attempted but failed at accomplishing the advised.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>In this paper, I have shown that the mentor’s assessment or advice can function as triggers for teacher reflections. In accepting or rejecting the assessment, the teacher engages a range of reflective talk such as articulating an independent analysis of her success, reconsidering a pedagogical practice, or relating her difficult endeavors in effectuating a certain behavioral change. In accepting or rejecting the advice, the teacher’s reflection ranges from detailing reasoning for an alternative course of action, asserting a critical stance towards the textbook materials, to depicting one’s diligence in pursuing but failure at obtaining a desired goal. Sometimes, teacher thinking in response to advising is not delivered as part of the acceptance or rejection package but leveraged through a stepwise topic shift.</p>
<p>Given the explorative aim of the study, these findings are intended to initiate rather than finalize an investigation. Admittedly, with the small sample size, there is no basis for claiming generalizability – not in the sense of ‘the traditional “distributional” understanding of generalizability’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0033688212473296">Peräkylä, 2004</xref>: 296). What CA achieves, however, is analytical generalization, where each case is related to a ‘theory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0033688212473296">Pomerantz, 1990</xref>). Each instance is evidence that ‘the machinery for its production is culturally available, involves members’ competencies, and is therefore possibly (and probably) reproducible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0033688212473296">Psathas, 1995</xref>: 50). Additional instances provide ‘another example of the method in the action, rather than securing the warrantability of the description of the machinery itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0033688212473296">Benson and Hughes, 1991</xref>: 131). In other words, the findings regarding mentor-teacher conversations in this study are generalizable not as descriptions of what other mentors and teachers do, but as what any other mentor or teacher <italic>can</italic> do.</p>
<p>Theoretically, findings of this study offer a microscopic look into how the much valued commodity of reflection in teacher education can emerge in the details of interaction without any explicit solicitation, thereby extending in particular the small body of work on teacher reflection in post-observation conferences. By detailing the emergence of teacher talk without explicit solicitations then, the current study stretches our existing appreciations for the myriad linkages between mentor conduct and teacher talk. In particular, insofar as doing assessments or being directive are sometimes considered impediments to true reflection (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0033688212473296">Brandt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0033688212473296">Copeland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0033688212473296">Fanselow, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0033688212473296">Keogh, 2010</xref>), there are perhaps grounds for a reappraisal in light of the new evidence, especially since advice and assessment seem to have persisted to exist as integral components of mentor talk.</p>
<p>More importantly perhaps, methodologically, a full-blown conversation analytic endeavor that prioritizes sequential details based on video data has yielded crucial insights into the rich dynamics as experienced by the participants, not just observed by the analysts, from one micro-second to the next in the unfolding interaction. It is in such details as an inbreath, a gaze shift, a facial expression, a specific prosodic packaging or the precise positioning of a turn onset that we become privy to the extent of a teacher’s engagement or readiness to reflect. It is also in such details that we begin to detect which part of the teacher talk the mentor is aligning with and to what extent. It is through scrutiny of such details that we manage, for example, to go beneath the surface of ‘positive assessment’ to the exact nature of such assessment that the teacher orients to as an opportunity for reflection.</p>
<p>For the practicing mentor, the lessons to be learned are by no means direct ones. To suggest that mentors engage in advice and assessment as a surreptitious way of obtaining teacher reflection would be ludicrous. It would, however, be prudent to develop a more realistic appreciation for practices such as advice and assessment in mentor talk. Understanding the reflection-potentials afforded by advice and assessment can push mentors to become more vigilant in these particular sequential environments, and by extension, better equipped for nurturing the possibilities of reflection, e.g. giving teachers the space to explain problems and devise solutions rather than accomplishing these tasks single-handedly. Finally, although this is not a study on how to do reflection, the range of richly detailed teacher turns that strive for and succeed in having their voices heard offer realistic exemplars of how and when precisely in the conversations teacher perspectives can be shared. In other words, these exemplars can serve as an empirical starting point for helping teachers overcome the difficulty of not knowing how to do reflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0033688212473296">Copland, 2010</xref>).</p>

<ack>
<p>This project would not have been possible without the generosity of the faculty and students in the graduate TESOL program, who allowed my cameras into a very important and intimate space of their professional lives. I would also like to thank Di Yu, Gahye Song, Carol Lo, and Nadja Tardic for producing the initial transcripts of these meetings.</p>
