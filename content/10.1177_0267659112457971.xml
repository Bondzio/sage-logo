<title>Objectives:</title>
<p>Jehovah’s Witnesses present a challenge to cardiac surgeons, as quality of care is not only defined by mortality and morbidity, but also by the avoidance of blood transfusions. Over the last years, minimized perfusion circuits (MPC) have contributed substantially to the achievement of this goal in our clinic. Presented is a retrospective analysis of our experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0267659112457971">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Twenty-nine Jehovah’s Witnesses, aged 69 ± 10 years, have undergone cardiac surgery with a MPC in our institution since 2005. The ROCsafe (Reservoir Optional Circuit) MPC was used in most of these patients (n=27) as it offers the unique possibility of a speedy integration of a reservoir in the event of a major air leak, thereby, negligating any safety concerns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0267659112457971">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>There was no in-hospital or 30-day postoperative mortality. Mean ICU stay was 1.6 ± 2 days with a mean intubation time of 11.3 ± 9.1 hrs. Postoperative complications included one myocardial infarction with accompanying low cardiac output, one stroke, one transient delirium, one idiopathic thrombocytopenia and three re-operations (one sternal infection, one postoperative bleeding and one delayed tamponade). The mean postoperative hospital stay was 9.9 ± 2.3 days. Mean decrease in hemoglobin was 2.1 ± 1.3 g/dl during cardiopulmonary bypass and 3.4 ±1.4 g/dl at discharge. The lowest postoperative hemoglobin level was 9.3 ±1.8 (Range 6-12.9).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Jehovah’s Witnesses confront the cardiac surgeon with both the need for and the possibility of transfusion-free surgery. Our experience with Jehovah’s Witnesses reflects how efficient we could be in reducing transfusion requirements if it became one of our utmost goals. Considering the abundance of evidence in the literature not only to the dire consequences of the lowest hematocrit during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112457971">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112457971"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659112457971">3</xref></sup> but also to the adverse short - and long-term consequences of blood transfusion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112457971">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112457971"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112457971"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112457971"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112457971"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659112457971">9</xref></sup> achieving this goal would be expected to have a positive impact on the quality of patient care.</p>
<p>One of the most evident and striking advantages of minimized perfusion circuits (MPC) has been their contribution towards reducing transfusion requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659112457971">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112457971"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659112457971">12</xref></sup> It, therefore, appears reasonable to assume that Jehovah’s Witnesses would benefit from their use. It was this supposition, in addition to vast experience with MPC, that has made the ROCsafe MPC the standard perfusion circuit for Jehovah’s Witnesses in our clinic. This is a retrospective analysis of our experience.</p>

<title>Patients and methods</title>
<p>From August 2005 until November 2010, 29 Jehovah’s Witnesses (aged 69 ± 10 years; 10 females) have undergone cardiac surgery using a MPC in our institution. Following approval of the ethics committee and the patients’ consent, their data were retrospectively analyzed.</p>
<p>Ten Jehovah’s Witnesses were operated urgently while the remainder were elective patients. Eight different surgeons were involved; however, 65% of the operations were performed by 3 of them. On the other hand, 6 different perfusionists were involved, with a nearly equal distribution among the participants. The ROCsafe (Reservoir Optional Circuit) MPC (Terumo Cardiovascular Systems, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) was used in most of these patients (n=27), while the ECCO (extra corporeal circulation optimized) MPC (Soring Group Italia, Mirandola, Italy) was used in two of the earlier cases.

<title>Management strategy</title>
<p>All elective patients were advised, through their referring physician, to raise their preoperative hemoglobin levels to about 13 - 14 g/dl by means of s.c. injections of erythropoietin.</p>
<p>Surgery was performed through a median sternotomy. After heparinization with a target activated clotting time (ACT) of 480 sec. (measured at initial dose and every 20 minutes thereafter), cardiopulmonary bypass was established with an arterial cannula in the ascending aorta, and a two-stage venous cannula introduced through the right atrium or double caval cannulation in cases of mitral valve procedures. To minimize the risk of air aspiration, the venous cannula was secured by a ligature around the right atrial auricle in addition to a conventional snare. Retrograde autologous priming was employed by retrograde washout of the priming volume following arterial cannulation, thereby, reducing the priming volume by about 500 ml.</p>
<p>Nasopharyngeal temperature was maintained at 35°C to 37°C during CPB. Myocardial protection was achieved by low volume intermittent warm blood cardioplegia that was repeated every 20 minutes except in mitral valve procedures where cold crystalloid cardioplegia (Bretschneider) was used. In those cases, the cardioplegia was drained via the right atrium to avoid haemodilution.</p>
<p>Meticulous haemostasis accompanied every step of the procedure. Following venous de-cannulation at the end of surgery, the blood in the circuit was almost completely re-transfused through an antegrade washout by replacing it with a colloid solution. Most patients received desmopressin (0.4 µg /kg) following weaning from the perfusion circuit and heparin reversal. Until 2006, all patients received aprotinin 6 million KIU intra-operatively; thereafter, 6 g of tranexamic acid were given (2 g at the beginning of the operation, 2 g after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass and 2 g on arrival to the intensive care unit).</p>
<p>Postoperatively, the positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) was elevated to 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O if the intrinsic PEEP permitted such an elevation. Early revision was considered in cases of moderate postoperative bleeding (exceeding 300 ml in the first 2-3 postoperative hours). If the hemoglobin level fell below 10 g/dl postoperatively, iron was supplemented and, if below 7 g/dl, patients received 10,000 IU of erythropoetin s.c. every second day.</p>

</fig>
<p>This is a minimized closed-loop circuit, incorporating a Sarns<sup>TM</sup> centrifugal pump (Terumo Cardiovascular Systems, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), a hollow-fiber oxygenator (Terumo RX 15, Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and a 40 µm arterial blood filter (AL8X, Pall, East Hills, NY, USA) in the arterial line. Integrated in this system is a venous de-airing unit, consisting of an ultrasound-controlled bubble detector (ABD, component of System 1, Terumo Cardiovascular Systems), a 150 cc/170 µm Bubble trap (BT15X, Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and an electronic venous line occluder (EVO, Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).</p>
<p>When air is detected by the ABD, an automatic command is given to the centrifugal pump to reduce its speed to 1500 rpm (coast mode), thereby, creating neither forward nor reverse flow. The EVO automatically closes the venous line in response to the speed reduction of the centrifugal pump. This allows for controlled manual de-airing of the bubble trap using a standard vacuum suction device (-200 mmHg); this is accomplished in a matter of a few seconds.</p>
<p>The modular concept of the circuit permits the rapid integration of a pre-connected hard-shell reservoir (Accessory Pack B) in case of a major air leak. This is facilitated by quick connectors that are an integral part of the system. Likewise, a pericardiotomy suction can be integrated in cases of major blood loss. Pericardial blood is routinely aspirated into a cell saving device. In most cases, it was continuously washed, centrifuged and re-transfused during the operation. Venting was performed via the aortic root (in addition to the pulmonary vein in cases of valve surgery) directly to the venous line or into a coated flexible reservoir that included a 105 µm filter screen (Accessory Pack A) in case of valve surgery.</p>
<p>All of the components in the system are coated with a biocompatible proprietary coating (X-coating, Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The circuit was primed with 600 ml crystalloid solution that was further reduced to 100-200 ml by retrograde autologous priming following aortic cannulation, as previously mentioned.</p>

<p>Patient demographics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267659112457971">Table 1</xref>. There was no in-hospital or 30-day postoperative mortality. No device-related complications were encountered and neither of the accessory packs had to be incorporated during any of the procedures. The different operative procedures are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0267659112457971">Figure 2</xref>. The mean CPB time was 92 ± 21 min, mean aortic clamping time was 64 ± 28 min, and the mean duration of surgery was 188 ± 50 min. Following de-clamping, 25 patients spontaneously resumed sinus rhythm while 4 patients had to be defibrillated. The mean hemoglobin level before CPB was 12.1 ± 1.3 g/dl and at end of the operation 10.1 ± 1.5 g/dl, with a mean decrease of 1.2 ± 0.7 g/dl.</p>

<p>On arrival in the ICU, eight (28%) patients were free of catecholamines while 16 (55%) were in need of inotropic support, mostly low-dose dobutamine, and seven (24%) were in need of low-dose noradrenaline. Mean ICU stay was 1.6 ± 2 days, with a mean intubation time of 11.3 ± 9.1 hrs.</p>
<p>Postoperatively, one patient had a myocardial infarction with low cardiac output. One patient sustained an embolic stroke with multiple bilateral lesions on cranial magnetic resonance imaging; following extubation, he presented with bilateral arm paresis that resolved almost completely before discharge. One patient had a transient delirium, seven patients had atrial fibrillation, one patient developed an idiopathic thrombocytopenia – thrombocyte count dropping to 20,000/ µl - that resolved spontaneously. Three patients needed a re-operation, one due to a sternal infection, one due to postoperative bleeding and one because of a delayed tamponade. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 9.9 ± 2.3 days.</p>
<p>The mean decrease in hemoglobin level was 3.4 ± 1.4 g/dl at discharge. The lowest postoperative hemoglobin value was 9.3 ± 1.8 (range 6.0 – 12.9). The course of the hemoglobin level during the hospital stay is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0267659112457971">Figure 3</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Concerns regarding the safety of MPCs are mainly attributed to their capacity for air handling in cases of major air leaks, as has been reported by Nollert et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659112457971">13</xref></sup> following an accidental perforation of the right ventricle during preparation of an intramural LAD. The possibility of a rapid integration of a reservoir into the ROCsafeRX system has, in our opinion, reduced these concerns to a negligible level.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the benefit of MPCs regarding the reduction of transfusion requirements has been repeatedly shown in large prospective randomized trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659112457971">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112457971"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659112457971">12</xref></sup> In addition, the lowest hematocrit during CPB has been shown to have its negative impact on patient morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112457971">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112457971"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659112457971">3</xref></sup> Habib et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112457971">2</xref></sup> described a significant increase in the incidence of stroke, myocardial infarction, sepsis and multi-organ failure in 5000 consecutive cardiac patients as the lowest hematocrit decreased below 22% on CPB. In the same study, the authors also reported that the lowest hematocrit on bypass was an independent predictor of operative mortality, prolonged ICU (&gt; 2 days), prolonged postoperative hospital stay (&gt; 8 days) and a worse 0 to 6 year survival in a subgroup of 3800 CABG patients.</p>
<p>Hence, the use of these MPCs in the treatment of Jehovah’s Witnesses appears both plausible and advantageous. This conforms with the recently updated Society of Thoracic Surgeons and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists guidelines on blood conservation which have extended their recommendation for the use of MPCs from Class II b, “It is not unreasonable to use low prime and minimized extracorporeal bypass circuits to reduce the fall in hematocrit during CPB as part of a multimodality blood conservation program”,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267659112457971">14</xref></sup> to Class I a, “Minicircuits (reduced priming volume in the minimized CPB circuit) reduce hemodilution and are indicated for blood conservation, especially in patients at high risk for adverse effects of hemodilution (e.g. pediatric patients and Jehovah’s Witness patients)”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659112457971">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1977, Ott et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659112457971">16</xref></sup> reported on a mortality rate of 10.7% in 362 Jehovah’s Witnesses who underwent cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass in their institution. As blood conservation strategies have improved over the last decades, most recent publications have shown a substantial improvement in postoperative mortality rates, ranging from 0%-6%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267659112457971">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267659112457971"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267659112457971"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267659112457971"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267659112457971">21</xref></sup> However, experience with MPCs in this patient group is limited, the pre-mentioned updated guidelines on blood conservation cite only two case reports involving Jehovah’s Witnesses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267659112457971">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267659112457971">23</xref></sup> To our knowledge, the only series published in this context was a comparative study by Vaislic et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0267659112457971">24</xref></sup> comparing the results of 40 Jehovah’s Witnesses to those of a comparative group of non-Jehovah’s Witnesses; however, this series involved only low-risk isolated CABG patients and the means by which the patients in the control group were selected was not mentioned. There is also no mentioning of the surgeons involved in both groups nor the type of cardioplegia used in the control group.</p>
<p>The predicted transfusion requirement, according to the TRUST score,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267659112457971">25</xref></sup> would have been 50 ± 26% for our patient population (a score of 2.5 ± 1.3; mean ± standard deviation). Taking this into consideration, our results demonstrate what could realistically be achieved in terms of reducing transfusion requirements in daily practice, as only 3 of our patients experienced a drop of their hemoglobin value to less than 8 g/dl throughout their hospital stay, the institutional transfusion trigger in most of our cardiac patients (a theoretical transfusion incidence of 10%).</p>
<p>Worth mentioning is that 1 of the 3 patients bled postoperatively and required a re-exploration, 1 was discharged with a hemoglobin of 10 g/dl and later re-admitted because of a sternal wound infection. He developed an infection-associated anemia in the further course. The third patient had been referred from an external hospital that turned down a cardiac catheter in spite of an acute myocardial infarction as the patient refused to receive a blood transfusion in case of a bleeding complication. The patient was referred for cardiac catheterization after receiving a loading dose of aspirin and clopidogrel; the cardiac catheter examination revealed a significant stenosis of the left main coronary artery. Due to persistent angina, she was operated on 24 hrs. later despite a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dl and thrombocytes of 100,000/µl. The lowest hemoglobin level any of these patients reached was 6.0 g/dl, and none of them experienced any further complications.</p>
<p>Comparing the results of these patients to daily routine may be questionable because of the recommendation to elevate preoperative hemoglobin levels to 13 - 14 g/dl. However, 10 patients were operated on urgently and so did not receive any erythropoetin, while only 4 of the elective patients complied, but received erythropoietin for only 1 week prior to surgery.</p>
<p>Evidence in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0267659112457971">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267659112457971"/>-28</sup> suggests negative effects of raising hemoglobin levels with the use of erythropoietin in patients with chronic renal failure. These effects are mainly related to cardiovascular events and hypertension. Up till now we have seen none of these effects. However, this may be related to the short time period of its administration and the fact that this is being done under close medical observation.</p>
<p>The results of a patient collective with which we have recently contributed to a prospective randomized multi-center comparative study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659112457971">12</xref></sup> (MPC vs. conventional perfusion circuits) on elective low-risk first-time CABG and / or AVR patients show that preoperative hemoglobin levels were similar and the transfusion incidence (14%) among the MPC group was comparable (unpublished data).</p>
<p>The importance of minimizing blood transfusions in daily practice is evidenced by their persistently reported drawbacks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112457971">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112457971"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112457971"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112457971"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112457971"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659112457971">9</xref></sup> Chelemer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112457971">5</xref></sup> reported that RBC transfusions were independently associated with a higher incidence of postoperative bacterial infections in 533 CABG patients. Furthermore, they showed that the risk of infection increased in proportion to the number of units of RBC transfused as the adjusted rates were 4.8% for non-RBC transfused and 15.2% with one to two units, 22.1% with three to five units and 29% with greater than or equal to six units. Diabetes was the only patient or disease factor associated with the incidence of bacterial infection. This conforms with the report from Leal-Noval et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659112457971">9</xref></sup> which showed that the administration of blood derivatives, mainly RBCs, was associated in a dose- dependent manner with the development of serious postoperative infection primarily nosocomial pneumonia among 738 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Vamvakas et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112457971">4</xref></sup> demonstrated that the volume of administered RBC supernatant was associated with the likelihood of postoperative ventilation past the day of operation in 416 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.</p>
<p>Koch et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112457971">6</xref></sup>found that, among approximately 12,000 isolated CABG patients, peri-operative RBC transfusion was the single factor most reliably associated with increased risk of postoperative morbid events, including mortality, renal failure, prolonged ventilation, serious infection, cardiac complications, and neurological events. Each unit of red cells transfused was associated with increased risk for adverse outcome.</p>
<p>Engoren et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112457971">7</xref></sup> comparing the effect of blood transfusions on long-term survival after cardiac surgery found that transfused patients had twice the 5-year mortality of non-transfused patients (15 vs. 7%). Even after correction for comorbidities and other factors, transfusion was still associated with a 70% increase in mortality (risk ratio = 1.7). Furthermore, on multivariate analysis, blood transfusion proved to be an independent predictor of long-term survival.</p>
<p>An additional argument for the use of MPCs in Jehovah’s Witnesses is the reported benefit of improved platelet preservation in comparison to conventional heart-lung machines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659112457971">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112457971"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659112457971">12</xref></sup> Keeping in mind that the likelihood for surgery under anti-platelet therapy in modern times is increasing (drug-eluting stents, more frequent urgent operations, etc.) and that there is no real alternative to platelet transfusion to compensate for low platelet numbers function, this argument appears reasonable.</p>
<p>The limited hemodilution on CPB, low incidence of postoperative anaemia and the lack of transfusions may explain the low incidence of perioperative infections (3.4% as one patient had a sternal infection) in spite of a high prevalence of diabetes mellitus (31%) among our patients. Likewise, these factors may explain the absence of postoperative renal complications despite the fact that 5 patients (17%) had a positive history of renal insufficiency.</p>
<p>Putting the drawbacks of transfusions and the possibility of transfusion-free cardiac surgery in face of modern perfusion strategies into perspective, one is inclined to extend the recommendations for the use of minimized perfusion circuits even further.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0267659112457971">
<title>Limitation</title>
<p>Although proof of a better outcome in comparison with standard perfusion circuits is obviously lacking, such a proof would only be conclusive if the patients were to be prospectively randomized. On the other hand, the reduced transfusion requirements with the use of MPC in cardiac surgery has been sufficiently documented and a prospective randomized trial in this specific patient group appears ethically questionable.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The ROCsafeRx MPC can be recommended for the treatment of Jehovah’s Witnesses. The role which MPC can play in daily practice for the reduction of transfusion requirements is significant, the impact of this reduction on the long-term outcome of patients is expected to be of importance, but has yet to be proven. Finally, we hope that our results can serve as a stimulus for other similar experiences.</p>
