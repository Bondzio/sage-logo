<abstract>
<p>Prior research often categorizes corporate environmental responses on a spectrum that ranges from reactive to proactive. Such research subordinates the role of time, yet time is central to organizational responses to environmental issues such as climate change. In this paper, we study five oil and gas firms and inductively develop a framework of corporate responses to climate change that explicitly acknowledges the role of time. The framework identifies two categories of corporate responses grounded in different temporal perspectives: focused and integrated. We discuss the implications of this categorization for research on corporate environmentalism and time in organizational theory.</p>

<p>Time is central to climate change. Experts suggest that while the worst effects of climate change may be more than 50 years away, there is an urgent need for society, including corporations, to act now to avoid potentially devastating long-term effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0170840612463319">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007</xref>). Climate change, therefore, requires a multi-faceted view of time, which is particularly challenging for corporations, given the unrelenting pressurs they face to focus on the short term. In fact, some researchers have argued that the long lag times between climate actions and effects have hampered organizational action on climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0170840612463319">Keith, 2009</xref>). Consequently, investigating the role of ‘time’ is important to understanding corporate responses to climate change.</p>
<p>Time has played only a supporting role in prior corporate environmental research. Responses to social and environmental issues have typically been categorized along a continuum from reactive to proactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0170840612463319">Buysse &amp; Verbeke, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840612463319">Henriques &amp; Sadorsky, 1999</xref>). Reactive firms are myopic because they resist acting on social and environmental issues despite the potentially negative consequences of inaction, while proactive firms are farsighted, anticipating future needs and regulations. Such a continuum, however, has two important limitations. First, it imposes a rather simplistic view of time, where firms lie somewhere along a single continuum from a short-term to a long-term orientation. Yet effectively responding to climate change requires firms to balance urgency with long-term impacts. Second, the continuum evokes a hierarchical ranking of corporate environmental responses, ranging from ‘do nothing’ to ‘do much’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0170840612463319">Carroll, 1979</xref>). However, a more nuanced view of time does not lend itself to such a hierarchy, as short-term, seemingly less effective responses may in some cases be preferred to slower long-term responses.</p>
<p>The growing body of research on organizational time offers some relief through a more nuanced view of time. Researchers have pointed to different perspectives of time within organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840612463319">Bluedorn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840612463319">George &amp; Jones, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840612463319">Mosakowski &amp; Earley, 2000</xref>). For example, firms may emphasize clock time or event time: clock time is measurable and linear; event time tends to repeat and be cyclical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840612463319">Ancona, Okhuysen, &amp; Perlow, 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840612463319">Bluedorn &amp; Denhardt, 1988</xref>). This body of work focuses on understanding time in organizations, but offers little insight into the impact of these time perspectives on organizational responses to environmental issues generally, much less regarding responses to issues with long time scales, such as climate change.</p>
<p>In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by examining <italic>how an organization’s time perspective relates to its response to climate change.</italic> To explore this relationship, we studied five oil and gas companies with operations in the Alberta oil sands, using qualitative data to induce new theory. Nowhere has the pressure to respond to climate change been more acute than in Alberta’s oil sands, one of the most significant contributors to Canada’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Extracting and refining oil from the oil sands is energy-intensive; in 2010, the oil sands accounted for 6.5 percent of Canada’s GHG emissions, which is expected to nearly double by 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840612463319">Canada, Department of Natural Resources, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840612463319">Canada, Ministry of the Environment, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>We found that, based on their responses to climate change, firms clustered into two different categories related to different temporal perspectives. The first group, which we labeled ‘focused’, sought to innovate new technologies that could improve energy efficiency and competitiveness. These firms focused on internal operations, seeking innovative solutions, and viewed climate change as a competitive opportunity. They exhibited a <italic>linear time perspective</italic>, focusing on the present, seeking immediate technology-based solutions, and aiming to remove the uncertainty inherent in the long-term future. Consequently, these firms tended to execute on a narrow set of solutions, but could respond with agility or speed.</p>
<p>In contrast, the second group, which we labeled ‘integrated’, invested in a broad range of activities to mitigate climate change and collaborated extensively to identify cross-sector, broader-based solutions. These firms exhibited a <italic>cyclical time perspective</italic> by tending to make a greater number of connections between the past, present, and future. However, the sheer complexity of their response made it difficult for these firms to respond quickly.</p>
<p>Our research contributes to the corporate environmental and climate change literature by highlighting the importance of time perspectives in shaping organizational responses to complex, long-term issues such as climate change. We also contribute to research on time both by clarifying the linear and cyclical dimensions of time and by highlighting each dimension’s impact on firm responses to environmental issues. Finally, we offer insights into the tension between speed and breadth of responses in addressing climate change.</p>

<title>Organizational responses to climate change</title>
<p>Climate change research in organizational studies has drawn considerably on prior work that examines organizational responses to environmental issues. Much of this research on corporate environmentalism has built in some way on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0170840612463319">Carroll’s (1979)</xref> continuum of corporate social responsiveness, which comprises four levels: reactive, defensive, accommodating, and proactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0170840612463319">Branzei, Ursacki-Bryant, Vertinsky, &amp; Zhang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0170840612463319">Buysse &amp; Verbeke, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0170840612463319">Hart, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0170840612463319">Hart &amp; Milstein, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840612463319">Henriques &amp; Sadorsky, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0170840612463319">Orlitzky, Schmidt, &amp; Rynes, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0170840612463319">Sharma, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0170840612463319">Sharma, Pablo, &amp; Vredenburg, 1999</xref>). Reactive firms resist responding to social and environmental issues; defensive firms comply with regulations; accommodating firms go beyond compliance; and proactive firms take a leadership position.</p>
<p>Such mapping persists even in more recent work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840612463319">Basu and Palazzo (2008)</xref>, for example, explain firms’ responses to social and environmental issues by describing three postures: defensive, open, and tentative. Defensive firms resist feedback from others, insulating themselves from alternative sources of information. Firms with an open posture are willing to listen and learn from others, while sharing information and actively debating issues to achieve change. Finally, tentative firms act inconsistently, often because they are inexperienced with the issue.</p>
<p>This continuum finds considerable empirical support in corporate environmental research. For example, in their multi-industry cluster analysis of corporate environmental practices, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840612463319">Henriques and Sadorsky (1999)</xref> confirm that firms clustered into Carroll’s four categories. At one extreme, reactive firms lacked top management commitment toward environmental issues, did not engage in environmental reporting or employee training, and lacked formal environmental management. At the other extreme, proactive firms possessed top management commitment, while engaging in reporting, employee training, and formal environmental management. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0170840612463319">Buysse and Verbeke (2003)</xref> also find empirical support for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0170840612463319">Hart’s (1995)</xref> framework resting on the natural-resource-based view that end-of-pipe investments are reactive, while three interconnected strategies are proactive: pollution prevention, product stewardship, and sustainable development.</p>
<p>This continuum not only appears in research on corporate environmentalism but also emerges in research on climate change. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0170840612463319">Kolk and Pinkse (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840612463319">2005</xref>) describe two distinct responses to climate change that map onto the reactive/proactive continuum: compensation and innovation. Firms that respond using a compensation strategy focus on external or internal emissions trading, while waiting for new innovations driven by other firms. In contrast, an innovation strategy emphasizes investments in carbon-mitigating technologies, processes, and products, all of which can proactively create new competencies in firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840612463319">Kolk &amp; Pinkse, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0170840612463319">Pinkse &amp; Kolk, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Time perspectives are often implicit in these typologies. For example, reactive firms are often portrayed as myopic, whereas proactive firms are described as farsighted. Proactive firms make major investments in product and technology innovations that have long payback periods, such as new power plants, and encourage behavioral changes that take time to embed, such as employee participation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840612463319">Aragon-Correa, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840612463319">Aragon-Correa &amp; Sharma, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0170840612463319">Hart, 1995</xref>). These firms also place greater importance on community and organizational stakeholders, recognizing that these relationships take time to develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840612463319">Henriques &amp; Sadorsky, 1999</xref>). Similarly, research on organizational responses to climate change implicitly suggests that these responses have different time frames. Firms can respond to climate change by compensating for carbon emissions through offsets, substituting carbon-based technologies with non carbon-based technologies, or reducing energy consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0170840612463319">Hoffman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0170840612463319">Levy &amp; Kolk, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0170840612463319">Okereke &amp; Russel, 2010</xref>). Such investments in climate change mitigation can be characterized as having different time horizons: some investments result in a short-term impact, while others represent a longer-term solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0170840612463319">Weinhofer &amp; Hoffmann, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This prior work, however, has not systematically assessed the role of time in shaping organizational responses. As a result, the way that time maps onto the reactive/proactive categories can be ambiguous. For example, substituting carbon-based technologies with renewable sources of energy is a proactive response accomplished either by purchasing renewable energy or by building the capacity to generate renewable energy internally. Purchasing renewable energy is quicker than building the infrastructure required to generate solar or wind power. Consequently, identifying categories of responses based on time perspectives can provide important insights into organizational responses to climate change.</p>

<title>Organizational time perspectives</title>
<p>Researchers have long argued that perceptions of time are important for understanding individual and collective behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840612463319">Mosakowski &amp; Earley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0170840612463319">Sorokin, 1943</xref>). Schein even asserts that ‘there is probably no more important category for cultural analysis than the study of how time is conceived and used in a group or organization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0170840612463319">Schein, 1992</xref>, p. 114).</p>
<p>Two perspectives on time have dominated the social sciences: clock time and event time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840612463319">Orlikowski &amp; Yates, 2002</xref>). The Greek word for clock time is <italic>chronos</italic>, which emphasizes measurement and linear succession. <italic>Clock time</italic> refers to a view of time that is discrete, linear, measurable, divisible, precise, deterministic, and subject to only one interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840612463319">Mosakowski &amp; Earley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840612463319">Orlikowski &amp; Yates, 2002</xref>). This view of time is consistent with an atomistic view of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0170840612463319">Jaques, 1982</xref>) and has dominated western culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840612463319">Bluedorn &amp; Denhardt, 1988</xref>). This ‘Newtonian’ view of time has contributed to scientific progress and ultimately helped spur the Industrial Revolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840612463319">Ancona et al., 2001b</xref>). As Jaques succinctly argues:
<disp-quote>
<p>The truth is that great successes were achieved when things were somehow made to stand still long enough to be counted and measured. The idea—the abstraction, the fiction—of the absolute constancy of physical things became the necessary foundation of the development of scientific and mathematical abstractions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0170840612463319">Jaques, 1982</xref>, p. 8)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In <italic>event time</italic>, different episodes acquire meaning through time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840612463319">Mosakowski &amp; Earley, 2000</xref>). The Greek word for event time is <italic>kairos</italic>, which refers to the duration of an event, with a beginning, middle, and end; thereby, connecting events through time. Event time reflects the human time of intentions and goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0170840612463319">Jaques, 1982</xref>). It is subjective, open, organic, and cyclical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840612463319">Ancona et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840612463319">Orlikowski &amp; Yates, 2002</xref>). Butler describes event time in the following way: ‘Events, as with the seasons and weather, will not occur in a completely haphazard way but there will be an irregularity, novelty and multiplicity of events reinforcing the non-linearity of the time scale’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840612463319">Butler, 1995</xref>, p. 934). Event time, which is similar to polychronic time, does not follow the clock but instead emphasizes what has been accomplished and places greater emphasis on relationships than on short-term efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0170840612463319">Schein, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>In much of the time literature, linear and cyclical time feature as dimensions of the broader categories of clock and event time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840612463319">Bluedorn &amp; Denhardt, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840612463319">Crossan, Cunha, Vera, &amp; Cunha, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840612463319">George &amp; Jones, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0170840612463319">McGrath &amp; Rotchford, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840612463319">Mosakowski &amp; Earley, 2000</xref>). Linear time refers to time progressing forward from past to present to future, such that events do not repeat themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840612463319">Mosakowski &amp; Earley, 2000</xref>). Given that time disappears quickly, it is perceived as being scarce. As Schein notes, ‘time is viewed as a valuable commodity that can be spent, wasted, killed, or made good use of’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0170840612463319">1992</xref>, p. 107). In contrast, with cyclical time, events are seen to repeat themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840612463319">Mosakowski &amp; Earley, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Scholars have linked different perceptions of time to a number of organizational outcomes and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840612463319">Ancona et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840612463319">Bluedorn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840612463319">Mosakowski &amp; Earley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0170840612463319">Vinton, 1992</xref>). We have two issues, however, with this prior body of work. First, these time perspectives remain mainly conceptual, making it difficult to advance research on time in organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840612463319">Ancona, Goodman, Lawrence, &amp; Tushman, 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840612463319">Crossan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840612463319">Mitchell &amp; James, 2001</xref>). Second, these time perspectives have not been applied to issues that manifest over long time scales. This omission is surprising given that several researchers have hinted at a possible relationship between the time perspectives of individuals and organizations, and social/environmental issues, which require a more complex and long-term view of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840612463319">Bluedorn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0170840612463319">Elkington, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840612463319">Zimbardo &amp; Boyd, 2008</xref>). Given the importance of the role of time in climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0170840612463319">Weinhofer &amp; Hoffmann, 2010</xref>), we believe that this prior work on organizational time perspectives can reveal important new insights into organizational responses to climate change. In this study, we aim to remedy some of these oversights by using the organizational time literature as a backdrop to explore the relationship between organizational time perspectives and responses to climate change.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>To ground our theoretical insights, we investigated five corporations in the Alberta oil sands, applying an inductive case study methodology to address the research question. We chose this research design because of the conceptual gap between organizational time perspectives and firm responses to climate change. We sought to extend existing theory on corporate environmentalism and organizational time. Such theory elaboration is appropriate when previous research provides a starting point for a new inductive study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0170840612463319">Lee, Mitchell, &amp; Sablynski, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0170840612463319">Maitlis, 2005</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section5-0170840612463319">
<title>Research context</title>
<p>We chose Alberta’s oil sands as the research context for this topic for several reasons. First, climate change has been a central issue in the production of the Alberta oil sands’ heavy oil, which is more carbon-intensive than conventional oil. At the same time, firm responses to climate change vary significantly because of the uncertainty, both in public opinion and in government policy and regulation. Since 2007, the Province of Alberta has priced carbon at $15 per tonne for facilities that emit more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year and are unable to meet intensity reduction targets of 12 percent. Although these regulations were not considered stringent at the time of the study, they were expected to become more stringent, but it was unclear by how much or within what time frame. Similarly, Canada’s federal government had indicated its plans to introduce climate change legislation, but uncertainty surrounded the timing and nature of this legislation. What was known was that the federal government had committed to reducing Canada’s GHG emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. Again, how these reductions would be achieved remained unclear.</p>
<p>We focused our research on a single industry to constrain the range of responses. All oil sands firms are subject to the same regulatory environment, pressure from environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs), and media attention. In recent years, the oil sands industry has come under significant public scrutiny, largely because of the high energy use required to produce this type of oil. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, clay, water, and bitumen, a heavy and extremely viscous oil. Not only does the oil need to be extracted from the ground but it must be further processed before being refined. Given the carbon-intensive process used to refine bitumen, critics have labeled it ‘dirty oil’. At the time this article was written, the European Union (EU) was seriously considering boycotting oil extracted from the oil sands and the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which would link Alberta oil to US refineries, was facing significant opposition in the United States. Finally, Canada’s First Nations communities had become more vocal in questioning the impacts of the oil sands both on their health and on the natural environment.</p>
<p>Further, extracting bitumen from the oil sands is capital-intensive: developing the reserves requires long-term investments, sometimes as long as 50 years, in sharp contrast to the wildcat wells commonly associated with conventional oil. Therefore, our focus on a single industry and geography helped to restrict the variance in climate change responses, thereby enabling us to better isolate the relationship between these responses and firm-level differences, such as time perspectives.</p>

<sec id="section6-0170840612463319">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Our sample was composed of five publicly traded oil and gas companies with subsidiary or corporate head offices in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. We aimed to sample firms that had a range of climate change responses. To do so, we consulted Jantzi Research &amp; Associates’ Canadian Social Investment Database (CSID), which evaluates firms’ environmental, social, and governance dimensions. We also used media accounts and annual reports and consulted with industry experts and consultants to ensure these firms varied in their climate change responses. From an initial population of fewer than 20 large companies operating in Alberta’s oil sands, we identified nine that exhibited a breadth of responses to the climate change issue.</p>
<p>For each of the nine firms, we conducted pilot interviews with key informants responsible for overseeing their firm’s climate change response. After these initial interviews, we removed one firm from further consideration because it had ceased its oil sands operations. We invited the remaining eight firms to participate in this study, of which five agreed.</p>
<p>We assigned the following pseudonyms to the five firms to protect their identities: Techno, Project, Engaged, Vision, and Alternative. These five firms ranged in size from approximately 2,000 to 8,000 employees in Canada. Their scope of operations ranged from being entirely upstream (exploration and extraction) to encompassing both upstream and downstream (refining and retail) activities. Finally, their head offices were located in either Canada, the United States, or Europe. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0170840612463319">Table 1</xref> for each company’s demographic profile.</p>

<p>As we will discuss later, we identified two clusters of corporate responses. Techno and Project fell into one cluster, Vision and Alternative fell into the other, and Engaged appeared to lie in the middle. Although we had not planned on a matched pair design, Techno and Vision were matched across most dimensions, as were Project and Alternative, which strengthened the validity of our findings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0170840612463319">
<title>Data sources</title>
<p>To build reliability in the responses, we drew from multiple sources: in-depth interviews, archival data/secondary sources, and observations. The data were collected in three phases. During the first phase (July–October 2008), we examined archival materials and secondary sources. During the second phase (November 2008–September 2009), we conducted participant observations and semi-structured interviews. In the third phase (September 2009), we validated our findings through subsequent interviews with our key informants.</p>
<sec id="section8-0170840612463319">
<title>Interviews</title>
<p>We interviewed a total of 60 individuals; each interview lasted between 45 minutes and 2 hours, with an average length of 60 minutes. The first author conducted all of the interviews, and the second author participated in approximately one-third of the interviews. We entered the transcripts and the archival data into QSR NVivo, a software package that enables researchers to organize and analyze qualitative data.</p>
<p>In each firm, we interviewed an average of nine executives or managers across a range of departments (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0170840612463319">Table 2</xref>). We selected a range of informants from across each company to ensure that we accessed each firm’s time perspective and approach to climate change, rather than the views of individual employees. We interviewed a total of nine managers in the four firms who were eventually dropped from the study because they either did not meet our criteria or could not provide us wide access to their company. Nevertheless, we analyzed these data to gain further insights into the industry. In addition, we interviewed five consultants and industry experts for the purpose of gaining industry knowledge, selecting the cases, and validating our findings. Most interviews (54/60) were conducted at the interviewee’s site. The others (6/60) were conducted off-site or over the telephone. With the consent of the interviewee, the interviews were audio-recorded and fully transcribed. The interview questions were open-ended and semi-structured to allow us to probe deeply for rich theoretical insights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0170840612463319">Yin, 1994</xref>). We asked interlocutors about their firm’s responses to climate change and about various aspects of their company that would reveal its perception of time.</p>

<p>As a final step in our data collection process, we asked a selection of interviewees from each of the five participating firms to ascertain whether our assessment of their firm was accurate. Their feedback served to validate the findings. To further establish validity, we also reviewed our findings with two industry experts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0170840612463319">
<title>Archival documents/secondary sources</title>
<p>We used archival documents, including annual reports, sustainability reports, Carbon Disclosure Project reports, internal and external communications documents, and independent media coverage, to understand each company’s response to climate change. These data also helped us to probe the company’s actions and time perspectives in the interviews and to augment and validate the comments. In addition, to develop a deeper understanding of the research context, we examined several monographs pertaining to the Alberta oil sands and the climate change issue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0170840612463319">
<title>Observations</title>
<p>The first author observed two workshops in Alberta to better understand the context and phenomena: one workshop, held in November 2008, was on climate change adaptation; the other, in September 2009, was on climate change mitigation technology. Representatives from industry, government, and academia attended the workshops. Each of the companies in our sample attended at least one workshop, with the exception of Techno. Direct observations have the advantage of allowing researchers to observe participants in situ with their peers, which can result in conversational comments that differ from comments made to the research team during an interview. The first author took detailed notes at each workshop. We found the observations to be consistent with the interview data.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0170840612463319">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>We analyzed the data between waves of data collection and again, in their entirety, after all the data were collected. In this way, we were able to sharpen the questions after each round of interviews to drive at the more central aspects of the study. The data were collected over a one-year period from late 2008 to late 2009. The interview transcripts and electronic archival documents were entered into QSR NVivo and analyzed between waves of interviews over the one-year period. We then reanalyzed the data over a subsequent four-month period. We followed three stages in the data analysis: a within-case analysis, a cross-case analysis, and a theory-building stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0170840612463319">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>In the first stage, both authors read through the data separately and identified key emerging themes for the two firms that were most divergent in their response to climate change. Based on these two companies, we identified a set of codes pertaining to: (1) responses to climate change; and (2) organizational time. Applying axial coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0170840612463319">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990</xref>), we identified a set of codes that were developed more fully as we analyzed each additional interview and company.</p>
<p>Although we started with a list of codes based on existing literature, we allowed new concepts to emerge from the data. Three major categories of codes emerged: (1) climate change responses; (2) collaboration with government, ENGOs, and industry; and (3) time perspectives. We identified climate change responses and time perspectives that were shared among respondents to ensure that we captured firm-level insights. We summarized the first-order codes for each interviewee and then for each firm to build within-case reliability. Using these summary sheets, we then searched among the first-order codes for relationships within each firm so we could begin to identify second-order codes.</p>
<p>In the second stage, both authors developed theory through cross-case comparisons using techniques proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840612463319">Eisenhardt (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0170840612463319">Miles and Huberman (1994)</xref>. We compared the concepts and relationships among all the firms, and two separate approaches to climate change emerged. We also began to find differences in time perspectives among the two groups of firms. We consulted existing literature that described organizational time and climate change postures. Through extensive discussions, both authors debated the emerging categories and relationships and discussed any discrepancies until an agreement was reached.</p>
<p>In the third stage, we iterated between data and theory and realized that the firms seemed to split into two clusters that reflected differences in both their climate change responses and their time perspectives. The fifth firm exhibited some elements of each cluster, which seemed to suggest that either the firm was in transition (it had recently experienced a change in CEO) or the clusters were two ends of a continuum and the fifth firm was in between. Although insights were drawn from all of the data, the relationships proposed here are drawn primarily from the two clusters of firms.</p>

<sec id="section12-0170840612463319">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>In this section, we describe the two patterns of responses to climate change that we found among the five companies in our sample. We defined climate change responses as the actions that companies took in response to climate change. They include actions that would either reduce their carbon footprint or encourage others to reduce their carbon footprint. The list of responses by firm is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0170840612463319">Table 3</xref>. We then use our data to show how these different climate change responses were related to distinct time perspectives, which are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0170840612463319">Table 4</xref>.</p>

<p>By analyzing Climate Disclosure Project (CDP) reports, company documents, and interview transcriptions, we found two overarching patterns in the ways oil sands operators responded to the climate change issue. We label these two patterns ‘focused’ and ‘integrated’. Techno and Project exhibited a focused approach, by attempting to mitigate their GHG emissions through technologies that improved energy efficiency. These two focused firms used current and looming regulations as important guideposts. They also worked independently on solutions to the climate change problem for the purpose of securing a competitive advantage through their resources and capabilities. We also found that the temporal perspective of these firms emphasized a disconnected view of time, in which the distant past and distant future were not considered in decision-making relating to climate change. This disconnected perspective on time was related to each firm’s low tolerance for uncertainty because such a lack of certainty could lead to certain decisions being delayed.</p>
<p>In contrast, Vision and Alternative took an integrated approach, pursuing a broad set of initiatives, including emissions management, investment in renewable energy, and public education on climate change. Despite the uncertainties regarding future regulations, these firms took actions, such as setting emission-reduction targets. By looking outside the firm for solutions, the integrated firms sought to build capabilities through external engagement. Unlike focused firms, whose approach to time was disconnected, integrated firms connected the past and future to the present and exhibited a higher tolerance for uncertainty in their responses to climate change. We show each of these responses and their associated temporal perspectives in more depth below.</p>
<p>The fifth firm, Engaged, did not exhibit a clear pattern of responses to climate change and seemed to lie, on the spectrum of responses, somewhere between the focused and integrated categories. Consequently, we did not include Engaged in either category. We discuss this company’s response at the end of this section.</p>
<sec id="section13-0170840612463319">
<title>Focused firms’ responses to climate change</title>
<p>In responding to climate change, Techno took a narrow approach that focused on reducing GHG emissions to meet current or anticipated regulations. Because changes in regulations were forthcoming, Techno aimed not only to comply with today’s regulations but to also be prepared for the forthcoming regulations, including a higher price on carbon. Techno critically analyzed the risks and costs that would result from future regulations.</p>
<p>Techno’s favored approach to meeting regulations was through technological innovation, especially by improving energy efficiency, with the aim of reducing the amount of fossil fuel energy used to extract oil. The Vice President of Regulatory Affairs reported: ‘We’ve come to realize that a lot of the environmental issues… that come with the business we’re in can be solved by technology.’</p>
<p>Techno invested in technologies that could save the company money while also reducing its GHG emissions. In fact, several managers at Techno referred to the company as being an industry leader in innovative technologies that reduced energy consumption and emissions. For example, the company had significantly reduced the amount of energy and water required to produce the steam used in extracting oil from the oil sands. Techno had, therefore, developed strong internal capabilities in reducing its energy intensity.</p>
<p>Although the firm excelled at developing technology, it did not invest in renewable energies. Techno also did not set voluntary targets to curb emissions beyond the limits required by current regulations. Thus, Techno’s emissions reductions aligned with the Government of Alberta’s regulations. Several managers explained that, given the uncertain regulatory environment, going beyond compliance was considered too risky. However, because of Techno’s strong focus on building a competitive advantage through technology, its managers took pride in the significant strides the firm had taken in reducing its energy footprint. Techno had a fund available to all employees for developing technologies that improved operational efficiency. Specifically, the firm funded projects that showed promise for reducing GHG emissions while also cutting operating costs.</p>
<p>Finally, Techno managers indicated that the company preferred to respond to climate change independently rather than working collaboratively with governments, ENGOs, or other companies. Compared with the other firms in our sample, Techno was the firm least involved in peer group sustainability networks, roundtables, and multi-stakeholder groups. Several Techno managers told us that they found these groups to be generally unproductive and time-consuming. For example, the Vice President of Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) indicated that the outcomes from participating in these groups did not bear immediate or tangible outcomes. She noted: ‘So, I think the outside forums are important to inform, but I haven’t necessarily always felt that they result in a lot of action.’</p>
<p>Project’s climate change response shared many of the same features as Techno’s, including its focus on energy-efficiency technologies. A senior manager in Project’s HSE group called technology ‘the key to unlocking a solution’. Project’s climate change strategy was directed at investments in energy efficiency. Although in recent years the company had begun to look into additional initiatives, such as investments in renewable energy research, Project had not committed to developing renewable energy projects as stand-alone projects. Its focus instead was on using renewable energy sources to decrease its reliance on fossil fuels as a feedstock in its oil sands production facilities. As several senior managers explained, the firm took a cautious approach, waiting for regulatory certainty before making significant investments.</p>
<p>Project chose to invest in initiatives that had the promise of immediate and tangible payoffs. The department responsible for climate change initiatives was pushing senior management to assume a leadership position in responding to climate change; however, the top management team did not want to make significant investments ahead of regulations. Instead, senior management focused on mitigating regulatory risk, thus preferring technologies and activities that would save costs through lower energy use. Another important part of Project’s climate change strategy was to purchase offsets to meet current and future regulations. The company planned to save costs by purchasing carbon credits that could be used later, when carbon prices increased. The current price of carbon credits in Alberta was $15 per tonne but oil sands participants expected the price to rise. Finally, like Techno, Project did not set voluntary targets to reduce its emissions.</p>
<p>A senior manager responsible for climate change at Project was pushing for greater company involvement in networks and in multi-stakeholder groups aimed at addressing social and environmental issues. However, his enthusiasm for such groups was not shared with members of the top management team. Project’s climate change group was pushing for a more comprehensive climate change strategy, but during the data collection period little company-wide progress had been made.</p>

<title>Focused firms’ temporal perspectives</title>
<p>In our data, we also found that the two focused firms appeared to share a similar temporal perspective. Focused firms had a lower tolerance for uncertainty, made very little reference to the past, and had short planning horizons.</p>
<sec id="section15-0170840612463319">
<title>Tolerance for future uncertainty</title>
<p>Managers at Techno and Project focused on the risks associated with climate change and the need to measure and quantify as much as possible to reduce the future uncertainty of regulations and carbon prices. In addition, both companies focused on the economic costs of climate change, incorporating different carbon prices into their long-range planning to determine how future regulations would affect the company. For example, when asked how climate change was taken into account in his firm’s long-range planning, Techno’s Vice President of Strategy explained that he and his team ‘do a lot of basic price scenarios’, using different price points for the per-tonne cost of carbon, anticipating that the price might increase over time if stricter regulations were imposed.</p>
<p>Similarly, the executives and managers at Project relied heavily on metrics. They used economic models to forecast future prices, which were, in turn, used to shape their decisions relating to climate change. Each initiative was ranked based on its return on investment. Several managers explained that these models helped to manage the uncertainty in the future regulatory environment. Managers at Project who worked on climate change issues struggled to convince their executives to make investments today for future emissions credits, in spite of the uncertain regulatory environment. A senior manager in the HSE group described the challenge in the following way: ‘So part of the issue is how do you convince decision-makers that these are the right investments, given the policy of regulatory uncertainty that exists?’ His group believed that the metrics would help to establish the economic value of climate change investments. These managers often mentioned the time value of money, referring, in the interviews, to such financial metrics as net present value and payback. They stated that if they could build the business case by showing tangible returns for climate change investments, then their senior management would agree to the investments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0170840612463319">
<title>Drawing from the past</title>
<p>Techno and Project interviewees rarely mentioned the past when discussing the climate change issue, focusing instead on the current state of the issue, especially the regulatory environment and its present uncertainty. When asked how long their company had been taking climate change into account in their decision-making, managers at both firms responded that it had been a few years (since the mid-2000s). Decisions about climate change seemed to be made independently of past considerations. Instead, managers were concerned with finding efficient and immediate solutions to the climate change issue. The senior manager responsible for climate change at Techno said, ‘We want to really create the mindset of efficiency both in the places where we work and [in] the people that we’ve got working for us.’ That senior manager’s counterpart at Project observed a similar focus in his company, explaining that ‘We’ve got a focus on efficiency.’</p>
<p>Techno and Project also emphasized the current aspects of the climate change issue that had a clear and present impact, such as the cost of carbon and the regulatory environment. In discussions with managers, climate change was considered within a narrow time frame. The regulatory uncertainty focused their attention on the present, dissuading them from making major investments with long payback periods. By emphasizing incremental investments with short payback periods, they were able to avoid the risks associated with new regulatory regimes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0170840612463319">
<title>Planning horizons</title>
<p>Compared with the integrated firms that looked as far out as 40 years when planning for climate change, focused firms did not have long planning horizons. Each firm had a five-year planning horizon, including planning for climate change. Neither Project nor Techno considered the long-term future when making climate change decisions. For example, when asked how far into the future the company thought about climate change, a senior manager in the HSE group at Techno responded: ‘Anything beyond 2020 is a bit of a stretch for a company… beyond [that] … it’s flat guessing, really.’ Linked to their discomfort with uncertainty was their preference for thinking about the short term—and, therefore, about more predictable and controllable events. At Project, the VP of Strategy captured the trepidation felt by many in the company: ‘[Project] is looking at all the near-term shuffle in terms of public policy and regulation and feeling that until it lands there’s not much of an imperative to get going on stuff because it’s better to know what it is and then respond.’ Finally, absent from most discussions with Techno’s and Project’s managers was the impact of GHG emissions on the future of the industry or society.</p>

<sec id="section18-0170840612463319">
<title>Integrated firms’ responses to climate change</title>
<p>Vision and Alternative had broader climate change responses than those of Techno and Project. Vision’s and Alternative’s climate change strategies comprised a range of approaches, including managing emissions and investments in renewable energy, while also collaborating externally with governments, ENGOs, and other industry players.</p>
<p>Vision had invested in energy efficiency but had also looked to other approaches to reduce its GHG emissions. The company had invested in research on carbon capture and storage (CCS), in which carbon is captured at the source, transported, and subsequently stored in underground geological reservoirs. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), CCS was an important option for climate change mitigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0170840612463319">2007</xref>). Although CCS was extremely expensive, Vision was exploring the application of this technology in its oil sands operations. The company was also investing in renewable energy. As one of the first oil and gas companies to invest in wind projects, Vision held significant investments in wind farms. The company had also built one of Canada’s largest biofuel plants. In addition, Vision set voluntary emissions targets, which it disclosed publicly. Finally, Vision included employee and public education in its climate change strategy.</p>
<p>Like Vision, Alternative had taken a variety of approaches to mitigating climate change. In addition to investing in energy efficiency, Alternative had invested significantly in CCS deployment. It had also invested in renewable sources of energy, including biofuels and wind. Both renewable energies and CCS were important components of Alternative’s climate change strategy. Although both Vision and Alternative invested considerably in emissions management, neither firm viewed its competitive advantage to be in energy-efficiency technologies. Instead, they both sought broader solutions. The VP of HSE at Alternative explained this view in the following way: ‘We try and get at the bigger picture arguments that it’s not just about CO<sub>2</sub> management or efficiency in our plants and so on. It’s about responding to this global imperative… It is not just a one, you know, one-club solution sort of thing.’</p>
<p>Each of the integrated firms highlighted in its climate change strategy the importance of collaborating with governments, ENGOs, and industry. At Vision, several senior managers within the firm worked extensively in, and in some cases led, multi-sector groups to address the complex problems experienced by their industry, including those related to climate change. Vision engaged with governments and competitors to encourage collective action and prompt regulatory changes regarding climate change. In the words of the senior manager responsible for climate change, ‘We are trying to work more collaboratively with these other companies to say, “Gee, this mode of working in isolation from one another just isn’t cutting it. It’s having some adverse effects.”’ Vision also engaged with various stakeholders, including ENGOs. A senior manager in Vision’s HSE department explained, ‘We talk to everybody, and we listen to them,’ while a senior manager in communications who had been with the firm less than a year had been surprised by Vision’s approach with ENGOs.</p>
<p>Like Vision, Alternative sought a collaborative approach to addressing climate change by engaging with other companies, ENGOs, and governments in multi-sector groups. The company was very engaged with external groups on the climate change issue, having worked with the IPCC and other international groups dedicated to the issue. In particular, Alternative’s official climate change strategy aimed to transition the company to a carbon-constrained future while simultaneously pushing for more stringent climate change regulations. Alternative did this by engaging and sharing information with governments in a variety of jurisdictions. As one of these senior managers explained, ‘We need to engage with the government to help formulate climate change policy. And I think we do a good job of that. [Alternative] is actively involved in helping to develop policy.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0170840612463319">
<title>Integrated firms’ temporal perspective</title>
<p>In contrast to focused firms, integrated firms had a higher tolerance for uncertainty, drew from the past, and had long planning horizons.</p>
<sec id="section20-0170840612463319">
<title>Tolerance for future uncertainty</title>
<p>Vision and Alternative focused on several dimensions of climate change, including the potential consequences of changes to the climate for society and for their companies. They relied less on metrics than Techno and Project by also using qualitative tools to justify investments in climate change and other sustainability-related areas. In addition to measuring the risks, including the cost of carbon, to the company’s return on investment, Vision and Alternative both had managers who used scenario analysis to examine qualitatively the future consequences of climate change on their companies. Scenario analysis allowed the firms to envision the future and, thereby, make it more tangible.</p>
<p>Both firms also exhibited a higher tolerance for uncertainty than the focused firms, which we detected by the few respondents from integrated firms that had focused on the uncertainty in the regulatory environment, especially relative to the focused firms. Further, both Vision and Alternative had invested in research into unproven future technologies to reduce GHGs. When asked why the firm would invest in such costly and uncertain initiatives despite regulatory uncertainty, the VP of HSE at Alternative explained the reason as being the potentially serious consequences of climate change. In his words, ‘There may be some uncertainty but let’s get on with business.’</p>
<p>Vision had made some of its environmental targets public, despite knowing the firm might suffer scrutiny and backlash if it failed to meet those targets. In other words, Vision had introduced its own uncertainty. A senior manager in the HSE department expressed concern that the company did not yet have a plan for addressing some of these targets, but viewed the setting of aggressive targets as a positive step because it pushed people out of their comfort zone: ‘We set goals that are … easier than others. Some of them already got a plan to go from A to B …. Some of them … we’re not sure yet, which is good. You want there to be a bit of discomfort.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0170840612463319">
<title>Drawing from the past</title>
<p>Both Vision and Alternative respondents knew that their firms had included the climate change issue on their radar at least since the Kyoto Protocol negotiations of 1997. During the interviews, several managers in each firm discussed their firm’s long-time commitment to sustainability and to climate change. Several managers at Vision discussed Vision’s long history and experience with the climate change issue. For example, a senior manager in the business development group described how in ‘the past decade, we—you know, we being the people in the sustainability group and the climate change strategy groups, have been saying, well, climate change regs [regulations] are coming.’ He went on to explain that the company had been developing a climate change strategy ever since.</p>
<p>Several Alternative managers discussed how past executives from their company had been committed to sustainability for many years and had made climate change a priority for over a decade. The climate change issue had continued to be important in their firm ever since. The VP of business development noted that, ‘In the past when we took our decisions around the original [oil sands investment], and were making commitments around voluntary targets around GHGs, which costs money, there was never a challenge around is that appropriate and should we be looking to reduce or not make that public commitment. There was always strong support through [the company].’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0170840612463319">
<title>Planning horizons</title>
<p>The integrated firms had much longer planning horizons than the focused firms. In their planning, Vision and Alternative looked further into the future of climate change. For example, Vision’s planning considered the impact of the climate change issue on the firm 35 years into the future. As a senior manager in the strategy department explained, ‘I think right now, you know, we’re looking fairly high level at what the world might look at and how we might position ourselves.’ Similarly, Alternative took a long-term approach to climate change in its planning, looking out more than 40 years. According to a senior manager in regulatory affairs, Alternative examined ‘how the world is going to look in that 40-, 50-year period and what we think should be done.’ By examining possible future outcomes of climate change, managers in these firms acknowledged the importance of strong action by governments and industry to avoid harmful consequences.</p>

<sec id="section23-0170840612463319">
<title>Somewhere in the middle: Engaged’s response to climate change</title>
<p>Engaged exhibited characteristics of both the focused and integrated clusters. This firm invested in a broad range of projects, including emission-reduction activities and wind power projects. Yet it did not invest in other renewable energies and did not have as comprehensive a climate change strategy as did the integrated firms. In addition, Engaged did not invest in voluntary emissions reductions. The firm engaged with governments to help determine a fair price for carbon, as did focused firms, but did not collaborate with governments as extensively as the integrated firms. Engaged was also not involved in as many multi-stakeholder consultations dedicated to understanding the impact of climate change.</p>
<p>The firm’s time perspective was also mixed. At Engaged, regulatory uncertainty stood in the way of further investment in climate change mitigation. A senior manager in the HSE department put it this way: ‘And, of course, in any business you want to get rid of uncertainty as much as you can, right.’ Engaged placed a strong emphasis on metrics in its approach to climate change. When asked whether the firm had a non-quantitative approach to planning for climate change, a senior manager in the strategy department explained: ‘Our current planning tool doesn’t really allow for [that].’ Meanwhile, the firm did focus on the past to understand the climate change issue. Managers frequently mentioned the past CEO’s strong involvement during the Kyoto Protocol negotiations in support of strong action on climate change issues. Finally, the firm’s planning horizons were short, with little attention being paid to the distant future. According to several managers, including the senior manager responsible for climate change, the future was too unpredictable.</p>
<p>To summarize, the focused firms relied on a view of time in which past and future were not as salient to present decision-making on climate change as they were for the integrated firms. Indeed, the discomfort about uncertainty and the reliance on metrics that prevailed in these firms appeared to reduce their time horizons. Meanwhile, the integrated firms were more comfortable with uncertainty and relied less on metrics. To understand the climate change issue, they drew more heavily on past events and future scenarios. In the next section, we apply these findings to extant theory on corporate environmentalism and organizational time. Although we analyzed the data from Engaged, we developed our theory by relying primarily on the two categories of integrated and focused firms.</p>

<title>Discussion and Implications</title>
<p>This research examined the relationship between an organization’s time perspective and its responses to climate change. Using a multi-firm, case-study approach to examine the responses to the climate change issue by five oil and gas firms, we uncovered two distinct patterns of responses to climate change, which we labeled ‘focused’ and ‘integrated’. Focused firms sought internal solutions and often leveraged technology. In contrast, integrated firms developed a broad range of responses, including investments in alternative energies, multi-stakeholder dialogue, and energy efficiency.</p>
<p>We found that the two patterns in firms’ responses to climate change reflected two different time perspectives (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0170840612463319">Table 5</xref>). Focused firms emphasized linear time, which was manifested in a lower tolerance for uncertainty and a tendency, in their climate change decisions, to dismiss the past and the long-term future. In contrast, integrated firms saw time as being cyclical and connected events over time. Integrated firms had a higher tolerance for uncertainty, drew on previous experience, and peered into the deep future to gain insights into how to approach climate change.</p>

<title>Linear time in focused firms</title>
<p>Previous research on time in organizations has described linear time as time that progresses forward with little repetition of events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840612463319">Bluedorn &amp; Denhardt, 1988</xref>). Each day is perceived ‘as relatively new, with a capacity to reinvent itself and events are only loosely influenced by the past’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840612463319">Mosakowski &amp; Earley, 2000</xref>, p. 800). Because of the lack of temporal continuity, the future holds more uncertainty.</p>
<p>Focused firms saw climate change as a recent challenge that was disconnected from the past, a perception that created uncertainty in their organizational environments. It is not surprising, then, that focused firms aimed to mitigate risks and tried to control their immediate environments through such measures as modeling the impact of carbon prices and purchasing offsets. By expressing time as money, the focused firms were better able to model and forecast the future. The translation of time into money also focused their attention on operational efficiencies in an attempt to reduce expenditures. Such a linear view of time focused firms’ attention on narrow solutions to climate change.</p>
<p>As several researchers have noted, when time is viewed as linear, it is seen as a scarce resource that must be managed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840612463319">Doob, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0170840612463319">McGrath &amp; Rotchford, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0170840612463319">Schriber &amp; Gutek, 1987</xref>). Time also tends to be assigned monetary and non-monetary values, which is why the mantra ‘time is money’ continues to dominate western society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0170840612463319">Clark, 1985</xref>). Such a view of time in turn affects behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840612463319">Doob, 1971</xref>). In our data, we found that linear time was related to narrow responses to the climate change issue. The issue became quantified, and the solutions that were pursued tended to be focused and internal.</p>
<p>Linear time, which is normally manifested in organizational planning and other practices designed to mitigate uncertainty, has been associated with a sense of orderliness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0170840612463319">Zerubavel, 1981</xref>). Planning increases orderliness and reduces uncertainty by providing individuals in organizations with psychological and social boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840612463319">Bluedorn &amp; Denhardt, 1988</xref>). Compared with integrated firms, focused firms rely more heavily on metrics and quantitative planning tools to rein in the complexities of climate change. In their search for order, these firms attempt to simplify the climate change issue and therefore respond with narrow and tangible activities, such as investments in energy-efficient technologies. They also look inside the firm for solutions and spend much less time engaging and collaborating with ENGOs, governments, and other firms. This firm-centric approach likely provides more control, thereby reducing the sense of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Research in social psychology offers insights into the relationship between linear time and the responses to climate change by focused firms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0170840612463319">Jost and colleagues (2003)</xref> found that a variety of social-cognitive motives were interrelated, including uncertainty avoidance, intolerance of ambiguity, decreased openness to experience, decreased cognitive complexity, and the need for cognitive closure. Thus, firms with a linear view of time may have a lower tolerance for the uncertainty of climate change, in part because of their need for closure. Focused firms seek immediate and tangible solutions to complex problems, which may explain their heavy reliance on modeling and technologies to address the climate change issue.</p>
<p>Research on organizational time has described linear time as divisible and separate from events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840612463319">Ancona et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0170840612463319">Schriber &amp; Gutek, 1987</xref>). One of our key insights is that firms in which time is perceived as linear tend not to connect the past, present, and future. The past is viewed as unimportant and the future as too far away. Such a focus on the present ignores much of the complexity associated with issues. Therefore, a linear view of time emphasizes less complex solutions that can be compartmentalized. These firms are more likely to define problems more narrowly and, consequently, to be able to solve them more quickly. They are not bogged down by numerous stakeholders that could be involved or by connections that could be made among the past, present, and future. This simplicity gives these firms more clarity, direction, and purpose in solving issues. It also provides the opportunity to develop strong internal capabilities, especially in technology-based skills. Further, the linearity also creates a path dependency in their capability development, as they build ever stronger skills in improving energy efficiency, exploring cutting-edge technologies.</p>
<p>Firms with a linear view of time tend to view the past as irrelevant and the future as unknowable; hence, they emphasize the current state of the climate change issue, including the current regulatory environment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0170840612463319">Schein (1992)</xref> has noted that a linear view of time is well-suited for efficiency but does not handle complexity well. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840612463319">Dubinskas (1988)</xref> found that a closed time orientation, which views time as compartmentalized and thus closely resembles linear time, corresponds to a focus on the immediate present. A firm’s present focus reduces complex issues such as climate change to a narrow economic problem. Focused firms that rely on a linear view of time look for efficient solutions, but their approach tends to be narrow, and they may miss some of the problem’s complexities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0170840612463319">
<title>Cyclical time in integrated firms</title>
<p>Although linear time was present among all firms, integrated firms showed a noticeably higher use of cyclical time, in which events are viewed as repeating through time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0170840612463319">Clark, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840612463319">Orlikowski &amp; Yates, 2002</xref>). In our data, integrated firms not only viewed the climate change issue as repeating through time but they also connected events through time, including in the past, present, and future.</p>
<p>Integrated firms viewed climate change as a long-term problem with both a historical context and future consequences. In their planning, these firms went beyond economic modeling and used scenario analysis, by exploring how the future might unfold and then connecting these different futures to present-day decision-making. Scenarios allowed the integrated firms to explore the possible impacts of climate change on their firm, industry, and society. Scenarios are not predictions about the future; rather, they are stories describing how the future might look. By examining different possible outcomes, scenarios encourage dialogue and learning within organizations, thereby helping the organization to achieve greater flexibility to respond to a variety of possible outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0170840612463319">Marcus, 2009</xref>). Confronting the future makes it less daunting, which may help companies to deal with the uncertainty associated with a long-term issue such as climate change. Consequently, making investments ahead of regulatory certainty was seen by these firms as being less risky than it was for the focused firms.</p>
<p>Collaborating with a variety of stakeholders also allowed the integrated firms to connect issues relating to climate change through time. In collaborating extensively with governments, integrated firms were exposed to the historical context of climate change and worked with governments to shape the future regulatory environment. They also engaged extensively with ENGOs and with First Nations communities, both of which had voiced concerns about the impact of the oil sands on future generations.</p>
<p>This appreciation of the past and willingness to visualize the long-term future broadened both the temporal perspective of these firms and the types of information they absorbed. They did not rely only on metrics but also on qualitative information. In doing so, they were more tolerant of uncertainty, as their work involved numerous stakeholders and many contingencies. Because integrated firms viewed climate change as a complex issue that could not be solved by any one individual firm, they sought collaborative solutions. However, the disparate positions held by many stakeholders led them to realize that climate change could not be tackled quickly.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0170840612463319">Schein (1992)</xref> noted that because firms with a cyclical approach to time focus more on relationships than on efficiency, cyclical time is more effective for solving complex problems when information is dispersed widely and requires high interaction. Integrated firms had a broad climate change strategy, involving multiple alternative technologies. They did not go as deeply as focused firms into improving their energy efficiency, but seemed to have multiple ongoing projects. The integrated firms also involved numerous stakeholders in the dialogue. Each of these different touch points reflected the complexity of their own climate strategy and of the climate change issue. In other words, they demonstrated cognitive complexity, defined as ‘the extent of differentiation among multiple perspectives or dimensions and the higher order integration or synthesis of these differentiated components’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0170840612463319">Jost et al., 2003</xref>, p. 353).</p>
<p>The relationship between cyclical time and an integrated posture can also be explained by literature that has examined temporal connections. Several researchers have recognized that temporal connections help actors learn about issues more deeply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0170840612463319">March, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0170840612463319">Nuttin, 1985</xref>). Integrated firms are able to see the climate change issue over a longer temporal span than focused firms, leading them to appreciate policy changes and public opinion changes occurring over time. When time is perceived as having no fixed end in view, actors typically take a long-term approach to issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840612463319">Dubinskas, 1988</xref>). Orlikowski and Yates noted that ‘depending on the length of observation, a phenomenon may shift from being seen as a one-time event to being recognized as part of an ongoing cycle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840612463319">2002</xref>, p. 691). Thus, a cyclical view of time fosters connections through time and allows for a broader, more complex approach to climate change.</p>

<p>The social sciences, including organizations research, have focused mainly on objective clock time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840612463319">Ancona et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840612463319">Macnaughten &amp; Urry, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840612463319">Mosakowski &amp; Earley, 2000</xref>). However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840612463319">Bluedorn &amp; Denhardt (1988)</xref> note, clock time is a time perspective in which actors view time as a commodity that can be spent and wasted, rather than simply an objective measure of time. Our research empirically supports this claim by demonstrating that organizations possess linear and cyclical perspectives on time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although a clock-time perspective dominates western society, we did find the presence of an event-time perspective in some of the firms we studied. Given the emphasis on clock time in organizational theory, our research helps to highlight the distinct organizational outcomes of event time. By largely ignoring event time, organizational researchers have overlooked some potentially critical variables that can help explain numerous organizational phenomena, including the ability of firms to respond to complex, long-term issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840612463319">Mosakowski &amp; Earley, 2000</xref>). In contrast, the physical sciences have moved beyond Newtonian concepts of time as static, measurable, and divisible through a number of discoveries that characterize time as dynamic rather than static. For instance, research in the sciences has demonstrated that humans are affected not only by clock time but also by multiple rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840612463319">Macnaughten &amp; Urry, 1998</xref>). Similarly, our research shows that organizations may encompass a cyclical view of time in which events are perceived as repeating themselves. This notion of time resembles the cycles of the natural environment rather than a mechanical view of time that has persisted in organizations since the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>Finally, our research expands current understandings of the event time/clock time dichotomy and in particular the dimensions of cyclical time versus linear time. We operationalize these constructs using three interrelated dimensions: drawing from the past, the use of time horizons, and tolerance for uncertainty. Organizations that perceive time as cyclical tend to connect the past to the present and are willing to explore the future despite the accompanying uncertainty. Indeed, researchers have long noted a relationship between time and uncertainty: the longer the time frame, the greater the uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840612463319">Laverty, 1996</xref>). This relationship is often used to explain why firms tend to focus on the short term. Our research shows that despite the uncertainty associated with a long-term issue such as climate change, firms that connect the past, present, and future exhibit a greater willingness to make long-term investments. In other words, making connections in time may mitigate some of the uncertainty associated with long-term issues.</p>

<title>Contributions to corporate environmental research</title>
<p>Our research also contributes to the literature on corporate environmentalism. Previous research on corporate environmentalism has typically plotted firms along a continuum from reactive to proactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0170840612463319">Branzei et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0170840612463319">Buysse &amp; Verbeke, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0170840612463319">Hart, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840612463319">Henriques &amp; Sadorsky, 1999</xref>). However, we found that such a mapping may not provide a thorough and nuanced explanation of corporate responses to climate change.</p>
<p>Focused firms, on the surface, can appear reactive. They responded to the climate change issue by focusing almost exclusively on reducing energy use, a narrow approach compared with the response of their integrated peers. As well, the focused firms’ emphasis on compliance and risks can be labeled as either reactive or defensive, based on existing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840612463319">Henriques &amp; Sadorsky, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0170840612463319">Sharma, 2000</xref>). However, these firms can also be considered to be proactive in their responses. They had developed strong internal capabilities to reduce energy use, suggesting a proactive innovation strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0170840612463319">Pinkse &amp; Kolk, 2009</xref>). As a pollution-prevention approach, energy-efficiency technology can be categorized as proactive, based on previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0170840612463319">Buysse &amp; Verbeke, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0170840612463319">Hart, 1995</xref>). These firms therefore engaged in activities that would not limit them to one distinct category.</p>
<p>Similarly, integrated firms can appear to have proactive or open responses to climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840612463319">Aragon-Correa, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840612463319">Aragon-Correa &amp; Sharma, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840612463319">Basu &amp; Palazzo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840612463319">Henriques &amp; Sadorsky, 1999</xref>). They invested in a broad range of renewable energy projects, engaged in multi-stakeholder dialogue, and were building research consortia of organizations to address climate change. In this sense, they can be considered innovators that cooperate with other companies, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0170840612463319">Kolk and Pinkse’s (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840612463319">2005</xref>) categorization. In their categorization, Kolk and Pinkse classified companies’ climate change strategies based on two dimensions: their strategic intent and their interactions with other actors. A company’s strategic intent can be directed at innovation or compensation: innovation reduces emissions through improvements in processes, products, or product market combinations; compensation reduces emissions through external or internal emissions trading and offsets. To carry out their strategic aims, firms can opt for one of three different levels of interaction: internal to the company, vertical through the company’s supply chain, and horizontal with other companies, including competitors. While all companies in our study invested in innovation and compensation through energy-efficiency innovations and purchasing offsets, we found that some firms invested in additional mitigation technologies, such as CCS. We also found that firms differed in their level of interaction, with some firms emphasizing horizontal interactions more than others.</p>
<p>What differentiated these companies was their approach to time. Firms with a long-term, cyclical perspective on time invested in CCS technology. However, according to existing research, such an investment is considered to be an end-of-pipe technology, often associated with a reactive posture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0170840612463319">Buysse &amp; Verbeke, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0170840612463319">Hart, 1995</xref>). We found no evidence that integrated firms had fewer GHG emissions than focused firms or that they could respond to climate change more quickly than focused firms. In fact, focused firms are likely more agile in their responses to climate change because of their technological capabilities.</p>
<p>In this paper, we suggest that the reactive/proactive continuum may not fully capture the range of firms’ responses. Firms may engage in activities that are seen as both reactive and proactive, making it difficult to assign firms to one category. Furthermore, a hierarchical categorization implies that one category is superior to another, and yet some activities require tradeoffs. So, whereas substituting fossil fuels with alternative energies may be perceived as preferable to reducing energy use, the latter may be much faster and easier to implement.</p>
<p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840612463319">Basu and Palazzo (2008)</xref> suggested that instead of using lists of activities to rank firms on their social and environmental performance, a more useful approach may be to understand patterns of behavior and, thereby, the overall character of the firm in responding to issues. In this paper, we argue that a firm’s time perspective forms an important aspect of its character. Furthermore, a firm’s time perspective underlies its response to climate change. This finding sheds light on previous studies that have explained differences in environmental strategies based solely on variance in firms’ activities. Yet, even firms that resemble each other on the surface (e.g., two firms that engage in proactive initiatives) may, in fact, exhibit very different approaches based on more fine-grained underlying factors, such as their perspective on time. Such underlying factors may help to predict future behaviors of such firms on numerous different issues. Thus, by explicitly exploring a firm’s time perspective, we have opened up new and important distinctions that can help us discriminate between patterns of firm responses.</p>
<p>Finally, by recognizing the importance of time perspectives in shaping corporate responses to climate change, we can more fully appreciate the tradeoffs between speed and breadth of response. The differences that are conveyed in linear and cyclical time highlight the tension between speed of response and breadth of response. Firms that use linear time can move quickly and efficiently to work on technological solutions to climate change, but they may not address the problem broadly, focusing instead on a single dimension of the problem. For example, they may look for ways to reduce the amount of fossil fuel energy, and therefore carbon emissions, they use to produce a barrel of oil. At the same time, they may create unintended consequences because problems are conceptualized narrowly. In contrast, firms that use cyclical time, viewing the past, present, and future as connected, are likely to coordinate and learn, but their solutions may be slower and incommensurate with the temporal realities of the climate change issue.</p>

<title>Implications for managers and policy-makers</title>
<p>This research has significant implications for management practice and public policy. Managers need to be aware of the underlying time perspective inherent in their organizations and its effect on their decision-making. Firms with a linear time perspective actively aim to mitigate risks. They do so by investing in technology innovations that build efficiencies and reduce their GHG emissions. With their internal technological capabilities, and without a reliance on external partners, they become more agile. Firms relying more on cyclical time accommodate a broader base of information, look to build external relationships, learn from the past, and attempt to shape the future, rather than accept it as given. These firms have the opportunity to change the system by leading coordinated actions. Managers that understand their corporate time perspective can uncover and, potentially, shift their decision biases.</p>
<p>Our research also provides insights for public policy-makers. We identify new levers based on temporal dimensions that can shape corporate responses to climate change. For example, firms with a linear view of time favor innovation and technology, so programs that incentivise firms to invest in low-carbon technologies can motivate these firms to act. Firms with a more cyclical view of time will respond well to industry-wide collaborative initiatives, so encouraging information-sharing and dialogue may motivate these firms to respond to climate change.</p>

<title>Limitations and future research</title>
<p>This study has some limitations. First, these case studies are limited to one industry, which results in limited generalizability beyond the oil and gas industry. However, many industries increasingly face strategic challenges and societal pressure as a result of climate change. Future research should investigate whether the temporal perspectives we uncovered exist in other industries and in other contexts.</p>
<p>Second, access was a problem for the firms that industry experts had identified as being the least active in terms of their climate change policies. Although we can only speculate, these firms may have had even more focused responses than Techno and Project. However, since we found differences among what were likely more similar firms, these differences would probably have been magnified even further if our sample had included companies with greater variance in their climate change responses. In other words, the firms that agreed to participate in the study were likely more similar to each other than to the firms that did not agree to participate, and yet differences were found regardless of this limitation, further strengthening our findings.</p>
<p>Third, our research demonstrates that a temporal perspective existed in the firms’ responses to climate change. However, we were unable to determine whether this time perspective applied across the entire firm. We were also unable to determine from our data the elements that shaped the time perspectives of the firms, although some of the organizational practices appeared related to firms’ time perspectives. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0170840612463319">Schein (1992)</xref> has argued that time is a fundamental category of cultural analysis and therefore we expect that organizational culture, in part, will shape time perspectives. More empirical research is needed to determine the precise form and nature of an organization’s time perspective and its antecedents.</p>
<p>Because this research was cross-sectional, we were unable to examine how responses changed over time. Such a line of inquiry could provide insights into the dynamic forces that shape organizational responses to climate change. While we suspect that time perspectives do shape firms’ strategy over time, future research would benefit from a longitudinal design to improve our understanding of climate change responses. Our research provides a first step in that direction.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>An important irony is at play. Clock time, which is linear and focuses on the short term, currently dominates western society. While this view of time has contributed greatly to progress in the last 200 years, it has also contributed to such environmental problems as resource depletion and climate change. Viewing time as ‘scarce’ encourages a faster pace of life and a focus on the present, with little thought given to future consequences. Yet, as GHGs continue to accumulate in the atmosphere at an accelerated pace, the climate change issue becomes increasingly urgent. The time perspective that has contributed to the problem may also be part of the solution.</p>
<p>If society is to confront the many challenges and complexities associated with climate change, then we will also need to alter the way we view, value, and manage time. Drawing on lessons from the past and connecting them to a more sustainable vision of the future may bring us closer to addressing the many challenges associated with climate change—but doing so requires the luxury of time.</p>
