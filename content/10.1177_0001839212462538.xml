<p>That people and organizations care about status should not be a controversial assertion. In many cases, status is important because it arises directly from merit: a Nobel Prize is a powerful signal of status that grants the recipient visibility and respect, but it also recognizes “objective” merit. Yet status is not only and not always a consequence of merit. Examples of companies that benefit from high status yet offer relatively lower quality products abound. Teams often neglect their most experienced members and rely disproportionately on members with less relevant experience but higher status on other, less relevant characteristics.</p>
<p>If status matters for individuals, for groups, and for organizations, then it is not a surprise that scholars from a number of disciplines have studied it. The sheer variety of settings, methodologies, and theoretical groundings that have been used to demonstrate its impact on important outcomes confirms status as a critical element of organizational life. The same variety also makes it extremely difficult for researchers, let alone for practitioners, to navigate the concept and, more important, to develop a comprehensive intuition for why, when, and how it should matter. For that reason alone, Pearce’s edited volume, <italic>Status in Management and Organizations</italic>, is a welcome contribution. The book gathers authors from different fields to illustrate how status is conceptualized and how it can affect important outcomes at different levels of analysis. The effort is important because the languages, methods, and publication outlets chosen by the different disciplines can give the impression that, though they all study “status,” they actually explore different phenomena with little in common and little to contribute to each other. But the book demonstrates that, beyond the apparent differences, status as a concept shares important characteristics and mechanisms across disciplines.</p>
<p>The book provides a useful snapshot of existing research by covering a comprehensive array of methods and disciplinary approaches. Its first contribution emerges from the introduction, in which Pearce extracts a common definition of status that translates well across the rest of the book. It is the standing with respect to a <italic>specific group</italic> that is derived from a <italic>social consensus</italic>, is perceived by <italic>individuals</italic>, and can be (roughly) assessed via <italic>structural (observable) characteristics</italic>. An important distinction, well illustrated in different parts of the book, is that status is not “owned” by focal actors but is granted to them by a specific group and therefore is audience-dependent. This helps explain a critical characteristic of status: that it can be correlated with quality but is only loosely coupled with it. An interesting extension is that, when evaluating an actor’s status, audience members may care more about making accurate estimations of how other members rank the actor than about making accurate estimations of quality. Put differently, status reflects what audience members agree are the group’s generalized beliefs (what “everybody thinks everybody thinks”) about an actor’s rank, and not necessarily how members actually assess the actor’s value.</p>
<p>The book contains an impressive array of perspectives. Empirical chapters provide illustrations of status dynamics in particular contexts. Chapter 2, by Sullivan and Stewart, analyzes a community of open-source programmers to explore the process through which an audience reaches consensus on the status hierarchy. Wry, Lounsbury, and Greenwood look at the fascinating world of nanotechnology in chapter 6 to argue that status hierarchies arise within the cultural context of specific groups and, as such, can be highly susceptible to the early actions—“cultural work”—of more visible actors, in this case, star scientists.</p>
<p>Other chapters construct a bridge between status research and other fields or theories. O’Brien and Dietz, make a case for the usefulness of social dominance theory in general and measures of social dominance orientation (an individual’s propensity to endorse social hierarchies) in particular as tools to conduct research on status in organizations. Nippa argues that status as a concept should enrich tournament theory and can help it solve some of its internal inconsistencies by, for example, recognizing that status can be an end in itself and can greatly alter how actors compete. Chapter 7, by Saxton and Saxton, provides a useful model to map the stages of venture creation and the financial, human, and product resources that startups must acquire, with different stakeholders, at different stages. The authors conceptualize venture formation as a process of status acquisition, whereby startups accumulate “intangible resources that will help them overcome the liability of newness. . . . Ultimately status makes a new venture desirable to stakeholders” (p. 206). Ironically, the authors don’t discuss how the status of its stakeholders can help or hinder a startup’s status acquisition, but the model is nonetheless conceptually useful. Greenberg and Ganegoda provide a comprehensive, if at times difficult to follow, review of existing theories that explain perceptions of justice inside organizations. They also discuss the ways in which the theorized mechanisms interact with status hierarchies to alter what is perceived as fair inside organizations.</p>
<p>These chapters make useful contributions, to be sure. But it is the remaining chapters that prove most valuable. Each of them tackles a particular field, providing a useful survey of its approach to status research, identifying critical puzzles that remain unsolved, and proposing ways to explore them. Appropriately, each chapter focuses on status at a particular level of analysis, covering the organization, the group, and the individual. Starting with the organization, chapter 4, by Jensen, Kim, and Kim, focuses on the effects of status in markets as conceptualized by economic sociology. The authors first provide a helpful summary of existing theories, the actual mechanisms proposed or implied by them, and the distinction between organizational status and quality and reputation. They then argue that an organization’s status is codified as its market identity, which is the interface between the organization and its audience. Thus an organization’s status is found in the intersection of two dimensions, as defined by the organization’s audience: horizontal, divided by categories based on different properties and attributes; and vertical, or a shared ranking of the members of a particular horizontal category. What is useful about this visual conceptualization is that it allows the authors to reconcile and integrate mechanisms from a broad set of often-disjointed works that explore different elements of the role of status and categories in the marketplace. It also allows them to pose a provocative set of questions around market dynamics and organizational mobility across the horizontal and vertical dimensions of status.</p>
<p>Chapters 8 and 9 move down one level of analysis to examine status dynamics in work groups. Both chapters examine the critical question of how status is processed by individuals in teams. In particular, they explore the reasons why teams often grant members status—and thus weigh their contributions—based on ascribed characteristics rather than expertise or merit, to the detriment of team performance. Chapter 8, by Bunderson and Barton, first describes the importance of identifying expertise within teams to provide hierarchies of participation and influence. It then reviews existing research to explain how, given that expertise is often unobservable, team members rely instead on members’ observable characteristics to infer expertise. The authors provide a valuable typology of the status cues available to team members: cues can be differentiated based on their validity, or whether they are diffuse vs. specific; and their reliability, or whether they are grounded in behaviors vs. attributes. The typology creates a hierarchy of cues, according to which team members prefer to size each other up based on valid and reliable cues but, when these are less salient, they instead choose reliable cues based on attributes that are invalid because they are poorly correlated with expertise. The authors identify conditions under which different types of cues will play a larger role in defining status hierarchies within teams. They then state clear boundary conditions for their propositions, intriguing questions for future research, and actionable implications for managers.</p>
<p>Chapter 9, by Thomas-Hunt and Phillips, proceeds along similar lines but takes the additional step of discussing how race, a particularly salient and unreliable status cue, affects status hierarchies in teams. The authors ask when race, as a status cue, will be activated and affect the recognition of the <italic>achieved</italic> (i.e., expertise) status as opposed to the <italic>ascribed</italic> (i.e., race) status of team members. They propose that, rather than explore <italic>whether</italic> racial characteristics affect status assignment within teams, we should explore the conditions under which it does. They propose different ways in which racial characteristics can affect the interpretation of achieved status characteristics. In particular, they propose three mechanisms that can activate racial cues to make them more salient than achieved characteristics: when members act in ways that are consistent with racial stereotypes, when in the absence of firsthand observations members disclose stereotype-consistent behaviors, and when members violate the norms of a group. The authors then extract clear implications for team managers.</p>
<p>Finally, chapter 11, by Elsbach brings the level of analysis down to the individual and explores the relationship between individual status and identity. The chapter highlights a critical fact: individuals have multiple identities, as well as multiple audiences that they care about, and these identities and audiences often collide. As a result, individuals must choose which characteristics, traits, or roles to display to which audiences. These self-categorizations seek to confer both “<italic>status</italic> based on the legitimacy and rank associated with a category, and <italic>distinctiveness</italic> based on inclusion or exclusion from specific categories” (p. 305). The chapter then explores how individuals balance the status and distinctiveness of their self-categorizations when responding to identity threats and the different tactics that they are likely to follow when resolving particular identity conflicts. The chapter is useful because, in proposing the different tactics and the mechanisms that underpin them, it highlights with particular clarity the importance of <italic>situated</italic> audiences and identities in status dynamics. The micro level of analysis also helps isolate mechanisms that also seem to operate at other levels, thus suggesting interesting links to other chapters in the book.</p>
<p>As a volume, the book suffers from two related limitations. The first is that it lacks a clear integrating narrative to tie the chapters together. Given the diversity of chapters, and of the approaches that they represent, a single narrative is probably impossible to achieve, but the organizing framework is nonetheless awkward and difficult to navigate. The second, and more disappointing limitation is that it puts the onus of making connections between the chapters entirely on the reader. For a book that seeks to demonstrate how the different fields and approaches can contribute to each other, it remains conspicuously silent on the matter, both within the chapters and most notably in the conclusion. For example, there is a clear parallel between the mechanisms of self-categorization described by Elsbach and the status-identity framework proposed by Jensen, Kim, and Kim. Chapters 8 and 9 also clearly complement each other, but the book never explores how. For example, it is interesting to think about how star scientists in nanotechnology could strategically highlight certain parts of their identity (Elsbach) and make certain characteristics more or less salient to others (Thomas-Hunt and Phillips) so as to increase their influence in their field (Wry, Lounsbury, and Greenwood). But no such connections are attempted and, as a result, the book ironically illustrates how different literatures seem to talk past each other, even when they ostensibly seek to collaborate.</p>
<p>Limitations aside, the book can provide a valuable resource for researchers seeking an efficient entry into the complex world of status and organizations. The reader will find useful definitions, succinct summaries of existing research, and provocative questions to explore. As an added bonus, readers might make their own interesting connections across disciplines and research settings.</p>
