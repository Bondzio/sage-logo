<p>I recently attended the two-day conference organised by Information Today Group at Copthorne Tara Hotel, London on 27–28 October 2011. The conference is organised every year and this is the 13th year of Internet Librarian International. </p>
<p>Internet Librarian International’s primary focus was case studies of innovation and technology in action in a variety of library settings. This year, more than 30 case studies were featured from around the world, including Australia, Belgium, Hungary, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<p>This year's conference theme was ‘Navigating the New Normal – Strategies for Success'. Conference Chair, Marydee Ojala explained that innovation and experimentation are still taking place. We are amazingly proficient at revolutionising our work environments, understanding and utilising new technologies, and also bringing creative thinking to problem solving. The new normal isn’t just about austere budgets, it’s also about new technologies and new ways of working. It's about partnerships and transparency, about new ways to develop and disseminate knowledge, about the increasing importance of communication skills, and about opening up access to information, data, and knowledge.</p>
<p>The opening keynote address was delivered by Klaus Tochtermann, Director of the German National Library of Economics and Professor of Computer Media at the University of Kiel. Professor Tochtermann shared his vision of the future of the Internet and how it will affect information professionals and libraries, based around the four elements of the future Internet that he has identified: the Internet of content and knowledge, the Internet by and for people, the Internet of things, and the Internet of services. The second-day keynote speakers were journalist Kevin Anderson and social software consultant Suw Charman-Anderson. They focused on the evaluation and adoption of digital innovations, issues around data journalism, social media, semantic search, crowd sourcing, digital rights and press freedom.</p>
<p>ILI 2011 was organised into six tracks to help delegates focus on topics of their particular interest:<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Track 1 – ‘Technology Developments and Trends’ kicked off by UKOLN’s Brian Kelly and Åke Nygren of Stockholm Public Library who explored what’s on the technology horizon. The track includes a presentation from Andrew Woolfson of law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain LLP who explained how RPC have developed ‘Edge’, a new social platform designed to understand the way people work, married to the attributes of social media within the unique demands of a legal environment. Other speakers in this track include the Open University's Tony Hirst, the University of Huddersfield's Dave Pattern and Bryony Ramsden, and Rurik Thomas Greenall from Norway’s NTNU.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Track 2 – ‘New Models for the New Normal’, included presentations from Linda Vidlund and Cecilia Petersson from Uppsala University Library, who talked about how they are experimenting with technologies such as QR codes to find out how digital materials can be made more visible in the physical library, and how the library can become both a social and a learning space. Other speakers in this track come from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Wellcome Trust, National Library Board of Singapore, the Scottish Qualifications Authority and Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (UK).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Track 3 – ‘Transforming Resource Management’ kicked off with a look at the e-book revolution in libraries. Kate Worlock of industry analyst firm Outsell revealed some of the publishing trends underlying the future development of e-books. Ceri Hughes of KPMG discussed experimenting with e-resources to keep a dispersed and highly mobile workforce informed. Trevor Dawes and Jennifer Baxmeyer of Princeton University talked about how university library prepared for a programme to circulate electronic devices such as Kindles and iPads to library patrons. Also in this track, Hugh Look presented the first comprehensive look at the JISC Collections review of its banding scheme.</p>
</list-item>

<p>Track 4 – ‘Search and Discovery' featured presentations from conference favourites Phil Bradley and Karen Blakeman as well as an examination of the state of play of linked data and Web scale discovery.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Track 5 – ‘New Users, New Audiences, New Behaviours' focused on new ways to engage and understand users, and to develop services accordingly. Joanna Ptolomey discussed a case study that looks at the information community journey of Long Term Conditions Scotland and asks if community members can effectively curate and moderate content for themselves. </p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Track 6 – ‘Teaching Others, Developing Ourselves' featured presentation from Michael Stephens of San Jose State University with an overview of emerging literacy related to digital media, information exchange and education as well as presentation regarding teaching information skills and developing ourselves.</p>

<p>The conference was attended by delegates from more than 30 countries and from academic, public, corporate, government, medical, law and various other types of libraries. My most favourite sessions were:</p>

<p>The Internet Librarian International conference ended with a panel discussion tackling the question of whether the new normal requires a new you. The panel was made up of three speakers from the conference, Michael Stephens, Ulla de Stricker and Joanna Ptolemy and was chaired by Marydee Ojala. </p>
<p>I attended really interesting sessions, met renowned experts on various fields and had engaging discussions in the field of current trends in library and information management during this conference. I personally feel that I don’t completely need to reinvent myself to work with the new normal, but I can use my existing knowledge and resources as a basis to adapt myself to meet new needs and challenges.</p>
