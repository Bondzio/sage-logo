<abstract>
<p>This study applies the concept of institutional logic to interpret the content of the instrumental and expressive dimensions of nonprofit organizations (NPOs). The study concludes that the three-sector assumption of public, private, and nonprofit in existing nonprofit studies may have neglected some institutional logics of NPOs. The sets of institutional logics that are innate to NPOs must often adapt to “external” institutional logics due to resource dependency. The study discusses a relatively complete spectrum of the multiple institutional logics enacted by NPOs, and it conceptualizes the “adapted institutional logics” phenomenon, whereby NPOs are forced to change due to competing logics.</p>

<p>As a relatively new form of organization, nonprofits have become more pervasive worldwide. However, current nonprofit organization (NPO) scholarship lacks theoretical clarity, a fact that prevents scholars from reaching meaningful consensus about the characteristics of NPOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095399712438371">DiMaggio, 2006</xref>). This study attempts to theorize the characteristics of the nonprofit sector by employing an institutional logic lens. The multidimensionality of the nonprofit sector has been increasingly recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399712438371">Anheier &amp; Salamon, 2006</xref>). Institutional logic theory, which views societal contexts as being influenced by contending institutional logics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0095399712438371">Thornton &amp; Ocasio, 2008</xref>), thus offers a promising theoretical tool to examine the multidimensional characteristics of the sector. This qualitative study additionally employs an analytic tool to analyze organizational-level qualitative data: the instrumental and expressive dimensions of NPOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399712438371">Frumkin, 2002</xref>). The study suggests that the current crisis in developing NPO theory is present because different scholarship lacks appreciation of the complex nature of NPOs and tends only to focus on one type of logic, although various NPOs can embody a wide range of institutional logics. Theoretically, the work conceptualizes a new institutional logic phenomenon—“adapted institutional logics.” This concept recognizes the influence of external institutional logics on innate institutional logics. In this study, innate organizational logics adapted to external institutional logics due to resource dependence.</p>

<title>Economic and Charitable Aspects of Contemporary NPOs Inhibit Scholarly Consensus</title>
<p>A challenge facing nonprofit theory development is the increased diversity among organizations in the nonprofit sector. The increasing diversity of NPO characteristics makes identifying a set of “shared” characteristics common to all NPOs a difficult task. The major tensions leading to diversification include the tendency of NPOs to take on characteristics from the public and private sectors. Developing a generalizable nonprofit theory seems unachievable because it is difficult to reconcile these contradictory tensions.</p>
<p>From an economic perspective, some NPOs are perceived as being increasingly institutionalized into “hybrids” of private and public organizations due to resource-based relationships with the private and public sectors, including financing, competing, or contracting relationships (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095399712438371">Billis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399712438371">Brandensen, de Donk, &amp; Putters, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095399712438371">DiMaggio, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399712438371">Evers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399712438371">Evers &amp; Laville, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095399712438371">Gumport &amp; Snydman, 2006</xref>). From a charitable perspective, some NPOs gain support largely on the basis of their values and the values of donors and volunteers. This is suspected to be the “original,” innate nonprofit characteristic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095399712438371">Frumkin &amp; Andre-Clarke, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399712438371">Mason, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095399712438371">Moore, 2000</xref>). In practice, the tendency of NPOs to take on characteristics from the public and private sectors increasingly blurs the boundaries between the sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095399712438371">Ferris, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095399712438371">Kramer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0095399712438371">Saidel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0095399712438371">Van Til, 2009</xref>). Although the economic aspect emphasizes efficiency in some NPOs, the charitable aspect emphasizes free giving, care, and values in others. The increasing tendency of NPOs to take on characteristics from other sectors also makes it more difficult to distinguish between innate nonprofit characteristics and characteristics adopted from the private and public sectors.</p>
<p>The commercialization trend of some NPOs prompts some scholars to account for the nature of NPOs through a private sector lens. However, this approach cannot speak to the characteristics of NPOs that are not businesslike. Some NPOs resemble businesses, as the “for-profits-in-disguise” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0095399712438371">Steinberg, 2006</xref>, p. 118; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095399712438371">Weisbrod, 1998</xref>); others do not. These NPOs utilize distribution channels, including excessive executive compensation, self-dealing, and merging with for-profit ventures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399712438371">Steinberg &amp; Powell, 2006</xref>). Historically, NPOs were utilized by businesses to benefit the owner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095399712438371">Hall, 2006</xref>) and have been increasingly commercialized and acting more like businesses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095399712438371">Weisbrod (1998)</xref> asserted that NPOs progressively face financial pressure because of the growing gap between resources and social need. This pressure inevitably leads to NPOs engaging in commercial activities to bring in additional revenue. NPOs can engage in buying and selling services, and in aggressive and competitive marketing and fundraising (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399712438371">Brown &amp; Slivinski, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0095399712438371">Van Til, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095399712438371">Weisbrod, 1998</xref>). NPOs become “business-like” or “charity-like” depending on whether resources are from commercial income or from donations and volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399712438371">Galaskiewicz &amp; Bielefeld, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The tendency of NPOs to take on characteristics of the public sector prompts other scholars to account for the nature of NPOs through a public sector lens. This approach cannot address the characteristics of NPOs that are not involved with the public sector. More and more NPOs rely on government funding to provide services demanded by the government (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095399712438371">Kramer, 2000</xref>). This trend results in NPOs resembling public agencies, especially those NPOs that receive nearly all resources from governmental contracts or grants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399712438371">Steinberg &amp; Powell, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399712438371">Lipsky and Smith (1989)</xref> noted that, along with government funding, public management practices and the politics surrounding social service expenditures are transferred to NGOs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095399712438371">Ferris (2001)</xref> indicated that NPOs often gain public funding at the cost of nonprofit autonomy. This could encroach on nonprofit uniqueness. The dependence of NPOs on public funding can cause several anxieties: funding uncertainty, goal deflection, and reduced fiscal flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095399712438371">Kramer &amp; Grossman, 1987</xref>).</p>

<title>Institutional Logics Enacted by NPOs: What Do We Know and What to Explore?</title>
<p>It is first necessary to introduce the definitions of institutional logics as a theoretical background for further discussions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0095399712438371">Thornton and Ocasio (2008)</xref> defined institutional logic as “the socially constructed, historical patterns of material practices, assumptions, values, beliefs, and rules by which individuals produce and reproduce their material subsistence, organize time and space, and provide meaning to their social reality” (p. 804). Friedland and Alford (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399712438371">Alford, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399712438371">Friedland &amp; Alford, 1991</xref>) articulate that private organizations mainly enact the institutional logics of capitalism and the state. “The institutional logic of capitalism is accumulation and the commoditization of human activity. That of the state is rationalization and the regulation of human activity by legal and bureaucratic hierarchies” (Alford &amp; Friedland, 1991, p. 248). Public organizations enact the institutional logics of democracy and the state. The institutional logic of democracy is “participation and the extension of popular control over human activity” (Alford &amp; Friedland, 1991, p. 248)</p>
<p>Examining prior literature, we can deduce that certain NPOs enact the institutional logics of capitalism, the state, and democracy. Previous discussion shows that some NPOs demonstrate businesslike characteristics; one can deduce that these NPOs partially enact the institutional logic of capitalism. Some NPOs also practice the institutional logic of the state, according to the existing literature documenting the government-like nature of contemporary NPOs. Similarly, one can also deduce that NPOs also enact the institutional logic of democracy, because NPOs are a main component of the civil society. Although these three institutional logics can explain some NPOs’ behavior, they are not sufficient to explain the behavior of all NPOs. Businesslike organizations are not necessarily 100% businesslike, even if they provide services based on a fee basis and engage in market competition. Their fees may not be set at a market rate, or these organizations may simultaneously provide free services to low-income customers. Unlike public organizations, government-like NPOs represent minority, not majority, interests. If nonprofits represented majority interests, they would be doing the same job as the government, which is charged with representing the majority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0095399712438371">Young, 2001</xref>). Not all NPOs are civil society organizations or representatives for political interests.</p>
<p>The previous discussion shows a complex picture of institutional logics embodied in the nonprofit sector. First, unlike the private or public sectors, which have uniform sets of institutional logics, the nonprofit sector has a multitude of logics. For example, businesslike NPOs may demonstrate the institutional logic of capitalism, but some NPOs may not be businesslike at all. Second, some NPOs seem to demonstrate the institutional logic of capitalism, the state, or democracy while enacting another, less obviously visible logic. Third, there are NPOs that do not enact capitalist, statist, or democratic logics. They may be completely charitable-value based. This study explores the institutional logic that may be enacted by these organizations and the partially obscured logics embodied by NPOs that have begun to enact institutional logics of capitalism, the state, and democracy.</p>

<title>Instrumental and Expressive Dimensions of NPOs</title>
<p>Although the research question is at a sectoral level, the analysis is carried out in individual organizations. This study adopts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399712438371">Frumkin’s (2002)</xref> definitions of instrumental and expressive dimensions as initial working concepts to facilitate the organizational-level analysis. These two dimensions are employed to categorize emerged organizational concepts. As a by-product, this study also further refines these two dimensions. Scholars have long held that instrumental and expressive dimensions are unique to NPOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399712438371">Frumkin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095399712438371">Gordon &amp; Babchuk, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095399712438371">Knutsen &amp; Brower, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399712438371">Mason, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0095399712438371">Smith, 1973</xref>), but definitions and properties of these two dimensions have, to date, remained vague. The precise meaning of the two dimensions is also inconsistent among scholars. For instance, Gordon and Babchuk’s definitions are inconsistent with Frumkin’s work. Political associations are instrumental organizations according to Gordon and Babchuk, but according to Frumkin, civic and political engagement is “upon the expressive rationale” (p. 25).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399712438371">Frumkin’s (2002)</xref> interpretation of the instrumental dimension hinges on the service delivery role and potential commercialized social entrepreneurial behavior of NPOs. He posits that the core of the instrumental dimension consists of the value of NPOs accomplishing public goals. Frumkin’s interpretation of the expressive dimension is focused on “the very act of attempting to address a need or fight for a cause.” The expressive value “may be entirely psychic and may arise simply from the act of expressing commitment, caring, and belief” (p. 23).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0095399712438371">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399712438371">Locke, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095399712438371">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>) is the principal method used to qualitatively explore the instrumental and expressive organizational characteristics. The goal of this study is to develop a middle-range theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095399712438371">Boudon, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095399712438371">Merton, 1968</xref>) to understand contemporary NPOs (i.e., not the total conceptual structure but a limited conceptual range). The study does not claim to generate findings that are applicable to all NPOs, nor does it exhaust all possible institutional logics that NPOs may practice. The target organizations are the archetypal nonprofits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095399712438371">Greenwood &amp; Hinings, 1993</xref>). Four common types of NPOs are identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399712438371">Frumkin, 2002</xref>): religious organizations, public-serving organizations, member-serving organizations, and political advocacy organizations. With the goal of maximizing variations among organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399712438371">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>), the study recruited one or two organizations for each type. This study recruited 16 Canadian NPOs in total.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this study only targets NPOs that are perceived as “Chinese” NPOs. Often, a significant portion of the clients of these NPOs are members of the Chinese ethnic population. Targeting only Chinese ethnic organizations has two benefits. First, the ethnic component is expected to offer more sensitivity or “insight” to the data, especially to the expressive dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095399712438371">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>, p. 46). In fact, the analysis shows that the ethnicity element of the data strongly contributed to the theme of the Chinese identity, democratic values (e.g., antiracism), and the advocacy themes for the ethnic community. Second, the author is not only familiar with Chinese and Western cultures but also distant from both, as a Chinese immigrant now living in North America and, as such, is at an appropriate position to manage the balance between objectivity and sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399712438371">McCracken, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095399712438371">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0095399712438371">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Note: The table reports each organization’s type instead of its name to comply with our confidentiality promises to research participants. The average age of the 16 organizations is 30 years. Most organizations are small or medium-sized (less than 20 paid staff), except for three (organization #12, 15, and 6), which are relatively large. Member-serving organizations, political organizations and the church are mostly run by part-time staff and volunteers. Service organizations have more full-time staff ranging from 17 to 65. This largest organization has a total budget of CAD3.5 million dollars at the year of the study (#10); however, the size of an organization does not seem to represent a particularly relevant factor in the analysis. In general, the smaller sized organizations are representative of the majority of the NPOs.</p></fn>

<p>The principal method of data collection is the “long interview” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399712438371">McCracken, 1988</xref>) or “ethnographic interview” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399712438371">Spradley, 1979</xref>). By asking open-ended, nonleading questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399712438371">Spradley, 1979</xref>), investigators are able to obtain nonleading information on the everyday activities of social actors. The study recruited interviewees at the top management level because these individuals are knowledgeable or “thoroughly enculturated” with their organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399712438371">Spradley, 1979</xref>, p. 46). These interviewees are program directors or presidents of the organization. The study adopts a semistructured interview format, with interviews averaging about one and a half hours. Supplementary data were obtained through field observations, including attending a variety of organizational activities such as a celebration of an organization’s anniversary, open-to-the-public seminars, cultural promotion activities, and conferences. More field data were obtained from office visits, including visits to neighboring non-Chinese NPOs. Archival data utilized include program brochures, Canadian Chinese newspapers, Canadian Chinese websites, organizational announcements, organizations’ mission statements, history introductions, and strategic plans. Data collection began in May 2007 and was complete by the end of January 2008. In total, 51 documents of data were constructed, including interviews, field notes, and some archival data documents. Different sources of data serve the function of validating each other.</p>
<p>Nvivo 8 software was used to analyze the data. The author developed first-order codes, such as “providing network opportunities to members,” “lack of funding,” and “helping the communities” which offer a summary of themes that emerged in the data that may only potentially be useful to develop more consolidated codes. The first-order codes include two levels of analysis: individual and organizational levels. The author then separated the individual level codes and focused only on the organizational-level codes, categorizing these codes into four groups: content of instrumental dimension, activities to fulfill the instrumental content, facilitators, and constraining factors. The categories repeat for the expressive dimension analysis.</p>
<p>The overall analytic process is iterative, moving back and forth from inductive insights to deductive confirmation, and then back (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399712438371">Locke, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095399712438371">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>). Codes constantly emerged, consolidated into a category, changed into a different category, or merged with other codes. More detailed levels of codes were developed under the above-mentioned categories. For example, under the category of “organizational form of instrumental dimension,” there are four subcategories: (a) instrumental to the society—mission related, (b) instrumental to the organization itself, (c) instrumental to the society—nonmission related, and (d) disconnection between the instrumental and expressive dimensions. Under “(b) instrumental to the organization itself,” there are four further subcategories: instrumental needs of the organization, instrumental activities to fulfill the needs, constraints to achieving the needs of the organization, and factors facilitating achieving the instrumental needs. During analysis, new codes often were added when analyzing a new kind of organization. Saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095399712438371">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>) was reached once all different types of organizations were analyzed. Nvivo reports six levels of categories and 524 codes in total. The analysis also created 18 memos.</p>
<p>The analysis shows that nonprofit instrumental and expressive dimensions are reflected at the individual and the organizational level. Both dimensions are evidenced by four organizational factors: (a) the content of the dimension, (b) organizational activities to fulfill the dimension, (c) organizational factors constraining the achievement of the dimension, and (d) organizational factors facilitating the achievement of the dimension. This article only focuses on the organizational level and only reports organizational Factor (a): content of the dimension. The content of the expressive dimension consists of various “values” embodied by NPOs. The content of the instrumental dimension mainly contains various “needs” that NPOs are instrumental in fulfilling. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0095399712438371">Thornton and Ocasio (2008)</xref> noted that institutional logics can be socially constructed “material practices,” “assumptions,” “values,” “beliefs,” and “rules.” Because this article only reports the content of the two dimensions, the application of institutional logic to interpret the expressive dimension particularly focuses on the “values” and “beliefs” dimension of the institutional logics. The application of institutional logic to the instrumental dimension particularly focuses on the “practice” dimension of the institutional logics. Therefore, “institutional logic” as used in this article is institutional logic in a general sense, not the multifaceted institutional logics as described by Thornton and Ocasio previously.</p>

<title>Findings: Content of the Expressive Dimension</title>
<p>The content of the expressive dimension and the corresponding institutional logics are presented in the left box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0095399712438371">Figure 1</xref>. The content of the expressive dimension of an NPO refers to <italic>values</italic> the organization builds on, implies, agrees on, practices, or advocates. This study interprets these values as reifications of institutional logics of democracy, family, religion, professions, and the state. They lie in the organizational goal or are embraced by organizational activity, or are implied through the organization’s services. It is worth noting that not all NPOs embody all the identified values in the study. Some NPOs reify only certain values. Religious and political advocacy NPOs tend to pursue values as their explicit goals. Social service NPOs are more likely to advocate for values implied in service provision. This finding does not suggest that all NPOs simultaneously reify all the institutional logics of democracy, family, religion, professions, and the state. Instead, it suggests that the nonprofit sector includes diverse organizations, and some may emphasize certain institutional logics more than others. However, as a whole, the nonprofit sector demonstrates five kinds of institutional logic, as exhibited by the diverse organizational populations.</p>

<title>Democratic Values and the Institutional Logic of Democracy</title>
<p>The first values identified as the content of the expressive dimension are democratic values. Two democratic values emerged from the data: (a) civic participation and (b) equality. These two values are embraced by many NPOs, including political advocacy NPOs, member-serving NPOs, and the church. Chinese NPOs particularly encourage civic participation because NPOs serve as an important channel for the Chinese ethnic population to integrate into and participate in Canadian society. One webpage of a professional member-serving organization (#3) states that “The need for Chinese-Canadians to engage in the social and political landscape has become more pressing than ever, and it is thus important for Chinese-Canadians to actively participate in defining the direction and ensuring the well-being of the country.” After a formal apology from the Canadian government for the Chinese head tax levied on immigrants to Canada from China from 1885 to 1923,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0095399712438371">1</xref></sup> a leader of a political advocacy NPO concluded that this apology “symbolizes a new era of cooperation” and would help the Chinese Canadians to “sit at the Canadian table” and be “accepted as part of the Canadian family.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0095399712438371">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>“Equality” is articulated through an organization’s mission or advocacy activity, including antiracism (#7), equal employment opportunities (#3), and equal treatment from the government toward ethno-specific organizations as compared with “mainstream” organizations (#12). In the data about ethnic minority communities and their organizations, these equality themes are particularly sensitive. This observation of NPOs enacting the institutional logic of democracy is consistent with the proposition deduced from existing literature.</p>

<title>Community-Related Values and the Institutional Logic of Family</title>
<p>The second group of values identified as the content of the expressive dimension are community-related values. Three value sets emerged that are related to the community or the individuals and families in the community: (a) values to maintain, resist, or form a self-perceived Chinese identity, (b) the value of giving back to the community, and (c) family values. This study identifies these <italic>community-related values as symbols and expressions of the institutional logic of family.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399712438371">Friedland and Alford (1991)</xref> explained that the institutional logic of family is “community and the motivation of human activity by unconditional loyalty to its members and their reproductive needs” (p. 248). “Unconditional loyalty” is the source of legitimacy of the institutional logic of family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095399712438371">Thornton, 2004</xref>). It is worth noting that the institutional logic of family also includes community-level actions. This finding reveals that the role of some NPOs is better perceived as between one’s public life and private life, rather than between the state and market. This finding is consistent with the role of voluntary associations defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399712438371">Berger and Neuhaus (2001)</xref>. They argue that voluntary associations, together with neighborhood, family, and church, are the “mediating structures” that negotiate between private life and the large institutions of public life—the “megastructures.”</p>
<sec id="section9-0095399712438371">
<title>Values to maintain, resist, or form a self-perceived Chinese identity</title>
<p>Chinese NPOs in the community act as entities to preserve, redefine, or formulate the Chinese identity for immigrant and Canadian-born Chinese. These Chinese people struggle between multiple Chinese and Canadian identities. They are in a constant search for a less-contested space in which to define the Chinese identity in a Canadian setting. These identity struggles are most salient in Chinese ethnic organizational settings—who are the “real” Chinese, and therefore who deserve to be funded to represent the community? Before the recent arrival of greater waves of mainlander Chinese people to Canada, Hong Kong immigrants had already established many NPOs. They were able to establish themselves by working through the not-unfamiliar social, political, and economic mechanisms in Canadian society, because Hong Kong values and lifestyles are comparatively close to those of Canadians, as both cultures have strong undertones of British influence. Hong Kong Chinese regard themselves as “Chinese” rather than Hong Kong-nese. The Hong Kong NPOs are also advertised as “Chinese,” not “Hong Kong.”</p>
<p>Hong Kong Chinese organizations’ “Chinese” identity began to be challenged by mainland Chinese immigrants since the mainlanders’ recent arrival. Some perceived stereotypes distinguish mainlanders from Hong Kong Chinese. This prevents the two groups from sharing an identity. Mainlander immigrants tend to be perceived as less wealthy or worldly. Mainlanders speak the Chinese official language of Mandarin—“standard Chinese” that is promoted by the Chinese government in the effort to unify numerous dialects in China. Hong Kong Chinese speak Cantonese, which is a regional dialect popular in Hong Kong and Guangdong Province. In mainland China, a person’s ability to speak Mandarin with a favorable accent often stereotypically signals him or her as well educated, and as having a higher social status. In Hong Kong and Guangdong Province, and in certain parts of Canada, speaking Mandarin signals that the individual is from “impoverished” mainland China, is isolated from the West, likely supports Communism, and overall, is someone who is a “barbarian.”</p>
<p>The heterogeneity within the Chinese community challenges Chinese ethno-specific NPOs. These organizations are venues for people to contest and resolve their ambiguous identities. For example, the church (#1) provides its services in three languages: Cantonese, Mandarin, and English. Beyond the language issue, many Hong Kong immigrant-based NPOs are challenged to adapt to the arrival of new mainlanders. A director from organization #16 noted that mainlanders do not share the same passion and community spirit as the older generations:
<disp-quote>
<p>The older generation is from Hong Kong and Taiwan. They speak Cantonese. Now we have the influx of Chinese people from China who speak Mandarin. They do things differently; the heritage changed. The people from China tend to be more educated, but the older generation tends to have deep root of emotion and sentiment . . . That’s a problem posing to your organization—how to adjust to fit in the new generation.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One social service NPO (#11) director describes the service provision challenge:
<disp-quote>
<p>Most of the new Chinese immigrants are from mainland China. So in order to serve this group better, we have to understand them better, and naturally, there is no better way than hiring those who originally are from mainland China, because they speak the language [Mandarin], they share the same culture and everything. But social workers are relatively new in China. So, at least five years ago, there were no, I would say, no formal social worker programs in China. We basically have to train people.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Canadian identity also challenges the Chinese identity. Some people would like to be treated as Chinese, and some prefer to be treated as Canadians. This clash of identity is most relevant to a Chinese-specific organization. One informant described the contradiction between the organization’s mission and his own belief:
<disp-quote>
<p>Our association tries hard to have people to go to the mainstream. But having said that, I know, I must know that, no matter how hard we help, we probably can’t do it culturally. . . even my son, or my grandchildren, they can’t never really integrate into the society because of the looks of ourselves. . . . A third generation Chinese Canadian was really mad on the street, when someone, a Caucasian, said, “Where do you come from?” Ok. He is a third generation [and therefore considers himself Canadian, rather than Chinese].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This informant (#8) explains that he and his organization are looking to be treated as Canadian in terms of language capacity, but treated as Chinese in terms of expertise:
<disp-quote>
<p>One of the things they [a mainstream organization] are missing on their end is they need language support to do translations, . . . so they assumed that because we are a Chinese organization, that we will be able to provide them with that kind of support without understanding that not every Chinese person knows how to speak Chinese. I speak some Cantonese, but I am not literate. . . . They see me as a Chinese person. They don’t see me as a Canadian even if I was born here.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many people involved in Chinese NPOs constantly ask, ”How is a Chinese Canadian supposed to believe and behave?” Chinese NPOs provide venues to contest different identities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0095399712438371">
<title>The value of “giving back to the community</title>
<p>“The second community-related value that reflects the institutional logic of family is the altruistic value of “giving back to the community.” “Giving back to the community” was a frequently quoted proverb by many interviewees. Altruistic values and behavior, such as charitable donation and volunteering, are new concepts to many mainland Chinese immigrants. Although many organizations promote these values, it takes time to socialize the Chinese population to acquire a Western concept of volunteering, given the absence of voluntarism in Chinese culture.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0095399712438371">
<title>Family values</title>
<p>The last of the community-related values are family values. These values inspire Chinese NPOs to support Chinese families in the community through various services, which address issues such as seniors’ needs, marital issues, mental health, employment, and child-related issues. The pastor of the Chinese church often deals with marital issues and senior citizen issues in the community. Political advocacy organizations work on Chinese seniors’ old age pension issues and provide free bus rides for seniors.</p>

<sec id="section12-0095399712438371">
<title>Religious Beliefs and Institutional Logic of Religion</title>
<p>The third value comprising the expressive dimension is religious belief. The institutional logic of “contemporary Christian religions attempt to convert all issues into expression of absolute moral principles accepted voluntarily on faith and grounded in a particular cosmogony” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399712438371">Friedland &amp; Alford, 1991</xref>, p. 249). The Chinese pastor also believes that the practice of faith should infiltrate everyday activities:
<disp-quote>
<p>Expressing your faith means that, in your life, for example, you do your job. If you are a student, to you, your duty is being a student. Or if you are a housewife, or any occupation, [faith] means you do everything with your heart . . . You should try your best, within your own capacity, be a good teacher, a good employee, and a good parent.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To many mainland Chinese, practicing faith is generally a new experience. China discouraged religion since 1949. Unlike well-established Canadian churches, Chinese churches’ activities have a lot of emphasis on joining the church, exploring and questioning the details of religious beliefs, and participating in coaching-like activities (field observations). Chinese churches often carry out services while assuming that participants are not fervent believers. Chinese immigrants struggle among multiple institutional logics of religion through interactions with the Chinese church, which can be antecedents of adopting a new institutional logic of religion.</p>

<title>Professional Values and Institutional Logic of Professions</title>
<p>The fourth group of values identified as the content of the expressive dimension are professional values. The health service organization (#12) emphasizes multiple professional values, including holistic health disease prevention approaches, community process-based healing, cultural competence, and non-stigmatizing approaches to serving people with mental illness. The director regards “being culturally competent” as an important professional quality:
<disp-quote>
<p>What we see is that we have to be very careful that being a Chinese, being an agency that has that language and ethnic staff, this doesn’t necessarily mean that you would necessarily do well in serving your clients. I think we would have to act as professionals, be aware of our own values, and our own biases, in how we look at people, and in how we look at the system and how we look at the society.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095399712438371">Thornton (2004)</xref>, professional nonprofit associations and “members in guilds” are major manifestations of the institutional logic of professions (pp. 44-45). The institutional logic of professions is based on personal expertise. People in a professional relational network exercise this logic. Professional associations provide authority to all members in guilds to promote quality and innovation. Besides nonprofit professional associations, the analysis also shows that service NPOs also practice the institutional logic of professions by providing professional services and implementing professional best practices.</p>

<title>Adopted Values From the State and Institutional Logic of the State</title>
<p>The fifth and final group of values comprising the expressive dimension are values adopted from the state. This is the only “adapted institutional logic” theme that emerged in the content of the expressive dimension. For example, multiple NPOs, including political advocacy organizations and social service organizations, claim that the priority groups for services should be youth, women, and seniors (e.g., #7, #8, #9), which are consistent with the priority groups of government policy. Sometimes, NPOs have to adopt values and ideas from the government because the government makes funding decisions based on compliance with these values. The study contains an extreme example about how NPOs adopt the institutional logic of the state. In the 1990s, the Canadian government shifted funding preferences from ethno-specific organizations to “diversified” or mainstream organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095399712438371">Kobayashi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399712438371">Miller, 1998</xref>). This funding preference shift resulted in many Chinese NPOs removing their “Chinese” identity, as did organization #15:
<disp-quote>
<p>As I said, we are forced to change . . . I think the most powerful and force of all the organizational change is the funder . . . First of all, our board is a totally Chinese board. I mean from top to bottom. . . . The board needs to be changed. . . . Money is another issue. You have to have the money to do non-Chinese programs, and where will the money come from? You have to apply for funding. And then ourselves, with the existing staff, it’s not easy for us to do such kind of proposal for other ethnic groups. So without money, we cannot change, and then for service users, without such a program, you can’t invite them to come in. . . . So I ask myself, is the Chinese agency really changed to a new non-Chinese agency? It’s not easy at all.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this case, the Chinese identity and the community value of these NPOs, enactments of the institutional logic of family, are gradually replaced by the institutional logic of the state, specifically the state’s value about ethno-specific organizations. NPOs are forced to choose the state’s logic over their own logic due to the need to obtain resources from the state to survive.</p>

<title>Findings: Content of the Instrumental Dimension and the Adapted Institutional Logics</title>

<sec id="section16-0095399712438371">
<title>Fulfilling Community Needs: Adapting to the Logics of the State and Capitalism</title>
<p>The first instrumental role NPOs play is to fulfill community needs. NPOs in this study provide a wide range of programs to meet community needs, such as training, senior services, youth engagement, immigrant settlement services, and legal services. Some NPOs provide services specifically needed by the Chinese community, such as immigrant services. Organization #6 helps seniors who are culturally and linguistically challenged.</p>
<p>NPOs exercise the institutional logic of family through community services; however, contemporary NPOs often have to adapt to the institutional logic of the state to gain the financial resources necessary for providing services to the community. Government appears to play an important role in NPOs’ provision of community services, mostly through a financial relationship. This perhaps is a unique feature of contemporary NPOs, which often are partners of the government. In this study, interviewees from service organizations consistently reported that the primary funding source is from public funders. When public funding is the major source of an organization’s revenue and most organizational activities rely on the sustainability of this funding, the role of government in the service provision can be vital. An experienced manager of a social service NPO who is also the past chair of NPO #11 noted that “the reality is whatever you do, you still have to make sure you still survive, to be very honest. So my first priority is to basically make sure whatever funding we get we have to retain these funding.”</p>
<p>Gaining government funding is not easy. The President of organization #14 summarized the funding challenge into three factors:
<disp-quote>
<p>(1) . . . the difficulty of getting funding is a challenge, because it’s very difficult for an agency to tap into new funding . . . if a funder like an “old boy phenomenon.” . . . So some funding, the old boys dominate the funding decision. So we come in, it is very, very difficult to tap into it. . . . (2) The other challenge, I am going to get funding, is the time, and resources that we need to acquire to apply those funding, because some funders made the application process very difficult . . . (3) The third one is the funder’s structure. We like to see that more funders are to consider to give, let’s say multi-million funding. The majority of the funding is pretty much program based, or project based. That’s to say, the three years, or whatever project is finished, after that, then the funding ends.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lack of sufficient funding is indeed common among NPOs and jeopardizes nonprofit autonomy. Almost all service organizations specified a lack of sustainable funding as the number one challenge. One formally incorporated organization (#11) has no funding or paid staff and is solely volunteer based. The cultural organization (#16) only has three full-time staff and is operating more than ten different kinds of programs. Lack of self-sustainability and the difficulty of gaining government funding situate NPOs in a vulnerable position, and in turn, situate the government funders in a powerful position. Qualifications for government funds often include liability insurance, a sound funding history, and a certain level of organizational infrastructure. These requirements eliminate from funding eligibility those NPOs with weak capacity.</p>
<p>Organizations often need to provide proof to convince the public funders the funding will be properly spent. The chair of organization #11 explained that “we have to convince them that we are worthwhile funded.” The organization must demonstrate “a positive impact in the community.” Annual budget proposals are a requirement. Organization #6 shared that a successful path to gaining financial support is to find some seed money, do a pilot project, and show the government funder that the project is proven to work: “and then the government will be willing to fund and provide a core funding for us.” The Executive Director emphasized that the key to gaining government support is to demonstrate community needs to the government, because “the government has to see the need.”</p>
<p>Application, monitoring, and reporting processes inevitably influence NPOs’ organizational dynamics. Funded NPOs have to remain subject to public accountability. More importantly, NPOs often need to redefine their services and restructure their programs to align only with the needs that are defined and proven by the government funders. To fulfill the community needs, the NPO institutional logic of family has to adapt to the institutional logic of the state. Although the institutional logic of family emphasizes individuals, family, and community welfare, the institutional logic of the state emphasizes public accountability and the general public interests that are beyond any single community.</p>
<p>Besides adapting to the institutional logic of the state, to gain resources and support, some NPOs need to adapt to the institutional logic of capitalism. When providing services to meet community needs, NPOs also have to adapt to the nonprofit “market.” Providing the services that are needed by the community and adapting to changing community needs add one more kind of institutional logic to NPOs: the institutional logic of capitalism. Nonprofit services have to be needed to be funded and capable of retaining users. The program director of organization #11 noted the “challenge is about keeping up with what’s going on”:
<disp-quote>
<p>We have to be active in the community to know what’s happening, who are the population, what are the needs, what are the challenges and issues that are coming up. As long as we stay involved, and engaged that we can decide how we want to respond.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Talking about a successful experience, the past chair of organization #11 said,
<disp-quote>
<p>You have to know the community needs, and you have to adapt to the changing needs. Twenty years ago, we serve mainly Southeast Asian immigrants, but the immigrant pattern has changed. We have to adapt to the new people . . . focus more on counseling.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this study, many NPOs conduct marketing and advertising activities to promote their services. To understand more fully their clients’ needs, some NPOs conduct outreach for clients and formal needs assessments. Sometimes, NPOs get involved in competition with other NPOs that provide similar services. The director of a political advocacy organization (#8) describes the competition among service organizations as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>There is some tension with perspective of who gets what in a piece of pie. Agencies don’t only fight over funding, they also fight over clients. For example, in the downtown area, where my office is located, there are probably four, five, six agencies and, while some of them are Chinese specific and some of them are not Chinese specific, they do serve the Chinese community. They also are fighting over clients, because the demographics here have changed. They are not necessarily getting the same kind of needs as they used to.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To fulfill community needs and realize the logic of family, many NPOs need to adapt to the institutional logic of the state and capitalism to gain resources, maintain legitimacy, and retain service users. The director of a social service agency (#15) described NPOs’ businesslike and charity-like behavior: “It’s kind of strange relationship. It’s not like in the business world. They compete, right? We compete and we also collaborate.” The program director from a health agency (#12) worries that the competitive behavior is overpowering the goal of serving the community, or the institutional logic of capitalism is overriding the institutional logic of family:
<disp-quote>
<p>[The challenge is] How do you really get people to look at not working in silo. I think the system is very much that, organizations, looking at doing their own things, and maybe expanding their own programs, but really how we collaborate about each other, and that we are not really looking at organizations’ self interest. When we are looking at providing services, we really should question ourselves what benefits the community, not what benefits the organization.</p>

<title>Fulfilling Members’ Needs: Adapting to the Institutional Logic of Capitalism</title>
<p>The second instrumental role identified in this study is that of the “collective benefits” provider, a role wherein NPOs meet needs that can only be met in a group setting. Typical collective benefits are networking opportunities, information-exchange activities, and social activities. Member-serving NPOs in this study mainly exercise the institutional logic of professions. Because individuals have to join a group to pursue these benefits, these collective benefits also become major incentives to attract members. For example, a professional organization (#3) did not have the goal of providing social networking opportunities, but later realized the importance of networking, and introduced “a lot of components for networking,” including social and recreational activities. A professional association (#4) created a “default list,” providing information about “companies or individuals who have allegedly defaulted in their payment for goods or services that the organization’s members rendered to them.” The association members benefit from this list by gaining credit information to facilitate their business decision making. Professional associations give business advice, give advice about norms, exude professional values, and maintain a business network.</p>
<p>Member-serving NPOs also host parties during Chinese holidays and provide entertainment activities. Therefore, they also occasionally embrace the <italic>institutional logic of family.</italic> For example, the founding reason for the business association (#5) is to support self-help business initiatives. In the early years, when many immigrants could not find jobs, they came together to build this association to help start-up businesses and become self-employed.</p>
<p>Member-serving NPOs not only embody the institutional logic of professions and family but also appear to adapt to the institutional logic of capitalism. These organizations demonstrate characteristics of private businesses to attract new members, retain current members, and attract business sponsors. If members are not satisfied with the services, the organization will lose members, volunteers, and membership fees. Eventually, this threatens the organization’s survival. The President of a professional organization (#3) talked about how the organization identifies a market niche:

<p>You have to know your uniqueness, at the same time, know you competitors. Then, you can’t be, at the same time, you can’t be everything for everyone. So we decided, we will basically promote ourselves as the unique powerful network of working Chinese professionals. So we provide them a media for people to meet and mingle to network, business connections, things like that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She also explained that the meaning of “improving marketing” in the organization’s strategic direction statement is to attract more members, sponsors, and volunteers: “we are being perceived as a unique network of Chinese professionals.”</p>
<p>Sometimes, NPOs can be strategic or even political to gain more resources and support, reflecting an approach that can be very pragmatic and businesslike. For example, inviting famous people to organizational events is one commonly used strategy:
<disp-quote>
<p>By having . . . the Senator in presence providing a huge ongoing marketing, promotion benefit for us. The impact does not end at the end of the gala, because we still have this relationship . . . It’s about having, as simple as marketing. A year from now . . . we can still show and tell others that we had this event, when we were able to have the Senator.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, business sponsorship often does not come for free. Sponsorship resembles a business transactional relationship. The sponsor expects something from the organization (#4): “it all depends on what . . . benefit they can get from the sponsorship. I think if they cannot get the same benefit as the cost they give out, they won’t continue to be the sponsors.”</p>
<p>Member-serving NPOs are mostly independent from the government. Unlike public service NPOs, member-serving NPOs enjoy significant autonomy. As a trade-off, they rely more heavily on private individuals and sponsors, and public funding is largely inaccessible. Consequentially, because the nonprofit member market provides the human and financial resources that are critical to the organization, member-serving organizations need to adapt to the institutional logic of capitalism as well.</p>

<title>Fulfilling NPOs’ Survival Needs: Adapting to the Logics of the State and Capitalism</title>
<p>The third instrumental need that NPOs fulfill is the organization’s own need for survival and growth. This need provides the essential foundation for NPOs to carry out other activities. If the organization cannot fulfill its own need for survival and sustain minimal resources for daily operation, fulfilling either community or members’ needs become impossible. NPOs have to adapt to the institutional logics of the state and capitalism to secure necessary resources for themselves. This theme confirms the previous discussion on adapted institutional logics of NPOs and, most importantly, provides the foundation for all adapted origin themes in NPOs.</p>
<p>Four kinds of needs that are instrumental to NPOs’ survival and growth are identified from the data: human resources, material resources, organizational technology, and environmental support. Human resources include staff, volunteers, board members, and members in member-serving NPOs. To hire staff, organizations need a certain degree of financial sustainability. Material resources available to NPOs include government funding, service fees, business sponsorship, and individual donations. Organizational technology refers to how organizations transform organizational input into the final output, including not only machinery or computer technologies but also work processes, coordination arrangements, and management skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095399712438371">Perrow, 1986</xref>). Chinese NPOs in particular need to learn new skills to succeed in a Canadian context, such as applying for government funding in English and adopting Western management skills and professional norms. Environmental support refers to the relationship between the NPO and the community, such as reputation and establishment of networks that can potentially provide volunteers, donations, and clients. In general, although community support and membership (institutional logic of family) provide most nonmaterial resources—including social networks, members, and volunteers—the government and market provide the most financial support to NPOs. Financial revenues include fees for services, government funding, and private donations. NPOs are subjected to the institutional logics of the state and capitalism when acquiring resources either from the government or the market.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Implications</title>
<p>This study applies the concept of institutional logic to offer a greater understanding of the characteristics of NPOs. The study accomplishes this goal by using the concept of institutional logic to interpret the expressive and instrumental dimensions of NPOs and by connecting with the societal-level institutions that prompt NPOs to internalize these characteristics. The NPO sector, as a whole, enacts at least four institutional logics via different types of NPOs: the institutional logics of democracy, family, religion, and professions. Except for the institutional logic of democracy, the institutional logics are not explicitly noted by existing literature. It may not be surprising that certain NPOs enact the institutional logic of family, religion, and professions. However, existing nonprofit theories neglect these, because these theories have been overreliant on theories of the state and the market, including various economic and political theories of NPOs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095399712438371">Douglas, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095399712438371">Weisbrod, 1975</xref>). Insufficient attention has been paid to the nonprofit sector itself, which emphasizes caring, personal care, religious beliefs, and professionalism.</p>
<p>These new-found institutional logics have two implications. First, NPOs may resist “reform pressures” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0095399712438371">Light, 2000</xref>) originating from the public or the private sectors, because the institutional logic of the state and capitalism may conflict with the four nonprofit logics. If these reforms are implemented, NPOs may lose the very uniqueness that makes them nonprofit. For example, institutional logic that emphasizes formalizing and professionalizing NPOs may conflict with the institutional logic of family, which promotes the provision of care that is personal, casual, family like, needs based, and provided on a case-by-case basis. Emphasizing private sector-style efficiency may also conflict with the institutional logic of democracy and family because efficiency may be associated with reduced time spent on individual cases and reduced equality. Nonprofit scholars need to be aware that reform measures—even if they work well in other sectors—may not work in the nonprofit sector. Such measures may even cause detriment to the sector, because the nonprofit sector enacts different institutional logics.</p>
<p>However, the adapted institutional logic theme also suggests that some NPOs are capable of becoming businesslike or government like if they need to rely on the government and market for resources. This phenomenon challenges our current study: How can NPOs integrate competing institutional logics? An NPO may embrace the logic of family that promotes a personal, casual, family-like culture, while the same organization may need to integrate various government requirements to become more formal, professional, and even bureaucratic. What are the consequences of such competing logics? How can an organization balance these tensions? More importantly, will the adapted state logic harm or replace the family logic?</p>
<p>Second, a relatively comprehensive account of the spectrum of nonprofit institutional logics makes clear the diversity of the nonprofit sector. The adapted origin theory reveals that multiple institutional logics can be embodied and practiced by different types of NPOs within a nonprofit sector. This confirms prior speculation that studying NPOs with one disciplinary view (such as economics or political science) that often emphasizes a single particular institutional logic is insufficient. The nonprofit sector is multidimensional, and pursuing one single best nonprofit theory to account for all organizations within the nonprofit sector may not be realistic. Although previous scholars have written extensively on commercialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095399712438371">Weisbrod, 1998</xref>) or professionalization of NPOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399712438371">Frumkin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0095399712438371">Salamon, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399712438371">2003</xref>), these insights must not be confined to mere factual accounts, but must be integrated into efforts to build nonprofit theory. Approaches that acknowledge the diversity of NPOs and the complexity of the nonprofit sector are promising. One example is to study NPOs as “hybrids” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095399712438371">Billis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095399712438371">DiMaggio, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399712438371">Evers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399712438371">Evers &amp; Laville, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095399712438371">Gumport &amp; Snydman, 2006</xref>). Research inquiries could be as follows: How does one nonprofit juggle multiple institutional logics, logics which can at times be in conflict with one-another? What managerial strategy can allow hybrids to balance multiple logics? As a nonprofit sector, how can we generalize the characteristics of NPOs while acknowledging that, depending on the type of NPOs, they may operate on very different institutional logics? Some existing literature may also enrich our nonprofit theory-building efforts, such as social enterprise, corporate social responsibility, and social economy literature. These streams of literature study organizations without a sectoral boundary and specifically examine the integration of multiple, perhaps conflicting, institutional logics within one organization. A prominent area of focus for this literature is profit-making logic versus social charitable logic. Literature on competing institutional logics may also be of help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095399712438371">Kraatz &amp; Block, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0095399712438371">Thornton &amp; Ocasio, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The other major finding of this study is expressed in the adapted institutional logic theme. Although the existing nonprofit literature seems to focus on the public-side (i.e., democratic role, government–nonprofit relationship) and the private market-side of nonprofits (i.e., nonprofit marketing, fund-raising, fulfilling unmet needs), this study shows that the institutional logics of the state and capitalism are not innate to NPOs, but are adapted as an external logics. It is surprising that existing nonprofit literature neglected the family, religion, and professional logics, which are internal to NPOs. Scholars’ backgrounds and the underlying three-sector assumption may contribute to this consequence. However, it also suggests that NPOs’ resource-based relationship with the public sector (i.e., contracting and public grants) and their fundraising capacity in the market may be more important. The adapted institutional logic theme confirms the one unique weakness of the average NPOs: a lack of self-financial sustaining capacity. Only by relying on a government funder or the market can NPOs gather sufficient resources to carry out programs.</p>
<p>This thesis is supported by previous research. Statistics show that, in Canada, 39% of NPO revenue is from governmental sources. Forty-eight percent of the revenue is earned in the “nonprofit market,” including member fees, fees for service, and earnings from endowments. Only 12% is from donations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399712438371">Hall, Barr, Easwaramoorthy, Sokolowski, &amp; Salamon, 2005</xref>). According to Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Civil Society Studies, the American nonprofit revenue pattern closely resembles this, with 30.5% of revenue from the government, 56.6% of revenue earned in the market, and only 12.9% from donations. On average, for all surveyed developed countries, the market-earned income and government funding comprise the largest source of revenue for NPOs (about 40%-50%) and donations only provide the smallest portion of revenue (7.2%). The same pattern holds for developing countries or the aggregation of developed and developing countries.</p>
<p>The adapted institutional logic of NPOs can be seen as one consequence of competing logics. If an NPO cannot be sustained through donations, its innate institutional logics are at risk of being compromised by external institutional logics. This insight implies that NPOs may be at a disadvantage in their interactions with the state and market, due to a lack of internal financial capacity. This should serve as a reminder to researchers who advocate the transfer of technology invented in other sectors to the nonprofit sector (e.g., New Public Management) that they risk overpowering NPOs with the institutional logic of the state or capitalism, thus crowding out the uniqueness of NPOs—the institutional logics of democracy, family, professions, and religion.</p>
<p>Finally, this study also refines the concepts of the instrumental and expressive dimensions of NPOs. It suggests that the common values of the expressive dimension include democratic values (civic participation and equality), community-related values (individual identity, altruistic community values, and family values), religious beliefs, and professional values. On the instrumental dimension side, the common instrumental roles of NPOs include fulfilling community needs, members’ needs, and organizations’ own survival needs. Identifying the content of the instrumental and expressive dimension provides a clearer picture of these two nonprofit dimensions. This can be helpful for future research adopting these two dimensions as theoretical tools.</p>
