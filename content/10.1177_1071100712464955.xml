<sec id="section1-1071100712464955">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Although antituberculosis medication is the first step in the management of skeletal tuberculosis (TB), surgical debridement, biopsy, synovectomy, or arthrodesis may be needed for the definitive diagnosis and treatment of the symptomatic ankle.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1071100712464955">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Twenty-nine patients with TB around the ankle joint were enrolled during a 23-year period and followed for 73.1 months (range, 30-260 months) after TB was controlled. Among 61 surgical procedures performed in 29 patients, complete resolution of ankle TB was seen in 28 patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1071100712464955">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>According to Martini and Ouahes classification, radiographic findings of localized osteoporosis were stage I in 4 patients, one or more erosions were stage II in 9 patients, destruction of the whole joint was stage III in 8 patients, and anatomic disorganization and subluxation were stage IV in 8 patients. Functional results were excellent in 6 patients and good in 16 patients, but with talar bone collapse or hindfoot malalignment, a fair result was noted in 6 patients. The diagnostic accuracy rates were 28.5% with aspiration of synovial fluid, 66.7% in histological analysis, and 44.4% in bacteriological analysis. Mixed infection with bacterial flora was noted in 8 patients (27.6%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1071100712464955">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Ankle TB is easily misdiagnosed and may ultimately involve the peritalar neighboring joints with talar height loss or hindfoot deformity. Successful treatment depends on the extent of disease at presentation, accurate staging, duration of adequate chemotherapy, and optimal surgical intervention.</p>

<body>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (TB) infection is a major health problem in some countries in Asia. Vertebral lesions are the most common form of skeletal TB, comprising nearly 50% of cases. Involvement of the peripheral joints is relatively rare and has nonspecific clinical manifestations with a chronic and indolent course, leading to diagnostic and therapeutic delay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712464955">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712464955">15</xref></sup> Patients may initially receive an antibiotic regimen for TB due to misdiagnosis or because TB is combined with pyogenic arthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712464955">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712464955">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712464955">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712464955">12</xref></sup> TB of the ankle joint, accounting for only 1% to 6.9% of osteoarthritic cases, is defined as a bony focus that spreads and involves the interconnected spaces of the peritalar joint. In the early stages of synovitis and when the disease is limited to bones, medical treatment achieves excellent healing with few sequelae.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712464955">6</xref></sup> As the disease progresses, granulomas of the bone involve the connected surfaces of the peritalar joint, leading to erosion of articular cartilage, draining sinuses, painful ankylosis, and residual deformity of the ankle–foot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712464955">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712464955">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712464955">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712464955">15</xref></sup> Secondary pyogenic infection may superimpose itself and complicate the clinical picture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712464955">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ankle TB is seldom discussed in the literature compared with TB of the hip or knee joint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712464955">9</xref></sup> A lack of detailed description of the involved peritalar joints limits clinicians’ awareness of this disease entity. Antituberculosis medication can obtain positive clinical outcomes in patients with ankle TB, whereas a combination of synovial biopsy, joint debridement surgery, and even arthrodesis has been used in cases of advanced involvement and for the differential diagnosis with degenerative, pyogenic, traumatic, or inflammatory diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712464955">5</xref></sup> It is essential to have an accurate diagnosis and prompt management to restore functional activity and avoid a deformed ankle–foot. Therefore, the purpose of this retrospective study was to survey (1) radiological staging for assessment of joint destruction, (2) pathological confirmation using histological findings of granulomatous lesions with caseous necrosis and Langhans giant cells in a tubercle and/or mycobacterial culture on bone or synovial specimens, (3) medical treatment and surgical considerations in disease progression and for prevention of fixed ankle deformity, and (4) functional outcomes in long-term follow-up of patients with ankle TB. We hypothesized that the degree of bone and joint involvement, the extent of pathological confirmation, and various management strategies were critical for the outcome of ankle TB.</p>
<sec id="section6-1071100712464955" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>From March 1984 to December 2007, a total of 10 983 cases of TB (including 562 cases of osteoarthritic TB) were reported by our institution. During the study period, 29 patients with ankle TB were identified and followed for at least 2 years (range, 30-260 months; mean, 73.1 months) after infection control. This group accounted for 0.26% of all patients with TB and 5.2% of cases of osteoarthritic TB. A complete chart review was performed in all the ankle TB cases as well as an extended follow-up until the end point of either freedom from symptoms or deformity correction, although 1 patient was lost to follow-up and 1 died of causes unrelated to TB treatment. Among the 29 patients, 9 had active pulmonary TB, 4 healed, and 2 had generalized dissemination. Data on the patients’ underlying diseases, clinical findings, duration of symptoms, sinus formation, white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, radiographic staging, pathological confirmation, medical/surgical intervention, and Teeny and Wiss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712464955">18</xref></sup> ankle–hindfoot rating scale were analyzed.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of ankle TB was based on clinical examination, radiographic findings, and representative tissue obtained for histopathological and microbiological analyses. Diagnostic delay was possibly attributed to the need to differentiate from other joint diseases, inaccurate treatment, and the fact that ankle TB was easily misdiagnosed and endemic but less progressively in our country. Diagnosis was delayed an average of 3.6 months (range, 2-6 months) after initial clinical presentation.</p>
<sec id="section7-1071100712464955">
<title>Radiological Evaluation</title>
<p>Tuberculosis osteoarthritis usually developed from hematogenous dissemination through the subsynovial vessels or indirectly from epiphyseal or metaphyseal lesions with erosion into the joint space. Patients with ankle TB had radiographic features of soft tissue swelling, joint effusion, paraosseous mass, cortical demineralization, and subchondral lytic lesion with little formation of new bone. Subsequently, cartilage damage led to joint space narrowing and substantial bone loss and ultimately involved the neighboring joints with talar bone collapse and ankle–foot deformity. Four stages of TB arthritis were proposed by Martini and Ouahes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712464955">12</xref></sup> and refined as follows. Stage I included infection of the synovial lining with little bony erosion or localized osteoporosis. Stage II had marked erosions or areas of frank TB osteomyelitis, yet the joint space continued to be maintained. Stage III included more synovial and osseous involvement with a loss of joint space. Stage IV entailed involvement of more than 1 peritalar joint surface or concomitant pyogenic arthritis with substantial disorganization of osseous architecture. The radiographic findings were stage I in 4 patients, stage II in 9 patients, stage III in 8 patients, and stage IV in 8 patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1071100712464955">
<title>Pathological Confirmation</title>
<p>For diagnostic confirmation in each patient, aspiration of synovial fluid or open biopsy of bone or synovial specimens was performed for acid-fast bacilli staining, histological evaluation, and microbiologically proven study. Specimens from discharging sinuses were cultured for acid-fast bacilli and pyogenic microorganisms. According to Watts and Lifeso,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712464955">17</xref></sup> the diagnosis of tuberculosis can be definitively confirmed by the histological findings of caseous necrosis, epithelioid tubercle, lymphocytes and Langhans giant cells, and/or positive mycobacterial culture on bone or synovial specimens. In our patients, ankle TB was categorized as a definitive case if culture of the excised specimen grew <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. A case with a negative culture and concurrent histopathological analysis suggesting TB and microbiologically proven TB involving any other site was also categorized as definitive ankle TB. Otherwise, it was categorized as a probable case when the histopathological analysis showed granulomatous inflammation with caseous necrosis or as a possible case when the histopathological analysis showed granulomatous inflammation alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712464955">4</xref></sup> Some patients with a history of lung TB but negative histopathological analysis or cultures were categorized as questionable cases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1071100712464955">
<title>Medical Treatment and Surgical Consideration</title>
<p>In the view of medical treatment, all patients began antituberculosis treatment once the diagnosis was made. The recommendation for treatment in adults with ankle TB was 5 mg/kg of isoniazid per day, 10-15 mg/kg of rifampin per day, and 20 to 30 mg/kg of pyrazinamide per day (discontinued after 2 months).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712464955">3</xref></sup> Ethambutol was included in the initial regimen until the results of drug susceptibility studies revealed there was no known drug-resistant TB. Surgical intervention was considered in patients with no definitive diagnosis or delayed treatment. First, drainage, synovectomy via arthrotomy, and joint space preservation with an external distraction apparatus were performed when there appeared to be any evidence of a soft tissue abscess. Second, radical debridement of the avascular lesion and juxtaposition of the viable cancellous bone were performed for arthrodesis due to the loss of normal osseous architecture in the later stage.</p>
<p>In our study, treatment strategies were based on radiological staging. Patients in stage I could be treated with medical therapy alone. In stage II, joint debridement surgery with joint preservation was considered when the diagnosis was not confirmed. In stage III, radical synovectomy, debridement, and possible fusion of the involved joints were necessitated. With stage IV, peritalar joint arthrodesis was recommended due to the loss of joint space and osseous architecture subsequent to talar bone collapse (more than 20% loss of height) or rocker-bottom deformity.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The patients were 21 males and 8 females with an average age of 57 years (range, 9-90 years) at presentation. Underlying diseases were noted in 17 patients (rate, 58.6%), including 11 active lung TB, 7 renal insufficiency, 5 gout, 4 liver disease, 4 malignancy, 4 diabetes, 2 rheumatoid arthritis, 2 upper gastrointestinal bleeding, 1 cardiovascular attack, 1 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 1 atrial fibrillation. Symptom duration ranged from 1 to 48 months. All patients had pain, 15 had a discharging sinus, 5 had mild fever, and 8 had a trauma history. White blood cell count averaged 8400/mm<sup>3</sup> (range, 3500-14 000/mm<sup>3</sup>), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate averaged 57.4 mm/h (range, 8-140 mm/h), and C-reactive protein greater than 5 mg/dL was noted in 18 patients.

<title>Diagnosis</title>
<p>Evidence of definitive TB infection was found in 18 patients, granulomatous lesion with caseous necrosis in 5, granulomatous inflammation alone in 4, and a history of pulmonary TB in 2. For the purpose of diagnostic confirmation, aspiration of synovial fluid was obtained in 21 patients, with positive acid-fast bacillus staining/culture found in 6 patients or 28.5%. Twenty-seven excised synovial tissues or bone biopsies were examined histopathologically and cultured. Among them, 18 specimens revealed epithelioid lymphocytes and Langhans giant cells (rate, 66.7%), 13 cases of acid-fast bacilli were detected using Ziehl-Neelsen staining (rate, 48.1%), and 12 specimens grew <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (rate, 44.4%). Two questionable cases were treated based on the disseminated TB history and aspiration result. A positive bacterial culture was obtained from the sinus tract or joint fluid in 8 of 29 patients (rate, 27.6%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1071100712464955">
<title>Treatment</title>
<p>Antituberculosis treatments were prescribed for 6 to 9 months in 7 patients (1 failed due to reactivation of <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> subsequent to all drug resistance and resolved following ankle arthrodesis) and for 9 to 12 months in the other 22 patients. The mean follow-up period after the end of antituberculosis treatment averaged 73.1 months (range, 30-260 months) with resolution of ankle TB.</p>
<p>Surgical treatment consisted of 61 procedures used in 29 patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1071100712464955">Table 2</xref>). Joint debridement surgery with synovectomy was performed when aspiration failed in stage II, whereas radical debridement and arthrodesis had to be performed due to loss of bone and joint architecture in the later stages. Progression of disease was found in 9 patients (rate, 31%) during the course of treatment. Among them, 2 patients (1 patient at stage I and the other at stage II) were shifted to synovectomy after initial aspiration, 1 patient (initially stage I progressing to stage III) was shifted to arthrodesis after initial incision and debridement, and 6 patients were shifted to arthrodesis following synovectomy (1 at stage II, 4 at stage III, and 1 at stage IV).</p>

<p>Nineteen arthrodesis procedures were performed based on the extent of peritalar joint involvement and disease progression; these included 11 tibiotalar joints, 3 subtalar joints, 1 talonavicular joint, and 4 procedures with more than 2 joints involved at the peritalar area. Unfortunately, talar bone collapse with flatfoot or rocker-bottom deformity was found in 6 patients, including 3 stage III and 3 stage IV cases, even though the ankle TB was under control.

<title>Functional Outcomes</title>
<p>Clinical outcome was evaluated using the rating scale of Teeny and Wiss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712464955">18</xref></sup> Six patients had excellent outcomes with more than 92 points, 16 had good outcomes with 87 to 92 points, 4 had fair outcomes with 65 to 86 points, and 2 had poor outcomes with fewer than 65 points. We defined excellent or good results as a satisfactory outcome and fair or poor results as an unsatisfactory outcome. Twenty-two of 28 patients (1 deceased) achieved a satisfactory outcome (rate, 78.6%). Complications included talar bone collapse with flatfoot or rocker-bottom foot in 6 patients. Mixed infection with bacteria flora was under control in 8 patients, and ankle TB relapsed and subsided following arthrodesis in 1 patient.</p>
<p>The results were much better in the earlier stages of ankle TB prior to extensive joint destruction and bone loss. However, the ankle is a weight-bearing and multicompartmental joint that communicates with the subtalar and intertarsal joints. Microorganisms sometimes spread from a granulomatous focus adjacent to a joint and induce disease progression if not cured sooner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712464955">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712464955">10</xref></sup> All 28 patients had complete resolution of infection; however, 6 patients subsequently had a talar height decrease greater than 20% or subtalar joint angle loss, which led to hindfoot malalignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712464955">Figure 2</xref>) at final follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712464955">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Skeletal TB generally is a result of hematogenous dissemination secondary to infection in the lung, whereas only one-third to a half of patients have a history of active pulmonary disease. Monoarticular involvement occurs in 80% to 90% of bone and joint TB cases and presents with nonspecific pain, heat, and swelling, with or without a discharging sinus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712464955">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712464955">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712464955">9</xref></sup> Systemic symptoms of fever, lethargy, weakness, and weight loss occur less often. Phemister’s triad<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712464955">19</xref></sup> of periarticular osteoporosis, marginal erosions not affecting a more central lesion, and narrowing of the joint space describes the radiographic characteristics that aid in detecting osteoarthritic TB. Magnetic resonance imaging nonspecifically reveals effusion, periarticular osteoporosis, bone lysis with periostitis, and gross thickening of the synovial membrane. A high degree of radiological suspicion of ankle TB is required when the margin of the articular surface is hazy and ill-defined, but in ankle TB, the joint space is preserved longer and lysis of the cartilage is slower than in pyogenic arthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712464955">1</xref></sup> Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in addition to nucleic acid probes using antibodies against <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, has a higher sensitivity in facilitating therapeutic decisions for patients with suspected extrapulmonary TB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712464955">13</xref></sup> PCR combined with pathological results may increase the sensitivity of the early diagnosis of pleural TB if the acid-fast stain is negative.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712464955">11</xref></sup> PCR is gradually being introduced but was not widely available during the early period of our study. Because of a lack of significant recognition and various rates of accuracy in the diagnosis of ankle TB, prompt management is easily missed, especially without multidisciplinary specialists or in countries in which TB is not endemic.</p>
<p>A prolonged course of antituberculosis medication is the first step in management to cure and stabilize ankle TB. Operation is an adjunct to appropriate chemotherapy, joint space preservation, and hindfoot alignment. If joint surgery is performed, distraction applied to maintain the ankle joint space must be carefully monitored to avoid hindfoot malalignment. In our series, tibial–talocalcaneal joint space preservation with a distraction apparatus was performed if there was clinical suspicion of ankle TB or if a poor response to medication was anticipated. However, complete resolution of the peritalar joint space infection might be difficult, so further arthrodesis of 1 or 2 joints was recommended to maintain hindfoot alignment and achieve a better outcome, especially if there was disease stage progression. The traditional course of medication includes the use of 3 or 4 agents simultaneously during a 6- to 12-month period; short-course regimens (6-9 months) may not be applicable for skeletal TB, especially for those patients with cartilage erosion, disease progression, and drug resistance. However, with the above management, 6 patients in our group still had restricted ankle motion, talar bone destruction, and loss of the subtalar joint angle, which led to a flatfoot or rocker-bottom deformity due to hindfoot malalignment. Our current practice now begins with a 4-drug regimen for 2 months, and then pyrazinamide is discontinued and followed by a 3-drug regimen for 10 months.</p>
<p>In countries where skeletal TB is not endemically prevalent or where strains are resistant to drug regimens, biopsy of synovial tissue or adjacent bone cystic lesions is strongly recommended, so that the pathogens may be revealed accurately in histological, microbiological, and sensitivity studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712464955">16</xref></sup> Aspiration of synovial fluid is often insufficient to make a diagnosis because of the scarcity of bacilli. Also, culture specimens obtained from draining sinuses are easily contaminated with other organisms. In our group, 15 patients presented with sinus formation and 9 patients had disease progression to stages III and IV. Therefore, for suspicious cases that failed to prove the presence of TB, it is prudent to proceed directly to total synovectomy, ankle joint preservation, or even arthrodesis to resect the major granulomatous lesion for histological and microbiological confirmation. The high incidence (27.6%) of coexisting pyogenic infection in ankle TB could mask the correct diagnosis and lead to joint sepsis or bony destruction. In terms of diagnostic confirmation in our group, joint fluid revealed 28.5% positive acid-fast staining, histological specimens obtained 66.7% positive acid-fast staining, and 44.4% of specimens grew <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. Although the prognosis of osseous TB with chemotherapy is good, this treatment takes time, and the possibility of joint destruction with disease progression should be considered in treatment strategies. Joint arthrodesis is considered when extensive cartilage erosion or hindfoot malalignment needs to be corrected.</p>
<p>Without stabilization of the disorganized joint, multidrug therapy may not achieve good functional outcomes during joint debridement surgery. The timing and extent of joint debridement surgery depend on the degree of bone and joint involvement, especially significant sequestra extending into adjacent joints, fracture, or the danger of structural collapse. Concomitant pyogenic infections dictate the need for abscess drainage, synovectomy, or even arthrodesis, as well as additional antibiotics. The purpose of surgical intervention is to obtain tissue biopsy for diagnosis; assess the damage to the bone and joint; debride sequestra, granulomata, or thickened synovium; and fuse the irretrievably destroyed joint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712464955">10</xref></sup> Martini and Ouahes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712464955">12</xref></sup> reported that 36 ankles (6.9%) in 520 patients with skeletal TB had features of severe destructive lesions (87%), sinus (86%), and coexistent pyogenic infection (66%). Ankle TB treated with chemotherapy and immobilization in plaster casts had 90% good and excellent outcomes with 60% anatomical results and spontaneous fusion. The authors recognize that ankle arthrodesis was performed in only 16% of patients with persistent pain or crippling deformity. In our cases, decision making for ankle arthrodesis was based on cartilage destruction with loss of joint space, large abscesses with discharging sinuses, talar bone collapse greater than 20%, rocker-bottom deformity, and uncontrolled infection due to mixed infections or drug-resistant strains. Good results could be expected in patients with early-stage disease before the weight-bearing joint was destroyed. However, arthrodesis of 1 or more neighboring joints might be optimal for hindfoot alignment in the later stages.</p>
<p>Total hip or knee joint replacement has been considered after a safe period of absolute disease quiescence for a painless but mobile joint. Nowadays, ankle fusion is still considered the standard procedure for advanced TB arthritis, because total ankle arthroplasty has had unacceptably high complication and failure rates compared with arthrodesis. Excisional arthroplasty in the hip, knee, or ankle weight-bearing joint produces only fair results.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Soft tissue swelling, periarticular osteoporosis, and irregular areas of destruction are seen in the early stages of ankle TB. Later, local cystic lesions, cartilage erosion, and sinus are commonly seen. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of ankle TB are important to prevent the ultimate involvement of the neighboring joint and talar bone collapse. Debridement with biopsy is done in nonhealing lesions or for the purpose of diagnostic confirmation. Synovectomy may be insufficient and prolong the antituberculosis treatment course due to incomplete sterilization of the joints. In cases of severe destruction of the ankle joint, arthrodesis is a salvage procedure with predictable outcomes, but hindfoot alignment must be maintained. In our study, the long-term prognosis depended upon the extent of disease at presentation, accurate staging, adequate duration of medical therapy, and optimal surgical intervention.</p>
