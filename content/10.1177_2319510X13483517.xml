<abstract>
<p>This study compared the customers’ perception of quality of telecom services provided by Reliance Communications Limited (a private player) and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (a public player) in western Uttar Pradesh. Using modified SERVPERF scale, thirty scale items, customers’ perceptions were sought on eight aspects of service quality. In addition to standard five dimensions, three more dimensions, network quality, customer complaint and convenience, were added to the scale. Most of the research studies comparing private and public enterprises in India show that customers’ level of satisfaction is comparatively more for private enterprise than that of public sector enterprise. So it was felt that Reliance Communications Limited (RCOM) would outperform Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) on the measures of service quality. This contention was largely supported. The results also indicated that both groups have room for improvement.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Telecommunication is pivotal to a country’s socioeconomic growth as it brings overall progress of all segments of the country through a rapid revolution in the realm of information technology which is a prerequisite for promoting equitable and sustainable development as well as political and social cohesion. Increasing connectivity is highly instrumental in improving governance, business communication and security of the nation, response to emergencies and in the overall strengthening of the socio-cultural ethos of the country.</p>
<p>In the pre-liberalisation era (1980–1990), Indian telecommunication services were under the ownership of Government. The Department of Telecommunication, a public industry entity, established in 1985, was sole responsible for the entire telecom services operation in the whole country and was not able to meet the ever growing demands for telecommunication. So to harness the advantages of telecommunication, the Government of India opened up the door for private players in the major economic reforms of 1991. In the past two decades, Indian telecom industry has come a long way from a monopoly market to highly competitive market with the arrival of new generation tech-savvy private companies and experienced MNCs.</p>
<p>To cope up with the ever increasing competition in today’s dynamic business environment, a sustainable competitive advantage is without doubt essential for all firms. Sustainability is achieved when the advantage resists erosion by competitor behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2319510X13483517">Porter, 1985</xref>). A competitive advantage is sustained when competitors cannot duplicate the benefits of this strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2319510X13483517">Barney, 1991</xref>). The available evidence indicates that service organisations which adopt a strategic approach to ‘service quality management’ may considerably improve their competitiveness.</p>
<p>As Ghobadian et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2319510X13483517">1993</xref>) put it, ‘quality is one of the primary drivers of the business and corporate image is built around the quality of the offering’. Service quality functions as an antecedent to customer satisfaction. So a major challenge for companies is to deliver service quality consistently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2319510X13483517">Zeithaml &amp; Bitner, 2006</xref>). Service quality is proven to provide many benefits to organisations because of its relationship to various costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2319510X13483517">Crosby, 1979</xref>), profitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2319510X13483517">Rust &amp; Zahorik, 1993</xref>), customer satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2319510X13483517">Boulding et al., 1993</xref>), customer retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2319510X13483517">Reichheld &amp; Sasser, 1990</xref>) and positive words of mouth. Thus it can be said that focusing on a strategic or proactive approach to service quality can help an organisation to strengthen and differentiate itselffrom other organisations and through it, to gain a lasting competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Profit impact of market strategy (PIMS) research indicated that firms that provide superior service are in position to charge 8 per cent more for their offers, while getting higher-than-normal market share growth and profitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2319510X13483517">Philips et al., 1983</xref>). Today, many service organisations have responded to the promise of the strategic and financial impact of quality, treating it as a strategic weapon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2319510X13483517">Paradise, 1991</xref>). Thus, offering superior service quality can help firms become more profitable and help them sustain a competitive advantage in their served markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2319510X13483517">Hampton, 1993</xref>). However, before service improvement programmes are introduced, current service quality levels needs to be addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2319510X13483517">Berry &amp; Parasuraman, 1991</xref>). These assessments should identify the strengths and weaknesses of the service currently being offered. Moreover, insights about how to differentiate through improved service quality, that is, to gain a competitive advantage, require comparing quality assessments to those of competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2319510X13483517">Parsuraman et al., 1988</xref>). Such a comparison helps to establish priorities for service quality improvements as well as identifying which service quality attributes to emphasise in differentiating the firm’s service offer. So this article attempts to examine the quality of telecom services provided by public (BSNL) and private (RCOM) telecom operators in Western Uttar Pradesh and explore the following two hypotheses:
<list id="list1-2319510X13483517" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>The quality of telecom services is likely to be better of RCOM, a private telecom operator, than that of BSNL, a public sector enterprise,</italic> because unlike BSNL, RCOM doesn’t have to deal with large and dominating labour unions. Additionally unlike BSNL, RCOM doesn’t have the government financial support and it must fend itself.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There is room for improvement for overall quality of telecom services provide by both players.</p></list-item>
</list></p>

<sec id="section2-2319510X13483517">
<title>Measuring Perception of Service Quality</title>
<p>Without doubt, the measurement of service quality is a critical element for quality improvement. Zeithaml et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2319510X13483517">2006</xref>) argued ‘a sound measure of service quality is necessary for identifying the aspects of service needing performance improvement, assessing how much improvement is needed on each aspect and evaluating the impact of improvement efforts’. SERVQUAL Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2319510X13483517">Parsuraman et al. 1988</xref>) played an important role to the understanding of the concept of service quality and the factors that influence it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2319510X13483517">Zeithaml et al., 1990</xref>). SERVQUAL questionnaire consists of two sections with 22-items which seek to measure customers’ expectations of service and perceptions of actual service received. Customers are asked to show their level of agreements to the 22 statements on expectations and performance on the basis of a seven-point Likert scale where1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree. In an equation form, their operationalisation of service quality can be expressed as follows:

<p>Where:</p>
<p><italic>SQ</italic><sub>1</sub> = perceived service quality of individual ‘i’</p>
<p>k = number of attributes/items</p>
<p>P = perception of individual ‘i’ with respect to performance of a service firm attribute ‘j’</p>
<p>E = service quality expectation for attribute ‘j’ that is the relevant norm for individual ‘i’</p>
<p>SERVQUAL model has been criticised by many researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2319510X13483517">Carman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2319510X13483517">Buttle 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2319510X13483517">Donnelly et al. 2006</xref>). Researchers have questioned the validity and reliability of the gap model, suggesting that measuring only perceptions might provide a better indication of service quality than measuring the difference between perceptions and expectations. Cronin and Taylor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2319510X13483517">1992</xref>) developed an alternative measure for service quality, the SERVPERF model. Besides theoretical arguments, Cronin and Taylor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2319510X13483517">1992</xref>) provided empirical evidence across four industries (namely banks, pest control, dry cleaning and fast food) to corroborate the superiority of their ‘performance-only’ instrument over disconfirmation-based SERVQUAL scale. Being a variant of the SERVQUAL scale and containing perceived performance component alone, ‘performance only’ scale is comprised of only 22 items. A higher perceived performance implies higher service quality. In equation form, it can be expressed as:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-2319510X13483517">

<p>k = number of attributes/items</p>
<p>P = perception of individual ‘i’ with respect to performance of a service firm attribute ‘j’</p>
<p>Given the continued support for the perception-based aspect of the measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2319510X13483517">Cronin &amp; Taylor, 1992</xref>), many criticisms of SERVQUAL and the failure of empirical studies to replicate SERVQUAL’s initial success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2319510X13483517">Babakus and Boller 1992</xref>), it was decided to use the one-stage (SERVPERF) form of the survey as the base in the present research.</p>
<p>Further the context of telecom industry suggested the need to modify the scale by adding some more contextual variables to measure telecom service quality. This contention was supported by qualitative interviews of telecom experts and three other variables such as ‘network quality’ (The availability and quality of signals/network of telecom service provider), ‘complaint handling’ (The telecom service provider’s ability to handle customer complaints with in time) and ‘convenience’ (The processes and locations of TSP to make it convenient to you to use its services) were included for the assessment of perception of service quality.</p>
<p>Consequently, the modified SERVPERF framework was adopted for this study. The conceptual framework for this study is described next. Then the research method is explained, followed by the findings and conclusions.</p>

<sec id="section3-2319510X13483517">
<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>The proposed core components of telecom service quality in Western Uttar Pradesh are as follows:
<list id="list1-2319510X13483517" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Tangibility:</italic> It refers to the appearance of the telecom service provider’s physical facilities, equipment, personnel and communication materials. Four standard items were used to measure this construct.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Reliability:</italic> It is defined as the telecom service provider’s ability to perform the promised service dependably and accurately. Five standard items were used to measure this construct.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Responsiveness:</italic> It refers to the telecom service provider’s willingness to help customers and provide prompt service. Four standard items were used to measure this construct.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Assurance:</italic> It is defined as the knowledge and courtesy of the TSP’s employees and their ability to convey trust and confidence. The last item ‘service provider pays individual attention to the customers’ has been removed as it was considered irrelevant in the context of telecom services.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Empathy:</italic> It means the caring attention the telecom service provider provides to its customers. To measure this construct the standard dimension ‘employees interacting customers pay personal attention to them’ were removed and one single dimension was introduced ‘employees can be expected to give personal and individual attention’.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Network Quality:</italic> The new dimension was added as it was considered very important for telecom services. It is defined as the availability and quality of signals/network of telecom service provider. Four items were used to measure this construct to reflect on connectivity, call quality, voice quality and coverage.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Complaint Handling:</italic> This is second new dimension which was added to the scale. It is defined as the telecom service provider’s ability to handle customer complaints with in time. Three items were used to measure this construct to reflect on availability and ease and timely complaint handling system.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Convenience:</italic> This is the last new dimension added to the standard SERVPERF scale. It refers to the processes and locations of TSP to make it convenient to you to use its services. Two items were used to measure this construct.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Telecom services provided by BSNL and RCOM were compared on these eight dimensions.</p>

<title>Research Methodology</title>
<p>In order to determine if any studies were done in Western Uttar Pradesh to compare the quality of services between private and public telecom operators, existing research was examined extensively. There was little information found in this regard and as a result survey method was adopted to carry out this study. With the help of literature review from other countries and expert interview, there were minor modifications done in the standard SERVPERF scale. Eight important dimensions were identified as to measure telecom service quality. Questionnaire was developed in English. 5 point Likert scale, where 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree, was used to measure the responses on 30 items of the questionnaire. Eight construct were measured through multiple items. The questionnaire was pre-tested for assessing its reliability and validity.</p>
<p>Primary data have been collected from a standard questionnaire. Total 422 customers’ data was collected. Considering the companies’ reluctance to use their customer database for sampling purpose and objective of comparison between the two selected companies, purposive sampling method was used to select the sample from four major cities of Western Uttar Pradesh, that is Ghaziabad, Meerut, Muzaffarnagar and Saharanpur. In order to identify individuals who are using or used both companies’ services, these cities were selected on the basis of personal persuasion of the researcher. Initially 05 families were selected from each city across different social class group and using snow-ball method for generating references 50 families were identified in each city and contacted to have their concern to respond to the questionnaire. Visit to these families was made and questionnaire was administered personally for individuals in these families. Thus a total of 422 individuals responded to the questionnaire designed for customers out of which 400 questionnaires were considered fit for data analysis.</p>
<p>The demographic distribution of sample on four parameters age, occupation, gender and income is presented as follows: There were 55 per cent male and 45 per cent female in the selected sample. There were 5 per cent respondents less than 18 years old, 25 per cent in the age group (18–23) years, 28 per cent in the age group (24–28) years, 23 per cent in the age group (29–45) years and 13 per cent respondents were above 45 years. As for occupation, 20 per cent were government employees, 28 per cent were working in private organisations, 20 per cent were self employed/businessman, 18 per cent were students and 15 per cent were homemakers. 30 per cent of respondents have income less than ₹ 1.5 lakh, 20 per cent between 1.5 lakh to 3 lakh, 30 per cent between 3 lakh to 5 lakh and 20 per cent above 5 lakh. The sample was found adequately consistent with the people living in Western Uttar Pradesh who would be of interest for the marketers of telecom companies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2319510X13483517">
<title>Findings and Analysis</title>
<p>Data was analysed with the help of statistical software PASW18.0. With the help of frequency distributions, data entry errors (example missing values) were found and rectified. Descriptive statistics were obtained to check the basic assumptions of multivariate data analysis. Reliability for eight construct were assessed with the help of Cronbach’s alpha. The reliability coefficients were found greater than 0.75 for each construct that is consistent with the recommendation of Nunnally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2319510X13483517">1978</xref>). To test whether there are significant differences between the perceptions of service quality of private and public telecom operators, item-wise comparisons were made using multivariate and univariate ANOVA for each construct.</p>
<p>Multivariate test was found significant for all eight dimensions of telecom service quality. Hence the null hypotheses of no group difference on all those eight dimensions were rejected. The univariate <italic>F-</italic> statistics were also found significant (α = 0.95) on all items except second item of ‘Reliability’ ‘When promises to do something, service provider do so’ and first dimension of ‘Network Quality’ ‘Service network connects immediately to a dialed number’. Also univariate <italic>F</italic>-statistic for the second item of ‘Network Quality’ ‘Service network handles all the calls successfully without maintaining any call drops’ was found significant for α = 0.90.</p>
<p>Univariate tests also showed the significant difference on all items of ‘Tangibility’, ‘Responsiveness’, ‘Assurance’, ‘Empathy’, ‘Complaint Handling’ and ‘Convenience’. The mean score of RCOM on all items of these dimensions were significantly higher than that of BSNL. This further strengthens our first hypothesis.</p>

<p>For the ‘Reliability’ dimensions of service quality, RCOM’s mean scores were significantly higher on all items except first item, ‘when promises to do something service provider does so’ and third item, ‘service provider is dependable’. For the first item, univariate test showed that there is no significant difference for this item. Interestingly for the third item ‘service provider is dependable’ mean score of BSNL was significantly higher than that of RCOM. This could be attributed to the wider network coverage of BSNL (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-2319510X13483517">Table 6</xref>).</p>

<p>For the ‘Network Quality’ dimension of service quality RCOM’s mean score was found significantly higher only on one item, ‘Service network maintains excellent voice quality and without interruption’. For the first two items, ‘Service network connects immediately to a dialed number’ and ‘Service network handles all the calls successfully without maintaining any call drops’ univariate test showed no significant difference between the mean scores of RCOM and BSNL where as for the last item, ‘Service provider has network with wider coverage (area)’ BSNL’s mean score was significantly more than that of RCOM.</p>
<p>Maximum mean score for RCOM was on the first item of Tangibility ‘Service Provider has up-to-date equipments/technology’ where (<inline-formula><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>̄</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula>  = 3.45). For BSNL the highest score was on the last item of ‘Network Quality’, ‘Service provider has network with wider coverage (area)’ where (<inline-formula><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>̄</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula>  = 3.14). The mean of mean scores of 30 items for BSNL and RCOM were 2.60 and 3.04 respectively supporting our second proposition that there is enough room for improvement for overall quality of telecom services provide by both players. Further, there are 11 items where mean score was lower than mid-point for RCOM and 28 for BSNL. This further strengthens our second hypothesis.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The first hypothesis that the quality of telecom services is likely to be better of RCOM, a private telecom operator, than that of BSNL, a public sector enterprise was largely supported by the multivariate and univariate tests since RCOM received better ratings than BSNL on most of the measures of eight dimensions of Telecom Service Quality. These differences indicate that BSNL has failed to come up to expectations to compete with private players. Despite having government financial support and largest network, it is struggling to maintain the quality of service at par with the competitors. In order to maintain competitive level of service quality, BSNL should design the incentive structure for its workforce like linking a part of compensation of employee with the quality of service of their work. This, of course, will not be easy and has to deal with many complex issues as government pay scale administration is bound with certain pay structures.</p>
<p>Though results suggests that RCOM outperform BSNL on most of the measures of service quality, but it should also be noted that the service evaluation for RCOM on those dimensions were not praiseworthy. The mean score did not exceed 3.5 for any measure of service quality on a 5-point likert scale. This clearly conforms to the second hypothesis that both BSNL and RCOM have room to improve overall service quality.</p>
<p>Both companies should strive for higher service quality for sustenance, continuity and growth. We suggest that services evaluations must be done on these eight dimensions of Telecom Service Quality on regular intervals by the public or private players in the Telecom Industry. Findings should be compared with the best and disseminated across the organisation to make employees aware of their organisation standing with the best. These kinds of comparisons would wake up complacent telecom service providers to take necessary corrective action and provide the quality of service that customers expects.</p>
