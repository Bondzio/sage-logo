<sec id="sec12-1477153512464141"><title>Executive summary</title>
<p>This digest presents a summary of recent research on the relationship between lamp spectrum and brightness in the context of residential roads. Lighting design for such roads considers primarily the needs of pedestrians rather than drivers. For pedestrians, brightness is important because brighter lighting tends to produce higher levels of perceived safety in a particular location. Studies of brightness perception for lamps with different spectral power distributions at illuminances representative of those used for residential road lighting have been made using controlled laboratory conditions and field surveys. The findings from these two approaches are in good agreement.</p>
<p>It has been found that in the mesopic region (the lighting levels found on roads at night time) lamps with a higher scotopic / photopic (S/P) ratio appear brighter at the same illuminance than lamps with lower S/P ratios. This means that lamps with a high S/P ratio can be used either at the same illuminance to create a higher brightness or at a lower illuminance but the same brightness, the latter leading to a reduction in energy consumption. The recently established CIE system of mesopic photometry, which involves S/P ratio, can be used to predict the illuminance reduction that will ensure the same level of brightness for a range of lamps with different spectra.</p>
<p>However, brightness is not the only factor that matters for the lighting of residential roads. The ability to detect obstacles is also important, as is the appearance of the environment and the confidence that the intent and identity of other people can be recognised. Other studies have shown that the ability to detect obstacles is influenced by lamp spectrum in a similar manner to brightness, that is, a higher S/P ratio improves obstacle detection. As for the acceptability of the appearance of the environment, this is more consistently related to the colour rendering of the light source than the S/P ratio. How light spectrum affects the ability to recognise the intent of other people is still uncertain.</p>
<p>Given these findings it is possible to modify the illuminances used in residential roads when using different light sources. These illuminances should be chosen based on two characteristic of the light source, S/P ratio and colour rendering index. The Institution of Lighting Professionals (ILP) have proposed two rules:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477153512464141">1</xref></sup>
<list id="list1-1477153512464141" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Reducing illuminance from the levels recommended in the S-series of lighting classes can be considered when using lamps which have a CIE general colour rendering index greater than or equal to 60.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Where lamps with a colour rendering index greater than or equal to 60 are to be used, the illuminance reduction allowed can be calculated using the CIE system of mesopic photometry, assuming the low pressure sodium lamp is the reference.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The table below gives the examples of the illuminances predicted by this process for a number of alternative lamps for the S-classes given in BS 5489-1:2003 and BS EN 13201-2:2003. This demonstrates that MH lighting, for example, may be used at a lower average illuminance than HPS lighting, and this may lead to a saving in energy consumption.

<p>This digest presents the implications of recent research concerning lighting in subsidiary roads such as those in residential areas. A residential area is an area of a village, town or city which is suitable for or is occupied by private dwellings and a residential street is defined as a street where the majority of frontages comprise private dwellings. In such roads lighting is designed primarily to meet the needs of pedestrians rather than drivers of motor vehicles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477153512464141">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this report, <italic>brightness</italic> is used to define the visual sensation of the amount of light within an environment such as a lighted street, and may therefore be more precisely defined as <italic>spatial brightness</italic>. Brightness encompasses the sensation based on the response of a large part of the visual field: it does not necessarily relate to the brightness of any individual objects or surfaces in the environment, but it may be influenced by the brightness of these individual items.</p>
<p>Brightness is of interest because of its link with perceived safety (or, fear of crime). Loewen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477153512464141">3</xref></sup> used two procedures to examine perceived safety in urban environments. The first study sought spontaneous comments as to what features of environments contributed to making them feel safe or dangerous and this was done without reference to any real or simulated locations. Three environmental features were mentioned most frequently, with light (either daylight or artificial light) being the most frequent (42 of the 55 test participants) followed by open space (30) and access to refuge (24). In their second study, test participants were presented with images of outdoor scenes and asked to rate them using a 5-point response scale ranging from not at all safe (1) to very safe (5). These images presented the eight combinations of the three critical safety features found in the first study – light, open space and refuge. The results, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1477153512464141">Figure 1</xref>, indicate that lighting is important: The presence of lighting increased ratings of perceived safety in all four situations regardless of the presence or absence of open space and refuge.
<fig id="fig1-1477153512464141" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Mean ratings of perceived safety of images of outdoor scenes as reported by Loewen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477153512464141">3</xref></sup></p></caption><graphic alt-version="no" position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_1477153512464141-fig1.tif" xlink:type="simple"/>
</fig></p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1477153512464141">Figure 1</xref>, a rating of 1 indicates that a scene was considered to be very unsafe, and the scene with no lighting, open space nor refuge was rated close to 1. The presence of open space and access to refuge together increased the average rating of perceived safety to 2, approximately the same gain as found with a scene having lighting but without open space and refuge. The largest gain in perceived safety was found when lighting was added to a scene that offered both open space and refuge, increasing the rating of perceived safety from 2 to more than 4.</p>
<p>These results support the value of lighting in general but it would be a mistake to assume that improvements to lighting will always improve perceived safety in specific situations. Indeed, a review of field surveys of improved lighting did not find consistent evidence to claim a gain in perceived safety.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477153512464141">4</xref></sup> Mansfield and Raynham<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477153512464141">5</xref></sup> surveyed a small town centre in the UK (Swinton) following re-lighting and found that factors which might contribute to a high fear of crime, such as vandalism, graffiti, groups of young people loitering and acting rowdily, were not offset by the new lighting. Regardless of lighting, some areas will still feel unsafe. The only thing that lighting can do for certain is to allow you to see better, but if what can be seen is disturbing then this will not alleviate the fear of crime.</p>
<p>Boyce et al carried out field surveys of the perception of safety in 24 car parks in urban and suburban areas in the US.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477153512464141">6</xref></sup> At each site participants were asked to walk around and then describe the environment using questionnaires. One question sought ratings of perceived safety when walking alone. Walking in daytime was perceived to be safer than walking at night-time. Lighting at night was able to bring the perception of safety close to that of daytime in a small number of sites but did not exceed it. As illuminance increased, the difference between daytime and night-time ratings of perceived safety also tended to decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1477153512464141">Figure 2</xref>). The relationship between illuminance and perceived safety appears to be non-linear. At low illuminances (0–10 lux) a small increase in illuminance produced a large increase in perceived safety; at high illuminances (≥50 lux) increases in illuminance have negligible effect on perceived safety; and in the intermediate range (10–50 lux) the increase in perceived safety with increases in illuminance followed a law of diminishing returns.
<fig id="fig2-1477153512464141" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Difference in daytime and night-time ratings of perceived safety plotted against the median illuminance of 24 car parks in which the ratings were given.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477153512464141">6</xref></sup> A difference of 1 means that the night-time rating was one point lower (i.e. perceived to be slightly less safe) than the daytime rating</p></caption><graphic alt-version="no" position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_1477153512464141-fig2.tif" xlink:type="simple"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Criteria for lighting design may be found in BS5489-1:2003,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477153512464141">7</xref></sup> which is a guide to interpretation of BS EN 13 201-2:2003<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477153512464141">8</xref></sup> which in turn specifies illuminances for lighting in subsidiary roads, the S-series of lighting classes. The S-series comprises six classes, ranging from average illuminances of 2.0 lux (S6) to 15.0 lux (S1). BS5489-1:2003 permits a trade-off between spectral power distribution (SPD) and illuminance, with a reduction in illuminance equivalent to one class of the S-series when using lamps of high colour rendering (R<sub>a</sub> ≥ 60).</p>
<p>Previous guidance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477153512464141">9</xref></sup> for road lighting stated that high pressure sodium (HPS) and low pressure sodium (LPS) were the preferred types of light source. These sources have narrow SPDs while sources such as metal halide, fluorescent and LEDs offer much broader SPDs. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1477153512464141">Table 1</xref> shows some of the characteristics of light sources that describe the nature of their SPDs as well as the luminous efficacy. Lamps having broader SPD tend to offer better colour rendering and a higher CCT than do LPS or HPS lamps.

<p>In recent years two areas of research have developed to the point at which we are far better able to understand the effects of lamp SPD on pedestrian lighting. One theme is the development of a system of mesopic photometry to characterise the spectral sensitivity of the eye.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512464141">10</xref></sup> The other is the study of typical pedestrian tasks under light sources of different SPD, including studies of brightness,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477153512464141">11</xref></sup> obstacle detection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477153512464141">12</xref></sup> and facial recognition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477153512464141">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>One reason for the interaction between lamp SPD and illuminance is the change in sensitivity of the human visual system between daytime and night time. In daytime conditions the cones are the dominant photoreceptors, and the spectral sensitivity of human vision is characterised by the CIE Standard <italic>Photopic</italic> Observer, <italic>V</italic>(<italic>λ</italic>). Illuminance and luminance meters provide a measurement of photopic quantities. At very low light levels the rod photoreceptors dominate visual response, and this is characterised by the CIE <italic>Scotopic</italic> Observer, <italic>V′</italic>(<italic>λ</italic>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1477153512464141">Figure 3</xref>, the peak sensitivity of the scotopic response occurs at a shorter wavelength (507 nm) than the photopic response (555 nm). Thus the spectral sensitivity of human vision is different in dark and light conditions; the human eye is more sensitive to blue light under night time conditions than it is under daylight. Typical street lighting provides low light levels somewhere between photopic and scotopic levels, in what is known as the mesopic region. At mesopic levels both the rods and cones contribute to visual response in proportions dependent upon the state of adaptation of the eye.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512464141">10</xref></sup> Therefore, in mesopic conditions, the rod contribution means that photopic illuminance alone will not correctly estimate the visual effectiveness of the illumination.
<fig id="fig3-1477153512464141" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Illustration of photopic and scotopic curves</p></caption><graphic alt-version="no" position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_1477153512464141-fig3.tif" xlink:type="simple"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The S/P ratio of a light source is the ratio of the scotopic luminous flux to the photopic luminous flux and represents the relative strengths of the rod and cone visual stimulation produced by the lamp, which means it effectively provides a measure of night-time visual efficiency compared with daytime visual efficiency. For any light source the S/P ratio is a constant based on the SPD and independent of luminous intensity. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1477153512464141">Table 1</xref>, light sources of higher CCT tend to have a higher S/P ratio than do sources of lower CCT, since an increase in the amount of blue light (higher CCT) generally increases the scotopic luminous flux, but this is not always the case.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Summary #1</italic></bold>: Research has demonstrated that lighting contributes to perceived safety at night and that brighter lighting can lead to a higher perception of safety. At mesopic light levels it is expected that the spectral power distribution of the light will affect brightness due, in part, to the contribution of the rod photoreceptors which become more active at low light levels. The metric that predicts the magnitude of this effect is the scotopic/photopic (S/P) ratio. The next section examines experimental research of brightness under lighting from lamps of different SPD to determine whether the effect on brightness is significant and whether it can be reliably predicted.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1477153512464141"><title>2.1. Trials in controlled situations</title>
<p>Trials in controlled situations (which tend to be carried out in a laboratory rather than in the field) are important because they allow the experimenter to eliminate, or at least control, variables other than the one which is under investigation, which is lamp spectrum in the current case. This means we can be more sure that the results are due to difference in lamp spectrum and not to anything else.</p>
<p>Fotios and Cheal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477153512464141">14</xref></sup> compared brightness under five lamps in the laboratory using three methods; joint (side-by-side) evaluations using a matching task and a discrimination task, and separate (one at a time) evaluations using a category rating task. The tests used two field sizes: the joint evaluations used side-by-side booth giving a visual field of approximately 37° high and 71° wide, and the separate evaluations were carried out in a room giving full-field stimulation. The joint evaluations used three reference illuminances, 2.0, 7.5 and 15.0 lux, and the separate evaluations used two reference illuminances, 2.0 and 15.0 lux. The results from all three methods were in agreement. Brightnesses under the two types of MH lamps used (2800 K and 4200 K) and the CFL lamp were evaluated to be significantly higher than under the HPS lamp for the same illuminance, which was in turn considered to be higher than under the LPS lamp. The results of their matching task suggest that MH lighting achieves equal brightness at an illuminance 27% lower than that of the HPS.</p>
<p>These results from Fotios and Cheal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477153512464141">14</xref></sup> are consistent with a laboratory test, briefly reported by Rea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477153512464141">15</xref></sup> where subjects adjusted the illuminance from an HPS source on a scale model scene until it visually matched the brightness of the same scene illuminated by a MH source. At similar light levels to those used by Fotios and Cheal, the MH lighting produced equal brightness at an illuminance 29% lower than that of the HPS. A further study from Rea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477153512464141">13</xref></sup> was carried out in a real outdoor environment used a discrimination task. Opposite ends of a road were lit using MH and HPS lamps, and test participants located at the centre reported at which end the street appeared brighter and also at which end they would feel safer walking at night. Interpolation of the results suggests the illuminance of the MH lamps could be 21% lower than HPS for equal brightness and 34% lower for equal perceived safety.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1477153512464141"><title>2.2. Field surveys</title>
<p>Trials in real situations are important because they place any effect of lamp spectrum on brightness into the context of other environmental variables and more realistic situations. Three field surveys have recorded responses to lighting in real streets in urban and residential areas before and after changes to the lighting. The findings of these studies confirm those found in controlled situations.</p>
<p>Knight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1477153512464141">16</xref></sup> reported evaluations of the perception of brightness, safety and comfort of over 300 residents in the Netherlands, Spain and United Kingdom before and after the street lighting in their neighbourhoods was changed from HPS to one of two types of MH (CCT of 2800 K and 4200 K). The average illuminances in the given areas were comparable before and after the change. Analysis of the results suggests that when the lighting was changed from HPS to MH 2800 K or MH 4200 K, the perceptions of safety and brightness of the area were improved. When the reverse change was done, i.e. from MH 2800 K to HPS, there was a statistically significant reduction in ratings of brightness and perceived safety of the area. The results consistently indicated that for pedestrians, streets illuminated with white light at comparable illuminances and comparable light distributions are perceived to be brighter and safer than the same streets with HPS lighting.</p>
<p>Morante<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477153512464141">17</xref></sup> reports a survey of two streets in the US. In one street, HPS lighting providing an average illuminance of 8.7 lux was replaced by QL lighting providing 2.7 lux. In a second street HPS lighting providing an average illuminance of 3.2 lux was replaced by MH lighting providing 3.1 lux. Surveys of residents suggest that they found that the QL and MH lighting created environments that were considered to be safer and brighter than when using HPS lighting. Akashi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477153512464141">18</xref></sup> compared road lighting from HPS lamps providing an average photopic illuminance of 3.4 lux with lighting from a 6500 K fluorescent lamp giving 2.8 lux. Lighting under the fluorescent lamp was considered to be brighter and create an environment that observers judged to be safer.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1477153512464141"><title>2.3. Predicting the effect of lamp spectrum</title>
<p>The results of experiments in controlled and real situations demonstrate that lamp SPD affects brightness at mesopic levels. What is then needed is a tool to predict the magnitude and direction of the effect.</p>
<p>Fotios and Cheal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477153512464141">11</xref></sup> carried out further experimental work to screen various potential metrics for brightness. This included lamp colour metrics such as CCT, CIE general colour rendering index (R<sub>a</sub>), lamp S/P ratio, and four brightness models and one performance model from the literature. They used a brightness matching task with five different types of lamp observed in all possible pairs and these lamps were carefully chosen to test predictions of brightness. These results revealed brightness differences between two different lamps ranging from 0% to 25%. For example, their LED lamp required 25% less illuminance than the HPS for equal brightness.</p>
<p>The CIE recommended system for mesopic photometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512464141">10</xref></sup> had a high correlation with the brightness matching results. This is a surprise because the CIE mesopic system was developed from experiments of visual performance and was not intended to measure brightness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1477153512464141">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1477153512464141">20</xref></sup> It was possible to gain a slightly better correlation with the experimental results using a model developed purposefully for brightness perception<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477153512464141">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1477153512464141">22</xref></sup> but this slight benefit is outweighed by the practical utility of a system which has been adopted as a international standard and that also characterises mesopic visual performance.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Summary #2</italic></bold>: Empirical evidence demonstrates that lighting from lamps of equal illuminance will appear to have different brightnesses if there are differences in their SPD. That this has been found in tests using a range of procedures, in the laboratory and in the field, suggests the findings are robust. The relationship between lamp spectrum and photopic illuminance can be predicted with reasonable accuracy by the CIE recommended system for mesopic photometry. For road lighting applications this suggests that MH lamps, for example, may be installed to provide a lower average illuminance than HPS while maintaining the same brightness. The next section examines how an increase in S/P ratio and a reduction in illuminance would affect other tasks critical for pedestrians.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1477153512464141"><title>3. Effect on other requirements of lighting</title>
<p>In addition to providing brightness, lighting in residential roads needs also to contribute to the detection of pavement obstacles which might otherwise be a trip-hazard, to aid interpretation of the intent of other pedestrians, and to ensure the appearance of the visual environment is acceptable to users.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1477153512464141"><title>3.1. Obstacle detection</title>
<p>Safe movement requires the ability to detect obstacles on the path ahead, such as a raised paving slab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1477153512464141">Figure 4</xref>). In a study of movement of people through an obstructed space under emergency lighting conditions, lamps of high S/P ratio permitted faster speed of escape and fewer collisions with obstacles than did low S/P ratio lamps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1477153512464141">23</xref></sup> In real and simulated driving tasks an increase in the rate of detection of peripheral targets was found as luminance increased and also as the S/P ratio of the light source increased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1477153512464141">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1477153512464141"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1477153512464141">26</xref></sup> As for the ability of pedestrians to detect other pedestrians, there is some evidence to suggest that at mesopic illuminances a pedestrian in peripheral vision can be detected at a lower photopic illuminance under MH lamps than under HPS lamps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1477153512464141">27</xref></sup>

<p>Fotios and Cheal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477153512464141">12</xref></sup> examined the effect of light source SPD, illuminance and observer’s age on the ability to detect an obstacle simulating a raised paving slab. Two types of MH lamp (2700 K and 4200 K) and a standard HPS lamp were used at (photopic) illuminances of 0.2, 2.0 and 20 lux. The data collected were used to determine the height of the obstacle above the paving surface required for fifty percent detection (note that a lower height for 50% detection suggests better obstacle detection ability). These results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1477153512464141">Figure 5</xref>) demonstrated that the detection of obstacles in peripheral vision is enhanced when using lighting of higher S/P ratio and hence that illuminance could be reduced when using lighting of higher S/P ratio whilst still maintaining the same probability of obstacle detection.

<sec id="sec8-1477153512464141"><title>3.2. Recognition of intent</title>
<p>Lighting is required to enable pedestrians to make judgements of other pedestrians (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1477153512464141">Figure 6</xref>). Such judgements involve two tasks, (i) identification by facial recognition of people who are nearby in order to decide whether to let them enter one’s comfort zone, and (ii) interpretation of their intent (e.g. whether threatening or not) at a distance sufficient to take avoiding action if necessary.
<fig id="fig6-1477153512464141" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Interpreting the intent of other pedestrians</p></caption><graphic alt-version="no" position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_1477153512464141-fig6.tif" xlink:type="simple"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Six studies have been carried out to determine whether lamp type affects facial recognition but with mixed results. In three studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477153512464141">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1477153512464141"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1477153512464141">30</xref></sup> it was reported that facial recognition was affected by lamp type, with MH and CFL lamps enabling facial recognition at a greater distance than when using HPS lighting producing similar vertical illuminance on the face. However, in three other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477153512464141">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1477153512464141">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1477153512464141">32</xref></sup> it was reported that lamp type did not have a significant effect on facial recognition. It may be that the methodology requires improvement to enable better understanding of the real effects of lighting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1477153512464141">33</xref></sup> There is however some evidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1477153512464141">34</xref></sup> that there is a chromatic contribution to facial recognition when features are not clear as may be the case when observation of a face is hindered by glare. It appears that colour may help to define and separate areas of the face, such as the cheeks and the eyes, rather than enable accurate assessment of skin or eye colour. Such separations may be enhanced by using light sources with a large colour gamut.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1477153512464141">35</xref></sup> To avoid complications arising from the use of too many metrics it has been assumed in lighting recommendations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477153512464141">1</xref></sup> that CRI is a satisfactory measure of the ability to separate colours.</p>
<p>Recognition of intent (i.e. is it safe, or not safe, to walk closely by an approaching person?) may be made from visual cues such as judgements of facial expression, gait, clothing, and behaviours including gestures and speech. The effects of lighting on these aspects of perception have yet to be examined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1477153512464141"><title>3.3. Acceptability</title>
<p>It would be a mistake to recommend lighting based on brightness and other effects without consideration as to whether that lighting would be acceptable to users. Fotios and Cheal examined judgements of preference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1477153512464141">36</xref></sup> alongside their brightness matching trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477153512464141">11</xref></sup> These were judgements of the preferred appearance under lamps of different spectral power distribution of skin (test participants’ own hands), a colour array and a lit space. These judgements were made under lighting from the ten possible pairs of five test lamps at equal illuminance (5.0 lux) and at equal brightness (a match made by each test subject). It was found that SPD affected judgements of preferred appearance and that this correlated better with the CIE general colour rendering index (R<sub>a</sub>) than with other metrics of lamp spectral characteristics.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Summary #3</italic></bold>: For brightness, illuminance can be reduced when using lamps of higher S/P ratio. A similar trade-off between SPD and illuminance also exists for the detection of pavement obstacles in the peripheral field of view. Judgements of acceptability correlate better with colour rendering than with S/P ratio, so an increase in S/P ratio to improve brightness and obstacle detection may provide lighting that has an unacceptable appearance. These data suggest that consideration of S/P ratio alone is an unsatisfactory tool for lighting guidance; there is also a need for a good level of colour rendering. Further work is needed to determine how recognition of the identity and intent of other pedestrians is affected by lamp spectrum.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1477153512464141"><title>4. Application of brightness and lamp spectrum at mesopic levels</title>
<p>Empirical evidence suggests that it is possible to choose a lamp SPD for lighting residential roads that will improve brightness, or alternatively to reduce the illuminance of lighting using such lamps and maintain the same level of brightness as under a reference light source at the standard illuminance. There is also evidence that lamp SPD affects obstacle detection and acceptability and a hint of an effect on recognition of other pedestrians.</p>
<p>Higher levels of S/P ratio and CRI (R<sub>a</sub>) permit illuminances to be reduced whilst maintaining the same level of visual amenity. A system for establishing illuminances under different lamps using these parameters was developed through the mesopic lighting panel of the Institution of Lighting Professionals (ILP) as reported by Fotios and Goodman.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1477153512464141">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>This system allows illuminance to be reduced when using lamps of high S/P ratio but only when using lamps of colour rendering index R<sub>a</sub> ≥ 60. For subsidiary roads in the UK, the S-class is determined from BS5489-1:2003 and the associated illuminance is found in BS EN 13 201-2:2003. The amount by which this illuminance can be reduced, if the lamps have a colour rendering index of R<sub>a</sub> ≥ 60, is as calculated using the CIE recommended system for mesopic photometry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512464141">10</xref></sup> Some examples of the outcome of this process are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477153512464141">Table 2</xref>.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477153512464141">Table 2</xref> was developed with the assumption that LPS lamps provide the benchmark for UK road lighting, i.e. that if an S-class were chosen according to crime rate and environmental zone then LPS lamps would provide satisfactory lighting. Justification for this decision can be found from the 1992 version of BS5489-3,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477153512464141">9</xref></sup> which states that HPS and LPS are the preferred light sources, with no distinction made between them. Furthermore, the survey of road lighting carried out by Simons et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1477153512464141">38</xref></sup> that led to the average illuminances in BS5489-3:1992 examined roads using LPS, HPS and MBF lamps. LPS are around 40% of the current UK street lighting stock and have been the preferred lamp choice for many years. This is not a recommendation that it is ‘good’ to use LPS lamps, but instead it is recognition that the specified illuminances have not been adjusted over time as new light sources have been introduced.</p>
<p>As an example, consider that environmental and traffic flow criteria have indicated class S4 to be appropriate for a particular road. If LPS lamps were to be used, the average illuminance would be 5.0 lux. If MH lamps (S/P = 1.2) were to be used the average illuminance could be reduced to 4.0 lux because these lamps have a colour rendering index greater than 60. HPS lamps have a higher S/P ratio than do LPS lamps, but if these were to be used the illuminance is not reduced because the colour rendering of HPS lamps is lower than 60. Light sources with a S/P ratio above approximately 2.0 generally allow a reduction in illuminance equivalent to one class of the S-series, akin to the reduction permitted in existing guidance when using a lamps of R<sub>a</sub> ≥ 60.</p>
<p>Comparison of the reduced illuminances permitted under the two MH lamps included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477153512464141">Table 2</xref> show why a simple metric, such as R<sub>a</sub> ≥ 60 alone, can be misleading. Both of these MH lamps have R<sub>a</sub> ≥ 60 and both would therefore be eligible for the one S-class reduction in illuminance according to BS5489-1:2003. The warm white MH lamp however has a S/P ratio of 1.2, lower than that of the daylight MH lamp (2.4). Therefore, the warm white lamp does not improve brightness and obstacle detection by the same amount as the daylight lamp and the illuminance should not be reduced by the same amount if equal visual amenity is to be maintained. The daylight MH lamp offers a reduction in illuminance of approximately a one-step reduction in S-class. This lamp has a higher S/P ratio than most lamps that tend to be used for road lighting.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477153512464141">Table 2</xref> allows the lighting designer to consider variations in lamp type and illuminance for a particular S-class in order to optimise criteria such as energy consumption and life cycle costs. For lighting of higher S/P ratio the lower illuminance may permit a reduction in energy consumption, although this depends also on the efficacies of the lamps and the precision by which the target average illuminance is met.</p>
<p>Lamps of higher S/P ratio will also present, in some cases, a higher CCT and thus a cooler white appearance. There are anecdotal reports that warmer sources feel more comfortable than colder sources but this remains to be proven – the preference judgements carried out by Fotios and Cheal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1477153512464141">36</xref></sup> found a relatively weak correlation between CCT and preferred appearance. Some anecdotal comments have suggested that higher CCT leads to higher brightness. Fotios and Cheal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477153512464141">11</xref></sup> found that while CCT provided a reasonable correlation with brightness, this relationship was not as strong as between S/P ratio and brightness. Studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1477153512464141">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1477153512464141">40</xref></sup> at photopic levels have found that CCT is not a reliable predictor of brightness, finding higher CCT lighting to appear less bright than lighting of lower CCT.</p>
<p>The choice of lamp involves considerations beyond brightness, such as lamp life, lumen depreciation and the requirements for control gear. Lamp selection affects two variables related to the spatial distribution of light,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1477153512464141">41</xref></sup> these being the range of luminaires that are compatible with the chosen lamp type and the type of photometric distribution available from the luminaire. Lamps with a short arc tube, such as HPS and CMH, allow the luminaire optic to control the light output very precisely, often meaning the designer has a wide range of distribution options available to them when undertaking the design. However, the small arc tube can become a very bright point source and thus a potential cause of glare. Lamps with a longer arc tube (e.g. LPS) or tubular sources such as CFL offer much less control and do not offer many photometric options.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Summary #4</italic></bold>: The CIE recommended system for mesopic photometry has been proposed as the basis for specifying relative illuminances for maintaining equal brightness under different types of lamp in residential roads. To account for acceptable appearance, this reduction in illuminance is applied only when using lamps of colour rendering index R<sub>a</sub> ≥ 60. For road lighting in the UK this trade-off uses the LPS lamp as the benchmark. It is noted that brightness is only one of many criteria involved in the decision of which type of lamp to use.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1477153512464141"><title>5. Summary</title>
<p>Research has demonstrated that lighting contributes to perceived safety at night and that brighter lighting can lead to a higher perception of safety. At mesopic light levels it is expected that the spectral power distribution of the light will affect brightness due, in part, to the contribution of the rod photoreceptors which become more active at low light levels. The metric that predicts the magnitude of this effect is the S/P ratio.</p>
<p>Empirical evidence demonstrates that lighting from lamps of equal illuminance will appear to have different brightnesses if there are differences in their SPD. That this has been found in tests using a range of procedures, in the laboratory and in the field, suggests the findings are robust. The relationship between lamp spectrum and photopic illuminance can be predicted with reasonable accuracy by the CIE recommended system for mesopic photometry.
