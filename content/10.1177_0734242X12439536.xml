<title>The <italic>Waste Management and Research</italic> Outstanding Reviewer Award, 2011</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_0734242X12439536-img1.tif"/>
<p><italic>Waste Management and Research</italic> (WM&amp;R) journal is pleased to announce the selection of Professor Antoni Sánchez Ferrer as its Outstanding Peer Reviewer of 2011.</p>
<p><italic>Waste Management &amp; Research</italic> is one of the leading journals in the field of waste management, disseminating scientific-based information regarding waste prevention, recycling, treatment, disposal, and energy and materials recovery from waste streams. Originality, novelty and applicability of results in theory and/or practice are key criteria for accepting manuscripts for peer review prior to publication.</p>
<p>The Journal’s reputation stems from several factors, including prompt refereeing, turn-around time, quality and depth of reviews, accelerated schedule for the review and publication process, and pertinence of the published topics.</p>
<p>The peer review process is a key factor that contributes to the quality of manuscripts submitted for publication in WM&amp;R. The peer review process validates a scientific outcome and is performed by recognized professionals in the waste management scientific community. This process needs to be independent, clear and developed at the highest standards of care, promoting and maintaining WM&amp;R’s global standing. So, WM&amp;R’s editors rely on contributions by peer reviewers to assess the merits and qualities of all manuscripts, recommend rejection of some, and assist authors to improve their papers by offering constructive comments and suggested edits. In addition, peer reviewers help speed up the publication process by submitting their reviews promptly.</p>
<p>The annual WM&amp;R outstanding reviewer award is intended to recognize consistently high quality performance by a peer reviewer. In 2011, WM&amp;R’s Editorial Group selected Professor Antoni Sánchez Ferrer, for his outstanding reviews, focused in the field of biological treatment of wastes.</p>

<p>Professor Antoni Sánchez Ferrer was born in 1970, and now is full professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the Universitat Autònoma, Barcelona, Spain. He is a chemical engineer and obtained his PhD in Biotechnology in 1998. His main research activities have been focused on biological waste treatment, especially on composting processes. He is now the coordinator of the Composting Research Group of Universitat Autònoma, Barcelona.</p>
<p>During his research career, Professor Sánchez has published more than 80 Institute for Scientific Information (ISI)-refereed papers on different aspects of biotechnology and environmental sciences, and his works have received near 1000 citations. In recent years, he has served as reviewer for several scientific journals in the fields of composting, biological treatment of waste and biotechnology, among other topics. He has also supervised several PhD, masters and undergraduate students in the preparation of their theses and he has served as principal investigator of numerous research projects from public institutions and contracts with private companies. Professor Sánchez is also a member of several waste industry associations including the Spanish Life Cycle Assessment Network, the Spanish Composting Network and the Spanish Network of Biological Treatment of Polluted Gases, among others.</p>
<p><italic>Waste Management and Research</italic> appreciates Professor Sánchez’s substantial commitment to WM&amp;R, the extraordinary amount of time he devotes to performing high-quality reviews, and his contributions toward improving the quality and global visibility of WM&amp;R.</p>
