<body>
<p>In the 1930s, a group of subeditors on the <italic>Times</italic> competed to create the most boring headline. Their most famous offering was “Small Earthquake in Chile—Not Many Killed.” It was the sort of group and attitude that Rupert Murdoch would detest—articulate underachievers, playing their elitist games, definitely not improving the paper, probably disdaining their audience.</p>
<p>But now News Corp’s spin doctors are engaged in a similar game of minimizing the significance of the scandal in which the company is embroiled. Murdoch has hired two leading companies—Edelman, the world’s biggest PR firm, and Rubenstein Communications—to handle the current scandal surrounding the phone and email hacking activities at its <italic>News of the World</italic> newspaper, and to contain its consequences.</p>
<p>No doubt this is a difficult brief for those companies, but so far their tactics seem to be standard ploys from page one of the Spin Doctors’ Defense Manual.</p>
<p>The first was the display of unbridled remorse—“the most humble day of my life,” the televised visit to the family of murdered girl Milly Dowler, the most outrageous of the phone tap abuses, the national advertisements expressing regret—where the total abjectness of the apologies is matched only by the complete denial of responsibility.</p>
<p>The second has been the standard News Corp ploy of maligning critics, the attribution of ulterior motives to their accusers. News Corp has always been “a company with a chip on its shoulder” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527476411426795">Ignatius 2011</xref>), aggressively counterattacking its critics. In a November 2010 speech to British editors, <italic>News of the World</italic> managing editor, Bill Akass, defended his brand of tabloid journalism against the “snobbish elite,” saying that their complaints were “a kind of proxy for sneering at the working class.” A month earlier, when the <italic>New York Times</italic> had published an investigation of the phone hacking scandal, he “sent an indignant letter arguing that the paper had attacked Murdoch’s publication because of the <italic>Times</italic>’ rivalry with the <italic>Wall St Journal</italic>” (ibid). Such attacks had to be put in abeyance during the July 2011 full-scale eruption of the scandal, but this part of News Corp’s repertoire will no doubt be revived as soon as political conditions permit.</p>
<p>The third strand of the strategy is what might be called the Darth Vader defense. This all happened in a remote and insignificant part of the Empire, and is explained by purely local factors. No one in central command knew anything, and certainly should not be held responsible for any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Murdoch himself has been its chief proponent. At a speech to the News Corp Board he “only briefly mentioned his British troubles. He said the problems were isolated to one part of the company—and had no effect on the whole” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527476411426795">Flint and James 2011</xref>). He said “he felt ‘very confident’ about News’s (other) titles. . . . ‘I’m shocked and appalled at what happened in one small corner, which is <italic>News of the World</italic>,’ he said. ‘But everything else is fine’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527476411426795">Chessell 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>He emphasized the size of News Corp—“News employs 52,000 people across four continents and generates annual revenues of $US33 billion” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476411426795">Chessell 2011a</xref>)—and the relative insignificance of <italic>News of the World</italic> in the total scale of the empire, reinforced by the dramatic decision to close it.</p>
<p>Many commentators have accepted this logic about the <italic>News of the World</italic> in particular (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527476411426795">Sheehan 2011</xref>) and newspapers in general, which have declined from 90 percent of News Corp’s revenue in 1980 to just 11 percent in 2010 (<italic>Financial Times</italic> 2011).</p>
<p>However, it is a mistake to simply equate revenue shares with significance. Historically—especially after the move to Wapping—the <italic>News of the World</italic> and the <italic>Sun</italic> were the cash cows that made Murdoch’s expansion into satellite and into America possible. But even today, these two biggest circulating of all Murdoch newspapers, are important for their political clout, for the political leverage they gave him in Britain.</p>
<p>When former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his spin doctor Alastair Campbell came rushing to Australia to court Murdoch, it was not because of what might be carried on Sky News. Current British Prime Minister David Cameron did not spend years ingratiating himself with Murdoch’s inner British circle in the hope of gaining favorable editorials in the <italic>Times</italic>.</p>
<p>For both prime ministers, the key consideration was to gain the support of the Murdoch tabloids, and this is so for two reasons.</p>
<p>The first is because the readership of his tabloid titles overlaps with a strategically important part of the British electorate, of people who are working class but also socially conservative. When Britain was a much more working-class country than it is now, the great Conservative Prime Minister Benjamin D’Israeli saw the importance of wooing these people, whom he called “angels in marble” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527476411426795">McKenzie and Silver 1968</xref>), that is those who by economic position would be inclined to vote Labour but for whom other appeals, such as nation, race, and order, were of overriding concern and they voted Conservative.</p>
<p>The other tabloids have not changed their partisanship in recent decades, but Murdoch very occasionally has. There is a close correlation between what party he supported and which party won the election, although it would be a mistake to assert his support caused the result. Most often, Murdoch’s changes have occurred when there has been a clear and obvious shift in public sentiment, and political leaders, always keen to make a sure thing even surer, have still been keen for his support in elections they almost certainly would have won anyway. Perhaps only in 1992, when the front page of the paper famously proclaimed “it was the <italic>Sun</italic> wot won it,” might the Murdoch press be attributed an important role in producing the outcome.</p>
<p>The second is these papers’ congenital unfairness. Both the paper’s “sense of entitlement and zeal for bullying” were on display just five months after that 1992 election when Britain was forced to withdraw from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Prime Minister John Major called Kelvin MacKenzie to ask how the <italic>Sun</italic> planned to cover it. McKenzie replied “I’ve got a large bucket of shit lying on my desk, and tomorrow morning I’m going to pour it all over your head” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527476411426795">Massie 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Once a leader was out of favor nothing was out of bounds, and yet the politicians were still held in what Timothy Garton Ash called “a fear that dared not speak its name; a self-deceiving cowardice that cloaked itself in silence, euphemism and excuse. . . . Gordon Brown tells us he was reduced to tears after the then editor of the Sun, Rebekah Wade, rang him to say that the paper was going to reveal that his four year old son Fraser had cystic fibrosis. Yet a few years later Brown still attended the wedding of said Rebekah—who is now, as Rebekah Brooks, Murdoch’s right hand woman at News International” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527476411426795">Ash 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>A “realist” perspective—one that concentrated only on material power and resources and self-interest—would suggest that after what Lord Macaulay once called the ridiculous spectacle of the “British public in one of its periodic fits of morality” has passed, the status quo, the old relationships of power and patronage, would return. Despite the temporary embarrassments they have suffered, this view is that the power of Murdoch and News Corp would remain intact.</p>
<p>My guess is that the consequences will be more far-reaching. Carl Bernstein, of Woodward and Bernstein, the investigative reporters whose work eventually led to the resignation of President Nixon, has called it Murdoch’s Watergate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527476411426795">Bernstein 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>It is a suggestive but inexact comparison. Both cases began because of offenses that the leader did not know about, but happened precisely because of the organizational culture and ethos they had fostered. Both thought they could rely on “plausible deniability” (the phrase being a Nixon White House invention) to contain the scandals.</p>
<p>Then in Watergate, the cover-up and its unraveling did even more damage than the original offense, and a similar process could be at work in the Murdoch scandal. The Woodward-Bernstein book was called <italic>All the President’s Men</italic> and the title captures the process. At each stage, when one group of participants were caught they implicated the next layer in, creating a dynamic where the previously impenetrable solidarity of allies disintegrated into an inchoate mass of individuals each scrambling for survival.</p>
<p>Already, similar unraveling is evident among those involved in the phone hacking scandals. A day after James Murdoch testified to the House of Commons committee in July, two senior figures in News Corp—lawyer Tom Crone and <italic>News of the World</italic> editor Colin Myler—contradicted his evidence on a crucial point, about whether he knew why a payment had been made to the Football Association’s Gordon Taylor in order to stop a court case. It is likely to be the first of many such contradictions, as the micro-interests of individuals under direct threat drive them to implicate or deflect blame onto others.</p>
<p>In the end, President Nixon resigned in the face of congressional votes that would have forced him out of office. No such democratic process can force Murdoch out. He and his family still control by far the biggest bloc of voting shares. Nevertheless, he is not immune from shareholder sentiment. The Murdoch model of governance—a docile Board, acquiescent management in thrall to the genius of their CEO, and a “whatever it takes” ethic—is likely to come under continuing challenge.</p>
<p>Certainly News Corp as a major corporation with interests in television, satellite television, films, pay TV channels, as well as newspapers, will survive. The larger issue is about its governance arrangements, the continuing role of Rupert and his children, and then whether these changes in corporate governance will bring changes in priorities and strategies. We are still in the early stages of a process whose end cannot be foreseen. It is not yet possible to know the magnitude of the carnage from the hacking scandal earthquake.</p>
