<p>Robert Lemon’s thesis is that familiar strategies of postcolonial criticism fail to recognize the specific character of Austrian history and literature. Unlike other European powers, including Germany between 1884 and 1919, the Austro-Hungarian Empire had no overseas colonies. However, it had in other ways an exceptionally close relationship to the East. Vienna, which withstood a Turkish siege as recently as 1683, was traditionally the <italic>porta Orientis</italic> or ‘gateway to the East’. Metternich (quoted here, p. 19) famously said: ‘Asien fängt auf der Landstraße an’, referring to the inner suburbs immediately east of the city centre. In 1878 the annexation of Bosnia brought a significant Muslim population into the Empire. It has been argued that the dominant German-speaking population exercised a colonial rule over the Empire’s Slav peoples, but Lemon is rightly sceptical of this approach. The important point is that Austrians were not colonial administrators. Hence, while other Europeans used stereotypes of the Oriental other to strengthen their distinct identity and their right to rule, Austrians had the freedom to question the very idea of empire. In their fiction, imperial identities are undermined and obscured.</p>
<p>The texts analysed in the light of this thesis are Hofmannsthal’s <italic>Märchen der 672</italic>. Nacht and his poem ‘Der Kaiser von China spricht’; Musil’s <italic>Die Verwirrungen des Zöglings Törleß</italic>; and several short texts by Kafka. At the risk of pedantry, one might wonder if all of these are distinctively Austrian. Musil wrote <italic>Törleß</italic> while living in Berlin. Kafka’s ‘In der Strafkolonie’ may well, as Paul Peters has argued, have been inspired partly by reading about atrocities committed in German colonies. However, Lemon is surely right in seeing the large, unstable, fissile Habsburg Empire reflected in Kafka’s Chinese stories, in the fantasies about Alexander the Great’s empire that help to structure Hofmannsthal’s <italic>Märchen</italic>, and in ‘Der Kaiser von China spricht’, where the image of concentric circles suggests the topography of Vienna with the Ringstraße and the Gürtel. With <italic>Törleß</italic>, although Lemon takes issue with J. P. Stern’s essay ‘The Education of the Master Race’, his argument seems to me to confirm Stern’s conclusion by showing that <italic>Törleß</italic> internalizes and thus overcomes the initially menacing alterity embodied in Boena and Basini.</p>
<p>Though he covers much familiar ground, Lemon also makes some new and telling points, especially when he discerns classical allusions, relating the savage horses in the <italic>Märchen</italic> to Alexander’s Bucephalus, and the invaders in ‘Ein altes Blatt’ to Tacitus’ description of the ancient Germans. Most of the book consists of lengthy close readings of a small number of texts, based on thorough knowledge of secondary literature. Stressing the ambiguity and complexity of the texts, Lemon convincingly questions attempts at simple identification (e.g. of the jackals in ‘Schakale und Araber’ with Jews).</p>
<p>In formulating his overall thesis, Lemon mentions a few criticisms of Said, but on the whole he accepts the concept of Orientalism, only doubting its applicability to Austria. However, Orientalism has received much more, and more damaging, criticism (from John Mackenzie, Bart Moore-Gilbert, Robert Irwin and many others). It is surely time for a paradigm shift into a new and more sensitive way of studying intercultural relations.</p>
