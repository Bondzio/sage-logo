<p>Flame-retardant additives used in plastics are based on halogen, phosphorus, inorganic compounds, and minerals. In this study, the use of bismuth trioxide as synergistic agent with brominated flame retardant is investigated and compared to formulations with antimony trioxide. Decabromodiphenyl ether and metal trioxide were incorporated in a polymer matrix via single-screw extrusion. The samples were classified with the UL 94 vertical burning protocol and studied with thermogravimetric analysis. The general combustion and heat release behaviors were studied via cone calorimeter. Results showed that 4% (wt) Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> displayed a synergistic effect with 12% (wt) of the halogen compound to achieve V-0.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Most modern plastics are made from hydrocarbon feedstocks and therefore are combustible. When these materials are used in applications for buildings and structures, aircraft or public transport, and electronic devices, these materials must be processed and formulated so as to become difficult to ignite or burn near a heat source.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734904112456004">1</xref></sup> High-impact polystyrene (HIPS) is composed of polybutadiene with grafting of polystyrene chains and is widely used for injection molding materials. For applications in electrical and electronic goods, additives are incorporated into the plastic to give flammability resistance, and these are usually brominated compounds and a synergist due to their high cost-effectiveness and the fact that typical loading levels of these additives do not negatively affect mechanical performance. Among these brominated compounds commonly used for polystyrene, hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), and decabromodiphenyl ether (DECA) are the most commonly cited, even only DECA is used in HIPS as HBCD is not effective in flammability tests for electrical and electronic goods. DECA has been the most widely used flame retardant for HIPS due to its low cost and high loading of bromine (83%) in its structure. This high loading of bromine means that it is particularly effective at low loadings, which does not negatively affect other polymer properties. This fact has led to DECA being optimized to work well with HIPS for flame retardancy while not negatively affecting too many other polymer properties.</p>
<p>These brominated retardants are generally used in combination with synergists, especially antimony trioxide, which in itself is not a flame retardant. As shown previously,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734904112456004">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734904112456004">3</xref></sup> the synergists enhance the efficiency of the compounds, since the metal halide formed during the combustion reacts on several occasions with the radicals formed by the burning of the polymer. The particles of oxides or hydroxides resulting from these reactions can also catalyze a recombination of the radicals, leading to an eventual termination of radical propagation, which in turn causes the flame to self-extinguish. Group V of the periodic table (N, P, As, Sb, and Bi) can carry out these types of reactions. Due to practicality of the chemistry of these oxides to use in the polymers, N, P, and As are not used in oxide form but have shown synergism with halogen. So Sb and Bi oxides are the only ones to be considered in this study since their oxides are stable to melt compounding conditions and do not have strong toxicity (such as arsenic oxide). Thus, SbX and BiX have a dual activity in reactions, such as flame retarding and providing HX species and their metal oxides, since both promote a catalytic removal of reactive radicals in the flame. This phenomenon has been well studied recently,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734904112456004">4</xref></sup> and studies on this synergism go back even further to 1972–1986.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734904112456004">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734904112456004"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734904112456004"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734904112456004"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734904112456004">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In recent years, the pair of DECA and antimony trioxide has been widely used, especially for polystyrene. Due to increasing demand of flame-retardant polymers, there is a need to propose new reagents that can replace with similar efficiency, especially antimony trioxide, obtained from mineral extraction. Bismuth oxide is found naturally as the mineral bismite (monoclinic) in the form of crystals with colors from yellow green to yellow, mainly in Bolivia, Mexico, and Japan. Among metals considered “heavy,” bismuth oxide has lower toxicity and thus might be a good substitute for antimony trioxide as antimony trioxide gets deselected due to environmental (European Electronic Waste Regulations) or cost issues.</p>
<p>In this work, the use of bismuth trioxide as synergist agent with a brominated flame retardant (DECA) is investigated and compared to formulations with antimony trioxide in compositions with HIPS. The resulting composites are characterized with respect to thermal stability (thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)) and flammability performance (Underwriter’s Laboratory Test 94 (UL-94) vertical burning test and cone calorimetry).</p>

<title>Experiment</title>
<p>The high impact polystyrene (HIPS) was produced by Innova S/A. Decabromodiphenyl ether (DECA), with the trade name Saytex 102E of ALBEMARLE CORP., was used as the halogenated flame retardant. Antimony trioxide (Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-abbreviated hereafter as SbO) was provided by FORMIQUÍMICA and bismuth trioxide (Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>- abbreviated hereafter as BO) were purchased from FLUKA, and both evaluated as synergists. The polymeric material (HIPS) was dried in an oven at 60°C for 24 h to remove moisture from the material and avoid interference during the extrusion process. The other reagents were used without drying or any pretreatment.</p>
<p>The compositions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734904112456004">Table 1</xref>) were weighed and mixed manually. A single-screw extruder of 14 mm L/D 30 from AX Plastics was employed in all extrusions. The temperature zones ranging from 190°C to 197°C with constant rotation of 45 r/min. Each formulation was extruded three times to ensure good incorporation of flame-retardant compounds in the polymer matrix.</p>

<p>The flammability tests were performed following ASTM D3801-06,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734904112456004">10</xref></sup> by burning in a vertical position. According to the standard, we tested five specimens with defined dimensions (125 mm × 13 mm × 5 mm) for each formulation. This standard is used for the UL-94, which used to rate the fire safety performance of plastics used in electronic and electrical goods. It should be noted though that while we tested according to this protocol and used the ratings listed in the test protocol, our results are not certified V-0, V-1, or V-2 ratings. Rather, they are an approximation of what we believe the ratings would be if one follows ASTM D3801-06 and submitted the samples to a UL-94 certified testing lab. TGAs were conducted on a Shimadzu TGA-50 equipment, under inert atmosphere with a N<sub>2</sub> flux of 50 mL/min and heating rate of 10°C/min, until the final temperature, 600°C, was reached.</p>
<p>Combustion behavior was assessed according to ASTM E 1354-10 using a Fire Testing Technology (FTT) dual cone calorimeter apparatus. The samples were irradiated at 35 kW/m<sup>2</sup>, and the exhaust gas flow rate was 24 L/s. Samples were molded on a heat press with defined dimensions (100 mm × 100 mm × 5 mm) and were wrapped in aluminum foil and tested without frame and grid. The only deviation from the ASTM method was to test each sample once rather than in triplicate as per the standard. This was done due to the limited amount of material available. Since we believe the samples to be homogeneous in composition, we believe that the single-point data are still within the standard 10% error for the technique, but we admit that the error is ultimately unknown since we do not have triplicate test data. However, the samples were well behaved during testing and should yield heat release (HR) data within the 10% error.</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>The derivative thermogravimetric analysis (DTG) curves for pure HIPS and the samples SbO 12:4 and BO 12:4 with the same concentrations by weight of synergist are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734904112456004">Figure 1</xref>. The decomposition of the pure polymer matrix is between 380°C and 500°C, with a prominent peak at ~450°C. For samples containing oxides, the decomposition follows different paths, occurring in two distinct regions. For sample SbO 12:4, containing antimony oxide, the first decomposition peak appears at ~360°C, starting at ~90°C below the temperature displayed by the pure matrix. This behavior indicates that the oxide begins to degrade via reactions with the brominated flame retardant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734904112456004">11</xref></sup> The behavior of bismuth oxide, in turn, can be considered similar to the curve of SbO 12:4, the difference being that the first decomposition peak appeared at ~340°C, about 20°C below the temperature observed for Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in the same conditions. The lower temperature of degradation of the metal oxides, such as Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is important because it forms a volatile product that slows reactions in the flame, and even though the oxide itself has no effect, it reacts with the halogen flame retardant increasing its efficiency. The second peak appears at around ~415°C–425°C and represents the degradation of the brominated flame retardant and the polymer.</p>

For the sample of HIPS without any flame retardant, the specimens were not classified; they burned completely, presenting dripping of the melting polymer on fire during burning. The sample SbO 6:2 also presented dripping, and the fire self-extinguished just after 30 s of being nonclassified by vertical UL-94 test. Sample SbO 9:3 burned after exposure to the flame but self-extinguished in 2 s. Since the sample SbO 12:4 showed no afterglow in the char once the flame extinguished, it was classified as V-0.</p>

<p>The sample BO 9:3 presented a similar behavior to SbO 6:2. It did not reach the UL-94 classification although their average burning time was 33 s. The samples BO 12:4 burned for just 2 s, while samples BO 15:5 did not present the formation of flaming drip away from the rest of the specimen, thus extinguishing the fire. However, it was observed that only the samples with burning time over 30 s (nonclassified) presented dripping and burned the cotton. The phenomenon of incandescence (char afterglow) was not observed in any of the BO samples. When analyzing the results of UL-94 for the mixtures with equal weight concentrations of flame retardants (samples SbO 9:3 and BO 9:3), it may be noted that the bismuth trioxide was not as effective as antimony trioxide. Two possible explanations could be formulated to explain this difference. The molecular weight of bismuth trioxide (465.96 g/mol) is considerably higher when compared to antimony trioxide (291.52 g/mol). This means that the same weight-based formulation has a molar concentration of bismuth trioxide much lower than that of antimony trioxide. The second factor lays on the reactions in the vapor phase. The reactions of bismuth trioxide and DECA in the condensed phase lead to less-volatile species in relation to antimony halides, thus reducing the flame-inhibiting reactions in the gas phase and decreasing the effectiveness of the material as a synergist agent. To verify the effect of the number of moles of Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> at the composition, a new extrusion, BO 9:4.8, was performed keeping the number of moles of Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> equal to the number of moles of Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in the composition of SbO 9:3. However, BO 9:4.8 did not reach the UL-94 classification, indicating that vapor phase reactions still play a major role in the action of synergism between DECA and antimony trioxide or bismuth trioxide, and for whatever reason, BO does not produce the same concentration of metal halide species in the flame essential to self-extinguishing behavior. However, the vapor pressure of BiBr<sub>3</sub> (should that be the species formed in these conditions) is much lower than that of SbBr<sub>3</sub>, so if less of the metal halide is volatilized in the small flame of the UL-94 ignition source, then perhaps this result is not that surprising. The cone calorimeter data for all five samples tested are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734904112456004">Table 3</xref>. HIPS without any flame retardant showed the higher flammability overall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734904112456004">Figure 2</xref>). The addition of Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and DECA yielded some decrease in peak heat release rate (HRR) and total HR but not as great as that observed with samples with antimony trioxide. About vapor pressures and molecular weights of the Bi and Sb halides, perhaps at higher heat flux, Bi may show more of a flame-retardant effect (HR reduction) when it is successfully volatilized.</p>

<p>From the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734904112456004">Table 3</xref>, we can see that the addition of DECA and SbO or BO results in reductions in peak HRR and average HRR, but the results are mixed with regard to performance. While the use of BO lowers peak HRR, it does not reduce total HR or average HRR as much as the use of SbO does. Going back to the commentary on BiBr<sub>3</sub> not being as volatile as SbBr<sub>3</sub> under fire conditions, we can see this in the flammability measurements, especially when studying the smoke release and effective heat of combustion measurements. The use of SbO results in more vapor phase flame retardancy, which causes an increase in smoke, a lower total HR, and a lower effective heat of combustion. Because SbO can form more volatile antimony bromide, it is a more effective flame retardant. However, the drawback to this will be an increase in smoke. BO on the other hand is not as effective as SbO in reducing HR, but it generates less smoke than base HIPS, which suggests that provided BO meets other flammability tests (such as UL-94 V), the use of BO may present a useful compromise performance of vapor phase activity with a lower amount of smoke release during burning. More studies would be needed though to verify this level of performance that improved fire safety could be obtained with BO with lower smoke and a good balance of properties (mechanical, fire) in the final product. Observed fire behavior during burning was as follows: Upon exposure to the heater, the sample with HIPS slowly began to darken and give a surface appearance of being molten. Later the sample began to smoke and then finally ignited. The sample burned with a high-intensity sooty flame. As the sample began to burn itself out, the edges of the aluminum foil curled up such that it was difficult to close the cone calorimeter heat shutters at the end of the experiment. Final char (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734904112456004">Figure 3</xref>) was mostly black soot and some char residue on the aluminum foil. All of the samples with HIPS and antimony trioxide showed the same fire behavior. Upon exposure to the cone heater, the surface went from glossy to blistered (small bubbles starting to form). The sample then began to smoke and flashed a few times before sustained ignition occurred. After ignition, the flames were unsteady and pulsating at the surface, and underneath the flames, the sample could be seen to be boiling away, which is likely the cause for the observed unsteady flames. After burning for a little while, the samples extinguished and left behind some black/grey chars (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734904112456004">Figure 3</xref>). For sample SbO 9:3, the char was again mostly at the edges of the aluminum foil holder, but the foil was intact and some network/webbing type chars could be made out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734904112456004">Figure 3(b)</xref>).</p>

<p>Fire behavior of the sample with bismuth trioxide was similar to that of the virgin HIPS, with the sample yielding a very large vigorous flame during burning with some small flamelets coming out around the edge of the sample, but eventually the entire flame smoothed out into a uniform single flame around 150 s into the test. Also, while the surface melted a bit, it did show some surface roughness. Finally, right before extinguishment, a green flame was observed. The final char showed a gold-colored char at the edges of the sample with black char in the middle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734904112456004">Figure 4(a)</xref>). However, this char smoldered a bit after removal from the cone calorimeter and once that char had fully cooled, almost all of the black ash had burned away leaving the gold-colored residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734904112456004">Figure 4(b)</xref>). The colors in the flames are likely from some sort of bismuth halide species.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results showed that the formulations with 88% HIPS, 9% DECA, and 3% Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> achieved a V-0 rating. However, the formulation with the same concentration of flame retardant but with bismuth trioxide instead of antimony trioxide was not classified by UL-94 standards. The reactions of bismuth trioxide and DECA in the condensed phase lead to less-volatile species in relation to antimony halides, reducing the reactions promoted in the gas phase and decreasing the effectiveness of the material as a synergist agent. Increasing the amount of flame retardants, 84% HIPS, 12% DECA, and 4% Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, the polymeric material reached V-0 rating. The burning behavior was very similar to the specimens with 88% HIPS, 9% DECA, and 3% Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, indicating that the synergistic action of these agents are similar, although Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> should be used in higher concentrations to get similar flame retardancy.</p>
<p>The addition of Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and DECA yielded some decrease in peak HRR and total HR when compared to pure HIPS, but it was not as great as that observed with samples with antimony trioxide. So while Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> does have some effectiveness as a brominated flame-retardant synergist and should be less toxic than Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, it is not as effective as antimony oxide and is not a 1:1 replacement for that synergist. Further, it shows some different burning behavior that may (lower smoke) or may not be useful (char smoldering in the cone calorimeter) from a fire safety perspective. Still, if antimony oxide were to be deselected from use due to economic or environmental reasons, bismuth oxide may have some viability as a replacement provided it is kept in mind that it is not as effective per unit of weight.</p>
