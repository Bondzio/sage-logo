<abstract>
<p>The physicochemical components and functional properties of the gum exudates from the trunk of the almond tree (<italic>Prunus dulcis</italic>) have been investigated, along with the emulsification and foaming properties. The gum exudates are composed on dry weight basis by 2.45% of proteins, 0.85% of fats and 92.36% of carbohydrates. The latter consist of arabinose, xylitol, galactose and uronic acid (46.8 : 10.9 : 35.5 : 6.0 mass ratio) with traces of rhamnose, mannose and glucose. Moreover, gum exudates are rich in minerals, such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and iron. The emulsifying capacity was studied for a 20% w/w olive oil in water emulsion as a function of gum concentration (from 3% to 12% w/w in the aqueous phase) as well as pH levels (from 3.0 to 10.0). The most stable and homogeneous emulsion was prepared with an 8% w/w aqueous almond gum solution at a pH between 5.0 and 8.0. In particular, for the same formulation, the emulsion processed by high pressure homogenization (5 passes at 200 MPa) resulted to be extremely stable under accelerated ageing, exhibiting no significant change in droplet size distribution for 14 days at 55 °C. All the tested systems exhibited an extremely low foaming capacity.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1082013211415173" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>A large number of systems incorporated in cosmetic and food products are in the form of oil in water emulsions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1082013211415173">Tan, 1998</xref>). Stabilizing an emulsion requires not only a source of energy to homogenize the immiscible phases but also includes an emulsifier with surface active properties, such as hydrocolloids gums. They are hydrophilic polymers, which have a high molecular weight as well as the ability to increase the viscosity of the solutions in which they are suspended. They are used in food emulsions not only as emulsifiers and stabilizers but also as foaming and gelling agents, due to their functional properties.</p>
<p>Food hydrocolloids are either polysaccharides (i.e. xanthan gum, carrageenan gum, gum arabic, starch, pectin) or proteins (i.e. gelatin). Polysaccharides secreted by plants or synthesized by microorganisms are known as gums (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013211415173">Sciarini et al., 2009</xref>). They are used to modify the texture and the appearance of food products, as well as improve the preservation of foodstuffs due to their ability to absorb water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1082013211415173">Rosell et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Gum arabic from <italic>Acacia senegal</italic> is the most well-known natural gum, and is widely used as an emulsifier in the food industry. It was accepted as a healthy and non-toxic food additive in 1982 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013211415173">FAO, 1982</xref>). It is a complex branched polysaccharide mainly composed of 39–42% galactose, 24–27% arabinose, 12–16% rhamnose and 15–16% glucuronic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013211415173">Idris et al., 1998</xref>). It is also rich in calcium, potassium, magnesium and sodium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013211415173">Anderson and Stoddart, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1082013211415173">Islam et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1082013211415173">Verbeken et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The cost and availability fluctuations of gum arabic are strong driving forces in seeking novel natural hydrocolloid gums with good functional properties. Several fruit-bearing trees belonging to the Rosaceae family, such as Peach (<italic>Prunus persica</italic>), Damson (<italic>Prunus insitia</italic>), Egg Plum (<italic>Prunus domestica</italic>), Cherry (<italic>Prunus cerasus and Prunus virginiana</italic>) and Almond (<italic>Prunus dulcis</italic>), can produce abundant amounts of gum exudates from the trunk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013211415173">Simas et al., 2008</xref>), as a consequence of a disease (gummosis) and/or a mechanical injury followed by a microbial attack. In particular, the gum exudates from the trunk of the almond trees (<italic>P. dulcis</italic>) represent a potential natural resource of hydrocolloid gums, which are widely available in Tunisia as well as throughout the Mediterranean Africa.</p>
<p>Therefore, the aim of this work was to study the chemical composition and the functional properties (such as emulsifying and foaming capabilities) of the gum collected from the trunk of almond trees (<italic>P. dulcis</italic>).</p>

<sec id="sec3-1082013211415173"><title>Raw materials</title>
<p>The gum samples were collected from different almond trees (<italic>P. dulcis</italic>), in the region of Sidi Bouzid, southern Tunisia, during July 2008, and stored under dry conditions. They were then crushed with a mortar in order to obtain a fine powder, which could be easily dissolved in water. The powder of the almond gum was purified by first dissolving it in water, then filtering it through a Whatman filter paper, and finally dialyzing it for 2 days against tap water.</p>
<p>Subsequently, samples for chemical analysis were further freeze-dried.</p>
<p>Samples for the characterization of the functional properties were prepared from gum suspensions, at different gum concentrations, which were homogenized overnight with a magnetic stirrer and used in the preparation of oil-in-water emulsions.</p>
<p>The commercial olive oil utilized for the preparation of the emulsions (Riviera d’Or) was purchased from a local supermarket in Tunisia.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1082013211415173"><title>Chemical analysis</title>
<p>The fat content of the gum exudates was determined using a Soxhlet apparatus according to the official methods (AOAC), while the dry matter was determined, after dehydration at 105 °C for 24 h in an oven, using a MB45 Moisture Analyzer (Ohaus, Switzerland). The protein content was calculated from the nitrogen content and analyzed by means of a Kjeldahl apparatus. The ash content of the almond gum exudates was determined according to the official methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013211415173">AACC, 2000</xref>), with the carbohydrate content being evaluated by difference.</p>
<p>In order to indentify the neutral sugars, the gum samples were hydrolyzed with a solution of 1 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> at 100 °C for 3 h and converted into alditol acetate according to the Blakeney method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013211415173">Blakeney et al., 1983</xref>). Alditol acetate derivatives were separated and quantified by gas chromatography using a high performance capillary column, BP1-methylsiloxane (30 m × 0.32 mm ID, 0.25 mm film thickness, Scientific Glass Engineering, S.G.E. Pty. Ltd., Melbourne, Australia) mounted on a Hewlett–Packard HP-6890 series GC system (Hewlett–Packard Co., Palo Alto, CA, USA). 2-desoxy-D-glucose (purity &gt;99.5%, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) was used as an internal standard. The total neutral sugars were calculated as the sum of the individual neutral sugars.</p>
<p>Uronic acid was determined using the carbazole method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1082013211415173">Bitter and Muir, 1962</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1082013211415173"><title>Mineral analysis</title>
<p>In order to determine the mineral content of the gum, the ash from the almond exudate solutions was dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid. The solutions obtained were then filtered into a 50 mL flask, which, in turn, was filled up to the mark with ultrapure water. Sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, zinc, iron and copper were determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Analytic Jena, ZEEnit 700, Germany).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1082013211415173"><title>Functional properties of the almond gum exudates</title>
<p>In general, the functional properties of gums are related to their physicochemical composition with regard to the protein and carbohydrate contents. These polymers are best known for their ability to increase the viscosity of the solutions in which they are suspended.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1082013211415173"><title>Viscosity measurements</title>
<p>The intrinsic viscosity of the almond gum was evaluated by measuring the specific viscosities at different concentrations (4%, 5%, 6% and 8% w/w) of the gum in the aqueous phase, with the addition of 0.5 M KCl. The specific viscosity <italic>η<sub>sp</sub></italic> of the gum aqueous solutions was measured using an AVS 400 capillary viscometer (Schott Gerate, Hofhein, Germany) at 20 °C, equipped with an Oswald capillary tube (flow water time 75.15 s). The <italic>η<sub>sp</sub></italic> was related to the gum concentration <italic>C</italic> in order to obtain reduced viscosity <italic>η<sub>red</sub></italic> = <italic>η<sub>sp</sub>/C</italic> (mL/g) according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1082013211415173">Rao (1993)</xref>. The intrinsic viscosity [<italic>η</italic>] was determined by the Huggins equation, shown in equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1082013211415173">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013211415173">Huggins, 1942</xref>)
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1082013211415173"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1082013211415173-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>η<sub>sp</sub></italic> is the specific viscosity, <italic>C</italic> is the polymer concentration and <italic>K<sub>H</sub></italic> is the Huggins constant. The determination of the intrinsic viscosity is therefore, the extrapolation of the reduced viscosity to the value at zero solute concentration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1082013211415173"><title>Emulsion preparation</title>
<p>Aqueous solutions of the almond gum were prepared, at different gum concentrations, which ranged from 3% to 12% w/w, and pH levels.</p>
<p>These solutions were homogenized overnight with a magnetic stirrer and used to determine the foaming capacity of the aqueous phase, as well as to prepare and characterize the oil in water emulsions.</p>
<p>The gum suspensions of different concentrations were mixed with commercial olive oil and homogenized under high shear according to the following procedure: in a beaker containing the aqueous suspension of hydrocolloids gum at different concentration, 20% w/w of olive oil was subsequently added to make a 50 g biphasic system, which was subsequently treated in a high-shear homogenizer (Ultra Turrax STL, Germany) for 10 min at 9000 rpm in order to produce oil-in-water emulsions. The emulsions were then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min (Beckman Coulter Avanti J25, Brea, CA, US), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1082013211415173">Huang et al., 2001</xref>). The pH of the emulsions was regulated to the desired value (between 3.0 and 10.0) by adjusting the pH of the gum aqueous solutions, by adding either 0.1 M NaOH or 0.1 M HCl prior to emulsification.</p>
<p>The emulsions, which resulted to be more stable and sufficiently fluid to be pumped, were further processed by high pressure homogenization (HPH) in order to produce fine emulsions with good physical stability over time. In particular, the pumpability requirement refers to the capability of any emulsion to be sucked by the high pressure pump and be forced through the disruption valve, which were both part of the high pressure homogenizer. The emulsions prepared with the almond gum aqueous solutions at 10% and 12% w/w resulted to be excessively viscous and thick to be processed by the HPH system.</p>
<p>Fine emulsions stabilized by almond gum were prepared by HPH, according to a procedure previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1082013211415173">Donsì et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1082013211415173">2011</xref>). The primary emulsions, produced by high-shear homogenization, were subjected to five passes at 200 MPa through a Nano DeBEE Electric Bench-top Laboratory homogenizer (BEE International, USA), equipped with a 200 µm orifice. After each passage through the homogenizer, the emulsions were cooled down to 5 °C by a heat exchanger fitted immediately downstream of the homogenization valve in order to compensate the significant heating induced by friction losses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1082013211415173"><title>Screening of optimal formulations</title>
<p>The functional properties of the almond gum exudates were initially investigated by screening the formulations with better emulsifying and foaming properties.</p>
<p>The emulsion stability (ES) was calculated as reported in equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1082013211415173">2</xref>)
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-1082013211415173"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1082013211415173-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>E<sub>w</sub></italic> is the remaining emulsion weight after centrifugation and removal of the separated oil or water layers, and <italic>T<sub>w</sub></italic> the total weight of the emulsion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1082013211415173"><title>Physical stability of the emulsions under accelerated aging</title>
<p>The droplet size distributions (DSD) of the HPH-treated emulsions were monitored over time by laser diffraction (Mastersizer 2000, Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). In particular, the DSD was characterized in terms of the <italic>d</italic><sub>0.1</sub>, <italic>d</italic><sub>0.5</sub> and <italic>d</italic><sub>0.9</sub> diameters, where <italic>d<sub>φ</sub></italic> is defined as the diameter such that the fraction <italic>φ</italic> (in volume) of the population is smaller or equal than <italic>d<sub>φ</sub></italic>, with <italic>φ</italic> = 0.1, 0.5 or 0.9. Another significant parameter of the size distribution was considered the diameter <italic>d</italic><sub>4,3</sub>, defined according to equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-1082013211415173">3</xref>)
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-1082013211415173"><label>(3)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1082013211415173-eq3.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>x<sub>i</sub></italic> is the diameter of the single droplet, with the sum being extended to the whole population.</p>
<p>The <italic>d</italic><sub>4,3</sub> value can be considered a reliable indicator of the mean droplet diameter in the case of emulsions (spherical particles).</p>
<p>The emulsions were stored in glass tubes at 55 °C and periodically sampled to measure their DSD by laser diffraction, in order to monitor incipient coalescence phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1082013211415173">Walstra, 1996</xref>). In addition, the emulsion samples were also visually examined in order to detect any sign of destabilisation, such as creaming, which was quantified in terms of the creaming index (CI), defined, similarly to ES, according to equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-1082013211415173">4</xref>)
<disp-formula id="disp-formula4-1082013211415173"><label>(4)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1082013211415173-eq4.tif"/></disp-formula>

<p>Stability tests were carried in duplicate on independent samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1082013211415173"><title>Foaming capacity and stability</title>
<p>One hundred mL of gum suspensions (3%, 5%, 7%, 8%, 10%, 12% w/w in aqueous phase) were whipped at a moderate speed for 5 min with a homogenizer (Philips ESSENCE HR 1357/05). The pH of the gum solutions was adjusted to the final pH (in a range from pH 3.0 to pH 10.0) by adding either 0.1 M NaOH or 0.1 M HCl solutions. The foam volumes generated by the whipping procedure were recorded over time to evaluate the foaming capacity.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013211415173">Table 1</xref>, the polysaccharide and protein content of the almond gum samples were 92.36% and 2.45% w/w, respectively. Both biopolymers contribute to the functional properties of the gum (foaming and emulsifying capacity and gelling properties), as well as to the regulation of the viscosity of the aqueous gum solutions.</p>
<p>The natural pH of the almond gum, measured in an 8% w/w aqueous solutions, was slightly acidic, with an average value of 5.7, which was higher than the pH of Gum arabic, with a reported value of 4.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013211415173">Chikamai, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1082013211415173">Karamalla et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013211415173">Mhinzi, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>All these parameters obviously depend on the season as well as on the cultivation site.</p>
<p>Carbohydrates of the almond gum are mainly constituted of Arabinose (Ara), Xylitol (Xyl), Galactose (Gal) and Uronic acid (46.8 : 10.9 : 35.5 : 6.0 mass ratio), with traces of Rhamnose (Rha), Mannose (Man) and Glucose (Glc) (0.83 : 0.75 : 0.24 mass ratio), thus suggesting an arabinogalactan structure of the gum (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013211415173">Table 1</xref>). The monosaccharide components are similar to those of the Peach gum polysaccharide PPNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013211415173">Simas et al., 2008</xref>), consisting of Ara, Xyl, Man and Gal in a 36 : 7 : 2 : 42 ratio, although PPNA has a greater amount of Gal and Man as well as a lower Ara and Xyl content.</p>
<p>In addition, the mineral content of the almond exudates was determined, due to the importance of the minerals in many functions such as tissues formation, muscular contraction and blood clotting as well as enzymatic activities. Almond trunk gum exudates presented large amounts of minerals, with the main constituents being potassium (1112.3 mg/100 g), magnesium (300 mg/100 g) and calcium (142.5 mg/100 g). The significant amount of minerals in the gum samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013211415173">Table 1</xref>) was probably due to the high concentration of these elements in the soil where the trees grew. The mineral content of the gums is not only related to the cultivation site but is also strongly affected by the age and the species of the tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1082013211415173">Li et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>The ability of a protein to form a stable emulsion is related to its capacity to absorb at the oil–water interface and stabilize the film (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013211415173">Pearce and Kinsella, 1978</xref>). Thus, the protein level in the gum may be the most important factor responsible for the high emulsion stability observed when using the almond trunk gum exudates.</p>
<p>A preliminary screening of the emulsifying properties of the almond gum was carried out, investigating the effect of gum concentration and pH level on primary emulsions, prepared through high-shear homogenization. The effect of gum concentration on the emulsifying properties is directly related to the surface coverage at the water–oil interface, while pH level is important, as it affects the interactions between the surface active molecules, such as the gum polysaccharides and proteins.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013211415173">Figure 1</xref> shows the effects of the gum concentration on the emulsion stability. The data refer to emulsions made with 20% olive oil at a pH value of 5.7 of the almond gum aqueous solutions the emulsions were prepared with. The effect of the pH of the aqueous phase on the emulsion stability is reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013211415173">Figure 2</xref>. In this case, the data refer to emulsions made with an 8% gum aqueous solution and 20% olive oil.

<p>Emulsion stability increased by increasing the almond gum concentration. More specifically, gum concentrations &lt;5% w/w induced creaming phenomena after only 3 h from the preparation of the samples, suggesting a high degree of instability. Higher gum concentrations caused the emulsions to become more homogeneous and more stable, according to the visual observations and emulsion stability measurements.</p>
<p>The results showed that for a 20% w/w olive oil, an almond gum concentration of 7% w/w in the aqueous phase was the minimum required to increase the ES index to &gt;80%, thus suggesting that this almond gum concentration is sufficient to cover the oil–water interface of the oil droplets, which are sufficiently fine to be stable under the centrifugal field. Previously reported results showed that an oil/Gum arabic ratio below 1 was required in order to cover the totality of the oil–water interface and stabilize a sub-micrometer emulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1082013211415173">McNamee et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The increase of the emulsifying capacity and emulsion stability, observed when increasing the gum concentration, may also be ascribed to the increase of the viscosity of the continuous phase, which contributes to improving the kinetic stability of the emulsions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013211415173">Benichou et al., 2004</xref>), due to the reduction of the separation velocity of the emulsion droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013211415173">Damodaran, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1082013211415173">McClements, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In particular, the intrinsic viscosity [<italic>η</italic>] of the almond gum was 1.73 dL/g in 0.5 M KCl at 20 °C. The intrinsic viscosity of the almond gum was lower when compared to that of the arabinogalactans of other gum exudates, such as that of peach gum, which had intrinsic viscosities of 1.95 dL/g in 0.5 M KCl at 22 °C.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013211415173">Figure 2</xref> reports the dependence of the emulsion stability as a function of the pH. It is worth noting that the stable emulsions were obtained for pH values greater than 3.0 and lower than 10.0, with a maximum <italic>ES</italic> value around pH 8.0. The experimental measurements were also corroborated by the visual observations of creaming occurring in the pH 3.0 and pH 10.0 samples.</p>
<p>This behavior could be explained in terms of the interaction between the proteins and the gum polysaccharides for the emulsion stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1082013211415173">Jones and McClements, 2010</xref>). For a pH value significantly higher than the proteins isoelectric point (pH ≫ pI), both the proteins and polysaccharides are negatively charged, with the electrostatic repulsion preventing them from associating in a stable emulsifier. For a pH value lower than the proteins isoelectric point and higher than the acid dissociation constant of the polysaccharides (pK<sub>a</sub> &lt; pH &lt; pI), stable protein–polysaccharide associations are formed, which, depending on the residual charge, may enhance repulsive inter-droplet forces and therefore promote emulsion stability. For a pH value lower than the acid dissociation constant of the polysaccharides (pH ≪ pK<sub>a</sub>), both the proteins and polysaccharides are positively charged, with the electrostatic repulsion preventing them from associating in a stable emulsifier.</p>

Interestingly, the droplet size distributions of the emulsions prepared at pH 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 differed from each other only marginally, and within the experimental error of the image analysis technique applied. It is worth noting that the emulsions at pH = 3.0 and pH = 10.0 were not analyzed due to instability phenomena (phase separation), which progressed relatively quickly, with a transparent serum forming on the bottom of the emulsion already 24 h after preparation. In contrast, the emulsions at all the remaining pH levels were visually stable to creaming for more than 24 h.

<p>On the basis of the preliminary screening results, almond gum based emulsions were prepared by high pressure homogenization at the natural pH of the gum (pH = 5.7) and three different gum concentrations: namely 4%, 6% and 8% w/w of gum in the aqueous solution.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1082013211415173">Figure 4</xref> shows the droplet size distribution (DSD) of the three emulsions immediately after preparation. Interestingly, the DSD slightly differed from each other, with the 8% w/w emulsion exhibiting a <italic>d</italic><sub>4,3</sub> = 2.8 µm, which is measurably smaller than the <italic>d</italic><sub>4,3</sub> of 6% and 4% w/w emulsions (3.0 and 3.4 µm respectively).

<p>The initial DSD data already suggest that 6% and especially 4% w/w concentrations of almond gum in the aqueous phase are not sufficient to fully cover and thus stabilize an emulsion hosting a 20% w/w olive oil disperse phase.

<p>Remarkably, the DSD curves of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1082013211415173">Figure 4</xref> clearly show that the 8% emulsion was significantly more stable than the 4% and 6% emulsions, without any sign of physical instability after 7 or 14 days and with a constant <italic>d</italic><sub>4,3</sub> value. In contrast, the 4% emulsion and, at a more limited extent, the 6% emulsion, exhibited the appearance of secondary peaks in the distribution and the increase of the <italic>d</italic><sub>4,3</sub> values.</p>
<p>The homogeneity and physical stability of the emulsions over time is more evident from the evolution of <italic>d</italic><sub>0.1</sub>, <italic>d</italic><sub>0.5</sub> and <italic>d</italic><sub>0.9</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1082013211415173">Figure 5</xref>) as well as of the creaming index CI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1082013211415173">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
<p>In particular, the <italic>d</italic><sub>0.1</sub>, <italic>d</italic><sub>0.5</sub> and <italic>d</italic><sub>0.9</sub> values are significantly closer for the 8% emulsion (they were between 2 and 4 µm) than for the 6% emulsion (they were between 2 and 5 µm) and for the 4% emulsion (they were between 1.5 and 6 µm), suggesting that a higher gum concentration is required in order to obtain a more uniform surface coverage and thus a more homogeneous and narrowly distributed emulsion. In addition, the 8% emulsion was also very stable, without any variation over time of the <italic>d</italic><sub>0.1</sub>, <italic>d</italic><sub>0.5</sub> and <italic>d</italic><sub>0.9</sub> values. In contrast, the 6% emulsion exhibited a slight increase of the <italic>d</italic><sub>0.9</sub> values over the 14 days of storage, while the 4% emulsion exhibited the greatest variations, with all the <italic>d</italic><sub>0.1</sub>, <italic>d</italic><sub>0.5</sub> and <italic>d</italic><sub>0.9</sub> values increasing or fluctuating over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1082013211415173">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
<p>The fluctuations of the 4% emulsion can be ascribed to the occurrence of instability phenomena, which led to evident phase separation after 5 days at 55 °C, as shown by the corresponding creaming index, which reached values &gt;50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1082013211415173">Figure 6</xref>), as a consequence of the separation at the bottom of an aqueous serum. The 6% emulsion exhibited a more limited degree of physical instability, with a creaming index reaching an asymptotic value of 20% after 7 days. In contrast, the 8% emulsion confirmed to be the most stable formulation, with the separation of an aqueous serum only for about 5% of the total emulsion volume after 14 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1082013211415173">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
<p>In particular, the reason for the optimal gum concentration being at 8% w/w (in the aqueous solution) could be noted in the balance among the efficiency of the emulsification process, the rate of formation of an emulsifier film at the oil–water interface and the rate of coalescence and separation.</p>
<p>If the gum concentration is excessively high, the viscosity of the continuous phase is significantly increased and, consequently, the mean diameter of the oil droplets becomes larger. This may be related to the deformation energy requirements during homogenization. In fact, it appears that the higher the continuous phase viscosity the lower the efficiency of the homogenization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1082013211415173">McClements, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1082013211415173">Walstra, 1996</xref>). On the other hand, at low emulsifier concentrations the film formation rate is slow (low driving force), therefore increasing the extent of coalescence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-1082013211415173"><title>Foaming capacity and stability: effect of pH and gum concentration</title>
<p>The ability of gum exudates suspensions prepared under different conditions (various pH and gum concentrations) to produce a stable foam was also studied. The results showed that these solutions conferred a very low foaming capacity as well as foam stability. In fact, the foam disappeared after just 2 min of observation. This is related to the proteins content of the gum, their molecular weight and nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013211415173">Agboola et al., 2007</xref>), as well as to the presence of the other compounds in the biopolymer composition. The proteins present in this gum were unable to significantly unfold at the interface when air was incorporated into the aqueous phase.</p>
<p>Several hypotheses can be made to explain this behavior. First of all, the observed phenomenon could be due to the high molecular weight of the proteins. Secondly, the proteins could contain a significant amount of disulphide bonds that prevent their migration at the air–water interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013211415173">Dickinson, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, it is also possible to assume that, due to the significant amount of the carbohydrates fraction, the migration of the protein at the air–water interface is impeded. Carbohydrates are, in fact, characterized by their water-holding ability and their gelling properties. Therefore, they are able to prevent foaming formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013211415173">Dickinson, 1992</xref>). Similar results were previously reported in a study on the foaming capacity of Australian wattle seed extracts of <italic>Acacia victoriae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013211415173">Ee et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>The growing interest in the use of natural hydrocolloid gums, as an alternative to gum arabic, in the formulation of functional foods, is at the basis of this work. In particular, the use of gum exudates collected from the trunk of almond trees (<italic>P. dulcis)</italic> in the formation of food colloidal systems was discussed. The chemical composition as well as the physicochemical characteristics of the gum were determined, showing that high amounts of carbohydrates and proteins as well as a low fat level are present. The exudates are also relatively rich in minerals, especially potassium, magnesium and calcium.</p>
<p>Different gum concentrations were used in the preparation of the emulsions, with the pH of the water phase also being changed in order to understand the effects of both parameters on the emulsion stability. The smaller mean droplets size (2.8 µm) was obtained for the emulsions produced through the high pressure homogenization of 20% w/w olive oil with an 8% w/w gum aqueous solution, in a pH range between 5.0 and 9.0. In particular, the 8% gum emulsion resulted to be extremely stable under accelerated ageing at 55 °C for 14 days, without any change in the mean droplet size.</p>
<p>In contrast, the almond tree gum exudates resulted to be unsuitable for the formation of stable foams, which was probably due to the high carbohydrates level as well as the nature of their proteins.</p>
<p>The results obtained so far were able to increase the understanding and knowledge of the possible uses of the gum exudates of almond trees in the formation and stabilization of emulsions, in substitution of either Gum arabic or artificial emulsifiers and stabilizers.</p>
