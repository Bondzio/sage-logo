<abstract>
<p>The authors extended research linking individual differences in consideration of future consequences (CFC) with health behaviors by (a) testing whether individual differences in regulatory focus would mediate that link and (b) highlighting the value of a revised, two-factor CFC-14 scale with subscales assessing concern with future consequences (CFC-Future) and concern with immediate consequences (CFC-Immediate) proper. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the revised CFC-14 scale supported the presence of two highly reliable factors (CFC-Future and CFC-Immediate; αs from .80 to .84). Moreover, structural equation modeling showed that those high in CFC-Future engage in exercise and healthy eating because they adopt a promotion orientation. Future use of the two-factor CFC-14 scale is encouraged to shed additional light on how concern with future and concern with immediate consequences (proper) differentially impact the way people resolve a host of intertemporal dilemmas (e.g., health, financial, and environmental behavior).</p>

<body>
<p>Many health behaviors pose a conflict between the short-term and long-term consequences of one’s actions. For example, in the short run, exercise and healthy eating can require people to sacrifice things that give them pleasure such as sleeping in and eating delicious, high-fat foods. In the long run, however, exercise and healthy eating benefit the individual. Unfortunately, as the growing obesity epidemic confirms, many people fail to exercise and eat healthy foods, suggesting they are either strongly influenced by the immediate consequences of their actions or they fail to consider the long-term benefits of exercise and healthy eating.</p>
<sec id="section1-0146167212449362">
<title>Consideration of Future Consequences (CFC) and Health Behavior</title>
<p>Given their intertemporal nature, one factor that predicts health behaviors is an individual’s CFC (i.e., the extent to which people consider the potential distant outcomes of their current behaviors and are influenced by those potential outcomes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0146167212449362">Strathman, Gleicher, Boninger, &amp; Edwards, 1994</xref>). For example, relative to those scoring low, those scoring high on the CFC scale are more likely to exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167212449362">Adams &amp; Nettle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167212449362">Ouellette, Hessling, Gibbons, Reis-Bergan, &amp; Gerrard, 2005</xref>); control their diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0146167212449362">Piko &amp; Brassai, 2009</xref>); report a lower body mass index (BMI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167212449362">Adams &amp; Nettle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167212449362">Adams &amp; White, 2009</xref>); accept free sunscreen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167212449362">Orbell &amp; Kyriakaki, 2008</xref>); limit sun exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167212449362">Heckman, Wilson, &amp; Ingersoll, 2009</xref>); use a condom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167212449362">Appleby et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167212449362">Dorr, Krueckeberg, Strathman, &amp; Wood, 1999</xref>); get tested for HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167212449362">Dorr et al., 1999</xref>), diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167212449362">Crockett, Weinman, Hankins, &amp; Marteau, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0146167212449362">Orbell &amp; Hagger, 2006</xref>), and colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167212449362">Orbell, Perugini, &amp; Rakow, 2004</xref>); vaccinate their daughters against cervical cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0146167212449362">Morison, Cozzolino, &amp; Orbell, 2010</xref>); take actions to prevent future occurrence of past illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167212449362">Sirois, 2004</xref>); and quit smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167212449362">Kovač &amp; Rise, 2007</xref>). High CFCs are also less likely to use alcohol and tobacco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167212449362">Adams &amp; Nettle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167212449362">Daugherty &amp; Brase, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212449362">Rappange, Brouwer, &amp; Van Exel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0146167212449362">Strathman et al., 1994</xref>) and expose themselves to environments promoting hearing loss (i.e., discotheques; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0146167212449362">Vogel, Brug, Van der Ploeg, &amp; Raat, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0146167212449362">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moving beyond main effects, many CFC/health behavior studies have taken an “interactionist” perspective. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167212449362">Ouellette et al. (2005)</xref> examined how self-generated prototypes (of other exercisers) versus ideal possible selves (of the self in the future) influenced exercise behaviors of low versus high CFCs. Ouellette et al. hypothesized that ideal possible selves (of the self in the future) would be more motivating for high CFCs than for low CFCs, as the ideal possible self is a version of the self that exists in the future. As predicted, high CFCs (but not low CFCs) increased exercise behavior after first considering ideal selves (but not prototypes of other exercisers). Although not predicted, results also showed that low CFCs increased exercise behavior when they considered prototypes of other exercisers (but not ideal selves), which the authors suggest makes sense, in that low CFCs focus on the “here and now” and prototypes are “very much based in the present” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167212449362">Ouellette et al., 2005</xref>; p. 617).</p>
<p>As another example, Orbell and her colleagues have reported a series of studies showing that high CFCs are more likely to engage in screening for diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0146167212449362">Orbell &amp; Hagger, 2006</xref>) and colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167212449362">Orbell et al., 2004</xref>), and accept free sunscreen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167212449362">Orbell &amp; Kyriakaki, 2008</xref>) when health messages emphasize the long-term benefits of these actions, while low CFCs are more likely to take the same actions when health messages emphasize the short-term benefits of these actions. Additional studies support this CFC × Tailored message approach (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167212449362">Kees, Burton, &amp; Tangari, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167212449362">O’Connor, Warttig, Conner, &amp; Lawton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0146167212449362">Strathman et al., 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, several studies have explored mediators between CFC and health behaviors. Such studies have focused on the mediating effect of positive/negative thoughts about cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0146167212449362">Morison et al., 2010</xref>), how procrastination mediates between CFC and health behavior intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167212449362">Sirois, 2004</xref>), and how attitudes, subjective norms, behavior control, and thoughts in response to persuasive messages mediate the impact of the CFC × Message framing interaction on health intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167212449362">Orbell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0146167212449362">Orbell &amp; Hagger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167212449362">Orbell &amp; Kyriakaki, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0146167212449362">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Gaps in the CFC–Health Behavior Literature</title>
<p>The preceding studies demonstrate that CFC predicts a range of health behaviors. At the same time, research linking CFC and health behaviors has at least two important gaps. First, there is growing debate regarding the factor structure of the CFC scale, with several studies arguing for a two-factor as opposed to a one-factor model (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167212449362">Adams, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167212449362">Joireman, Balliet, Sprott, Spangenberg, &amp; Schultz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167212449362">Petrocelli, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212449362">Rappange et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0146167212449362">Toepoel, 2010</xref>). Second, with the few exceptions noted above, little research has attempted to identify mechanisms through which CFC predicts various health behaviors. The present studies address these limitations by reexamining the nature of the CFC construct and testing the hypothesis that CFC predicts an individual’s chronic regulatory focus orientation (i.e., promotion vs. prevention; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167212449362">Higgins et al., 2001</xref>), which in turn predicts exercise and healthy eating attitudes and intentions. Because the distinction between the two CFC subscales is central to our theoretical development, we first consider measurement of the CFC construct.</p>

<sec id="section3-0146167212449362">
<title>CFC: One Factor or Two?</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0146167212449362">Strathman and colleagues (1994)</xref> developed a 12-item scale to measure individual differences in CFC (Items 1-12 in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0146167212449362">appendix</xref>). In keeping with its original conception, the majority of prior research has treated the CFC scale as a unidimensional scale (i.e., an average or sum of the future items and the reverse-coded immediate items). Recently, however, several studies have found that a two-factor model best explains responses to the scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167212449362">Adams, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167212449362">Joireman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167212449362">Petrocelli, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212449362">Rappange et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0146167212449362">Toepoel, 2010</xref>; for an exception, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167212449362">Hevey et al., 2010</xref>). Arguably, the clearest two-factor solution distinguishes between a 7-item CFC-Immediate subscale and a 5-item CFC-Future subscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167212449362">Adams, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167212449362">Joireman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212449362">Rappange et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0146167212449362">Toepoel, 2010</xref>). A two-factor distinction implies that, although individuals may develop a dominant temporal orientation, concern with future and concern with immediate consequences are not polar opposites; that is to say, individuals may consider the future consequences of their actions, the immediate consequences of their actions, or both (for a similar line of reasoning, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0146167212449362">Shipp, Edwards, &amp; Lambert, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0146167212449362">Zimbardo &amp; Boyd, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there appears to be growing support for a two-factor solution, distinguishing between CFC-Future and CFC-Immediate subscales has at least two disadvantages. First, personality researchers have often been criticized for unnecessarily adding new constructs to the large nomological net of existing constructs. Second, a two-factor solution complicates a researcher’s conceptualization and data analysis. Despite these concerns, distinguishing between the two CFC subfactors has several practical and theoretical advantages, as outlined below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0146167212449362">
<title>Practical and Theoretical Advantages of the Two-Factor Distinction</title>
<p>One advantage of a two-factor solution is that it allows researchers to determine whether consideration of <italic>future</italic> consequences (proper) is responsible for a given behavior, or whether the behavior is, in fact, better predicted by a consideration of <italic>immediate</italic> consequences. If researchers adopt a one-factor solution, they reverse code the immediate items and average them with the future items, resulting in a single “CFC score.” Although this single CFC score may predict a given behavior, the appropriate interpretation of this CFC/behavior relationship is not always clear.</p>
<p>For example, assume that the single CFC score correlates at <italic>r</italic> = .50 with exercise. Using the traditional (one-factor) interpretation, one would be tempted to conclude that “people who are concerned with the <italic>future</italic> consequences of their actions are <italic>more likely</italic> to exercise.” This reasoning is apparently logical, as the scale is called the “Consideration of <italic>Future</italic> Consequences Scale,” but a closer look reveals another interpretation: It is possible that the <italic>positive correlation</italic> between CFC and exercise is actually driven <italic>exclusively by the immediate items</italic>. In other words, a positive correlation between CFC and exercise behavior may occur because “people who are concerned with the <italic>immediate</italic> consequences of their actions are <italic>less likely</italic> to exercise.”</p>
<p>By merging the immediate and future items into a single CFC score, as has typically been done, a researcher could be overlooking an important conclusion: Exercise is not driven by a concern with future consequences (e.g., long-term health benefits) but rather by a concern with immediate consequences (e.g., inconvenience). The latter interpretation would have dramatically different implications. The first interpretation suggests that interventions aimed at increasing exercise should focus on convincing people to care about the long-term consequences of exercise (i.e., health benefits exercise can bring). In contrast, the second interpretation suggests that interventions aimed at increasing exercise should focus on decreasing people’s concern with immediate consequences or eliminating those immediate negative consequences altogether.</p>
<p>A second and related advantage of the two-factor solution is that it allows researchers to test competing models regarding how CFC is related to a given outcome. For example, in their article on CFC, ego depletion, and self-control, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167212449362">Joireman et al. (2008)</xref> articulated two competing theoretical models based on the distinction between CFC-Immediate and CFC-Future subscales. Briefly stated, the <italic>susceptibility model</italic> assumes that a high level of CFC-Immediate makes one susceptible to self-control failure, whereas the <italic>buffering model</italic> assumes that a high level of CFC-Future buffers one against self-control failure. As we note below, several studies have supported a two-factor distinction and highlighted the value of the susceptibility and buffering models.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0146167212449362">
<title>Empirical Support for the Two-Factor Distinction</title>
<p>Most studies on the factor structure of the CFC scale have focused exclusively on factor analyses. Albeit important, construct validity studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167212449362">Marsh, 1996</xref>) that explore whether the distinction between the factors matters (i.e., do the CFC subscales differentially relate to various outcomes of interest?) are also critical in determining the value of a two-factor distinction.</p>
<p>For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167212449362">Joireman et al. (2008)</xref> reported a large-scale confirmatory factor analysis supporting the two-factor solution, a correlational study showing that trait self-control was only predicted by the CFC-Immediate subscale, and an experiment showing that the CFC-Immediate subscale moderated the impact of ego depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167212449362">Baumeister, Muraven, &amp; Tice, 2000</xref>) on temporal discounting. Results showed that CFC’s relationship with self-control and temporal discounting is due to a high concern with the <italic>immediate</italic> consequences of behavior rather than low concern with the future consequences of behavior, supporting the susceptibility model.</p>
<p>A more recent study linking CFC with compulsive buying tendencies and credit card debt provided additional support for the susceptibility model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167212449362">Joireman, Kees, &amp; Sprott, 2010</xref>). In that study, high levels of CFC-Immediate magnified the impact of compulsive buying tendencies on credit card debt, whereas the CFC-Future subscale did not predict credit card debt, consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167212449362">Joireman et al.’s (2008)</xref> findings in the domain of self-control.</p>
<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212449362">Rappange et al. (2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0146167212449362">Table 3</xref>) reported results more in line with the buffering model, in that the CFC-Future subscale tended to be a better predictor than the CFC-Immediate subscale of various health beliefs (e.g., “If I live unhealthy, I may die sooner”) and behaviors (e.g., self-reported healthy eating and exercise). Rappange et al. summarized their results by stating, “The important conclusion from [our] findings is that the underlying factors explain different aspects of (health) behavior and, therefore, their distinction is important” (p. 577).</p>
<p>In sum, theoretical and empirical arguments support the distinction between CFC-Future and CFC-Immediate subscales. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167212449362">Joireman et al. (2008)</xref> noted, the reliability of the five-item CFC-Future subscale is often suboptimal (&lt;.70). Accordingly, we added two items to the CFC-Future subscale and evaluated the validity of the revised CFC-14 scale using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. As outlined next, we also tested whether promotion versus prevention regulatory styles mediate the CFC subscales’ relationships with exercise and healthy eating attitudes and intentions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0146167212449362">
<title>Linking Individual Differences in CFC With Regulatory Focus</title>
<p>Regulatory focus theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167212449362">Higgins, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167212449362">Higgins et al., 2001</xref>) proposes that people can adopt one of two goal pursuit strategies. A <italic>promotion orientation</italic> facilitates achieving ideal goals (hopes and aspirations) by focusing an individual’s efforts on eagerly achieving positive outcomes. A <italic>prevention orientation</italic> facilitates achieving ought goals (duties and responsibilities) by focusing an individual’s efforts on vigilantly avoiding negative outcomes. Some studies treat regulatory focus as a state that can be momentarily primed by the situation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167212449362">Cesario, Grant, &amp; Higgins, 2004</xref>). Other studies, like ours, treat regulatory focus as a stable individual difference (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167212449362">Higgins et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0146167212449362">Zhao &amp; Pechmann, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As we explain below, the goal-directed strategies involved in a promotion orientation—ideals, hopes and aspirations, eagerly seeking gains—are likely to arise out of a broader tendency to focus on the <italic>future</italic> consequences of one’s actions, whereas the goal-directed strategies inherent in a prevention focus—oughts, duties and responsibilities, and vigilantly avoiding losses—are likely to arise out of a broader tendency to focus on the <italic>immediate</italic> consequences of one’s actions. Restated, theoretical and empirical considerations suggest that people scoring high on the CFC-Future scale will tend to adopt a promotion orientation, whereas those scoring high on the CFC-Immediate scale will tend to adopt a prevent orientation.</p>
<sec id="section7-0146167212449362">
<title>Ideal Versus Ought Self-Guides and CFC</title>
<p>First, those who focus on the future consequences of their actions should be more likely to adopt ideal self-goals (hopes, aspirations), as ideal goals tend to be abstract and distal, and such construals are more in line with (i.e., provide a better fit with) a future orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167212449362">Fessel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0146167212449362">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2003</xref>). For example, (future-oriented) Julie might exercise because she wants to be “in ideal shape.” Being in ideal shape could mean meeting any number of criteria, such as enhanced cardiovascular functioning, firm muscles, or a sense that she is physically fit. Although some of these criteria can be objectively assessed (e.g., cardiovascular functioning via VO2 max), the range of possible values that qualify as “in shape” may vary considerably from person to person, suggesting that ideal goals tend to be abstract. Moreover, pursuing ideal self-goals typically requires sustained effort over a long period of time, as there is always room for improvement toward an ever higher ideal. In sum, ideal self-goals typically involve striving toward an abstract future goal, which is more appealing for people who consider the future consequences of their actions.</p>
<p>By comparison, people who tend to focus on the immediate consequences of their actions should be more likely to adopt ought self-goals (duties and responsibilities), as these goals tend to be more concrete and proximal, and these construals are more in line with (i.e., provide a better fit with) a present orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167212449362">Fessel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0146167212449362">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2003</xref>). For example, (present-oriented) John might exercise because important people in his life think he “should” exercise. When John does exercise, his friends and family may provide immediate positive feedback (e.g., it’s great that you’re getting into the gym!), and when he does not exercise, his peers may provide immediate negative feedback (e.g., we didn’t see you in the gym yesterday). Regardless of the valence of that feedback, the important point is that the feedback John receives is concrete and (relatively) more immediate (than the long-term gains associated with the ideal self). In sum, ought self-goals more often involve striving toward a concrete immediate goal, which is more appealing for people who consider the immediate consequences of their actions.</p>

<title>Eager Pursuit of Gains Versus Vigilant Avoidance of Losses and CFC</title>
<p>Regulatory focus theory’s emphasis on eagerly seeking positive outcomes versus vigilantly avoiding negative outcomes is also relevant to the CFC construct. For example, an eager pursuit of gains implies a willingness to move away from the (present) status quo in service of obtaining better but potentially uncertain positive future outcomes. Willingness to pursue such (uncertain) outcomes presumably rests in turn on optimism for the hoped-for future outcome. When one sets future goals, one tends to focus on potential successes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167212449362">Gilovich, Kerr, &amp; Medvec, 1993</xref>) and find it easier to envision a better possible future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167212449362">Pennington &amp; Roese, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0146167212449362">Snyder, Rand, &amp; Ritschel, 2006</xref>). For example, assuming that Julie routinely considers the future consequences of her actions, she may be more optimistic that exercise will lead to the positive outcomes associated with her ideal goals, and she may be more likely to set realistic goals and use more effective strategies for achieving those goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0146167212449362">Sohl &amp; Moyer, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>By comparison, vigilant avoidance of losses implies a constant monitoring of threats to one’s present outcomes. This is important, because when people think about achieving an outcome in the <italic>near</italic> future, they tend to focus on possible failures (more than possible successes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167212449362">Gilovich et al., 1993</xref>). This more pessimistic perspective may reduce thoughts about possible ideal goals and shift one’s focus onto actions that are necessary to maintain security and support the status quo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167212449362">Hazlett, Molden, &amp; Sackett, 2011</xref>). For example, if John routinely considers the immediate consequences of his actions, he may be disinclined to strive for future ideals and more likely to set immediate goals related to security (e.g., approval from peers). John’s tendency to focus on immediate outcomes may also make him more likely to accept smaller, immediate outcomes rather than striving for larger, delayed outcomes (i.e., to pursue the status quo).</p>

<title>Empirical Support for the Overlap Between the CFC Subscales and Regulatory Focus Orientations</title>
<p>Several studies support the line of reasoning just advanced. To help organize these studies, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0146167212449362">Table 1</xref> summarizes key differences between promotion and prevention orientations and highlights studies illustrating the overlap between each of these orientations and the CFC construct. For example, with regard to <italic>self-guides</italic>, as noted earlier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167212449362">Ouellette and her colleagues (2005)</xref> found that those scoring high in CFC were more motivated to exercise after contemplating their ideal future self, whereas those low in CFC were more motivated to exercise after contemplating prototypes of other exercisers (which presumably highlighted normative concerns of what one “should do”). With regard to <italic>end goals</italic>, research has shown that those scoring high on the CFC-Future subscale are more likely than those scoring low on the CFC-Future subscale to forgo smaller, certain rewards in favor of larger but less certain rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167212449362">Joireman &amp; Balliet, 2012</xref>), consistent with the idea that CFC-Future is associated with a tendency to focus on “pursuing (uncertain) gains.” Similarly, research has shown that those scoring high on the CFC-Immediate subscale are more likely to opt for smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167212449362">Joireman et al., 2008</xref>), consistent with the idea that CFC-Immediate is associated with a tendency to focus on “preventing (immediate) losses.” Finally, with regard to <italic>cognitive style</italic>s, research has shown that those scoring high in CFC are more optimistic than those scoring low in CFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0146167212449362">O’Brien-McElwee &amp; Brittain, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0146167212449362">Strathman et al., 1994</xref>), suggesting connections with an “eager” style. On the other hand, high scores on the CFC-Immediate subscale are associated with higher trait hostility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167212449362">Joireman, Anderson, &amp; Strathman, 2003</xref>, data reanalyzed at the subscale level), suggesting connections with a more “vigilant” style.</p>

<sec id="section10-0146167212449362">
<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>Based on the CFC/health behavior reviewed at the outset of our article, we predicted that the CFC-Future (CFC-Immediate) subscale would be positively (negatively) correlated with exercise and healthy eating attitudes and intentions. Building on the theoretical and empirical considerations just presented, we further hypothesized that those scoring high in CFC-Future should be more likely than those scoring low in CFC-Future to (chronically) adopt a promotion orientation, while those scoring high on CFC-Immediate should be more likely than those scoring low on CFC-Immediate to (chronically) adopt a prevention orientation. Finally, following this reasoning, we tested the hypothesis that promotion orientation would mediate the link between CFC-Future and exercise/healthy eating outcomes, whereas prevention orientation would mediate the link between CFC-Immediate and exercise/healthy eating outcomes.</p>
<sec id="section11-0146167212449362">
<title>Competing Hypotheses</title>
<p>Although the studies just reviewed provide conceptual support for our hypothesis, at least two studies have shown that those scoring high in CFC are more likely than those scoring low to respond favorably to “vigilant” messages. In one study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167212449362">Kees et al. (2010)</xref> showed that low and high CFCs had similar risk perceptions and attitudes toward ads promoting a healthy diet and exercise using an “eager” style (e.g., seek healthy foods, seek exercise), whereas high CFCs had higher risk perceptions and more favorable attitudes toward ads using a vigilant strategy (e.g., avoid unhealthy foods, avoid inactivity). In another study, high CFCs spent more time reading information on testing for hypertension when the information was presented in a loss frame, whereas low CFCs spent more time reading the information when it was presented in a gain frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167212449362">O’Connor et al., 2009</xref>). Taken together, these studies suggest a competing set of hypotheses, namely, that high levels of CFC-Future will be related to a prevention orientation, whereas high levels of CFC-Immediate will be related to a promotion orientation.</p>
<p>We should also note that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0146167212449362">Zacher and de Lange’s (2011)</xref> study mentioned earlier suggested that regulatory focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167212449362">Lockwood, Jordan, &amp; Kunda, 2002</xref>) precedes time orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146167212449362">Lang &amp; Carstensen, 2002</xref>). Although Zacher and de Lange’s (cross-lagged panel) findings suggest that CFC may mediate the effect of regulatory style, it is important to recognize that their operationalization of future and present orientation is much different than our focus on CFC. In their study, Zacher and de Lange operationalized “future orientation” in terms of optimism over future “opportunities” and “present orientation” in terms of pessimism over future “limitations.” Arguably, Zacher and de Lange operationalize time orientation in more narrow and perhaps transient terms (a perception that one currently has future opportunities vs. limitations). By contrast, we focus on broader individual differences in the tendency to consider the future (vs. immediate) consequences of one’s actions, which we have argued theoretically give rise to (i.e., better fit with) promotion and prevention styles, respectively. Nevertheless, in light of Zacher and de Lange’s findings, we test the competing model suggesting that CFC mediates the link between regulatory style and exercise and healthy eating outcomes.</p>

<title>Overview of Studies</title>
<p>To further evaluate the nature of the CFC construct, and its links with regulatory focus, exercise, and healthy eating, we conducted two studies. In Study 1, we performed an exploratory factor analysis of the new CFC-14 scale and tested a structural model positioning regulatory focus as a mediator between the CFC subscales and exercise attitudes and intentions. In Study 2, we used confirmatory factor analysis on the CFC-14 scale to compare the fit of a one-factor and a two-factor model, and we tested a structural model positioning regulatory focus as a mediator between the CFC subscales and healthy eating attitudes and intentions.</p>

<p>Students enrolled in an introductory marketing class at a large state university participated for course credit.

<title>Measures</title>
<p>As part of a larger survey, participants completed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0146167212449362">Strathman et al.’s (1994)</xref> original CFC-12 scale, along with two additional (future-oriented) items. All items on the CFC-14 scale are shown in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0146167212449362">appendix</xref>. The two new items were written by the first author and were designed to assess, as directly as possible, a “concern with future consequences” proper. Participants responded to each item on a 7-point scale (1 = <italic>very uncharacteristic of me</italic>; 7 = <italic>very characteristic of me</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0146167212449362">3</xref></sup> In addition to the CFC-14 scale, participants completed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167212449362">Lockwood et al.’s (2002)</xref> 18-item measure of regulatory orientation (1 = <italic>not at all true of me</italic>; 7 = <italic>very true of me</italic>). Lockwood et al.’s scale contains two subscales assessing the strength of a promotion orientation (e.g., I frequently imagine how I will achieve my hopes and aspirations.) and a prevention orientation (e.g., In general, I am focused on preventing negative events in my life.), respectively. Both scales showed high internal reliability (Cronbach’s α = .84 and .80).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0146167212449362">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>To gather evidence for the predictive validity of the CFC subscales, and mediation via regulatory focus, we also assessed exercise attitudes and intentions. Exercise attitudes were assessed with three items: (a) regular physical exercise is essential to good health, (b) regular physical activity makes one feel better, and (c) I enjoy physical activity. (Cronbach’s α = .72). Future exercise intentions were assessed with a single item: “Next week, how many times do you plan to exercise (how many different exercise sessions)?”</p>

<title>Exploratory factor analysis</title>
<p>We submitted the CFC-14 to a principal components analysis followed by oblimin rotation. We used an oblimin rotation, as past research has shown that the CFC-Future and CFC-Immediate subscales are (negatively) correlated (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167212449362">Joireman et al., 2008</xref>). Prior to conducting the analysis, we examined three measures to assess the suitability of the data for factor analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167212449362">Field, 2009</xref>): The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin measure (KMO = .85) was acceptably high (in the “very good” range; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167212449362">Field, 2009</xref>); the determinant of the correlation matrix was .004 (exceeding the recommended .00001 value and ruling out multicollinearity); and Bartlett’s test of sphericity was significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(91) = 614.86, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, revealing that the correlations were acceptably large for Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Turning to the main analysis, three eigenvalues exceeded 1 (5.02, 2.14, 1.04), suggesting the possibility of three factors. However, the eigenvalue &gt; 1 criterion is known to lead to overextraction of factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0146167212449362">Zwick &amp; Velicer, 1986</xref>). In addition, an examination of the scree plot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167212449362">Cattell, 1966</xref>) clearly suggested the presence of two factors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0146167212449362">Figure 1</xref>). The two factors explained 51.2% of the variance and were negatively but not strongly correlated (Φ = −.27). The rotated item loadings on the two factors from the pattern matrix are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0146167212449362">Table 2</xref>. As can be seen, all items loaded on their expected factor, and only one item showed a cross loading &gt;.30. A reliability analysis further revealed that the seven-item CFC-Future and CFC-Immediate subscales were highly reliable (respective Cronbach’s αs = .80 and .84). As expected, we also found that the internal reliability of the original five-item CFC-Future subscale was relatively low (α = .70), compared with the seven-item CFC-Future subscale.</p>

<title>Predicting regulatory orientation, exercise attitudes, and intentions</title>
<p>In the introduction, we argued that evidence for a two-factor solution should move beyond factor analysis and include an examination of the CFC subscales’ ability to differentially predict relevant outcomes. Accordingly, in the present study, we evaluated whether the CFC-Future and CFC-Immediate subscales differentially predict regulatory orientation and exercise attitudes and intentions. We also explored whether regulatory orientation would mediate the relationship between the two CFC subscales and the various exercise outcomes. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0146167212449362">Table 3</xref> presents the simple correlations among all relevant variables. To summarize, CFC-Future showed a strong positive correlation with scores on the promotion scale, as well as exercise attitudes and intentions. Promotion orientation was positively related to exercise attitudes and intentions. And exercise attitudes were positively related to exercise intentions. CFC-Immediate correlated negatively with promotion orientation and was not significantly correlated with the exercise outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0146167212449362">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study yielded two important findings. First, in line with five recent articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167212449362">Adams, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167212449362">Joireman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167212449362">Petrocelli, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212449362">Rappange et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0146167212449362">Toepoel, 2010</xref>), the present study supported the presence of two underlying factors on the new CFC-14 scale (CFC-Future and CFC-Immediate), both of which were highly reliable. Second, the present study provided initial support for the hypothesis that the CFC-Future subscale would predict favorable exercise attitudes and intentions through its relationship with a promotion-oriented regulatory style. Moreover, in partial support of our second hypothesis, scores on the CFC-Immediate subscale were positively related to a prevention-oriented style (although, unexpectedly, so were scores on the CFC-Future subscale). In an effort to replicate and extend these findings, Study 2 used confirmatory factor analysis to compare the fit of a one-factor versus a two-factor model on the CFC-14 scale, and structural equation modeling to test the proposed links between CFC, regulatory focus, and healthy eating attitudes and intentions.</p>

In addition, to gather evidence for the predictive validity of the CFC subscales, and mediation via regulatory focus, we assessed healthy eating attitudes and intentions. Healthy eating attitudes were assessed with three items: (a) Eating healthy is essential to my well-being, (b) I enjoy eating healthy, and (c) I feel great personal satisfaction when I eat healthy (α = .81). Healthy eating intentions were assessed by asking participants to think about future breakfasts, lunches, and dinners and to rate how healthy those meals would be (1 = <italic>not healthy</italic>; 10 = <italic>very healthy</italic>; α = .81).</p>

<title>Confirmatory factor analysis</title>
<p>To test the validity of the two-factor (vs. one-factor) models, we conducted confirmatory factor analysis. We began by evaluating the fit of the hypothesized two-factor model. The initial two-factor model showed a reasonable fit to the data, <italic>Sattora-Bentler (SB)</italic> χ<sup>2</sup>(76) = 164.85, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, Goodness of Fit Index (GFI) = .890, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = .892, root mean square error approximation (RMSEA) = .072 (lower limit [LL] = .057, upper limit [UL] = .087). However, to achieve acceptable fit (GFI and CFI near .95, and RMSEA below .05; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167212449362">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>), it was necessary to estimate seven correlated error terms. The final model, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0146167212449362">Figure 3</xref>, fit the data well, <italic>SB</italic>χ<sup>2</sup>(69) = 97.69, <italic>p</italic> = .013, GFI = .943, CFI = .965, RMSEA = .043 (LL = .020, UL = .062). As can be seen, the correlation between the factors was not especially large (Φ = −.37), and the majority of the correlated errors were understandable, given the common wording on the correlated items (e.g., Items 2 and 6 contain the phrase “achieve future outcomes”; Items 3 and 4 mention “immediate concerns”; Items 6 and 10 mention “sacrificing”; and Items 7 and 9 mention “warnings”). Next, we estimated a one-factor model, including all of the correlated error terms shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0146167212449362">Figure 2</xref>, to make the model comparison a fair test of the differences between the models (i.e., the only difference between the models is the number of underlying factors hypothesized). The one-factor model, with the same correlated errors as shown in our final model, fit the data very poorly, <italic>SB</italic>χ<sup>2</sup>(70) = 329.90, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, GFI = .734, CFI = .685, RMSEA = .129 (LL = .115, UL = .143). Furthermore, a direct comparison of the two models showed that the two-factor model fit the data significantly better than the one-factor model, <italic>SB</italic>χ<sup>2</sup>Δ(1) = 38.97, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. In addition, if the correlation between the two factors is set to 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167212449362">Benson &amp; Hocevar, 1985</xref>), model fit is poor, <italic>SB</italic>χ<sup>2</sup>(70) = 222.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, GFI = .896, CFI = .816, RMSEA = .099 (LL = .084, UL = .113), and is significantly worse than when the correlation between the factors is freely estimated, <italic>SB</italic>χ<sup>2</sup>Δ(1) = 38.97, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. As noted earlier, and replicating Study 1, reliability analysis indicated that both of the CFC subscales showed impressive internal reliabilities (CFC-Future = .82; CFC-Immediate = .80). As before, the reliability of the original five-item CFC-Future subscale was acceptable but was again lower (α = .74) than the reliability of the seven-item CFC-Future subscale.</p>

<title>Predicting regulatory orientation, healthy eating attitudes, and intentions</title>
<p>As in Study 1, we collected additional data to evaluate whether the two CFC subscales would differentially predict regulatory orientation and healthy eating attitudes and intentions.

Promotion orientation was positively related to healthy eating attitudes as well as healthy eating intentions. Finally, healthy eating attitudes were positively correlated with healthy eating intentions. CFC-Immediate, by comparison, correlated negatively with promotion orientation, positively with prevention orientation, and was not significantly correlated with the healthy eating outcomes.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>Over the past several decades, obesity has risen dramatically in the United States. Currently, it is estimated that roughly two thirds of Americans are overweight (with a BMI ≥ 25) and one third of Americans are obese (with a BMI ≥ 30; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167212449362">Flegal, Carroll, Ogden, &amp; Curtin, 2010</xref>). Two of the most important steps people can take to curb obesity include engaging in regular exercise and eating a healthy diet. Unfortunately, because the alternatives (physical inactivity and a poor diet) offer more immediate benefits, many people fail to exercise and eat healthy foods. Given the intertemporal nature of such health behavior decisions, one factor that influences whether an individual exercises and follows a healthy diet is their CFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0146167212449362">Strathman et al., 1994</xref>). The present studies helped shed light on how CFC relates to exercise and healthy eating in two ways. First, consistent with five recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167212449362">Adams, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167212449362">Joireman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167212449362">Petrocelli, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212449362">Rappange et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0146167212449362">Toepoel, 2010</xref>), we provided evidence that responses to the new CFC-14 scale are best captured by two underlying factors: a seven-item CFC-Future subscale and a seven-item CFC-Immediate subscale. Second, we showed that a promotion orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167212449362">Higgins et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167212449362">Lockwood et al., 2002</xref>) mediates the relationship between CFC-Future, on one hand, and exercise and healthy eating attitudes and intentions on the other hand. As detailed below, these results help extend work on CFC and health behavior by further supporting the discriminant validity of the two subscales, enhancing reliability of the CFC-Future subscale, and identifying a mediator between CFC-Future and two behaviors important in promoting healthy lifestyles and reducing obesity (exercise and healthy eating).</p>

<title>Extensions of the CFC-Health Behavior Literature</title>
<p>In 1994, Strathman and colleagues introduced the 12-item CFC scale to help researchers assess the extent to which people are concerned with and impacted by the future (vs. immediate) consequences of their behavior. Since that time, researchers have demonstrated that scores on the CFC scale predict a wide range of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to intertemporal decisions (for a broader review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167212449362">Joireman, Strathman, &amp; Balliet, 2006</xref>). As summarized in our introduction, one important and highly productive line of CFC research has been in the area of health behavior. Although yielding important insights, most of this work has treated the CFC construct as a unidimensional construct, and few studies have attempted to understand why CFC predicts health-related outcomes. The present studies aimed to address these gaps in the literature.</p>
<p>As noted, our results provide additional support for the presence of two underlying CFC factors (CFC-Future and CFC-Immediate). This distinction is important because separating the two subscales adds clarity to CFC’s relationship with a given outcome. If researchers continue to reverse code the immediate items and then average over the entire set of CFC items, they will end up with a single CFC score, which may predict behavior, but whose interpretation is unclear. A positive correlation between CFC and a given outcome of interest (say exercise) can mean the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0146167212449362" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>that those who are concerned with the future consequences of their behavior (proper) are more likely to exercise,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>that those who are concerned with the immediate consequences of their behavior are less likely to exercise, or</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>both.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>By clearly separating the future from the immediate items, a researcher can clearly tease apart these different explanations. Although the use of two CFC subscales will introduce some complexity to the analysis (and theorizing), we believe (based on our own findings and previous research; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167212449362">Joireman et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167212449362">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212449362">Rappange et al., 2009</xref>) that the additional steps will be worth the effort, primarily because the distinction will help shed a more nuanced light on the relationship between CFC and a researcher’s given outcome of interest.</p>
<p>In particular, distinguishing between CFC-Future and CFC-Immediate allows a researcher to test the buffering and susceptibility hypotheses advanced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167212449362">Joireman et al. (2008)</xref>. These hypotheses hold important practical implications within the health domain. If CFC-Future is the primary predictor of a given health behavior, the buffering hypothesis is supported, and interventions should focus on encouraging people to value and become aware of the future consequences of their actions. On the other hand, if CFC-Immediate is the primary predictor, the susceptibility hypothesis is supported and interventions should focus on reducing a concern with the immediate consequences of an action or eliminating them altogether. Put in broader theoretical terms, the buffering hypothesis assumes that activation of a “cool,” conscious, and rational system will promote health behaviors, whereas the susceptibility hypothesis assumes that reducing the salience of “hot” triggers will lower the likelihood of unhealthy behaviors directed by unconscious impulses for immediate gratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167212449362">Metcalfe &amp; Mischel, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to shedding light on the underlying nature of the CFC construct, the present studies provided additional insight into <italic>why</italic> individual differences in CFC relate to health behavior. Specifically, we found that people scoring high on the CFC-Future subscale are more likely to exercise and eat healthfully because they adopt a promotion-oriented regulatory style. Based on theoretical arguments and empirical data offered in the introduction, we anticipated this. However, as we noted, it was equally plausible, based on some other studies that CFC-Future would be more closely linked with a prevention-oriented style. One possible reason for the difference in our results is that the current study directly correlated CFC with individual differences in regulatory focus, whereas the previously noted studies inferred that those scoring high in CFC adopt a prevention orientation based on their response and attention to persuasive messages. Clearly, future research is needed to better understand the link between CFC, regulatory focus, and health behaviors. Nevertheless, the current studies do seem to converge on the conclusion that, at the level of individual differences, those scoring high on the CFC-Future subscale adopt a promotion-oriented regulatory style. That said, results across both studies showed a secondary, small but significant positive relationship between CFC-Future and prevention orientation, suggesting that those scoring high on CFC-Future primarily aim to promote positive outcomes but are also attuned to preventing negative outcomes. However, in the present studies, prevention orientation was not related to the outcomes of interest, suggesting that the key path from CFC-Future to health outcomes runs through a promotion orientation.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>Before closing, we consider some limitations of the present studies and suggest several directions for future research. First, the current data are based on single administration, correlational data. As such, future research would benefit by looking at how CFC, regulatory focus, and health behavior relate over time. Second, the current data are based on self-reports. Future research incorporating actual behavioral measures would strengthen confidence in our findings. Third, although demonstrating a meaningful link between individual differences in CFC and regulatory focus, our data do not address the underlying mechanism that might link the two constructs. One possibility is that CFC predicts temporal discounting, delay of gratification, and/or temporal construals (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167212449362">Daly, Delaney, &amp; Harmon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167212449362">Joireman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167212449362">Joireman et al., 2008</xref>), which in turn encourage the adoption of a promotion orientation. Finally, the current studies focused on two specific health behaviors. Given that CFC predicts a much wider range of outcomes, including academic performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167212449362">Joireman, 1999</xref>), financial decision making (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167212449362">Howlett, Kees, &amp; Kemp, 2008</xref>), and environmental behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167212449362">Ebreo &amp; Vining, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0146167212449362">Kortenkamp &amp; Moore, 2006</xref>), future research could examine whether regulatory focus explains the link between CFC and these other important outcomes.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167212449362">CDC; 2011</xref>) advanced the “Healthy People 2020” initiative to support America’s efforts in becoming a “society in which all people live long, healthy lives.” Specifically, the CDC outlined a 10-year plan to improve the health of all Americans by providing science-based insights to help people make informed health decisions and monitor their health behaviors. To achieve such ambitious goals, it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms that influence health behaviors such as exercise and healthy eating. The present studies contributed to that effort by studying the relationship between CFC, regulatory focus, and health behaviors related to a host of important outcomes (e.g., weight control, diabetes, cardiovascular health). Across two studies, we found that individuals concerned with the future consequences of their actions (i.e., those scoring high on the CFC-Future subscale) had more favorable attitudes toward, and stronger intentions to engage in health-related behaviors (exercise and healthy eating) because they adopt a promotion orientation. We also found that concern with immediate consequences (i.e., the CFC-Immediate subscale) and prevention orientation were not related to exercise and healthy eating outcomes. These findings suggest that efforts to reach the CDC’s goals focus on promoting positive future benefits of exercise and healthy eating.</p>

<p>Although a formal meta-analysis is beyond the scope of the current article, it is worth noting that, across the studies reported here, consideration of future consequences (CFC) explains between 1% and 33% of the variance in the relevant health outcome, with the majority of <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> values falling below 12%.</p>

<p>Other studies have treated CFC as a mediator. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167212449362">Adams and White (2009)</xref> showed that CFC partially mediated the relationship between economic deprivation and body mass index, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167212449362">Crockett, Weinman, Hankins, and Marteau (2009)</xref> showed that CFC partially mediated the relationship between socioeconomic status and intention to engage in diabetes screening. Although interesting, we do not discuss this work in detail, as it positions CFC as a mediator of broader socioeconomic factors, and our focus is on what mediates CFC’s relationship with exercise and healthy eating.</p>

<p>Originally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0146167212449362">Strathman, Gleicher, Boninger, and Edwards (1994)</xref> used a 5-point scale. However, to increase variability, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167212449362">Joireman, Strathman, and Balliet (2006)</xref> recommended the use of the 7-point scale employed here.</p>

<p>We selected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167212449362">Lockwood, Jordan, and Kunda’s (2002)</xref> measure because it was widely used in the literature, and its items possess strong face validity. Nevertheless, there has been debate about the relative merits of Lockwood et al.’s measure and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167212449362">Higgins et al.’s (2001)</xref> regulatory focus questionnaire. Notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0146167212449362">Summerville and Roese (2008)</xref> argued that the two measures are independent and can be conceptualized differently: Higgins et al.’s measure corresponds to a self-guide definition (ideal vs. ought selves), whereas Lockwood et al.’s measure corresponds to a reference-point definition (pursuing gains vs. avoiding loses). Summerville and Roese also cautioned that Lockwood et al.’s measure is potentially confounded with approach/ avoidance orientation and positive/negative affect. In their response to this cautionary note, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0146167212449362">Righetti, Finkenauer, and Rusbult (2011)</xref> noted that their previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0146167212449362">Righetti, Rusbult, &amp; Finkenauer, 2010</xref>) showed that approach/avoidance tendencies did not explain the effect of promotion/prevention orientation, and that, in theory, even if promotion/prevention overlaps with approach/avoidance and/or positive/negative affect, this is not highly problematic, as approach/avoidance and positive/negative affect represent “inherent properties of [the promotion/prevention] constructs” (p. 723). Given this, use of the Lockwood et al. measure in the present study does not appear problematic. At the same time, it would be valuable to explore in future research the extent to which our findings generalize using the Higgins et al. measure.</p>

<p>Several items on the promotion and prevention scales mention academic achievement, which has previously been linked with CFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167212449362">Joireman, 1999</xref>). To determine whether the relationships reported in the current article were attributable to this “context specific content,” we computed reduced (seven item) promotion and prevention scales without the academic-related items included (two items were dropped on each scale) and correlated the reduced scales with the remaining model variables. In both studies, the correlation between the full and reduced scales was <italic>r</italic> = .96 for both promotion and prevention. Moreover, the full and reduced scales showed very similar correlations with the other model variables, suggesting that the academically oriented items on the promotion and prevention scales did not systematically bias the relationships reported in our studies.</p>

<p>We also tested a competing path model in which regulatory focus and CFC were reversed (i.e., treating CFC as the mediator between regulatory focus and exercise attitudes). This model, however, did not fit the data as well as the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0146167212449362">Figure 2</xref>: <italic>SB</italic>χ<sup>2</sup>(6) = 21.36, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, GFI = .950, CFI = .898, root mean square error approximation (RMSEA) = .134, lower limit (LL) = .066, upper limit (UL) = .210.</p>
