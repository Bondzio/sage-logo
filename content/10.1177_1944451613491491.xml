<p><italic>Background</italic>. Controlled ventilation for head trauma patients should reduce hypoxemia, hypercapnia and prevent secondary brain injury. However, changes in cardiac output and arterial blood pressure are the common consequences of mechanical ventilation. This study was designed to compare pressure- versus volume-controlled ventilation modes in severe head trauma patients to identify the mode with least hemodynamic compromise and best oxygenation profile. <italic>Methods</italic>. This prospective crossover study was carried out on 15 severe head trauma patients admitted to surgical ICU for mechanical ventilation and critical care. All patients were initially ventilated with volume-controlled ventilation for 12 hours then the mode of ventilation was changed to pressure-controlled ventilation for the next 12 hours. Arterial and pulmonary artery catheters were inserted for continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary wedge pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and systemic vascular resistance every 4 hours from the start of each ventilation mode. Lung mechanics and arterial blood gases were simultaneously recorded during the times of hemodynamic monitoring. <italic>Results</italic>. Cardiac output did not show significant changes between the 2 ventilation modes and mean group differences at 4, 8, and 12 hours were −0.2, −0.2, −0.1 L/min (95% confidence interval = −1.04 to 0.64, −0.92 to 0.52, and −0.68 to 0.48 L/min), respectively. Additionally, the other hemodynamic variables were comparable at all levels of study analysis. Volume-controlled ventilation was associated with significant higher peak air way pressure in comparison with pressure-controlled ventilation after 4, 8, and 12 hours. The oxygenation values and other lung mechanics were not significantly change between the 2 ventilation modes. <italic>Conclusion</italic>. Both volume-controlled and pressure-controlled ventilations have comparable hemodynamic and oxygenation profiles in severe head trauma patients for short-term ventilation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In head trauma patients, a significant proportion of morbidity and mortality is caused by events that occur after the primary injury, including hypoxia and hypotension that lead to secondary brain injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451613491491">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451613491491"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451613491491"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451613491491">4</xref></sup> Secondary hypoxia is a common consequence of head injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451613491491">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1944451613491491">5</xref></sup> Previous attempts at improving the outcome of head trauma have focused on minimizing or eliminating secondary brain injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1944451613491491">5</xref></sup> Early ventilation of head trauma patients is of paramount concern during their management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451613491491">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1944451613491491">7</xref></sup> It is noteworthy that mechanical ventilation induces some changes in intraplural or intrathoracic pressure, which can independently affect the key determinants of cardiovascular performance. Changes in intrathoracic pressure are transmitted to intrathoracic structures, namely the heart and great vessels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1944451613491491">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1944451613491491"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1944451613491491">10</xref></sup> The main hemodynamic effect of increased intrathoracic pressure during positive pressure ventilation is decrease in right ventricular filling due to venous return decrease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1944451613491491">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1944451613491491"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1944451613491491">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whereas volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) ensures the delivery of a defined tidal volume with square-waveform flow pattern that produce a specific peak inspiratory pressure, the pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) delivers a decelerating inspiratory flow, which could allow more homogenous gas distribution. PCV has many theoretical advantages if compared with VCV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1944451613491491">14</xref></sup> These advantages include the following: (<italic>a</italic>) peak airway pressure is lower for the same mean airway pressure, (<italic>b</italic>) decelerating flow rate may be beneficial as a consequence of delivery the whole tidal volume earlier during the inspiratory phase, and (<italic>c</italic>) alveolar ventilation may be greatly improved than VCV because of increased alveolar residency time of delivered tidal volume. All these factors could potentially result in improving gas exchange with PCV. Although peak inspiratory flow is quite different between these 2 commonly used modes, the hemodynamic consequences are still a matter of controversy.</p>
<p>Although the cardiovascular effects of mechanical ventilation in head trauma are unpredictable, they are nevertheless very important. The choice of best mode of ventilation during early resuscitation of head trauma patients is still a matter of debate among intensivists. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have been done to evaluate the hemodynamic and oxygenation profiles in severe head trauma patients under either VCV or PCV mode. We hypothesized that the PCV mode might have less untoward effects on hemodynamic parameters to ensure optimum oxygenation for head trauma patients during their early management. Therefore, this study was designed to compare the effects of both modes of ventilation on the hemodynamic and respiratory variables in a case series of severe head trauma patients admitted at surgical ICU for their critical care.</p>

<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<p>This prospective crossover study was carried out on head trauma patients admitted to the surgical ICU at Mansoura Emergency Hospital for mechanical ventilation and critical care. The protocol was approved by the Medical and Research Ethical Committee of Department of Anesthesia, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt. Written informed consent was obtained from near relatives. Fifteen patients with severe head trauma, as diagnosed clinically by Glasgow coma score ≤8 and by computed tomographic scan, aged older than 30 years were the subject of this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1944451613491491">Figure 1</xref>). Exclusion criteria included major cardiovascular, chronic obstructive lung diseases, and severe renal or hepatic dysfunction. Patients with life-threatening bleeding, associated multiple fractures, thoracic trauma, or severe septicemia were also excluded.</p>

<p>The current study was done within 24 hours of ICU admission. All patients had received adequate fluid balance plus the required dehydrating measure as guided by the neurosurgeon’s advice. For all patients, the blood hemoglobin was kept &gt;10 g/dL with the used of packed red blood cells. The enrolled patients were kept supine with 25° head elevation and were mechanically ventilated with the aid of rocuronium, which was given as a loading dose 0.6 mg/kg followed by incremental doses as needed. Continuous analgesia in the form of fentanyl infusion 0.6 µg/kg/h after a loading dose 1 µg/kg was used. Midazolam infusion 0.02 mg/kg/h was used for sedation in agitated patients during the study period.</p>
<p>All patients were connected to the 5-lead electrocardiograph, pulse oximetry, and main stream capnography (Hewlett Packard, model 685 monitor). A 20-gauge arterial cannula was inserted in the radial artery of the nondominant hand (after performing Allen’s test) under aseptic technique. The arterial cannula was connected to arterial pressure transducer for continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure and for blood gasometric sampling. Four-lumen 7 FR, pulmonary artery catheter (Arrow Hands-Off thermodilution catheter with TwistLock Cath-Gard and integral flushing balloon test chamber; Teleflex Medical, Research Triangle Park, NC) was inserted into the pulmonary artery through right internal jugular vein under strict aseptic technique and local lidocaine infiltration. The pulmonary artery catheter was inserted through the sterile sheath after testing the balloon by 1.5 mL air. The distal port was connected to the pressure monitoring system for displaying the pressure waveforms during insertion of the catheter together with continuous flush the port with heparin–saline to ensure proper function and expel air from the catheter lumen. The proper catheter advancement was confirmed by characteristic waveform of each of these locations. The final position of catheter tip was confirmed with portable chest X-ray film.</p>
<p>Each patient received VCV for 12 hours, and then the mode of the ventilation was switched to PCV for the next 12 hours with a Galileo ventilator (Hamilton Medical, Rhäzüns, Switzerland). Volume-controlled ventilation was adjusted with tidal volume 6 to 8 mL/kg, inspiration/expiration (I/E) ratio of 1:2 with Fi<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> (35% in air) together with peak end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and a square flow waveform. After 12 hours, the mode of ventilation was changed to PCV using decelerating flow waveform and inspiration pressure that was set to match the expiratory tidal volume measured in volume-controlled mode together with using the same I/E ratio, Fi<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>, and PEEP. Whereas PCV induces some variability in tidal volume, a value of ±5% was allowed for the measured tidal volume. The respiratory rate was adjusted in both modes to keep end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> tension between 30 and 35 mm Hg. During each mode of ventilation, the measured and calculated hemodynamic data were recorded after 4, 8, and 12 hours from the start of each mode. The cardiac output was measured by injecting 10 mL cold saline through the proximal limb of the pulmonary artery catheter as fast as possible for 6 consecutive times and by taking the mean reading. The stroke volume, systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary vascular resistance were calculated through their specific equations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1944451613491491">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Arterial blood gases were synchronized analyzed during hemodynamic recording in each mode every 4 hours. Also, the respiratory variables that include peak airway pressure, mean air way pressure, and static lung compliance were recorded from the ventilator display in each mode of ventilation every 4 hours. Any adjuvant vasopressor or inotropic agents used during the study period were reported. Any concomitant events, comorbidity, or mortality were also noted.</p>
<sec id="section3-1944451613491491">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS program (version 10.0 SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL). Patient demographic and ICU characteristics were expressed as median and range. The other data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. The quantitative data were tested for normal distribution using Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. When data exhibited a normal distribution, they were analyzed using <italic>t</italic>-test analysis of variances with repeated measurement of one factor (study period) for within-group comparison with Bonforroni correction. When data exhibited abnormal distribution, they were analyzed using Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test for intergroup comparison. <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05 was considered statistically significant. Mean group differences and their 95% confidence intervals were estimated to determine which of the specific variables differed between groups. The 95% confidence interval that include zero indicates no significant difference.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>This crossover prospective study was carried out in 15 severe head trauma patients with median Glasgow coma score = 7 (range 5-8) associated with loss of consciousness &gt;24 hours in need of mechanical ventilation for their critical care. The patient demographic and ICU characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1944451613491491">Table 1</xref>. All patients had received their daily crystalloid therapy in the form of isotonic saline within the range of 30 to 40 mL/kg/day to keep their fluid balance adequate. Twenty units of packed red blood cells were used in 10 patients to target blood hemoglobin &gt;10 g/dL. Dehydrating measure in the form of mannitol 10% and furosemide was administered for treating brain edema as long as the systolic blood pressure was maintained at optimum levels (&gt;90 mm Hg) and was guided by the neurological status of each patient.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrated that both VCV and PCV modes applied for severe head trauma patients had comparable hemodynamic profiles. The use of each mode did not affect significantly the oxygenation and respiratory variables apart from significant lower peak airway pressure in PCV at all studied time points.</p>
<p>It is worth emphasizing that the purpose of ventilation therapy is to provide adequate gas exchange, while causing minimal physiological interference. In the current study, the cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance did not show significant difference between the 2 modes of ventilation. However, a previous study had studied the hemodynamic consequences in association with both ventilation modes in patients after cardiac surgery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1944451613491491">16</xref></sup> which had confirmed that PCV mode was associated with higher cardiac index and lower systemic vascular resistance than VCV. These findings bear little relevance with our results, which could be explained on the basis of patients selected for their study, where cardiac patients were the candidates after cardiac surgery. The diseased heart might be easily affected by minor changes in peak air way pressure, with consequent major changes in cardiac output.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the insignificant hemodynamic differences between both studied ventilation modes were in accordance with the findings of Abraham and Yoshihara<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1944451613491491">17</xref></sup> in a study of the cardiocirculatory effects of PCV during management of severe respiratory failure. The comparable different hemodynamic variables during PCV and VCV modes could be explained by their comparable effects on mean airway pressure. This notion was in accordance with hypothesis of Mercat et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1944451613491491">18</xref></sup> who studied the cardiorespiratory effects of PCV with and without inverse ratio in adult respiratory distress syndrome. Similarly, many pertinent reports have previously verified that mean airway pressure, as a reflection of mean alveolar pressure, was known to be the major determinant of hemodynamic consequences of mechanical ventilation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1944451613491491">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1944451613491491">20</xref></sup> Therefore, the possible first explanation for nonsignificant hemodynamic intergroup differences may be the nearly similar mean airway pressures that was evident during the 2 ventilator modes application with the same PEEP (5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) value. The second possible explanation for insignificant hemodynamic changes was the adequate hydration policy in all patients with nearly similar amounts of isotonic saline administered during each mode of ventilation. In our middle-aged head trauma patients with healthy cardiovascular system, infusion of isotonic saline with packed red blood cells could exert a beneficial hemodynamic stabilization without the need of vasopressors or inotropics. Therefore, the nearly similar amount of fluids administered between the 2 groups could nullify the effects of variable fluid therapy on hemodynamics in these critically ill patients.</p>
<p>In the current study, the oxygenation and respiratory variables showed comparable findings in both modes of ventilation. These results are in accordance with the findings of Prella et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1944451613491491">21</xref></sup> who studied the effects of short-term PCV on gas exchange and distribution in patients with acute lung injury and compared it with VCV. However, these findings are in contrast to that of Abraham and Yoshihara,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1944451613491491">17</xref></sup> where significant increase in arterial oxygen saturation and tension was present with PCV. They referred that improvement in oxygenation to initial higher pressure of decelerating waveform pattern induced with PCV mode, which caused recruitment and improved ventilation of alveoli. The significant decrease in peak airway pressure when the ventilation mode was switched from VCV to PCV mode in the present study was in agreement with findings of many authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1944451613491491">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1944451613491491"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1944451613491491"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1944451613491491">25</xref></sup> This event was achieved because of the difference between the decelerating inspiration flow and early dissipation of flow resistance with PCV in comparison with the constant inspiration flow with VCV. In the PCV mode; the inspiratory decelerating flow was initially high so that the preset pressure was reached rapidly. Airway pressure was then maintained throughout the inspiration phase with decreasing rate of flow. So, the decelerating inspiratory flow pattern of PCV could reduce peak inspiratory pressure and allow more homogenous gas distribution.</p>
<p>Lung compliance and oxygen parameters were comparable in the current study with application of both modes of ventilation. This observation may be of value especially in absence of associated thoracic trauma or chronic lung diseases. A controversy exists regarding the increased compliance seen with PCV in another study done for laparoscopic urological procedures without a clear explanation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1944451613491491">20</xref></sup> Many studies have related the improvement of oxygenation with PCV to higher instantaneous flow peaks with better alveolar recruitment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1944451613491491">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1944451613491491"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1944451613491491">28</xref></sup> The PCV mode is known to facilitate alveolar recruitment because the pressure gradient between driving pressure and alveolar pressure is maximal at the start of inspiration. In contrast, Hans et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1944451613491491">29</xref></sup> reported that PCV did not improve gas exchange in morbid obese patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery when compared with VCV. However, our findings support the concept of Campbell and Davis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1944451613491491">30</xref></sup> who reported that both VCV and PCV are not different modes, but are different control variables within a mode.</p>
<p>Some notes should be acknowledged concerning the limitations of the present study. First, the current study was carried out on middle-aged patients with healthy cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. The difference between the used 2 modes of ventilation should be studied in different categories of patients with different cardiovascular and chest problems. Second, the study of both VCV and PCV was done in a nonrandom fashion in their sequence during the study. To our knowledge, VCV mode is commonly applied as a starting mode by the clinician to offer the safety of preset tidal volume and minute volume ventilation. However, the study period was relatively short (24 hours) for the underlying pathology of head trauma to affect subsequent readings. Additionally, because of nature of this crossover study and because some ventilator settings, such as PEEP, I/E ratio, and Fi<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>, were fixed during each mode period, all could help collectively to minimize the hazard of potential bias of no randomization. Finally, monitoring of associated intracranial pressure, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral oxygenation with each mode of ventilation was not measured in the current trial. This valuable issue was missed because of the lack of our experience and facilities in this scope of monitoring at the time of the study. However, these outcome variables of this category of patients were beyond the scope of our objectives and will be considered in another future study.</p>
<p>In conclusion, both VCV and PCV modes were equally suited as a short-term ventilatory strategy for severe head trauma patients with comparable hemodynamic and oxygenation variables. A larger study would be required to test the hypothesis that either mode of ventilation can be extrapolated safely for long-term ventilation of head trauma patients especially if associated with cardiopulmonary problems.</p>
