<p>This volume, focusing on the Indian experience, contributes to reinforce the understanding of the process of resettling development displaced population. It does so through 15 chapters from experts with different backgrounds, approaches and sensibilities. From this variety of perspectives emerges a tension between theory and practice, which is also underpinning the entire field of resettlement practice and research, as it has been previously and elsewhere noticed, for instance, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-004908571104200112">Cernea (1999</xref>: 1) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-004908571104200112">Dwivedi (2002)</xref>. It is manifested in the chapters contained in this volume primarily as the tension between what Dwivedi (ibid.) had named the ‘reformist-managerial’ approach to development-induced displacement, and the need to revise and reinforce its theoretical understanding in the face of the paths undertaken by the dominant development strategy. This is well represented by the comparison between the opening chapter (by Hari Mohan Mathur, also the editor of the volume) and the closing chapter of the book (by Jayantha Pereira).</p>
<p>Mathur’s chapter offers an optimistic seizure of the problem of resettlement, which is deemed as ‘not insurmountable’, provided certain legal, policy, planning and management issues are adequately tackled. This view indeed constitutes the core of the ‘reformist-managerial’ approach. According to the author, a fair legal framework for land acquisition is needed in the first place, one which also defines the boundaries of the ‘public purpose’ upon which land confiscation by the state is legal and justifiable, so as to avoid that the process of land acquisition replicating the existing inequalities. The legal framework must then be accompanied by policy guidelines which create uniformity in the way in which resettlement is dealt with across sectors, allowing to overcome the ad hoc approach which has dominated so far. The latter in fact is appropriate at the stage of implementation of a resettlement programme, but the process in its wholeness needs to be regulated by general principles which ensure its fairness. Legislation and policies, says Mathur, however cannot make the difference unless resettlement is properly planned and implemented. Effective planning and implementation require accounting for the social impact of displacement, adopting a participatory approach in the process of resettlement design and addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups, women and indigenous population. This wariness has to be reflected in the compensation provided to the affected population (in the form of cash, land, employment schemes) and the extent to which this permits to restore and improve the previous quality of life. The success of this phase also depends upon the existence of the right institutional arrangement, that is, project and government agencies, professional figures and NGOs coordinating the process.</p>
<p>The approach to resettlement promoted by Mathur, despite acknowledging the complexities and dynamicity of the process, is fundamentally a policy tool for problem-solving and little space is left to the questioning of displacement and resettlement. As the term ‘reformist-managerial’ suggests, the focus is on finding practical solutions, with much less attention given to the theoretical understanding of the issues raised by resettlement.</p>
<p>This interpretation of the problem interestingly contrasts with the stance taken by Jayantha Pereira in the closing chapter of the volume. The author reviews the two dominant involuntary resettlement models (Scudder’s Four-Stage Framework and Cernea’s Impoverishment Risks and Reconstruction model) and points out how both are underpinned by a linear approach to resettlement which is consistent with a stagist view of development, so that resettlement is successful as long as it culminates with the ‘modernisation’ of the displaced population. Pereira’s claim is that this managerial approach to resettlement takes displacement for granted, hiding that it is in fact a violation of human rights. New models, he argues, are instead needed which focus on displacement rather than resettlement and promote a comprehensive human rights-based approach to displacement and resettlement.</p>
<p>This tension between the opening and the closing chapters, which is also the tension between the practical need to provide tools for policy making and the need of theoretical elaboration to understand a complex problem, is also found in the remaining chapters of the book. In one way or another they all point towards the inadequacy of the existing policy and legal framework in accounting for the complexities of the resettlement process and the systemic nature of the problem of displacement. The case studies collected in the volume are grouped and discussed so as to articulate this inadequacy in the form of shortcomings and the directions for improvement that they suggest.</p>
<p>The (in)adequacy of the existing policy and legal framework in tackling resettlement and its challenges constitutes the common topic of a group of chapters in the section Emerging Issues in Resettlement Policy. In Ramaswami Iyer’s chapter, the new Indian Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy, issued in 2007, is reviewed, with a discussion of the potential and the flaws of the two bills (the R&amp;R Bill and the Land Acquisition Amendment Bill) drafted as a complement to the policy. While significant progress has been acknowledged by the author, he also makes clear that the legal framework ‘in the making’ leaves a number of issues unaddressed. A number of these are due to the fact that some key concepts are left undefined or are narrowly incorporated. It is the case of Social Impact Assessment (where impact refers merely to physical assets) and of the ‘public purpose’ for which land acquisition is justified.</p>
<p>Two chapters then follow which instead point out the flexibility and the breadth of the World Bank Operational Policy (O.P. 4.12) on involuntary resettlement, reflected in their sector-wide applicability and in the broadening of the definition of population displacement. Gordon Appleby’s chapter in fact, using a number of case studies, shows how the policy can be tailored to be applied to the transport sector, not only when new infrastructure are built, but also when it comes to their maintenance and rehabilitation. Cernea’s chapter instead reviews the widening of the definition of population displacement adopted by the World Bank since 2002. The new definition includes not only displacement as a physical change of place, but also as ‘restriction of access’ to land or other natural resources. The importance of this change rests not only in the expanded applicability of the World Bank policy to Nature Conservation Projects but also in the implied broader understanding of the concept of displacement, which is made to encompass occupational and economic dislocation as well as geographical relocation.</p>
<p>The last chapter of this group looks instead at the gap existing between the policy framework and the realities of its application, focusing on the case of Orissa and its R&amp;R policy. The two authors, Padel and Das, suggest that a major reason of the inability of resettlement policies to keep the promises they make is their failure to account for corruption. Corruption, they argue, together with different forms of intimidation and exploitation, tends to emerge at every stage of a development project (at least in India). Nonetheless, corruption is absent from most of the theoretical models, which also fail to acknowledge that displacement and resettlement are underpinned by contrasting social construction of realities, that is, models do not account for the gulf existing between the development ideology invoked to justify displacing projects and the ways the latter are understood and experienced by the affected people. This mismatch also contributes to explain the failure of resettlement policies. This first group of chapters then seems to suggest that a first way to tackle the inadequacy of policies and frameworks is the adoption of broader definitions of the concepts used and the introduction of new categories of analysis.</p>
<p>The narrowness of the concepts and the categories used by the dominant resettlement frameworks and policies is also hinted by the two chapters of the section Compensation and the Resettlement Process, which more closely focus on different modalities of compensation and resettlement schemes. Case study analysis shows how the latter are not adequately articulated by the different models and guidelines. The reason is the generalised neglect of the existing constraints in providing land for land compensation and the difficulties in implementing employment creation and income-generation schemes as part of resettlement programmes.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Vasudha Dhagamwar, recollecting the experience of Orissa with the Korean POSCO steel plant and of West Bengal with the TATA Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in Singur and Nandigram, argues that land for land compensation is not a sustainable and in fact feasible option for India. This is due to the immense land requirement of the development path undertaken by the country, on one side, and the increasing population vis-à-vis the decrease in the average plot size, on the other, so that if land is increasingly scarce, small farming is not profitable anymore. While the author acknowledges the clear preference expressed by tribal people for land for land compensation and the peculiarities of the displacement and resettlement experience for tribals, he also suggests that a pragmatic approach to the resettlement problem is required, one which aims at the reduction of the number of people dependent upon land. This argument is well complemented by the chapter by M. P. Roy on the experience of the Coal India Limited (CIL) with the implementation of self-employment and income-generation schemes in lieu of land compensation. CIL was in fact renewed for offering a job inside the company as part of the compensation package to the affected family; however, the decreased capacity of the mining sector to create additional employment opportunities has forced CIL to focus instead on a resettlement strategy based on income restoration. Of course, the change in the compensation and resettlement strategy is meeting the resistance of most of the affected population, not the least because employment creation in non-farming activities is indeed the key development challenge for rural areas in India.</p>
<p>The complexities of adequate compensation and of the resettlement process are well demonstrated by Tulsi Charan Bisht’s ethnographic account of displacement in the case of the Tehri Dam. It documents the difficulties of re-building a new livelihood after resettlement, especially in agriculture, including for the families which did receive land for land compensation. Difficulties arise from the fact that monetary transactions (to which the affected population is not accustomed to) are needed at the new location to perform any type of productive and reproductive activities, including farming, together with the increasing cost of agricultural inputs.</p>
<p>The last three chapters taken together clearly indicate that the next challenge for resettlement frameworks and policies is incorporating livelihood restoration through employment creation into the analysis. The two remaining chapters of the section deal differently with the shortcomings of the existing resettlement frameworks and policies: they look at the problem of adopting an alternative methodological approach. Supriya Garikipati, collocating herself into the ongoing debate on the creation of an Economics of Resettlement (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-004908571104200112">Cernea and Mathur, 2008</xref>), explores the notion of ‘compensation’ as understood by Neoclassical Economics. While this exercise does not add much to an ontological understanding of compensation, it leads the author to a novel approach to the investigation of the preferences of the affected population for different types of resettlement packages. People displaced by the Sardar Sarovar Dam project were consulted through a methodology drawn from experimental economics. The findings make Garikipati conclude that the optimal approach to resettlement rests in tailor-made schemes which account for people’s preferences.</p>
<p>Medha Chandra instead sets herself to the task of explaining why displacement and resettlement in each specific case happen the way they do, using micro politics as the main explanatory factor. This is done looking at environmental conflicts over access and control of urban water bodies in Kolkata and comparing how the different articulation of social and political conflicts in two settlements led to different outcomes in terms of eviction (who is evicted and who is not) and compensation (whether compensation is paid and to whom). This approach offers a different perspective on the mechanisms underpinning displacement and eviction, which can inform the design of policies and resettlement schemes.</p>
<p>Finally, the last section (Privatising Development) represents a good sample of chapters which deal with the new key topic for empirical and theoretical research in the field: the relationship between development, displacement and resettlement in the face of the increasing involvement of the private sector in displacement inducing projects. While Walter Fernandes points out the increase in the practice of development-induced displacement in India since independence, and links it to the spread of liberalisation and privatisation in the country, the chapters by Manshi Asher and Yamini Atmavilas and by Abhijit Guha look more specifically at the problems raised by land appropriation for SEZs, drawing from the happenings in Goa and West Bengal. Hari Mathur describes instead the consequences for tribal people of Orissa of living in a state endowed with abundance of natural resources and of a private investment-friendly policy. What most strikingly emerges in all cases is how the existing policy framework for land acquisition is unfit to deal with the issues raised by SEZs’ land requirements and more generally with the increasing prominence of the private sector. The main unresolved issue appears to be the fine line which separates state expropriation of land in the name of public purpose, on one side, and private purchase with some forms of government mediation, on the other side. The tendency so far has been for state governments to act more in the interests of the investors than the citizens. As SEZs and private sector projects appear to trickle down less benefits to the displaced population than infrastructure projects, resistance so far has been intense: successful in some cases (see Nandigram) or leading to dramatic clashes with the police in others (like in Orissa’s Kalinganagar incident).</p>
<p>In conclusion, this book can be read as a stimulating whole of case studies drawing from the Indian experience, which together with some policy-oriented and theoretical contributions with general relevance update and enlarge our knowledge and understanding of the issues surrounding resettlement and displacement. But more importantly, it can also be read as an invitation to start revising the way we understand and learn about these issues. In particular it seems compelling in intensification of the dialogue between theory and practice, possibly between the ‘reformist-managerial’ approach and alternative (as well as more problematic) theoretical understanding of what resettlement is and how it relates to the development discourse. The existing literature seems already to pull towards this direction, particularly through the pursue of a broader conceptualisation of the two key concepts, the adoption of new categories of analysis and of alternative methodological approaches, and the expansion of the framework of analysis to incorporate displacement in the discourse of liberalisation and privatisation.</p>
