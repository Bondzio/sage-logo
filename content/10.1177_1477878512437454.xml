<p>This recently released book – Winner of the 2009 National Council for the Social Studies Exemplary Research in Social Studies Award – by University of Wisconsin Professor Diane Hess skilfully argues that essential democratic skills can be taught through carefully planned discussions of controversial issues. A longitudinal study of high-school students forms the basis of the data within the book, providing research-based advice to support her stance.</p>
<p>This book addresses concerns over what should be taught and how it should be taught against a background of growing discomfort over teaching controversial issues within the classroom. Hess argues against the ‘safety’ of avoiding controversial issues and makes a convincing case that the teaching of such issues is both unavoidable and crucial to enable students to have autonomy over their opinions and beliefs.</p>
<p>Hess defines controversial issues as ‘authentic questions about the kinds of public policies that should be adopted to address public problems’ (p. 5). According to Hess, because they generate a plethora of competing answers they become controversial. She argues cogently that if schools fail to address such issues, they send out the message that the political is unimportant and equally that everyone agrees on the nature of the public good.</p>
<p>The text is stronger in arguing that schools are ideal sites for learning how to discuss controversial issues. Taking a decidedly Deweyian understanding of democracy as a way of life, Hess concentrates on unpacking how students acquire the skills and dispositions to enable them to take their place within a vision of deliberative democracy. Going beyond this, Hess argues for a particular interpretation of ‘discussion’ and highlights its importance in a democratic community.</p>
<p>Much of the material draws heavily on Hess’ own background as a teacher as well as her considerable experience of research. She provides a detailed analysis, supported by data, of what happens in classrooms, the difficulties and the successes from both the teacher and student perspectives of engaging in controversial issues. The rich empirical research using both quantitative and qualitative data presented in the book reaches the conclusion that schools are powerful sites for democratic discourse, as argued elsewhere by Parker and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477878512437454">Barber, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477878512437454">Parker, 2002</xref>). What is unique to this text are the classroom insights gleaned over the course of the research as snapshots into how democratic education supports and trains students to live in an increasingly fragmented society whilst supporting the development of the skills and dispositions needed to improve the societies.</p>
<p>The book is divided into three parts. An extended theoretical Part I considers the existing literature and theory, and outlines the background within which the research takes place. A spirited defence of democratic rather than civic education as the starting point (Chapter 1) leads on to a consideration of why democracy requires controversy (Chapter 2) and how controversial political issues can be identified (Chapter 3).</p>
<p>Part II considers what happens in classrooms. In Chapter 4, Hess analyses her findings on pedagogical practice in this area through three case studies. The detailed application of theory to practice, examining how different classroom environments interact in creating the background for students to encounter different perspectives on controversial issues, identifies the quality of teacher skills in managing and running such discursive groups as critical. Following from this, Chapter 5 reports on an on-going mixed-methods study (surveys, observations and interviews) investigating what happens in 21 high-school classrooms in three states of the USA. This, in turn, leads into a consideration in Chapter 6 of whether or not teachers should disclose their stance on issues and how this is understood by both parties.</p>
<p>Part III starts with the controversy over what is considered controversial. Building on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477878512437454">Hand’s (2008)</xref> definition of what counts as a controversial issue, in Chapter 7 Hess explores how topics ‘tip’ from open to closed issues, drawing out the practical relevance of this for teachers in the classroom. Chapter 8 then considers a study undertaken by Hess and Stoddard in 2006 analysing the materials and the ideological messages used in studying 9/11 and its aftermath. Finally, in Chapter 9, Hess identifies the particular problems that hinder the development of controversial issues discussions.</p>
<p>This book is of direct interest to those concerned with what happens in our classrooms and why it happens. Whilst it is directly relevant to teachers, administrators in schools or those studying citizenship and social studies, it is also an ideal model for students wishing to undertake research, combining both theory and practice, and of how to approach complex issues in a thoughtful, coherent manner.</p>
