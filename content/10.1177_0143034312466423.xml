<abstract>
<p>This study examines the relationships among Taiwanese ninth graders’ perceptions of autonomy support versus psychological control in the classroom context, work engagement versus academic burnout, and their avoidance of help seeking as well as self-handicapping behaviors. Four hundred and thirty-five ninth-grade Taiwanese students completed a self-reported survey assessing these variables. Results of hierarchical regressions indicated that in terms of environmental predictors, teachers’ autonomy support negatively predicted both help avoidance and self-handicapping, whereas teachers’ psychological control positively predicted self-handicapping only. As for the predicting effects of individual factors, students’ dedication negatively predicted both avoidance of help seeking and self-handicapping. By contrast, the lack of efficacy positively predicted help avoidance, whereas cynicism positively predicted self-handicapping. Further, results of MANCOVA revealed that even after controlling for the effects of teachers’ autonomy support and psychological control, burnout students were significantly more likely to avoid seeking academic help and self-handicap than were engaged students.</p>

<p>Researchers studying achievement behaviors have found that by adolescence, students struggling to escape appearing incompetent adopt avoidance strategies to deflect attention from low ability. Two types of strategies that students use to protect them from negative judgments by others are avoidance of help seeking and self-handicapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143034312466423">Covington, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143034312466423">Turner et al., 2002</xref>). Students sometimes encounter ambiguity and difficulty in their schoolwork. The ability to use others as a resource to cope with the situation is critical for them to carry out academic tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143034312466423">McCaslin &amp; Good, 1996</xref>). Many adolescents, however, do not actively seek help when needed. When students do not secure help when they need it, they are at a great disadvantage for learning and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143034312466423">Ryan, Patrick, &amp; Shim, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Self-handicapping refers to the use of strategies such as putting off studying until the last moment or fooling around the night before a test that serve as ready excuses for potential failure. Students engage in academic self-handicapping to deflect others’ perceptions away from lack of ability should poor performance occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034312466423">Midgley &amp; Urdan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143034312466423">Urdan &amp; Midgley, 2001</xref>). Developmental characteristics of adolescents include increased self-consciousness, concern about peer acceptance, and sensitivity to social comparison. In comparison with younger children, adolescents may experience greater fear of embarrassment from seeming incompetent in the eyes of classmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143034312466423">Turner et al., 2002</xref>). Because others may infer that a lack of ability causes failure, adolescents start to use self-handicapping strategies to avoid such negative implications about ability. As with avoidance of help seeking, self-handicapping not only undermines students’ performance, but also limits their ability to learn. Hence, it is important to investigate factors that may be linked to these maladaptive strategies. In the present study, the relationship of environmental (i.e. teachers’ autonomy support versus psychological control) and individual factors (i.e. work engagement versus academic burnout) to Taiwanese adolescents’ use of avoidance strategies is explored.</p>
<p>In the Taiwanese educational system, upon graduation from junior high school (grades 7 through 9), students are required to take the joint entrance examination for senior high school (grades 10 through 12). In order to get into high-ranking schools, students usually study long hours and enroll in private after-school classes (i.e. ‘cram schools’) intended to supplement their regular education. For instance, according to a survey reported in the newspaper <italic>The China Post</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143034312466423">Soong, 2011</xref>), 61.9% of the 2,133 surveyed Taiwanese adolescents attended cram schools. In addition, 35.9% of them often felt ‘exhausted and drained’ after a day of school. Evidently, a large portion of Taiwanese adolescents are susceptible to academic burnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143034312466423">Gan &amp; Shang, 2007</xref>). Further, in such a highly competitive educational setting, social comparisons become salient. Students with low perceived ability are likely to engage in avoidance strategies to defend self-worth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143034312466423">Covington, 1992</xref>). As stated above, the tendencies to avoid seeking academic help and self-handicap can render these adolescents vulnerable to poor learning patterns.</p>
<p>Over recent years, most of the school psychology research in Taiwan has focused on the exploration of factors related to school bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143034312466423">Cheng, Chen, Ho, &amp; Cheng, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143034312466423">Wei &amp; Chen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143034312466423">Wei &amp; Jonson-Reid, 2011</xref>) or the perpetration of school violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143034312466423">Chen &amp; Astor, 2009</xref>). Little is known about Taiwanese adolescents’ use of avoidance strategies. The strong emphasis on evaluation in the Taiwanese educational context is speculated to provoke students’ avoidance behaviors. The use of avoidance strategies, nevertheless, is not confined to Taiwanese adolescents. Students across cultures employ these maladaptive strategies to prevent embarrassment stemming from self-perceptions of low ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143034312466423">Turner et al., 2002</xref>). The current study was thus intended to extend the focus to Taiwanese adolescents’ help avoidance and academic self-handicapping in the hope that this investigation can provide insights to other national populations. Next, factors that may influence students’ use of avoidance strategies are reviewed.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0143034312466423"><title>Autonomy support versus psychological control</title>
<p>Teachers’ autonomy support versus psychological control have been shown to be significant determinants of students’ achievement behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143034312466423">Assor, Kaplan, &amp; Roth, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034312466423">Patrick, Anderman, &amp; Ryan, 2002</xref>). Self-determination theory (SDT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143034312466423">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000</xref>) is a widely studied theory of human motivation that provides a framework for understanding human tendencies toward active engagement and development. According to SDT, autonomy refers to the need to experience one’s behavior as freely chosen and volitional. The satisfaction of such a psychological need is critical for optimal learning and achievement. SDT proposes that autonomy-supportive contexts are conducive to autonomy need satisfaction. In the classroom setting, autonomy support occurs as the teacher takes the student’s perspective, allows opportunities for self-initiation and choice, provides a meaningful rationale for the requirement, and acknowledges the student’s feelings while minimizing the use of pressures and demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143034312466423">Deci, Eghrari, Patrick, &amp; Leone, 1994</xref>). In contrast, psychological control refers to control attempts that intrude into the psychological and emotional development of the person through the use of manipulative techniques such as guilt-induction and love withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143034312466423">Soenens, Vansteenkiste, Luyten, Duriez, &amp; Goossens, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The differences between experiences of autonomy support and psychological control explain why people have true versus contingent self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034312466423">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1995</xref>). Contingent self-esteem requires that the individual continuously matches some standard of excellence to feel worthy. By contrast, true self-esteem is more securely based on a solid sense of self. With true self-esteem, one does not have to dutifully achieve some types of outcome to feel like a good and worthy person. Contingent self-esteem is likely to be connected with experiences of psychological control. Conversely, as one acts with an internal perceived locus of causality, the autonomously motivated behaviors facilitate a stronger sense of true self-worth. Because true high self-esteem reflects secure feelings of self-worth that do not depend on continual validation, individuals high in autonomy are found to exhibit less defensive coping mechanisms to maintain self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034312466423">Knee &amp; Zuckerman, 1998</xref>). It may be inferred that students who perceive autonomy support from teachers possess true high self-esteem such that avoidance strategies would not be necessary for them. Those who perceive psychological control in the classroom context, however, are apt to develop contingent self-esteem. As a consequence, they may adopt avoidance strategies to defend their fragile self-worth.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0143034312466423"><title>Academic burnout versus work engagement</title>
<p>The developmental tasks associated with adolescence pose a unique set of challenges and stressors including managing the physiological changes of puberty, achieving expectations of increasing independence from family, developing appropriate social roles with peers, as well as completing academic requirements. Adolescents are dealing with a variety of demands simultaneously. Because the youngster is confronted with many life stressors for the first time, he or she may not yet have developed a repertoire of coping skills from which to draw (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143034312466423">Compas, Connor-Smith, Saltzman, Thomsen, &amp; Wadsworth, 2001</xref>). As stated previously, academic pressures have been identified as the essential sources of stress that Taiwanese adolescents experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143034312466423">Soong, 2011</xref>). Taiwanese junior high students, who are already at a vulnerable developmental stage, are expected to be at increased risk for academic burnout.</p>
<p>Academic burnout refers to a psychological syndrome that occurs due to chronic academic stress and course loads, manifested as an emotional exhaustion because of study demands, a cynical and detached attitude toward schoolwork, and a reduced efficacy as a student (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143034312466423">Gan &amp; Shang, 2007</xref>). Student burnout can be considered to be an erosion of work engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143034312466423">Maslach, Schaufeli, &amp; Leiter, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034312466423">Schaufeli, Martinez, Marques Pinto, Salanova, and Bakker (2002)</xref> defined engagement as persistent, positive, fulfilling, and work-related state of mind that is characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption. Vigor refers to high levels of energy and resilience. Dedication refers to a strong involvement in one’s work. Finally, absorption refers to a pleasant state of total immersion in one’s work.</p>
<p>The vast majority of research on academic burnout versus work engagement has been conducted in the context of college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034312466423"/>Jacobs &amp; Dodd, 2003). Little is known about burnout among young adolescents. To address the paucity of literature in this respect, the present study attempted to examine how Taiwanese adolescents’ academic burnout versus work engagement was related to their use of avoidance strategies. As stated previously, students tend to employ avoidance strategies to conceal the appearance of low ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143034312466423">Turner et al., 2002</xref>). Given that a primary indicator of academic burnout concerns a reduced efficacy or feelings of incompetence, it was thought that academic burnout would increase the levels of help avoidance and self-handicapping. In contrast, students characterized by vigor and dedication would be less likely to adopt avoidance strategies to undermine their work engagement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0143034312466423"><title>The present study</title>
<p>To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms affecting Taiwanese adolescents’ avoidance of help seeking and self-handicapping, the present research was intended to explore the extent to which environmental (i.e. teachers’ autonomy support versus psychological control) and individual factors (i.e. work engagement versus academic burnout) underlie the use of these avoidance strategies. Although help avoidance and self-handicapping are both avoidance strategies in nature, there may exist differences in the strengths of associations between the potential determinants and these two types of avoidance strategies. This study aimed to shed light on the precise predictors of help avoidance and self-handicapping. Further, it is likely that adolescents who experience burnout significantly differ from those who are fully engaged in schoolwork in their tendencies to adopt avoidance strategies even after taking into account teachers’ autonomy support and psychological control. The present study also attempted to address this speculation. Specifically, this study was devised to test the following hypotheses: (a) students’ perceptions of teachers’ autonomy support versus psychological control and work engagement versus academic burnout would significantly predict their avoidance of help seeking and self-handicapping; (b) after controlling for teachers’ autonomy support and psychological control, students’ tendencies to avoid seeking help with schoolwork and self-handicap would differ according to their reported levels of work engagement and academic burnout.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0143034312466423" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<sec id="sec5-0143034312466423" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 435 ninth-grade Taiwanese students from 14 classes in three junior high schools. Participating schools were located in the northern part of Taiwan. All of the school principals granted initial consent for data to be collected in their schools. The 233 boys (54%) and 202 girls ranged in age from 13 years, 3 months to 15 years, 6 months (<italic>M</italic> = 14 years, 6 months, SD = 3.7 months). The school districts were primarily middle class in terms of socioeconomic status. All of the participants were Taiwanese. Guidelines for the proper treatment of human subjects were followed. Subjects’ participation was voluntary. All participants had parental consent to take part in the study. Confidential treatment of the data was guaranteed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0143034312466423" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title>
<p>Data were collected at the beginning of the ninth grade (September). Students were invited to complete a survey (described in detail below) during regular class time. There were two research assistants in each class for the data collection. They assured students of the confidentiality of their self-reports and encouraged them to respond to all items as accurately as possible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0143034312466423"><title>Measures</title>
<p>Participants were instructed to respond to all items on five-point Likert scales ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). A Chinese language version of this self-report survey was employed. All measures utilized in the present study were translated into Chinese and then back-translated into English. To ensure adequate translation, guidelines of the International Test Commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143034312466423">Hambleton, 1994</xref>) were followed. Specifically, the translation process took full account of linguistic and cultural differences among Taiwanese adolescents. Participants’ familiarity with item format, item content, and test procedures was ensured by checking with two Taiwanese junior high students during translation. Information on the reliability and validity of the adapted versions is detailed below.</p>
<sec id="sec8-0143034312466423"><title>Perceived autonomy support</title>
<p>Students’ perceptions of autonomy support provided by their teachers were assessed by the short version of the Learning Climate Questionnaire (LCQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143034312466423">Williams &amp; Deci, 1996</xref>). Six items measure the degree to which students perceive instructors as supporting student autonomy (e.g. ‘My instructor listens to how I would like to do things’; <italic>α</italic> = 0.86). Higher scores represent a higher level of perceived autonomy support from teachers. To examine the validity of the scale, a confirmatory factor analysis was completed. In the model tested, all items were hypothesized to load onto one latent factor. Results showed that this model provided an adequate fit to the data, χ<sup>2</sup> (9, <italic>N</italic> = 435)  = 33.75, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>N</italic> = 0.08, RMSEA = 0.06, GFI = 0.97, NFI = 0.99, NNFI = 0.99, CFI = 0.99, IFI = 0.99.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0143034312466423"><title>Perceived psychological control</title>
<p>The Parental Psychological Control Scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143034312466423">Shek (2006)</xref> was adapted to assess perceived teachers’ psychological control. Specifically, the subject of the sentence in each item was changed from ‘my parents’ to ‘my teacher’. Ten items assessed teachers’ psychological control in a global manner (e.g. ‘During our conversation, my teacher always dominates the conversation and wants me to follow his or her view’; <italic>α</italic> = 0.88). Higher scores represent a higher level of teachers’ psychological control. In the CFA model, all items were hypothesized to load onto one latent factor. The CFA yielded a good fit to the data, χ<sup>2</sup> (23, <italic>N</italic> = 435)  = 62.39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>N</italic> = 0.14, RMSEA = 0.04, GFI = 0.97, NFI = 0.99, NNFI = 0.99, CFI = 0.99, IFI = 0.99.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0143034312466423"><title>Academic burnout</title>
<p>Students’ academic burnout was assessed by the scale adapted from the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey (MBI-SS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143034312466423">Schaufeli, Martinez, et al., 2002</xref>). The MBI-SS consists of 15 items that constitute three scales: Exhaustion (e.g. ‘I feel emotionally drained by my studies’; 5 items; <italic>α</italic> = 0.82), Cynicism (e.g. ‘I doubt the significance of my studies’; 4 items; <italic>α</italic> = 0.85) and Lack of Efficacy (e.g. ‘I can effectively solve the problems that arise in my studies’; 6 items; <italic>α</italic> = 0.77). The items measuring efficacy were reverse scored. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed to test the validity of this scale. In the model tested, items from each subscale were hypothesized to load only onto their respective latent variables. Results indicated that this model represented a good fit for the proposed structure of the scale, χ<sup>2</sup> (85, <italic>N</italic> = 435) = 205.15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>N</italic> = 0.47, RMSEA = 0.05, GFI = 0.94, NFI = 0.97, NNFI = 0.98, CFI = 0.98, IFI = 0.98.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0143034312466423"><title>Work engagement</title>
<p>Students’ engagement in schoolwork was assessed by the questionnaire adapted from the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale-Student (UWES-S; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143034312466423">Schaufeli, Salanova, Gonzalez-Roma, &amp; Bakker, 2002</xref>). This scale was constructed to measure the three underlying dimensions of work engagement: Vigor (e.g. When studying I feel strong and vigorous, 4 items, <italic>α</italic> = 0.79), Dedication (e.g. I am enthusiastic about my studies, 5 items, <italic>α</italic> = 0.88), and Absorption (e.g. I can get carried away by my studies, 4 items, <italic>α</italic> = 0.81). To test the validity of the scale, items from each subscale were hypothesized to load only onto their respective latent variables in the CFA model. Results showed that this model provided a good fit to the data, χ<sup>2</sup> (61, <italic>N</italic> = 435) = 128.92, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>N</italic> = 0.30, RMSEA = 0.05, GFI = 0.96, NFI = 0.98, NNFI = 0.99, CFI = 0.99, IFI = 0.99.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0143034312466423"><title>Avoiding help seeking</title>
<p>Students’ tendencies to avoid seeking academic help was assessed by the scale adapted from the questionnaires of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143034312466423">Newman and Goldin (1990)</xref> as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143034312466423">Turner et al. (2002)</xref>. Avoidance of help seeking (5 items) refers to instances when students need help but do not seek it (e.g. ‘If the schoolwork is too hard, I just don’t do it rather than ask for help’; <italic>α</italic> = 0.89). In the CFA model, the five items were hypothesized to load onto one latent variable. Results suggested that this model represented a reasonable fit for the proposed structure of the scale, χ<sup>2</sup> (5, <italic>N</italic> = 435)  = 31.49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>N</italic> = 0.07, RMSEA = 0.08, GFI = 0.99, NFI = 0.99, NNFI = 0.98, CFI = 0.99, IFI = 0.99.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0143034312466423"><title>Self-handicapping</title>
<p>Students’ use of self-handicapping strategies was assessed using a five-item scale taken from the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Survey (PALS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143034312466423">Midgley et al., 2000</xref>). These items were constructed to measure the extent to which students employ <italic>a priori</italic> strategies to influence self-presentation. Rather than assessing cognitions, this scale measures students’ use of active strategies and behaviors (e.g. ‘Some students put off doing their math work until the last minute. Then if they don’t do well, they can say that is the reason. How true is this of you’; <italic>α</italic> = 0.82). In the CFA model, all the five items were hypothesized to load onto a single latent factor. Results showed that this model provided an excellent fit to the data, χ<sup>2</sup> (5, <italic>N</italic> = 435) = 5.37, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>N</italic> = 0.01, RMSEA = 0.01, GFI = 0.99, NFI = 0.99, NNFI = 1.00, CFI = 1.00, IFI = 1.00.</p>

<p>Students’ perceptions of teacher’ autonomy support versus psychological control were entered in the first regression model and accounted for a significant portion of the variance (10%) in self-handicapping, <italic>F</italic>(2, 432) = 25.11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. Both autonomy support (β = −.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and psychological control (β = .15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) emerged as significant predictors of self-handicapping.

<sec id="sec18-0143034312466423"><title>Differences between students reporting different levels of work engagement versus academic burnout</title>
<p>To determine the differences in the use of avoidance strategies between students reporting high and low levels of work engagement versus academic burnout, a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was performed while including perceived autonomy support and psychological control in the classroom context as covariates. By taking into account the perceived environmental influences, it was hoped that the effects of students’ engagement and burnout on their avoidance of help seeking and self-handicapping would be detected with greater precision. The composite scores averaged across the subscales of work engagement as well as of academic burnout served to identify adolescents reporting low and high levels of engagement versus burnout. Participants who scored above the mean on work engagement and below the mean on academic burnout were grouped as engaged students. Conversely, adolescents who scored above the mean on academic burnout and below the mean on work engagement were clustered as burnout students. In total, 322 out of 435 students met the criteria, including 160 engaged and 162 burnout students.</p>
<p>Two assumptions for the MANCOVA had been examined before the analysis was performed. First, Box’s M test was conducted to check for the homogeneity of covariance matrices. The result of this test was not significant (<italic>F</italic> = 5.11 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), suggesting the confirmation of this assumption. Additionally, the test for homogeneity of regression also yielded insignificant results. Hence, using a common regression coefficient to adjust for the covariate in all groups was appropriate. The MANCOVA revealed significant effects for different levels of work engagement versus academic burnout on students’ use of avoidance strategies, Hotelling’s T = 0.18; <italic>F</italic>(2, 317) = 28.00, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, η2 = 0.15. Results of the univariate analyses indicated significant effects on help avoidance, <italic>F</italic>(1, 318) = 53.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, η2 = 0.14; and self-handicapping, <italic>F</italic>(1, 318) = 30.77, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, η2 = 0.09. Burnout students scored significantly higher than did engaged students on avoidance of help seeking (adjusted <italic>M</italic> = 2.79 versus adjusted <italic>M</italic> = 2.04, respectively) and self-handicapping (adjusted <italic>M</italic> = 2.45 versus adjusted <italic>M</italic> = 1.92, respectively). Evidently, after accounting for the effects of teachers’ autonomy support and psychological control, students’ tendencies to use avoidance strategies varied as a function of different levels of work engagement versus academic burnout.</p>

<sec id="sec19-0143034312466423" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Findings of the present study advance the understanding of the environmental and individual factors affecting Taiwanese adolescents’ reluctance to seek academic help as well as self-handicapping. It was found that students’ perceived autonomy support versus psychological control in the classroom setting along with some dimensions of work engagement versus academic burnout function as significant predictors of the use of avoidance strategies. Moreover, the present findings reveal that even after controlling for the influences of teachers’ autonomy support versus psychological control, burnout students show significantly stronger tendencies to avoid seeking help and self-handicap than do engaged students.</p>
<p>Although the present research has been carried out in the Taiwanese classroom environment, adolescents’ use of avoidance strategies certainly is not restricted to the very cultural context. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143034312466423">Covington (1992)</xref> suggested that the highest human priority is to search for self-acceptance. In school students acquire self-acceptance primarily through their ability to achieve competitively. To protect self-worth, those who are unsure of their ability to achieve competitively tend to adopt avoidance strategies that deflect attention from their ability. There have been a number of studies on students’ help avoidance and academic self-handicapping conducted in different cultural societies including the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143034312466423">Ryan, Pintrich, &amp; Midgley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143034312466423">Urdan &amp; Midgley, 2001</xref>), Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034312466423">Butler, 1998</xref>), Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143034312466423">Bong, 2008</xref>), and China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143034312466423">Li &amp; Cheung, 1999</xref>). While there is no lack of research on factors related to avoidance strategies, the current study is the first one that explores the effects of adolescents’ work engagement versus academic burnout on their reluctance to ask for help and self-handicapping. Given that students’ use of avoidance strategies appears to be a cross-cultural phenomenon, findings of this study may be applied to adolescent students in countries with similar educational systems and cultural aspirations, such as Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143034312466423">Lee et al., 2010</xref>) and China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143034312466423">Liu &amp; Lu, 2011</xref>). Several important findings are now discussed in more detail.</p>
<sec id="sec20-0143034312466423"><title>Effects of autonomy support versus psychological control</title>
<p>Results from hierarchical regression analyses indicate that, as hypothesized, students’ perceived autonomy support from teachers negatively predicts both help avoidance and self-handicapping. When students’ need for autonomy is met through teachers’ provision of autonomy support, their true self-esteem is nurtured. They do not continuously have to fulfill some standards of performance to feel worthy. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034312466423">Knee and Zuckerman (1998)</xref> suggested, the secure feelings of self-worth may keep them from employing defensive coping to maintain self-esteem. Hence, students perceiving higher levels of teachers’ autonomy support are found to be less likely to avoid seeking help and to engage in self-handicapping to protect themselves from negative judgments about ability.</p>
<p>Compared to the significant correlations between teachers’ autonomy support and both help avoidance as well as self-handicapping, teachers’ psychological control is only significantly related to self-handicapping. In the psychologically controlling environment, students must dutifully live up to teachers’ expectations to feel like a good and worthy person. Their contingent self-esteem leads them to regard failure as a threat to self-worth. Self-handicapping is an <italic>a priori</italic> strategy that serves as ready excuses for potential failure. Adolescents who perceive teachers’ psychological control—and thus develop contingent self-esteem—may utilize self-handicapping strategies to avoid negative implications about ability should poor performance occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034312466423">Midgley &amp; Urdan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143034312466423">Urdan &amp; Midgley, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the amount of the variance in help avoidance accounted for by teachers’ autonomy support only (14%) is greater than that of the variance in self-handicapping explained by both teachers’ autonomy support and psychological control altogether. This finding indicates the relatively powerful effects of autonomy support from teachers on counteracting students’ tendencies to avoid seeking academic help. As mentioned earlier, autonomy support in the classroom environment provides students with opportunities for self-initiation and choice. Students are supposed to work proactively when undertaking learning tasks characterized by such opportunities. Presumably, they are unlikely to avoid asking for help when encountering difficulty, because this decision would deter them from successfully carrying out the self-initiated learning task.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-0143034312466423"><title>Effects of work engagement versus academic burnout</title>
<p>The present findings show that among the three indicators of work engagement, dedication is the only one that significantly predicts both avoidance of help seeking and self-handicapping. Adolescents reporting higher levels of dedication tend to choose to not engage in avoidance strategies. Dedication refers to strong involvement in one’s work, accompanied by a sense of significance, enthusiasm, pride, and inspiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143034312466423">Schaufeli, Martinez et al., 2002</xref>). Students with these characteristics are apparently regulated by approach rather than avoidance motivation. Accordingly, avoidance strategies are less likely to be elicited. A closer look at the amounts of variance explained by dedication suggests that the strength of the association between dedication and help avoidance (16%) is twice as many as that between dedication and self-handicapping (8%). If students are enthusiastically involved in schoolwork, they would be inclined to solve the problem when encountering difficulties. Help seeking would then be considered an effective problem-solving strategy by the dedicated students.</p>
<p>Unlike the finding that dedication is the only dimension of work engagement that predicts both types of avoidance strategies, help avoidance and self-handicapping are significantly predicted by different indicators of academic burnout. It is found that the lack of efficacy is positively related to adolescents’ reluctance to seek help with schoolwork. Self-handicapping is nonetheless positively predicted by cynicism. As stated above, the primary reason underlying individuals’ help avoidance centers on competence concerns. When students doubt whether they can be successful in school, their concerns about embarrassment from looking ‘dumb’ in the eyes of others arise. Avoiding help seeking then becomes a strategy that students with a lack of efficacy use to fend off the embarrassment.</p>
<p>With regard to the correlation between cynicism and self-handicapping, a cynical and detached attitude toward work suggests that students are not interested in academic activities at all. It can be inferred that adolescents with such an attitude do not appreciate the value of learning. Hence, instead of working diligently in order not to lag behind in schoolwork, these students put off study until the last moment. This finding underscores the importance of inspiring students to detect the significance of academic engagement when it comes to addressing the problem of self-handicapping. Students need to be able to see how classroom learning connects to their own lives outside school or to some future aspect of their lives.</p>
<p>Results of the MANCOVA also reveal significant differences in the use of both avoidance strategies between engaged and burnout students after taking into account the effects of perceived autonomy support and psychological control. Regardless of whether the classroom settings are perceived as autonomy-supportive or psychologically controlling, adolescents who report higher levels of academic burnout together with lower levels of work engagement are more likely to avoid asking for academic assistance and engage in self-handicapping than those who report higher levels of engagement in combination with lower levels of burnout. These findings again show that students’ patterns of engagement clearly play a crucial role in their tendencies to develop avoidance strategies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec22-0143034312466423"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>Although results of the present study provide insights into adolescents’ use of avoidance strategies, there are several limitations that will need to be addressed in the future research. First, the study findings are all based upon self-report measures. Future research would benefit from incorporating other methods of data collection, such as interviews or teachers’ reports. Second, it is speculated that psychologically-controlling environment may promote contingent self-esteem that leads students to adopt avoidance strategies to maintain self-worth. Contingent self-esteem <italic>per se</italic>, however, is not assessed in the current study. Future research should include this variable to empirically validate such speculation. Third, a deeper look at the results from hierarchical regressions suggests that work engagement versus academic burnout may mediate the relations between teachers’ autonomy support versus psychological control and students’ use of avoidance strategies. Future research using structural equation modeling to test the hypothesized path model is encouraged.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-0143034312466423"><title>Implications for practices</title>
<p>Results of the present research suggest that to alleviate adolescents’ tendencies to engage in avoidance strategies, school psychologists can offer professional training to familiarize teachers with autonomy-supportive practices and to raise their awareness of the harm that psychological control may cause. In terms of the provision of autonomy support, school psychologists can educate teachers to coordinate the instructional activities with students’ preferences, interests, sense of enjoyment, and choice-making. Moreover, when students are requested to engage in an uninteresting activity, autonomy-supportive teachers help them generate self-determined motivation by explaining why the undertaking is useful and necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143034312466423">Reeve, 2006</xref>). In doing so, students’ cynical and detached attitudes toward schoolwork are expected to be minimized. Students’ appreciation of the value of academic engagement may help diminish their self-handicapping tendencies. With respect to reducing psychological control, school psychologists should advise teachers that the use of manipulative techniques like guilt-induction and love withdrawal to pressure students into compliance with the teacher’s agenda should be cautiously avoided. As results of the current study indicate, when students do not have to constantly seek teacher approval in order to feel good about themselves, they are less likely to engage in self-handicapping.</p>
<p>In addition to providing help with teachers’ professional development, school psychologists can design intervention programs to boost adolescents’ self-efficacy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034312466423">Bandura (1997)</xref> maintained that students with higher academic self-efficacy work harder and persist longer. Such observation is parallel with the present findings that the lack of efficacy is positively associated with help avoidance. Before implementing interventions to promote students’ self-efficacy, school psychologists can assist them to improve the accuracy of efficacy appraisal. It was found that underestimated self-efficacy beliefs can be responsible for the use of avoidance strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143034312466423">Pajares, 2002</xref>). There are several strategies that school psychologists may deploy to alter adolescents’ academic self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143034312466423">Jonson-Reid, Davis, Saunders, Williams, &amp; Williams, 2005</xref>). First, psychologists can raise students’ self-efficacy by providing them with genuine success experiences with the performance at hand. Second, when a highly regarded school psychologist models excellence in an academic endeavor and encourages the student, the student’s self-efficacy may be increased. Third, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034312466423">Bandura (1997)</xref>, a sense of power and control over one’s environment affects the individual’s self-efficacy. When school psychologists intervene to help adolescents cope with personal problems (e.g. problems with bullying or violence at school), adolescents’ academic self-efficacy may be improved because of a heightened sense of personal power and control. Through the implementation of these practices, school psychologists may be able to considerably reduce adolescents’ tendencies to engage in avoidance strategies and therefore ameliorate the educational outcomes for them.</p>
