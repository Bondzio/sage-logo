<abstract>
<p>This article investigates the online and offline experiences of young people living in rural communities. It draws upon data from the AHRC-funded research project, ‘Young people’s creative understanding of their mediaworlds’ (2008–10), in which young people aged 14–15 created ‘identity boxes’ to explore the place of media in their lives. The article demonstrates that many young people in rural areas were disengaged with new media and highlights why, for some individuals, online inclusion increased their feelings of cultural exclusion. The article reveals that many young people in rural areas made use of new media technologies only when they saw them as having a practical value relevant to their lives. The article further demonstrates the use of a creative visual method as a process which elicits reflective comments about a taken-for-granted world, and contributes empirically to knowledge about young people’s uses of new media within their everyday lives.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is often claimed that the traditional notion of the media ‘audience’ is collapsing, especially for young people, as engagement with popular culture today means creating and sharing media as well as consuming it (for example, this has been the starting point for each of the ‘Transforming Audiences’ conferences 2007, 2009 and 2011; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.transformingaudiences.org.uk">www.transformingaudiences.org.uk</ext-link>). Traditional models, which were based around notions such as the ‘reception’ of television broadcasting or the ‘reading’ of mass-produced media products, are now only partially useful. Today’s media consumers also can be media producers, sharing images and music that they have created online, making online presentations of self (as on Facebook and Twitter), collaboratively producing knowledge in wikis, and using various Web 2.0 tools to communicate, share information, ideas and media materials, and to express themselves.</p>
<p>However, such claims can be overblown: individuals may not want to be creating a lot of the time – they might simply want to be entertained – and although online tools have become simpler to use in recent years, there are different degrees of skill and comfort with new technologies and, of course, different levels of technical, cultural and financial resources affect people’s access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367549412457476">Hargittai, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367549412457476">2010</xref>). This article investigates the online (and offline) experiences of young people aged 14–15 from rural areas and aims to develop broader understandings of these young people’s use of media within their everyday lives. The fieldwork was conducted as part of the AHRC-funded research project, ‘Young people’s creative understanding of their mediaworlds’ (2008–10), reference AH/F009682/1. The discussion begins with an overview of the research context of this study, before moving on to outline the methodology used in this work and presenting its results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1367549412457476">
<title>Research context</title>
<p>Previous studies have gathered data about young people’s access, usage and preferences in relation to new technologies, and connected them with issues of regulation and parental involvement. In the UK the most significant study of this type has been the ESRC-funded ‘UK Children Go Online’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367549412457476">Livingstone and Bober, 2005</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367549412457476">Livingstone, 2009</xref>), alongside more specific surveys such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367549412457476">Marsh et al. (2005)</xref>, focused on children from birth to six, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1367549412457476">Valentine et al. (2005)</xref>, which concerned young people’s home use of new technologies for educational purposes. Industry surveys may have gathered similar information, but often their findings are not fully accessible. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367549412457476">Buckingham (2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367549412457476">Carr et al., 2006</xref>) has conducted a number of studies of children and new media in terms of children’s culture, gaming and educational policy, and other studies recently have examined user-generated content, MySpace and the YouTube phenomenon (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367549412457476">Burgess and Green, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367549412457476">Gillmor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1367549412457476">Snickars and Vonderau, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, writers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1367549412457476">McMillan (2006)</xref> have sought to develop models of interactivity and, more broadly, the multitude of ways in which people are using the internet to communicate, interact and express themselves have been discussed in the collections edited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367549412457476">Gauntlett and Horsley (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1367549412457476">Tremayne (2006)</xref>, and others. There have also been many contributions to theories of the information society proposed by writers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367549412457476">Benkler (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367549412457476">Castells (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367549412457476">2009</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1367549412457476">Webster (2006)</xref>. Nevertheless, many of the empirical studies tend to be predominantly policy-orientated (‘Do we need to be worried about teenagers’ use of X?’) or take technology as their starting point (‘What are users doing with technology X?’). Moreover, what becomes apparent when looking at the existing literature on young people’s uses of new media is that there are relatively few empirical studies that focus on rural young people’s online experiences within their everyday environments and practices (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1367549412457476">Valentine and Holloway, 2001</xref>), and much of this work is specific to the USA (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367549412457476">Bell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367549412457476">Ito et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, significant gaps exist in our knowledge about young people’s uses of new media technologies from UK rural communities and its integration within their everyday lives.</p>
<p>Another important context for this project is the growing interest in creative and visual methods within social research, in which a diversity of techniques – such as collage-making, drawing, video-making, photography and building models – have been employed to explore people’s attitudes, feelings and experiences on a particular issue (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367549412457476">Belk et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367549412457476">Bloustein, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367549412457476">Guillemin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367549412457476">Holliday, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367549412457476">Radley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1367549412457476">Raggl and Schratz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1367549412457476">Young and Barrett, 2001</xref>). For example, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367549412457476">Radley et al. (2005)</xref> asked homeless adults to photograph places and activities of personal significance in order to ‘collect a series of glimpses of the city as seen through their eyes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367549412457476">2005</xref>: 276). The researchers then discussed the images produced with the participants, which led to insights into homeless life. Importantly, the photographs did not constitute an object of study in themselves, but served to engender communication which itself became intrinsic to the analysis. Hence, the researchers claimed that this kind of interview can be conceptualised as a dialogic relationship between researcher and participant through which meaning is produced in a dialectical process, and therefore not imposed by either party. Examples of this kind, as well as our own successful exploratory studies in which participants were invited to make video, collage and three-dimensional models (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367549412457476">Awan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367549412457476">Gauntlett, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367549412457476">2007</xref>), gave us confidence about the benefits of creative and visual methods and their ability to produce insightful findings.</p>
<p>As well as understanding what young people do with the media in all its forms – which to some extent we know already from academic and commercial studies – this study sought to get to grips with the motivations, tensions and conflicts that drive and affect media use and communication, and had an impact upon the outcomes (such as how the self is presented, how new information is responded to, which trends or issues become popular and have advocates, or are deprecated and have detractors). Consequently, this study began with young people’s own sense of self and identity, and then sought to explore how traditional and new media fit into this sphere.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1367549412457476">1</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1367549412457476" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Traditionally, media audience researchers have focused on the consumption of one type of media, or even one particular programme or product (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367549412457476">Ang, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367549412457476">Hermes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367549412457476">Hobson, 1982</xref>). However, this study was based on the assumption that in order to gain richer understandings of the place of media in young people’s lives we must take a broader view by recognising that individuals encounter and engage with many types of media every day, and that all of these are significant together. Furthermore, it is already becoming clear that traditional quantitative and qualitative research methods only give us a partial understanding of people’s media experiences, and as such we need new forms of empirical research to understand more fully the everyday experience of living and participating in a complex mediaworld (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367549412457476">Bird, 2003</xref>). This connects with the shift in media audience studies which argues that research participants should not be merely expected to generate talk about their media consumption, but should be given opportunities to create, and then reflect upon, creative artefacts themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367549412457476">Gauntlett, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367549412457476">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367549412457476">2007</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section4-1367549412457476">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>As this study set out to develop broader understandings of young people’s identities and the place of media within their everyday lives, it was deemed appropriate to select male and female participants from a variety of class and ethnic backgrounds to allow for a wide spectrum of responses. In order to achieve this, schools in Newcastle, Manchester, London, Southampton, Dorset and Cumbria were selected and provided a combined total of 10 groups of young people aged 14–15 for the project (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367549412457476">Table 1</xref> below). Five of the schools had a predominantly ‘white’ student cohort, while the other three were emphatically multicultural, and the schools were situated in both socially and economically deprived as well as affluent areas. In addition, it was emphasised to teachers that participating groups should not be selected by ability; rather, they should be generally representative of the student body.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The fieldwork ran from January 2009 to May 2009 in classroom environments, and was conducted by the project researcher with a teacher present.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1367549412457476">2</xref></sup> The students were introduced to the project during a session in class in which the researcher briefly discussed with the students the different elements which make up ‘the media’ and the fact that today people can make and share media themselves. It was explained that the researchers were interested in <italic>their understandings</italic> of their relationships with the media, and that this would be explored through asking the students to make something, and listening to what they have to say about it.</p>
<p>There was an exercise to introduce the idea of representing metaphors with objects in which students were asked to suggest words to describe popular celebrities, and then asked to select art or craft materials (from a broad selection) which somehow could represent these words. The researcher introduced the idea of making an ‘identity box’ to represent one’s identity, using visual metaphors: this would begin with a shoebox-type cardboard box (provided), which then could be added to and changed in any way that the students liked by using any of a wide range of art and craft materials provided, or anything else from home or elsewhere over the following week. The students were given a prompt sheet entitled ‘Things you should think about when making your identity box’, which asked them to think about the following: ‘What makes you “you”?’, including personality, interests and values; ‘Your world’, including people and places, community and culture; and ‘Your media’, including favourites, impact and the question: ‘Why is your media important to you?’ The students were reminded: ‘Try to show where your media connects with you and your life.’ In addition, the students were invited to take the box home for a week and to add metaphorical images and items to it.</p>
<p>We are aware that by inviting young people to think about and represent their identities, and the place of media within their lives, we were setting a certain kind of agenda. This meant that potentially we could hit the problem exhibited in the studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1367549412457476">Greg Philo (1990)</xref> and colleagues, where the researchers asked participants to produce newspaper headlines and stories and then appeared to be unreasonably surprised that the responses were written in the typical style of newspaper headlines and stories. It seems at least possible that the participants were simply doing what they thought they were being asked to do, and were imitating successfully the style of journalists rather than – as Philo seemed to think – inadvertently revealing the extent to which the media had affected their thinking about an issue. Similarly, we could not take it as significant that the present study’s participants had made connections between their identities and media products and services in general, because that was what we had asked them, at least in part, to represent. Nevertheless, we could take a legitimate interest in exactly what was represented, or left out, and the ways in which things were associated and connected (or not) within each identity box, and could explore these in dialogue with the participant.</p>
<p>The following are examples of the work produced and show that in some cases the identity boxes were packed with visual imagery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1367549412457476">Figure 1</xref>); conversely some were quite bare, without much imagery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1367549412457476">Figure 2</xref>); some illustrated that the participants had solely drawn upon visual imagery to convey their ideas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1367549412457476">Figure 3</xref>); and in other instances, imagery was accompanied by printed text to express further facets of the individual’s identity and the media that they utilise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1367549412457476">Figure 4</xref>):</p>

<p>Further time was made available by the schools during teaching hours for unstructured interviews to take place, in which the participants discussed their own self-reflexive explanations of the identity boxes that they had created: no teachers were present during these interviews, in order to ensure the young people’s confidentiality. The 10 groups produced 138 identity boxes and accompanying reflective commentaries, which formed the data upon which the results of this article are taken.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1367549412457476">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Within this study the creative work produced by the participants constituted an integral component of the research process by affording them time to engage and consider the research exercise, rather than having to produce an instant linguistic response. Then, as mentioned above, one-to-one unstructured interviews were conducted with the participants in which they reflected upon and offered interpretations of their own work. Interviewing and the data that this produces has been criticised for a number of reasons, including: participants may struggle to articulate their thoughts or feelings and/or may provide responses that they believe the interviewer desires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367549412457476">Bertrand and Hughes, 2005</xref>); the interview environment leads to a power imbalance in the research process which positions the interviewer above the interviewee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367549412457476">Holstein and Gubrium, 1997</xref>); and, the data provided by interviews is frequently misunderstood as a ‘window onto the world [rather than] the rhetoric of socially situated speakers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367549412457476">Lindlof, 1995</xref>: 165).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1367549412457476">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>In relation to this study the interviews fundamentally served as a means through which the participants could voice thoughts and feelings regarding their identity boxes on their own terms, and enabled the researchers to clarify any points by developing upon the young people’s responses. As such, the interviews did not explore themes predetermined by the researchers; rather, themes emerged out of the responses provided by the young people themselves. The interviews were not evaluated using computer programmes for qualitative data analysis, such as NVivo; instead, the researchers elected to adopt a fully ‘hands-on’, manual approach by immersing themselves within the interview data, reading and re-reading the transcripts in order to become familiar with the participants’ voices. During this process the themes that emerged in the data were identified, and headings describing the content of the participants’ responses were assigned – the technique known as ‘open coding’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367549412457476">Burnard, 1991</xref>). Following this, both the themes and headings (along with the relevant interview extracts) were grouped into broader categories, which provided the framework for the final analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1367549412457476">
<title>Interpretation</title>
<p>The study was centred upon visual materials in that its most evident product was the 138 identity boxes which constituted the basis for the investigation. Confronted by such conspicuous visual artefacts, the researcher may have a tendency to focus exclusively upon an interpretive strategy grounded in visual communication theory (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367549412457476">Kress and van Leeuwen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367549412457476">Rose, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1367549412457476">Sturken and Cartwright, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>However, such approaches are deeply problematic, as much work in this area purports to analyse how people use visual media in the context of their lived experience, but in practice imposes the author’s privileged ‘reading’ onto the visual text and presumes that these interpretations exemplify those of the audience as a whole (as argued in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367549412457476">Gauntlett, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367549412457476">2007</xref>). In contrast, within this study the participants actively produced visual materials and engaged in an ongoing process of analysis throughout the course of the research exercise. This position is informed by feminist criticisms of traditional methods which have highlighted that participants often have little impact on the direction or agenda of the research, instead acting merely as passive ‘subjects’ who provide data (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367549412457476">Hesse-Biber and Yaiser, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367549412457476">Letherby, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1367549412457476">Reinharz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367549412457476">Roberts, 1981</xref>). Creative techniques seek to overcome these limitations by proposing a more dialogic model which enables participants to shape and influence the research itself, thereby ensuring that they are represented more effectively rather than having researchers’ interpretations projected upon them. Of course, any kind of analysis requires the researcher to take on an interpretive role: interviews do not ‘speak for themselves’; but we sought to stick closely to the participants’ own interpretation and explanation of the thing that they had made, rather than take the less respectful and more patronising route of trying to second guess the ‘real meaning’ of something which a participant had brought to our attention (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367549412457476">Gauntlett, 2007</xref> for a more detailed discussion).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Although this study engaged with participants from a number of English regions, this article specifically focuses on the results produced by the young people from Cumbria, as they highlight issues that were particular to young people living in rural environments. While the participants came from mixed socio-economic backgrounds (most being working class), the results do not attempt to show differences in answer patterns between classes, which would be problematic given the small qualitative samples and hazy definitions of class. Instead, the focus of this article is on how young people living in a rural area use new media within their everyday lives.</p>
<p>The school, Samuel King’s School, is situated in the isolated village of Alston within the foothills of the North Pennines, and is approximately 20 miles from the nearest town, Carlisle. Samuel King’s School is a very small 11–16 mixed-sex secondary school, with 204 pupils from Alston and its surrounding villages and hamlets across Cumbria and Northumbria. In spite of the school’s remote location it had substantial technological resources: almost every classroom had computers (a ratio of one computer per student) and pupils were actively encouraged to use a virtual learning environment available on the school’s website. This has been aided by the Cybermoor Project which was implemented in 2003 as a response to a government initiative, ‘Wired Up Communities’, that sought to connect rural communities to the World Wide Web. For example, every household in Alston was given a free computer and internet access for a limited period of time, as well as practical training on how to use the internet. The Cybermoor Project’s main aims were to:</p>
<list id="list1-1367549412457476" list-type="order"><list-item><p>Encourage more people to use the internet for public services;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provide faster broadband connections to homes in Alston; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Encourage people to learn new skills through distance learning.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Therefore, the Cybermoor Project set out to establish Alston as a model for other rural communities to follow (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cybermoor.org">www.cybermoor.org</ext-link>). Consequently, the inclusion of participants from Alston was a deliberate one due to its role in this initiative, as well as the underrepresentation of rural communities in studies of young people’s uses of media within their everyday lives.</p>
<sec id="section9-1367549412457476">
<title>Uses of traditional media</title>
<p>The responses of many participants in this study revealed similarities in attitudes towards traditional media sources, common to both urban and rural young people, and are similar to the findings of previous research. However, some significant differences in the attitudes of rural young people were exposed, on which it is worth commenting. For example, for participants from both rural and urban areas, television was primarily viewed with family and/or friends, its main function being that it acted as a tool to facilitate communication within the home environment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367549412457476">Lull, 1980</xref>). Nevertheless, the majority of young people stated that they did not watch much television, perceiving it as a passive activity; rather, they expressed a preference for ‘doing things’ on the internet, and more physical hobbies such as playing sport and craft activities:<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t watch too much TV because it’s boring … I prefer to talk to them [friends and family] on Facebook and play games with them, things like that … I play football. I go out on my bike sometimes when it’s nice and play tennis with my friends. I started doing some golf with them as well now, there’s a golf course up near Garrigill, so [I] go up there sometimes. (Matthew)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Indeed, it was this perceived passivity that held the attraction of television viewing for many participants who came to see this as a form of relaxation. Nevertheless, whereas urban young people appeared to equate this relaxation with being ‘lazy’, rural participants – many of whom worked on farms after school, at the weekends and throughout school holidays – saw using television as a legitimate means of relaxing after periods of hard labour:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>When do you usually watch television?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Andrew:</speaker>
<p>After working on the farm – it’s relaxing and I can relax and do nothing. Just relax with the family.</p>
</speech>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the types of programmes watched, rural young people emphasised viewing the news, which may indicate a belief that, given their geographical remoteness, they had to make a more conscious effort to engage with the wider world than their urban counterparts:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>So are there any particular television programmes that you watch?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mark:</speaker>
<p>I don’t watch, like I don’t watch stuff every night apart from the news so I know what’s going on in the world. That’s important, like, to keep in touch with the bigger world, especially when you live here [Alston].</p>
</speech>
<p>This notion of isolation was further apparent in the remarks that girls made about magazines they read – predominantly fashion and celebrity gossip magazines. Although both rural and urban participants read magazines, citing them as an easier and more convenient source of information on topics of interest such as fashion than searching on the internet, the rural girls expressed frustration at not being able to purchase these for logistical and financial reasons:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>I’m assuming in Sunderland you had easy access to shops. Do you find that hard about living in Alston?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Samantha:</speaker>
<p>I’ve lived here for five years and it’s still not the same, because I could just walk to the shops to, like, get a magazine in Sunderland, but here I’ve got to get my dad to take us because the shop is a drive away. It’s annoying.</p>
</speech>
<p>In addition, rural boys’ choices of magazines and newspapers reflected their immediate environment and practical challenges, such as <italic>Farmers Guardian, Farmers Weekly</italic> and <italic>Tractor</italic>, rather than more common teenage (urban) cultural interests such as film, music or computer games:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Are there any magazines or newspapers that you read?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Jack:</speaker>
<p>I read the newspaper at home, the <italic>Farmers Guardian</italic>, it’s good for farming things, like information – and I buy <italic>Tractor</italic> magazine, I like the diggers, sometimes I use them when I’m working on the farm.</p>
</speech>
<p>With regard to cultural activities, unsurprisingly music played a significant role in the lives of both rural and urban young people, often being used as a medium through which they expressed their moods and emotions:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Jessica:</speaker>
<p>I listen to everything except opera, because I don’t really like that. I like listening to dancey stuff like during the day, and then listen to like classical stuff like on a night before I go to bed, because it’s just like a wind down.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>So do you use music just depending on what type of mood you are in?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Jessica:</speaker>
<p>Yeah. Like if I’m in a bad mood I might put on rock music, like loud guitars, or I’ll put on dancey stuff and it’ll make us not in a bad mood anymore.</p>
</speech>
<p>However, in contrast to urban participants who articulated the importance of a song’s lyrics as a means of authentically communicating their own experiences (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367549412457476">Awan, 2008</xref>), the rural participants in this study made no personal or direct association with the lyrical content of songs. Moreover, whereas urban young people were more inclined to download music from online services, those in rural areas tended to buy CDs. Similarly, and in relation to film, young people from urban areas frequently watched and/or downloaded these from the internet as well as going to the cinema, while those in rural locations who did not have easy access to cinemas (the nearest being in Carlisle, approximately 20 miles away) generally opted for DVDs instead:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Do you go to the cinema?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Stephen:</speaker>
<p>No, just DVDs … There’s like a DVD cinema, new releases of DVDs just three miles down the road, but the closest cinema would be in Carlisle.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Do you download films from the internet?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Stephen:</speaker>
<p>No, I know how to but don’t.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Why not? Wouldn’t it be easier?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Stephen:</speaker>
<p>Probably, just don’t. Not sure, just don’t. I’m just used to DVDs.</p>
</speech>
<p>As such, despite having access to the internet, these young people in rural communities appear to be less inclined to fully exploit the potential offered by the internet to overcome their geographical isolation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1367549412457476">
<title>Uses of new media</title>
<p>Social networking websites such as Bebo, Facebook and MySpace were used to maintain contact, develop relationships and communicate with family and friends (as identified in other research such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367549412457476">Lenhart and Madden, 2007</xref>). These young people did not utilise such websites to establish new relationships; typically, all listed friends were already a part of their existing social network, and these young people utilised such websites to augment existing relationships. Furthermore, both rural and urban young people admitted that their engagement with such sites was motivated at times by boredom, but also stated that they viewed them as a means to communicate without the risk of being overheard by others. However, what became apparent with the young people from rural areas is that there appeared to be a sense of disengagement with new media technologies once they were no longer seen as a novelty:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>So it sounds like you don’t actually use the computer that much?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Khloe:</speaker>
<p>Not much, not really. I used to, like when I first got it I’d be on it every night, all night – but the novelty’s worn off, it’s just boring now.</p>
</speech>
<p>Indeed, in contrast to the majority of urban young people who spent a lot of their leisure time using social networking websites, the rural participants engaged with new media technology to assist them with homework, play games and send the occasional email. Although some rural participants reported using websites such as Facebook to ‘chat’ with others, this seemed to be principally a matter of expense – a cheaper alternative to mobile phones – rather than a desire to involve themselves with the online social network itself. For many of the rural participants the internet was used when they could see that it had an immediate practical purpose that was integrated with their everyday lives. For example, the internet was used to assist in the administration associated with farming, such as buying equipment or registering livestock, and for purchasing day-to-day essentials, such as food shopping:<disp-quote>
<p>My mum, [to] register the cows, you go onto this website and you can register them to DEFRA [Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs], so we don’t have to go like 20, 30, drive 30 mile[s] to register them, so it’s a lot easier just to go onto the computer and the internet … Whenever we need a machine or a tractor, you just type in what website you want and you can find all the dailies and they’re just there for you, all the information and you just telephone them … With the shopping, mum just goes to Asda [website] and just gets it delivered, so she doesn’t have to go 30 or 40 mile[s] to the supermarket or something …. she finds it a lot easier to do that. (Jake)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Instead, on the whole these rural young people expressed that they preferred engaging in outdoor activities and pursuits related to this physical environment, such as biking, walking, climbing, fishing, hunting, ferreting and ‘lamping’ (an activity undertaken at night which involves shining a spotlight on a rabbit in a field, and then releasing a dog to chase and catch it). In addition, a few of these young people made and sold craft items, again related to their physical environment: for example, shepherd’s crooks and hutches, as well as taking casual work as hunt beaters and farm labourers:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>And what is the flag for?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Joss:</speaker>
<p>Oh that’s for beating. It’s made out of, you get a bit of hazel or something, like a piece of wood, and then you get a, do you know the dog food bags?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Joss:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, you cut like a bit of plastic off there, about that big, and then you attach it on, and then it makes a proper cracking sound … And then you do that all day and you get £40 at the end of it.</p>
</speech>
<p>Such activities were undertaken often for monetary gain, as unemployment is a very real issue for many families living in this area. Also, young people frequently engaged in farming duties in order to help out on their parents’ farms which were struggling financially. One teacher told us that he had come to accept students falling asleep in class during busy farming periods (such as the lambing season) as a matter of course, as the young people may well have been working through the night and farming was the most important aspect of their lives – which might account for Cumbria’s record of low educational attainment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to outsiders it might be easy to view rural life as a romantic idyll, but Cumbria, and Alston specifically, are marked by a number of social problems such as drug and alcohol abuse, particularly among young people. This could be attributed to boredom and a lack of social facilities. Indeed, much of the young people’s leisure time was spent hanging around in the town centre, drinking, listening to music, lighting campfires and dancing with friends. Like their urban counterparts, the rural young people seemingly take part in these activities with the specific aim of creating a social space for themselves, so that they can feel they are part of something and can engender a sense of belonging:<disp-quote>
<p>We do drink on the streets, then we all either play music and we have a dance round in the park or something. We make our own little party outside, it’s kind of good. Mean, like, sometimes we’ll light fires and that, it’s kind of good. (Abigail)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, for rural participants this need for a physical connection with others may be attributable to their geographical location, in which a sense of isolation is prevalent: many of these young people lived in homes miles from their nearest neighbour and thus were dependent on their parents for transport. Consequently, while the internet enables some forms of communication to take place with ease, it cannot compensate for or overcome remoteness and offer physical connections with other young people. Indeed, some participants emphasised that there was a desperate need for youth groups and schemes in the area to offer them a place to go and things to do. Boredom was a recurring theme in many participants’ accounts:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>What would make Alston a better place for you?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Aaron:</speaker>
<p>If it wasn’t so far away from anywhere else and boring, and if there was more things to do here for young people especially, like groups, you know.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1367549412457476">
<title>Frustrations with (traditional and new) media</title>
<p>Despite their frustrations with their rural environment, most of the participants expressed great pride in and a strong desire to preserve their heritage, as well as hostility towards urban agendas perceived to be influencing and impacting upon their lives:<disp-quote>
<p>But some people will come out and, you know, and they’ll come to the Dale and they’ll state their views and they try to change our culture. Like I think the ban on hunting is completely wrong, but people from inner cities, they just said ‘Oh, hunting’s wrong because it’s all inhumane’, but it’s <italic>our</italic> culture, why should we stop our culture? (Gerrard)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As such the identity boxes of these participants tended to feature aspects of their rural environment and relate to their rural lifestyle, whereas the media was not drawn upon to any great extent, in many cases being notably absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1367549412457476">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1367549412457476">Figure 6</xref> below):</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1367549412457476-fig6.tif"/></fig>
<p>In the view of these young people the media did not hold a significant place in their lives, and was seen as possibly representing a metropolitan bias which failed to articulate the views and concerns of the rural community:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>But does the media [have any relevance]?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Gerrard:</speaker>
<p>Erm, not really, not in my, not in my big world, not in my bigger picture, you know.</p>
</speech>
<p>In contrast with this, the small minority of participants who did use the internet on a regular basis were those who desired to ‘escape’ to the city as they were bored with their rural environment, sought diversity and expressed an interest in other people and cultures. Many of these young people were those who had an interest in or wished to pursue a career in the arts – which they felt was not considered to be of worth within their rural community – and used the internet as a source of information on the arts world:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>How would you feel if I suddenly took the internet away from you?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Martin:</speaker>
<p>It would destroy us probably … because I wouldn’t be able to find out any information on dance and dance events, the thing I like most, and I wouldn’t meet new people. So the internet does make quite a big difference and so does meeting new people, but the internet helps us do that in the first place.</p>
</speech>
<p>Ironically, rather than making these young people feel connected to the arts and the wider world, the internet seemed to remind them of their isolation and distance from their desired locations and goals, and therefore compounded their feelings of isolation:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>When you see things on the internet, like concerts or fashion shows, does it make you feel closer to it or do you feel more isolated?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Danielle:</speaker>
<p>More isolated. Just like because there’s nothing like that where we are, up like round here.</p>
</speech>
<p>Paradoxically, these same participants viewed their online identity as a more authentic and accurate representation of their real selves than the identity they presented within their rural social environment, for example:<disp-quote>
<p>Here [Alston] I have to be like everyone else, but there [Facebook] I can be myself … I want to be a fashion designer, so I show and chat about that kind of stuff with my friends in Newcastle. (Danielle)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This seems to be because they felt alienated from others in their immediate locale, as their differing aspirations and interests did not conform to accepted social norms within their rural sphere; whereas the individuals they communicated with via the internet, whom they had met at arts-based youth groups run for like-minded young people, were those who shared the same aspirations and interests. As such, the internet was very important for these young people as it enabled them to communicate and remain in contact with similar minded friends and arts events.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the internet seemed to foster a sense of ‘double isolation’ in that the young people were not only confined by their physical environment (which they saw as being limited to home and school), but online information and networks also increased their sense of isolation by highlighting how far they were from what they sought to attain:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Are most of your friends here [Alston]?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Rachel:</speaker>
<p>In youth theatre near Newcastle. I go to a youth theatre, as I said, and I spend a lot of time with them in Newcastle and Durham and around there, so I have a few friends here, but more of them, my close friends, are in my youth theatre.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Do you use social networking websites to say in contact with them much?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Rachel:</speaker>
<p>I stay in contact with them through Facebook when I’m not with them. I share photos and stuff with them about me …</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Could you live here [Alston] forever?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Rachel:</speaker>
<p>Never. I could never live here forever, it’s just I’d feel suffocated really. It’s very narrow-minded; it’s everyone seems to have, rather than their own view, it’s the view of, everyone around seems to be the same and it’s all about shooting or what’s happening in the rural – and I think it’s because a lot of people around here don’t have the same social views as people from other places. They’re not used to it … I think people think it’s sort of bigheaded of me to think that I’d be able to do something like that [acting], so I don’t say much about it … My closest friends at school live a few villages away, so I’m basically on my own in the village …</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Do you feel confined between school and home?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Rachel:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, that’s basically my life.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Is there anything that could improve it, because I would have thought that that the internet would have improved it?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Rachel:</speaker>
<p>It has improved it a lot. I mean, before that I was a lot more isolated than I am now so it has improved things, <italic>but it reminds me that I want to get away from here and start doing things with my life</italic>. (emphasis added)</p>
</speech>
<p>Within this rural community, two distinct groups emerged: those who were immersed in rural life and culture, who made very little use of new media technologies unless they could see immediate practical value in doing so; and those who were actively engaged with internet culture, who aimed to move to a city and escape the perceived confines of rural life. Indeed, for the young people who were relatively uninterested in the internet, their frustrations were fuelled further by technical difficulties such as slow broadband connections and outmoded equipment:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Did you get one [computer]?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Rowan:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, well they are about four years old now but they’re really rubbish. They’re like the worst network ever because it just like, constantly doesn’t work.</p>
</speech>
<p>These straightforward technical problems exacerbated rural young people’s sense that the internet was not really for them. Furthermore, as discussed above, wider social issues – such as unemployment and geographical isolation – also appeared to influence the young people’s engagement with new media. For example, instead of utilising the internet in their leisure time, some rural participants undertook paid employment to financially assist their families, while some young people sought to connect with others physically rather than electronically to compensate for their feelings of isolation. In addition, those young people who did engage with the internet used it to help alleviate their sense of social isolation through forging online connections with like-minded individuals, although this gave rise to feelings of ‘double isolation’.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has discussed the online (and offline) experiences of young people aged 14–15 from rural areas, and has aimed to develop broader understandings of these young people’s uses of media within their everyday lives. In addition, although these participants do not constitute a scientifically constructed representative sample, the themes which have emerged – for example, online inclusion increasing feelings of cultural exclusion – warrant further exploration in future research. Furthermore, we acknowledge that this study was specific to these young people living in a particular time and within certain locations, and as such, while it presents suggestive evidence, the results presented here cannot be used to make generalising claims.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, what has become apparent within the preceding discussion is that while initiatives such as the Cybermoor Project have given individuals much-needed access to new media technologies generally, this is not enough in itself. Indeed, what is revealed in the results is that the majority of young people living in Alston were not especially interested or engaged with new media, and in contrast to previous findings from the USA on internet use in rural areas, were not enthusiastic adopters of the internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367549412457476">Bell et al., 2004</xref>) or using online tools to invert feelings of geographical and social isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367549412457476">Ito et al., 2009</xref>). For many of the young people in the present study, the internet was not perceived as a global platform for articulating their rural identities and values, neither was it utilised as a means of reinforcing their own sense of uniqueness – contrasting with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367549412457476">Miller and Slater (2000)</xref> in their seminal ethnographic study of the role of the internet in the lives of Trinidadians.</p>
<p>Moreover, often the factors underlying the young people’s disengagement with new media technologies were related to deeper economic and social problems which these tools may help to mitigate, but which are unlikely to be resolved without government or third sector interventions. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367549412457476">Sreekumar’s (2007)</xref> work on the use of information and communication technologies in development projects in rural India highlights, ‘the application of information technology has not in itself led to any profound transformation of the social and economic milieu of marginalized groups’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367549412457476">2007</xref>: 870); ‘[c]ontrary to popular belief, these social enterprises are not inclusive enough, and the social factors that perpetuate inequalities in rural areas are in fact reinforced by the projects rather than eliminated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367549412457476">2007</xref>: 885). Therefore, as Neil Selwyn states, ‘neither academics nor policy-makers can afford to lose sight of fundamental issues of inequality and disempowerment which technology may not be capable of addressing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1367549412457476">2002</xref>: 17).</p>
<p>Consequently, in light of the present study’s results, we would suggest that future initiatives should focus on helping young people, from both rural and urban environments, to fully exploit the potential of new media technologies in ways that are more relevant to their lives. For example, while some rural participants showed little interest in the internet, they utilised it when they perceived it to be of direct practical use within their lived experience – such as registering farm stock with the government – and it is this very notion of relevance that should be built upon and extended if young people are to be given opportunities to recognise the potential value of new media in other spheres of their everyday practices and lives, such as education, learning and cultural activities. In doing so we would argue, based on the present study’s results, that this may help alleviate feelings of exclusion and/or isolation encountered by young people from rural areas, and instead may foster a greater sense of social participation and inclusion.</p>
<p>This article also demonstrates that the procedure of making and subsequently discussing the identity boxes in this study encouraged participants to go through a reflective process, considering the place of media within their everyday lives. Some young people still presented the researchers with relatively perfunctory information, as ever, but others provided data which moved to a level of thoughtfulness that we would not expect from a more direct, one-stop interview process. Four factors were especially significant. First, having time to consider questions and develop a response prompted richer discussion. Second, in guiding researchers around the object that they had made, the participants were able to take the lead in providing an account of media in their lives. Third, having the physical object filled with metaphors as part of the discussion meant that participants were able to recall important and meaningful elements and to make connections between them. Fourth, the use of metaphors provided a valuable alternative to the strictures imposed by formal language, and facilitated more associative forms of ‘open expression’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1367549412457476">Williams, 2002</xref>: 55). Thus, the methodology used, driven by a creative and visual process, has helped to elicit detail about rural young people’s uses of new media which more immediate interviews would be less likely to detect.</p>

<p>During these sessions the participating teacher was asked to refrain from intervening – which they agreed to and complied with – except in instances when the researcher required assistance with difficult students. A criticism that could be levelled against this work is that conducting the research within a classroom environment where the participants were surrounded by the presence of peers and a teacher could have impacted on how they constructed their identity boxes; however, the fact that the young people’s identity boxes represented diverse and contradictory elements of their identities arguably implies that the research context did not affect their ability to communicate this, and participants were able to take their identity boxes away with them to complete in their own time.</p></fn>
