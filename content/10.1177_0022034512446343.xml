<abstract>
<p>Xerostomia is the symptom of oral dryness resulting most frequently, but not exclusively, from salivary gland hypofunction. Because the prevalence of xerostomia may increase with age, it has multiple oral health consequences in aging populations. In the present study, we demonstrate that the <italic>in vivo</italic> administration of 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR; decitabine), a DNA demethylating agent, to the murine aging model C57BL/6CrSlc mice (24 wks old) increased the volumes of salivary flow compared with those of control mice. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining demonstrated the augmented expression of AQP5 protein in the salivary glands of 5-Aza-CdR-treated mice compared with those of control mice. In addition, AQP5 protein expression levels in 5-Aza-CdR-treated old mice (27 wks old) were much higher than those in untreated and young mice (6 wks old). Global methylation levels in the salivary glands were significantly lower in the 5-Aza-CdR-treated mice than in the untreated mice. Moreover, the induction of demethylation in the AQP5 promoter of 5-Aza-CdR-treated mice was stronger than in the control mice. Analysis of our data therefore suggests that a DNA demethylating agent may be a useful drug for restoring hyposalivation in elderly individuals, thereby leading to the resolution of xerostomia.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Among the common problems significantly affecting quality of life among elderly people are a decrease in salivary flow (hyposalivation) and dry mouth (xerostomia). The prevalence of xerostomia increases with age and affects approximately 30% of people aged 65 yrs or older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034512446343">Ship <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). In addition, as salivary glands age, it has been demonstrated that acini decrease in number and are replaced with adipose and fibrotic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512446343">Atkinson and Fox, 1992</xref>). Therefore, elderly populations with xerostomia may suffer from many problems, such as difficulties with communication (speech), nutrition (digestion, chewing, swallowing), and sleep. However, numerous investigators have shown contradictory results indicating that the production and composition of saliva are largely age-independent in healthy people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022034512446343">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034512446343">Ship <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Aquaporins (AQPs) are specific water channels that allow the rapid transcellular movement of water in response to osmotic/hydrostatic pressure gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512446343">King and Yasui, 2002</xref>). One of the AQPs, AQP5, cloned from rat submandibular glands, is present in the water-transporting epithelia of the lacrimal gland, trachea, eye, lung, and salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512446343">Raina <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>). In human salivary glands, AQP5 has been topographically localized to the apical membranes of acinar cells but not to those of ductal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512446343">Agre <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>). It functions to allow the outflow of water into the acinar lumen. In fact, reduced salivary gland secretion has been shown in mice harboring the mutant AQP5 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512446343">Ma <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). Moreover, a marked age-related decrease was found in acetylcholine’s stimulatory effect, acting at the M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptor, on the levels of AQP5 expression in the apical plasma membranes on the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512446343">Inoue <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent studies have indicated that hypermethylation of CpG islands within the promoter and 5′ regions of genes is an important epigenetic mechanism for suppressing gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512446343">Jones and Laird, 1999</xref>). DNA hypermethylation may directly affect the basal transcriptional machinery by altering the DNA secondary structure and inducing chromosome remodeling through the methyl-group binding proteins and histone deacetylase, thereby leading to transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512446343">Di Croce <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Thus, treatment with a DNA demethylating agent, such as 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR; decitabine), reactivates many genes that have been inactivated by hypermethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512446343">Daskalakis <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022034512446343">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512446343">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on these considerations, we formulated a working hypothesis that the use of demethylation agents in the salivary gland tissues of aging populations would be a promising strategy for therapeutic intervention in patients with xerostomia.</p>

<title>Mice and Experimental Design</title>
<p>A female C57BL/6CrSlc mouse strain was reared in our specific pathogen-free mouse colony. The animals were purchased from Japan SLC (Hamamatsu, Japan) and given access to food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Mice at 6 (young) and 24 (aged) wks of age were investigated, consisting of control (saline administration, n = 10) and treated (1 mg 5-Aza-CdR/mouse kg, n = 10) mice. 5-Aza-CdR was administered intraperitoneally 3 times a wk from 24 to 27 wks of age. Our preliminary results demonstrated that the concentration of 5-Aza-CdR used in this study effectively prevents the destruction of the acinar structure in a murine Sjögren’s syndrome model mouse. The submandibular, sublingual, and parotid salivary glands from each mouse were surgically excised under halothane anesthesia (at 6 and 27 wks of age). The mice were cared for in accord with the institutional guidelines on animal welfare.</p>

<sec id="section4-0022034512446343">
<title>Measurement of Fluid Secretion</title>
<p>The salivary volumes of treated and untreated (control) mice were measured according to a modified method described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512446343">Delporte <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). In brief, under no anesthesia, intramuscular injection of pilocarpine (5 mg/kg) was performed, and then volumes of whole saliva were determined gravimetrically after the 15-minute collection by a method used in a Saxon test for the diagnosis of Sjögren’s syndrome patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512446343">Kohler and Winter, 1985</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-0022034512446343">
<title>Histology</title>
<p>The salivary (submandibular, sublingual, and parotid) glands were fixed with 4% phosphate-buffered formalin (pH 7.2) and prepared for histologic examination. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin.</p>

<title>Western Blot Analysis of AQP5 in Salivary Gland Tissues</title>
<p>The total membrane fraction was used for the analysis of AQP5 protein expression. The preparation of the total membrane fraction and Western blot analysis were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512446343">Motegi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; see Appendix for details).</p>

<title>Determination of 5-Methylcytosine DNA Content</title>
<p>The genomic DNA from salivary gland tissues of both 5-Aza-CdR-treated and untreated mice was extracted with an UltraClean<sup>R</sup>Tissue &amp; Cells DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. Isolated DNA was subjected to the measurement of the global DNA methylation levels in the salivary glands. The relative degrees of methylation in the DNA samples were quantified by means of a MethylFlash<sup>TM</sup> Methylated DNA Quantification Kit (EPIGENTEK, Farmingdale, NY, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Three replicates of each sample analyzed were carried out.</p>

<title>Methylation-specific Polymerase Chain-reaction (PCR) of AQP5 Gene Promoter</title>
<p>The DNA from salivary gland tissues of mice treated with or without 5-Aza-CdR was modified by sodium bisulfite treatment as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034512446343">Williams <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). The CpGenome DNA modification kit (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After bisulfite treatment, cytosine residues are deaminated and changed into uracil residues, but methylated cytosine remains unmodified. The modified DNA was then amplified by PCR with well-designed primer sets for unmethylated and methylated sequences of the selected CpG islands in the AQP5 gene promoter (GenBank<sup>TM</sup>/EMBL Data Bank no. NM009701). The primers used for amplification of the methylated and unmethylated forms of the AQP5 promoter were as follows: methylated form, 5′-TCGTTACGGGCGGATAAGGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-GC GACCGAAACATCTTAACCC-3′ (antisense); and unmethylated form, 5′-TGTTTTTGTTATGGGTGGATAAGGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCACACAACCAAAACATCTTAACCC-3′ (antisense). PCR reactions were performed as follows: 94°C for 1 min; 35 cycles at 94°C for 30 sec and at 58°C for 2 min; and then at 72°C for 3 min at the end. PCR products were analyzed in 2% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. <italic>In vitro</italic> methylated control (positive control; Intergen, Purchase, NY, USA) and DNA template-negative control (H<sub>2</sub>O) were included in PCR.</p>

<title>Pathology</title>
<p>All salivary glands from mice treated with or without 5-Aza-CdR were microscopically examined. At the age of 27 wks, no gross changes, such as mononuclear cell infiltration, acinar cell atrophy, or replacement with adipose and fibrotic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512446343">Atkinson and Fox, 1992</xref>), were observed in the salivary glands of either group (data not shown). During and after the experiment, although neither weight loss nor shortening of lifespan was observed in any of the mice by 5-Aza-CdR treatment, hematologic parameters implied a myelosuppression, as was shown in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome treated with 5-Aza-CdR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034512446343">Wijermans <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; see Appendix Fig. 1 for details).</p>

<title>Changes in Volumes of Fluid Secretion with Aging in Control Mice</title>
<p>The average salivary volume of the aged mice was significantly lower than in the young mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512446343">Fig. 1A</xref>).

<p>We used immunohistochemical analysis in an effort to examine the localization of the induced expression of AQP5 in the salivary glands of 5-Aza-CdR-treated mice. Submandibular gland acinar cells in untreated mice showed a weak staining for AQP5 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512446343">Fig. 3A</xref>, arrow).

Abundant AQP5 expression was confined to the apical plasma membrane domains of the acinar cells in all of the glands (data not shown). In addition, in the serous acini and demilunes of the mixed submandibular gland, staining for AQP5 could also be seen in the secretory canaliculi radiating from the small luminal space, as previously shown by other investigators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512446343">Gresz <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512446343">Figs. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512446343">3D</xref>, asterisks).

<title>Hypomethylation of CpG Islands of AQP5 Gene Promoter in the Salivary Glands of 5-Aza-CdR-treated Mice</title>
<p>The methylation status of the AQP5 gene CpG islands was investigated by methylation-specific PCR in the submandibular glands of both control and 5-Aza-CdR-treated mice at the age of 27 wks. 5-Aza-CdR treatment strongly induced an unmethylation-specific band in salivary gland tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512446343">Fig. 4B</xref>). Therefore, AQP5 expression is related, in part, to the methylation status of the gene promoter region.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Because the causes of xerostomia in the aging population are unknown, at present we have no adequate therapeutic modalities for patients with xerostomia. Therefore, current treatment approaches for the management of xerostomia are directed toward the relief of symptoms and of the resulting conditions. These approaches include the use of gustatory, masticatory, and pharmacologic stimulants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034512446343">Ship <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), replacement therapies (mouth-wetting agents) for the prevention of damage to oral health due to hyposalivation.</p>
<p>Epigenetic modification has been identified as a crucial event in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512446343">Issa, 2000</xref>). Although there are few studies that directly test the hypothesis that exogenous exposures are associated with different degrees of aberrant gene-specific methylation and silencing in normal aging tissues, the exact causes of age-related methylation in aging cells and tissues are incompletely defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512446343">Issa, 2002</xref>). Aberrant cytosine methylation of promoter regions represents a possible mechanism for gene silencing. Cytosine methylation has been inversely correlated with the transcription of many genes. Although the high content levels of CG nucleotides (CpG islands), which were found mainly in the promoter regions of housekeeping genes and some tissue-specific genes, are protected from methylation in normal mammalian cells, the methylation pattern is altered with aging. Therefore, to construct a novel therapy for the improvement of xerostomia in elderly individuals, we postulated a working hypothesis that the age-related hypermethylation of the AQP5 gene would be responsible for the down-regulation of AQP5 expression in patients’ salivary glands. As a consequence, we have shown, in this study, that demethylation by 5-Aza-CdR in the AQP5 gene promoter of salivary gland cells could lead to the restoration of decreased salivary flow in aged mice.</p>
<p>Thus far, the age-related hypermethylation of CpG islands located in promoters has been reported for several genes. The first gene that well-characterized the relationship between aging and CpG island methylation in normal tissues was the estrogen receptor (ER) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512446343">Issa <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>): ER methylation in normal colon mucosa increased linearly with age and occurred very frequently in cancer (close to 100%). In addition, it has been demonstrated that breast and colon cancer cell lines that showed such methylation did not express ER, and that mRNA expression could be restored by treatment with methylation inhibitors such as 5-Aza-CdR, indicating that hypermethylation of the ER gene promoter correlates closely with the transcriptional silencing of this gene. Consistent with the above ER finding, the present study also showed that decrease in the expression levels of AQP5 proceeds with age and that treatment with a demethylating agent (5-Aza-CdR) restores AQP5 expression, thereby ameliorating the decrease in salivary flow. Therefore, our results suggest that AQP5 may be a candidate gene affected by the age-related increase in methylation.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting an epigenetic therapy with 5-Aza-CdR for decreased salivary flow associated with aging. 5-Aza-CdR is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog that strongly inhibits DNA methyltransferase activity and, as such, is one of the strongest inhibitors of DNA methylation. Several lines of evidence have indicated that the demethylation of a specific sequence of genes is associated with cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512446343">Lübbert <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>). At low concentrations, 5-Aza-CdR has shown cellular differentiating activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, and <italic>in vivo</italic> it stimulates gamma globin chain synthesis, leading to an increase in fetal hemoglobin in patients with a hemoglobinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034512446343">Pinto <italic>et al</italic>., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512446343">Koshy <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512446343">DeSimone <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). We also demonstrated that a demethylating agent, 5-azacytidine, induces cellular differentiation of salivary intercalated duct cells into acinar and myoepithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034512446343">Sato <italic>et al</italic>., 1987</xref>). Moreover, we have recently shown that an immortalized normal human salivary gland duct cell line, lacking the expression of aquaporin 5, acquires aquaporin 5 gene expression in response to treatment with 5-Aza-CdR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512446343">Motegi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). However, although we have not examined the differentiation phenotype of aquaporin 5-expressing cells, there is a possibility that these cells could differentiate into acinar cells with an augmented ability to secrete water.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that demethylation by 5-Aza-CdR functions in the AQP5 promoter to induce AQP5 gene expression in aged mouse salivary glands, and that enhanced expression of the AQP5 produces a significantly increased amount of saliva compared with that in untreated control mice. As long as an effective therapy is not available for the majority of patients with age-related xerostomia, we must investigate a drug that can influence the increase in salivary flow with low toxicity. However, this drug can be cytotoxic at high doses and is not yet established in clinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022034512446343">Yang <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Since low-dose 5-Aza-CdR, used for the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, is well-tolerated in this group of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034512446343">Wijermans <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>), 5-Aza-CdR seems to be especially active in patients with xerostomia. Thus, 5-Aza-CdR treatment in patients with age-related xerostomia should provide an efficient and useful means by which to impart facilitated water permeability to salivary gland cells in elderly individuals. This possibility seems to be worthy of further investigation.</p>
