<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Falls are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older people. At least 50% of octogenarians fall every year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511435688">1</xref></sup> Consequences may be serious: for the individual, loss of confidence and subsequent activity, dependency, depression, anxiety;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511435688">2</xref></sup> for society, major resources use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511435688">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most falls are multifactorial. Risk factors cover a wide range of bio-psycho-social domains. In a review of 16 studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511435688">4</xref></sup> those with greatest association are linked with sarcopenia: lower limb weakness, balance deficit and gait abnormalities. These also contribute to disability and mortality rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511435688">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511435688">6</xref></sup> Addressing mobility function and balance impairment are therefore central to falls prevention, along with individual targeting of additional risk factors such as culprit medications, visual impairment and environmental hazards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511435688">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is strong evidence for the effectiveness of home-based<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511435688">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511435688">9</xref></sup> and facility-based<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511435688">10</xref></sup> strength and balance exercise intervention programmes but the total dose must be of adequate intensity and duration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511435688">11</xref></sup> and adherence is variable. Such programmes can be effective for people over 80 years, but more frail older people may not manage them. Furthermore, at least in the UK, exercise programmes of sufficient intensity and duration may not be available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511435688">12</xref></sup> Thus there remains a need for additional approaches to reduce the functional mobility and balance impairment in frail older people.</p>
<p>Short-term programmes of whole-body vibration therapy are reported to improve lower limb muscle strength, power, functional mobility,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511435688">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511435688"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511435688">15</xref></sup> and bone strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511435688">16</xref></sup> Whole-body vibration therapy is feasible in frail nursing home residents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511435688">13</xref></sup> The design of some studies compared whole-body vibration plus exercises with a sedentary control group, precluding definite conclusions about the distinct contribution of whole-body vibration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511435688">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511435688">16</xref></sup> A small, adequately controlled trial of whole-body vibration over 10 weeks in women (average age 79 years) demonstrated a convincing 38% improvement of lower limb strength but no increase in power.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511435688">17</xref></sup> Power is more important for functional mobility.</p>
<p>Improvements in balance have been reported in all appropriately controlled studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511435688">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511435688">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511435688">19</xref></sup> although this may be the case only if balance is sufficiently impaired initially.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511435688">20</xref></sup> There are no published randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of whole-body vibration on falls rate. The potential to improve power, functional mobility and balance, along with possible benefits on bone strength, suggest that whole-body vibration might be an effective intervention for falls and fragility fracture prevention. Since exercise training has proven efficacy for falls prevention, the clinical role of whole-body vibration would be to provide additional benefit where exercise dose was suboptimal, or as an alternative for individuals unable or unwilling to do strength and balance training.</p>
<p>We report a proof of concept study, to investigate whether whole-body vibration is feasible in frail clinical populations and offers any additional benefit to a supervised strength and balance exercise programme. Specifically, does whole-body vibration improve balance and functional mobility more than strength and balance training alone? In addition, as a novel intervention challenging the balance of the participant, does it impact on falls-related confidence and general well-being?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269215511435688" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A single-blind randomized parallel group study was performed in a UK National Health Service specialist healthcare facility. Participants were drawn from older adults of either sex referred for falls risk assessment and intervention as part of an integrated falls service serving an urban area of approximately 0.7 million people (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.slips-online.co.uk">www.slips-online.co.uk</ext-link>). Referral criteria were: (1) either two or more falls in the last 12 months or one fall plus timed up and go test of &gt;15 seconds – a simple, sensitive and specific cut-point for high-risk fallers;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511435688">21</xref></sup> (2) recurrent unexplained falls. Following assessment, individualized treatment plans were agreed with each patient. Usually, this included an exercise intervention prescribed by a physiotherapist. Eligible participants were those judged unsuitable, for safety and adherence reasons, for high-intensity community or home based OTAGO programmes (an individually tailored strength and balance training programme), but who agreed to attend a facility-based supervised exercise programme. Exclusion criteria for the study were any joint replacement, vertigo or dementia (&lt;20/30 on the Mini Mental State Examination).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511435688">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Eligible patients were given information about the study and invited to participate. Those agreeable and with no evident exclusion criteria were approached for written informed consent, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. This study was registered on the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Register (ISRCTN 19205068) and approved by the local research ethics committee.</p>
<p>Each participant was randomized by a senior administrator unrelated to the study, in blocks of 6 using a unique study number. Allocation to either the group performing the exercise class alone (exercise group) or exercise plus whole-body vibration (vibration group) was communicated to the supervising physiotherapists but not the research team. Whereas participants and physical therapists were inevitably aware of group allocation, the research team performing assessments and analysis were kept blinded.</p>
<p>All participants received a physiotherapist supervised, three times weekly, 1 hour exercise programme which combined progressive strength, balance and functional mobility training for eight weeks (see Appendix 1 in the online supplementary data for a description of the class). The vibration group were offered the whole-body vibration therapy session at the end of the exercise period. It comprised 5 × 1 minute bouts of whole-body vibration, separated by 30 seconds rest, on an asynchronous whole-body vibration platform (Galileo 2000, Novotec Medical GmBH, Germany). Subjects stood upright on the platform, without locking their knees, over clearly marked foot positions, wearing normal footwear and using the handrail for support if required. Lower frequencies and amplitudes (15 Hz and amplitude of 2 mm peak to peak) were used initially for familiarization. Thereafter to obtain a greater muscular response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511435688">23</xref></sup> these were increased to the maximal tolerated amplitude and frequency but no greater than 30 Hz and 8 mm peak to peak. Peak accelerations ranged from 0.9 to 14.5 g (1 g = 9.81 m/s).</p>
<p>The primary outcome was the Timed Up and Go test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215511435688">24</xref></sup> as this is the functional performance test most suitable to assess falls-related gait and balance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511435688">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215511435688">25</xref></sup> Additional measures enabled evaluation of physical function related to sarcopenia (a timed 6-m walk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215511435688">26</xref></sup>), static balance (Berg Balance Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511435688">27</xref></sup>) as well as fear of falling (FES-I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511435688">28</xref></sup>) and health-related quality of life (SF-12 version 2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215511435688">29</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>Physical assessments were performed at baseline, mid-intervention (four weeks), immediately post intervention (eight weeks) and follow-up (six months). Fear of falling and health-related quality of life and were completed at baseline, eight weeks and six months.</p>
<p>The supervising physiotherapist inquired about and noted any adverse effects during or after the whole-body vibration sessions, and recorded if participants declined the whole-body vibration. They made a clinical judgement about progression of frequency and amplitude of whole-body vibration based on the participant’s response and preference, with the aspiration to increase the ‘dose’ as described above.</p>
<p>We needed 39 participants per group, assuming a 20% drop-out, to detect a reduction in timed up and go by 20% (indicative of reduced falls risk, based on unpublished observations from our clinical service) with a two-sided 5% significance level and a power of 80%.</p>
<p>The primary endpoint was at eight weeks but groups were compared with baseline and with each other at all time points. The normality of the data was assessed with Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests, after which either parametric or non-parametric procedures were used. The percentage change in timed up and go and 6-m walk time and the absolute change in Berg Balance Scale, fear of falling and health-related quality of life were determined. Differences between groups in timed up and go, 6-m walk, health-related quality of life and fear of falling were assessed with Mann–Whitney tests; independent sample <italic>T</italic>-tests were used to assess Berg Balance Scale. Repeated-measures ANOVA with Bonferroni correction post-hoc analysis were used to assess within-group differences in Berg Balance Scale while Freidman’s ANOVA and Wilcoxon signed rank test were used for equivalent analyses for Timed Up and Go, 6-m walk, health-related quality of life and fear of falling.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data are presented as mean (SD) unless stated otherwise. Changes denoted NS imply <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Seventy-seven of 80 identified patients were recruited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215511435688">Figure 1</xref>) between February 2008 and April 2010. There were no significant differences (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) in group characteristics for age, sex or body mass index, at baseline or between participants who attended for subsequent assessments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215511435688">Table 1</xref>). Fifty-six (73%) completed the eight- week programme and outcome assessments. One participant withdrew from the vibration group because they did not like whole-body vibration. The remaining drop-outs were for unknown reasons. The reasons for non-attendance for six months follow-up assessments (55% total) were also unknown. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215511435688">Figure 1</xref> shows the sessions attended and time spent receiving whole-body vibration was 44.5 (24.3) minutes – 37% of the maximum time that was offered though the percentage ‘dose’ varied as progression was individually tailored. No adverse events were reported. Some subjects enjoyed whole-body vibration, others did not. This largely accounts for the variation in exposure between 10 and 100 minutes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In a frail older population whole-body vibration incorporated into an exercise class in an eight-week programme resulted in greater improvements in functional mobility than the exercise alone. Balance, self-reported health status and fear of falling improved to a similar extent in each group. In general, these mobility-related improvements occurred progressively over the eight-week programme. Improvements from baseline had been lost after six months.</p>
<p>In agreement with some previous results, we found a greater improvement in timed up and go after whole-body vibration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511435688">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511435688">18</xref></sup> although not all studies report this.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215511435688">30</xref></sup> The initial ability of the subjects may be a factor. Improvements of about 0, 20 and 30% have been reported after similar whole-body vibration interventions in groups performing the Timed Up and Go in ~5, 15 and 36 seconds, respectively,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511435688">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511435688">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215511435688">30</xref></sup> suggesting that whole-body vibration provides greater benefit for more frail individuals. Our subjects had plentiful scope to improve, with the average timed up and go time at baseline being double that thought to indicate an increased risk of falling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511435688">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Timed Up and Go consists of a number of components including standing, walking, turning and sitting. It is unknown in which component improvement occurred, but some was probably due to the increased walking speed demonstrated by faster 6-m walk times, a variable which reflects lower limb power and strength. whole-body vibration has been previously reported to improve ankle plantar-flexion strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511435688">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215511435688">30</xref></sup> Previous research has reported a variable impact of whole-body vibration on walking speed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511435688">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215511435688">31</xref></sup> again greater change occurring in individuals with lower initial values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215511435688">31</xref></sup> The lack of difference between groups in the Timed Up and Go at four weeks, despite improved 6-m walk time in the vibration group, suggests that other factors are also involved.</p>
<p>Balance is important for safe functional mobility and independence. In contrast to previous reports,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511435688">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511435688">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511435688">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215511435688">31</xref></sup> we found a non-significant trend towards greater improvements with whole-body vibration. Responses to the relatively high intensity of exercise performed in the current study may have been sufficient to mask any additional impact of whole-body vibration. Reducing walking velocity is one compensatory strategy that individuals with impaired balance may use, our findings suggest a reduced employment of this strategy after treatment. Improvements in functional mobility probably reflect a combination of factors including improved strength, power and balance.</p>
<p>All components of health-related quality of life have previously been found to improve after whole-body vibration combined with low intensity exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511435688">18</xref></sup> In the current study, no between-group differences were found, but both showed improvements in the physical component. Whole-body vibration alone may be sufficient to improve self-reported health status but when performed in combination with moderate intensity exercise, as in our study, there may be no additional benefit. Similar considerations apply to the improvements in fear of falling.</p>
<p>Limitations of the study include non-blinding of the participants and the exercise supervising physiotherapists, in common with many physical therapy intervention trials. Without a non-exercising control group, we cannot infer with certainty that the changes in either group were not spontaneous recovery after a recent fall. Conversely, without a non-exercising control group, for comparison at six months, we cannot infer that return to baseline did not in fact denote a positive impact equivalent to six months of age-related deterioration.</p>
<p>Numbers recruited were adequate according to our power estimates, but drop-out from the subsequent assessments was considerable, and a possible source of bias as treatment non-responders may have been more likely not to attend. We choose not to employ a numerical imputation strategy (e.g. last observation carried forward) to replace the missing values as (1) the natural history of the values over time without intervention are unknown in this clinical population, and (2) this was a proof of concept study, not a clinical effectiveness one. Type 2 error is a possible explanation for the lack of significant findings for some variables.</p>
<p>The results suggest, however, that incorporation of whole-body vibration into exercise classes for older people, particularly the more frail, could be advantageous. Adherence is important and this varied greatly. This was partly because adherence to the exercise classes in general was relatively low but the addition of whole-body vibration may have been responsible for the non-significantly higher non-attendance. Adherence may be better alone or with the travel component avoided (e.g. care home residents).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511435688">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511435688">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The positive findings in this study, despite the low adherence, suggests that a shorter duration than initially thought may be sufficient for some individuals. Whole-body vibration alone may have sufficient impact to improve falls-related mobility impairments, but we considered it unethical not to offer the clinically indicated exercise programme. For those unwilling or unable, however, it is a feasible alternative which needs testing.</p>
<p>The non-maintenance at six months of the earlier gains might be because after trial participation, patients did not continue to exercise. This finding is typical of the literature on exercise interventions and the OTAGO programme and others incorporate increased walking as an ongoing component. Whole-body vibration alone may be sufficient to maintain the improvements after a supervised exercise programme. This also needs clinical testing.</p>
<p>In summary, whole-body vibration seems a promising and feasible adjunct or alternative to therapeutic exercise to reduce mobility and balance impairments. Clinical trials with falls or other clinical outcomes are probably justified.</p>
