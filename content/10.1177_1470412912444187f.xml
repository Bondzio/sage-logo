<p>Many of the things I should perhaps be embarrassed to admit I still love came out in 1972. A short blushing list might include the first flush of the Polaroid SX-70 instant-developing camera (that I still use). I might lay in as soundtrack the beginnings of disco and such appeals to dance across borders as ‘Love Train’ by The O’Jays. There would be <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470412912444187">Roland Barthes’ (1972)</xref> fighting and founding words that doing interdisciplinarity means constituting a ‘new object’. And, of course, there is John Berger et al.’s slim volume <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> (2008[1972]) which provocatively concludes by interpellating us to participate in its own gesture toward the open, writerly text: ‘to be continued by the reader ….’ (p. 166).</p>
<p>I first encountered that ellipsis of scintillating dots on the other side of the Atlantic from Berger’s place of publication in London or his residence in rural France. I encountered its interdisciplinary charge on a crumbling patch of the foundational ground laid for art history. I was then an undergraduate art history major at Princeton who sought refuge in cultural studies and critical theory. It was the mid-80s and much closer in time to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470412912444187">Susan Sontag’s (1982)</xref> often-quoted characterization of Barthes’ ‘new object’, the text, or, more precisely, the performance of writing in and through the text of the world as a practice of aphorism. I graphically occupied the tempting margins of my own copy of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> to contest, for example, the priority given to sight and to fume over essays two and three on ‘ways of seeing women’. Though I was not ‘out’ at the time, the elisions of the pleasures and possibilities of performing woman, of turning oneself into an object for other ‘women’ – whether identified with that category or not – were, let’s just say, palpable.</p>
<p>But there was still something to love about that first encounter with Berger’s own use of aphorism. This love is not so much for the said but the way of seeing and, more particularly, the way of saying: the format of the photo-essay, the apposition of relatively large-print words abutting the images and, ultimately, frankly, the style. What Sontag wrote of Barthes might apply to Berger’s aesthetics of aphoristic juxtaposition: ‘it is in the nature of aphoristic thinking to be always in a state of concluding; a bid to have the final word is inherent in all powerful phrase-making.’ And there are so many piercingly pithy lines that have come to stand as quasi-last words on the subject, from the opening sally ‘seeing comes before words’ to the nailing simplification ‘<italic>men act</italic> and <italic>women appear</italic>’ (original emphases).</p>
<p>Much as aphorism may make a stylish bid for, if not the last then the most quotable word or phrasing, there is also something both igniting and inviting about the touch of the aphorisms that make up <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>. There are the bold bumps of what the aphorisms so simply set side-by-side. The appositive form of these aphorisms is elaborated as well in the montaged juxtapositions of the photo-essays that make up the book to exploit that other resonantly phrased concept, the ‘always-present gap between words and seeing’. The book’s temporal and medium-defying montage strategies of juxtaposition, its strident call for what it insists should be the ‘shock’ of collisions in which the promises of ‘here’ meet the grim documentation of traumas ‘there’ do not mind but mine that gap to alter consciousness.</p>
<p>However, what I still find to be the most energetic contacts of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> are the adjacencies that are almost there: the touch of the ideas, events, actions, and things <italic>beside</italic> its condensations – like the possible contents of suitcases waiting to be unpacked, repacked, and taken someplace else. The felt punch of the aphoristic juxtaposition of ‘<italic>men act</italic> and <italic>women appear</italic>’, for instance, arguably derives much of its rhetorical potency from its unmentioned temporal contiguity to the feminist political theorizing, organizing, and art-making exercised beyond its pages. Ultimately, the power of the aphoristic, appositive form of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> generates much of its energy and fresh cheek from its seeming to think alongside or even on the side of what is conspicuously absent, namely contemporary art of the late 60s to early 70s.</p>
<p>But take sides the aphorisms of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> certainly do. Or, rather, one might say <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> makes and mines them in a rather rapid-fire sequence of battering binaries: seeing vs word, true vs false, woman vs man, homosexual vs heterosexual, and colonized vs conqueror, to name a few. One could say that <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> dances a Marxian dialectics with style across the slick dance floor of capitalist visuality. And its final challenge to what it characterizes as the dominating cultural field of capitalism with its magical system of ‘publicity’ takes up another loaded opposition, this time an apposition of true and false that takes the form of a final layout in which the cannon in the reproduction of Magritte’s painting <italic>On the Threshold of Liberty</italic> at the bottom right points up and leftward at two breathtakingly brief paragraphs that reduce the survival of capitalism to a magic trick of potentially precarious dependence, to the sleight not so much of hand, but of seeing that makes glamorous and seductive ‘a false standard of what is and what is not desirable’. What might be truly desirable remains on the other side of the threshold of this binary between the hollow promise and false premise of publicity and the ‘liberty’ that is implied by aphoristic opposition and yet remains, one might argue, deliberately open.</p>
<p>The aesthetic of aphoristic apposition as political opposition that gives <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> its muscle and its charm may be stirring. However, there remains the vital question of what is or might yet be the form of the good life (and the good death) and what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470412912444187">Walter Benjamin (1969 [1940])</xref>. called the ‘image of happiness’ on the other side of the system of publicity <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> decries. There is also the problem of the ways in which the divisive binaries it marshals may ultimately be not just exhausted but also profoundly inadequate to the necessary task of transforming and materializing imagination.</p>
<p>But taking this question of form and terms seriously is not necessarily a call for neologism. I found myself both annoyingly implicated and perversely intrigued by a recent conversation among friends that turned to the question of who or what fits the relatively new gender descriptive term ‘cis-gender’. This neologism takes up the Latin preposition <italic>cis</italic> for ‘on this side of’ to designate the opposite of trans-gender. Its problem is not its ostensible newness but, rather, its stake in not just the old but also, worse, the biological mold. Making a term to signal identification with and conformity to the sex to which one is assigned at birth conflates gender presentation with sex in binary biological terms. The term cis-gender performs yet one more twist on that other dueling dualism, nature vs culture, in which cis takes the place of nature (on the side of biology) and trans that of culture (on the side of an array of technologies of the self).</p>
<p>Cis-gender as a term and the entire terrain of critical gender studies and queer theory, and practice for that matter, are well beyond the borders of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>. And yet, the prepositional use of cis makes a provocative entry in a more recent essay by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470412912444187">John Berger (2009)</xref> on the material, political and transformative ‘land-sweeping’ power of the images wrought by words to alter the ground of trauma with which it forges an intimate obligation by the use of the prepositional relation of the cis:
<disp-quote>
<p>A few days after our return from what was thought of, until recently, as the future state of Palestine, and which is now the world’s largest prison (Gaza) and the world’s largest waiting room (Cis-Jordan), I had a dream.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The ensuing dream is one of imagistic metamorphosis in which a handful of dust thrown at the body becomes enwrapping cloth that changes into words written by the landsweeping agency of the dirt of the place, a tactic that could be read as an effort to turn ‘nature’ (the land swept of the exiled Palestinians) vengefully back on what has been expropriated by the state of Israel for ‘culture’. But what interests me here is the way in which the cis can be understood not in complete distinction from or opposition to the trans. Rather, it can enfold and unfurl its own transformations from within its side.</p>
<p>I began with the embarrassment of a declared love list, an associative train that literally included ‘The Love Train’, whose lyrics such as ‘start a love train, love train/All of you brothers over in Africa/Tell all the folks in Egypt, and Israel, too’ could not be more different in tone and structure from <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>. Like that book, though, the lyrics also attempt to mobilize contacts of touch to link and ultimately to transit through divisions in geopolitical space. Moving across time from the 70s to now, moving not only across the Atlantic but also from the US and Europe to ‘Cis-Jordan’ or the occupied territory of the Gaza strip, and moving across media from a book of photo-essays to visual art and poetry to a popular song might seem an exercise in the dangers of the trans, a transit across that levels everything along its rolling tracks. But there are also dangers to the cis, if that sticking close fails to reckon with the unruly volatilities and mobile potentialities on its side.</p>
<p>What I find provocative in re-encountering the aphoristic appositions of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> at this moment is the possibility of another way of working with juxtaposition, one that brings out the charged, even perverse interlinings and potentialities already there in ‘old’ words and images and, most of all, in those border-policing binaries we never seem to get past. Cunning puns, promiscuous homophones, and the lures of likeness can expose the possibilities inside or on this side. Such metamorphic play is, I would argue, a vital matter of the politics of form, whether they implicate the geo-political, legal, and religious boundaries of the state (and its institutions, including marriage), the properties of medium, or the genres of gender.</p>
<p>Consciously thinking with contemporary art practice, I couldn’t help but bring <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> along when I went to see Mary Reid Kelley’s digital film installation <italic>The Syphilis of Sysiphus</italic>. Perhaps taking its homophonic title from an article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470412912444187">Schamberg, 1963</xref>) on venereal disease titled ‘Syphilis and Sisyphus’, Kelley’s mad-smart and menacing feminist re-telling of French enlightenment thought, revolutionary history, and the ongoing gendered battle between artifice and nature does not just citationally mix the ostensibly opposed. It also pushes the pun of resemblance to pry open the radical possibilities latent in language – both verbal and visual. Kelley plays Sisyphus made up as a black and white cartoon of death, a skeletal 19th-century harlot hysteric who performs a sly poetic text riddled with puns set within the illusion that her little gouache drawings could grow Wonderland-like into a habitable stage. Surrounded by a cast of four women ‘Saltimbanques’ or itinerant circus performers who rove from playing Diderot and Marie Antoinette to Marx and Engels and finally a crowd of bachelors, Sisyphus repeats with a difference and begets the trouble that is already there. Take the absurdist mise-en-scène of the Punch &amp; Judy show gag in which the Saltimbanques beat each other with the icons of phallic Gallic loaves of bread while reducing the literally life-and-death controversies over generation and property to the visual and verbal pun, ‘I BAGUETTE YOU!’ Condensing the biopolitical in the look of and the word for a bread stick may be reductive and absurd. Yet it is, at the same time, a matter of insinuating resemblances that suggest how the puns lurking within can also punch and usurp.</p>
<p>The sis or bad sisterhood of <italic>The Syphilis of Sisyphus’</italic>s contagious and excessive punnings offers a queerly generative practice of the cis that brings out the altering possibilities in the seemings and seamings of the side-by-side. The video performance and the pamphlet end, as both good and bad comedies do, by ‘broaching’ the hymen. Resituating the wedding scene to Charcot’s clinic in the Salpêtrière, Sisyphus, now the ‘Polyamorous [and pregnant] Bride’, weds the crowd played by the Saltimbanques in dandy drag with the performative pun: ‘GOODBYE NATURE, AND HI, MEN’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470412912444187">Kelley, 2012</xref>). Through such cunning plays with the contagions of contact and the sides that emerge from within, the punning prismatics that don’t just fracture but also variegate and shimmer, the cis as performed through the tactics of radical resemblance in the <italic>Syphilis of Sisyphus</italic> re-names a relation to the given which in being ‘like’ is not to uphold the ostensibly natural but rather to show up the illusions of transformative artifice and its labors in the breeches and in the breach where they already are.</p>
<p>In this moment, the tactical power of aesthetic form and aphoristic juxtaposition seems ever more vital and necessary. ‘Bread and roses’ was the banner of the January 1912 textile workers’ strike. Not glamour but liberty was the implied cry of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>. Encountering <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> again on the 100-year anniversary of the strike, I ask, why not some version of the both/and – an image of happiness but also the materialization of that promised queer world leaking through on this side of ‘heaven’?</p>
