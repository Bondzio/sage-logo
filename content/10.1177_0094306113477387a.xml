<p>The religious demography of immigrants to Western countries has changed from primarily Christian to considerably non-Christian in recent decades. This process can cause a host of challenges for immigrants and their receiving countries. In <italic>Different Gods</italic>, Raymond Breton summarizes and analyzes the recent research on religious minorities and their experiences integrating into the larger society, focusing on Canada and the United States with some European comparisons. Not only do the religious customs, values, and identities of newcomers change, but the institutions and collective identities of receiving societies also change in response to religious pluralism. Integration of immigrants is interactive and mutual, and the evolution of both immigrants and mainstream society is inevitable.</p>
<p><italic>Different Gods</italic> is a good place to start for those looking into the literature on religious minority immigrants. The book is divided into four parts of two chapters each. Part One concerns the process of immigrant transplantation. Part Two delves into the challenges of members of minority groups after immigration regarding their religious identities and practices. In Part Three, Breton considers how religious institutions transform to meet the needs of their members in their particular social circumstances as individuals undergo acculturation. Finally, Part Four deals with how the mainstream society comes to incorporate religious minorities. While investigating current research on non-Christian minorities, Breton also points out the holes in the literature and where future research is needed on these topics. It is clear that research on religion must acknowledge the flow of immigration, and immigration research cannot ignore religion. Scholars on religion and immigration alike will find <italic>Different Gods</italic> to be informative.</p>
