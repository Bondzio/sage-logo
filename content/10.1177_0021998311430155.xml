<abstract>
<p>In the past decade, natural fiber composites with thermoplastic matrices have been embraced by many composite manufactures for its properties such as lightweight and low cost. Reinforced cowrap spinning yarns and thermoplastics offer a potential for low-cost manufacturing of complex-shaped and good, drapable composite parts, due to reduced impregnation times and resin flow distance during processing. In this article, the cowrap spinning yarns were produced by cowrap spinning method with flax and polypropylene (PP) and then woven to fabric preforms. The natural flax fibers were twistless in yarns and preforms, and PP served as a carrier for flax and prevented damage to flax fibers during processing, and became the polymer matrix in the final composites. To get an even distribution of fibers and thermoplastic resins in preforms and different flax fiber content, the main spinning parameters (hollow spindle twist and hollow spindle rotational speed) were analyzed and optimized. Besides fabric structure, the parameters affecting the mechanical properties of flax/PP preforms and composites were investigated. The fabric density, fabric structure (including plain, twill, and basket weave), and yarn tensile orientation (at 0°, 90°, and 45°) had a great influence on the tensile strength and elongation of preforms. Different pretreatments on flax/PP were investigated, and the microstructure and mechanical properties of thermoplastic composites showed improved wettability of impregnation and good adhesion and bonding interface between flax fiber and PP matrix in composites.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311430155" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The growing global environmental awareness and societal concerns, high rate of depletion of petroleum resources, and environmental-friendly development have together initiated the search for new products and processes that are compatible with the environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311430155">1</xref></sup> Natural fiber composites are claimed to offer environmental-friendly properties such as reduced dependence on nonrenewable energy/material sources, lower pollutant emissions, lower greenhouse gas emissions, enhanced energy recovery, and end of life biodegradability of components. A wide range of high-performance, low-cost materials for a variety of structural applications can be made using natural fibers with advantages such as high specific strength and modulus compared to metals, renewability, environment friendliness, low density, continued availability, and lack of any health hazards.</p>
<p>Natural fiber thermoplastic composites, as thermoplastic resins, have attracted greater attention in recent years due to advantages in the performance, processing, and environmental recycle and other aspects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311430155">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311430155"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311430155">4</xref></sup>. For any type of fiber-reinforced composites, the most important requirement is that the fiber and resin be distributed evenly. But, the thermoplastic resin, because of high molecular weight, has a high viscosity during melting and will lead to difficultly in impregnation, which limits the further application and development of thermoplastic composite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311430155">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311430155"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311430155">7</xref></sup> In general, thermoplastic resin is usually polymerized with the reinforced fiber before impregnation. Though with an impregnation process similar to thermosetting resin an even distribution of fiber and thermoplastic resin in preforms can be achieved, the preforms’ drapability will become poor and will not attach to the curved surfaces, hence there is a need for more expensive preparation to produce more complex-shaped preforms. If preimpregnation technique is used, when the resin is injected into fibers or fabrics, the resin will not impregnate completely because of the high viscosity and will not produce high-quality components. For short fiber and resin-mixed melting method and nonwoven fabric layer melting method, one of the problems encountered is the high viscosity of the thermoplastics caused by large molecules. Because of this and the fiber interlacement, it is very difficult to inject the resin into a tight fiber tow structure and fill the pores present. This increases the void content in the composite. In order to decrease this, it is necessary to use higher applied pressure, longer time, and heavier molds. To solve this problem, the matrix polymer needs to be mixed with reinforcing fibers evenly before the preforming operation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311430155">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Currently, the more popular mixed yarn preparation technology is mixed reinforced fibers and thermoplastic matrix fibers in a single-fiber level at first,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311430155">6</xref></sup> and then to hot-press molding. The use of cowrap spinning commingled yarns is one of the more promising routes for producing structural thermoplastic composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311430155">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311430155"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311430155"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311430155">12</xref></sup> As the polymer flow distance for impregnation is reduced when the matrix is already commingled with reinforcing fibers, the time for impregnation or the need for high applied pressure are reduced, leading to an improvement in impregnation and even distribution, and reduction in manufacturing cost. Moreover, compared to other intermediate product forms such as preimpregnated tows or powder-impregnated fiber bundles, the flexible cowrap spinning yarns can easily be converted into highly drapable textile fabric preforms, reducing the possibility of wrinkles during the formation of complex shapes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311430155">10</xref></sup> The cowrap spinning commingled yarn has the following advantages: (1) Reinforced yarn are completely wrapped by the wrapped yarn, which improves the protective effect on reinforcing fibers, thus avoiding the damage during spinning, processing, and postprocessing (such as weaving, knitting, and braiding); (2) the continuous reinforcing fibers maintain the twistless form and exhibit favorable mechanical properties that can be fully used; (3) enhanced even distribution of reinforcing fibers and thermoplastic matrix fibers enables easy hot-press processing. Therefore, cowrap spinning commingled methods will open up a broader prospect for development of thermoplastic resin composites, but there are very few researches and applications. So, it is very necessary to explore the novel technology which can provide high-quality components and economically feasible ways of producing natural fiber thermoplastic preforms and composites.</p>
<p>There is also a major drawback associated with the application of natural fibers for reinforcement of polymeric matrices. Due to the presence of hydroxyl and other polar groups in their constituents, natural fibers exhibit high moisture absorption property. This hydrophilic nature leads to incompatibility and poor wettability in a hydrophobic polymer matrix, and results in weak bonding in the fiber/matrix interface. To solve these problems, the surface of the fibers can be modified by physical or chemical means.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311430155">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311430155">14</xref></sup> The basic objective remains nearly the same: to improve surface interlock or bonding and to provide an intimate contact between natural fibers and polymeric matrices.</p>
<p>Although high levels of composite properties are attained with this technique, there has been no work reported on the parameters for cowrap spinning yarns and the structure of fabric preforms. In this article, the cowrap spinning yarns were produced by cowrap spinning with flax and PP, in which all flax fibers were twistless, and the fabric preforms were produced by weaving. The PP filaments served as carrier for the natural fibers during processing and became the polymer matrix in the final composites, which prevented impregnation difficulty and damage to the reinforcing natural fibers during processing. To get an even distribution of fiber and thermoplastic resin in preforms and different fiber content, the main spinning parameters (hollow spindle twist and hollow spindle rotational speed) were analyzed and optimized. The fabric structural parameters affecting the mechanical properties of flax/PP preforms and composites and the different pretreatment processes affecting the impregnation interface and the properties of flax/PP composites were investigated and reported.</p>

Flax yarn (2), as a core yarn unwinding from flax yarn creel (1), went through a self-made spring tension (3), then the core yarn passed through another transfer roller (4) and a guide hook (5), and through the guide tube (6) into the hollow spindle (7); at the same time, the wrapped PP yarn (9) on the wrapped tube (8) wrapped outside the core yarn and went together into the hollow spindle. After the core yarn and wrapped yarn went into the hollow spindle, the two yarns had a false twist as the hollow spindle rotates. But, after they went through the twisting hook (10), the false twist untwisted and the core yarn had no twist, while the wrapped PP yarn wraps outside the core flax yarn with a twist. Then, the cowrap spinning yarn output from the twisting hook went through the roller (11) and yarn guide beam (12), and then winds on the fancy bobbin (14) around the grooved drum (13).

First, the weave fabrics were cut into squares of 300 mm × 50 mm, and stacked in two-layers, with the warp and weft yarns in the same direction, into the hot-pressing machine.

<sec id="sec8-0021998311430155"><title>Effects of cowrap spinning parameters on fiber fraction</title>
<p>As the reinforcing flax fiber fraction had a great influence on the cowrap spinning yarn’s structure and properties of the final composites, the process parameters were the key factors for the production. To achieve reinforcing flax fiber fraction and perfect properties for the linear cowrap yarn preforms, and then prepare to produce fabric preforms and composites, we had to select and optimize the cowrap spinning parameters first. The hollow spindle twist and hollow spindle rotational speed were the two main factors that affected the wrapped angle and surface compaction, and the fiber fraction and properties of cowrap spinning yarns.</p>
<p>Response surface methodology (RSM) explores the relationships between several explanatory variables and one or more response variables. The method was introduced by Box and Wilson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311430155">17</xref></sup> in 1951. The main idea of RSM is to use a set of designed experiments to obtain an optimal response. The RSM has been used successfully for material and process optimization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311430155">18</xref></sup> in numerous studies including thermoplastic elastomers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311430155">19</xref></sup> and yarn properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311430155">20</xref></sup> This approach has the advantage of taking into account the combined effects of several parameters, and it uses statistical methods to fit an empirical model to the experimental data. The use of a model to describe the effects of cowrap spinning parameters allows us to represent the influencing parameter in a simple and systematic way and to predict the results of the experiments with different parameter combinations. Also, RSM enables us to obtain an overview of the processing parameters and their influence on each other.</p>
<p>The hollow spindle twist and hollow spindle rotational speed were the two variables identified in our study. The general second-order equation model for response η is given by:

<p>A factorial experiment was designed using two factors (hollow spindle twist and hollow spindle rotational speed). For the application of RSM to develop the process, sequential experiments were carried out. This type of design defined the minimum number of experimental combinations in the experimental domain to be explored in order to obtain the maximum information for adjusting the proposed model. For a quadratic model, experiments must be performed for at least three levels of each factor. These levels were best chosen to be equally spaced. With the approach of quadratic general rotary unitized design (QGRUD), we set five levels for each factor. The two factors (hollow spindle twist and hollow spindle rotational speed) and five levels result in 13 possible combinations of factor settings.

<p>By the analysis of QGRUD and results of experiments, we investigated the relation between fiber friction and two cowrap spinning parameters (hollow spindle twist and hollow spindle rational speed). Flax fiber fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311430155">Figure 4</xref>) decreased with the increase of the hollow spindle twist, that is, the wrapped PP filament was gradually increasing. So, we could conclude that with the increase of hollow spindle twist, the flax fiber fraction and wrap compactness became lower, thus, we preferred to better choose the hollow spindle twist to a lesser extent. The change of fiber fraction with the hollow spindle twist changed at different levels of the hollow spindle rotational speed, and the degrees of decrease trend were different. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311430155">Figure 4</xref> shows that the degree of decrease trend was higher and presented much slanting trend curve at a low level of hollow spindle rotational speed (3600 rpm). And, at the moderate level of hollow spindle rotational speed, for example between level −0.5 and level 0, the difference of decrease trends became smaller.
<fig id="fig4-0021998311430155" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Fiber fraction vs. hollow spindle twist at different level of hollow spindle rotational speed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311430155-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>There were three different trends at different levels of hollow spindle twist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311430155">Figure 5</xref>). When the value of hollow spindle twist was lower, the fiber weight fraction decreased with the increase of hollow spindle rotational speed, while it appeared as the contrary trend when the value of hollow spindle twist was higher. The curve of fiber weight fraction fluctuated stably according to the hollow spindle rotational speed when the hollow spindle twist was set between level −1 and level 0, and when the hollow spindle twist was near 1000 t/m, the fiber weight fraction maintained at 50% and almost had no changes with increase in hollow spindle rotational speed.

<p>As shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311430155">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311430155">5</xref>, the hollow spindle twist and hollow spindle rotational speed had different impacts on flax fiber weight fraction, which also had interactive effect on it. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311430155">Figure 6</xref> showed the different response contour plots of the interactive effect. The response indicated that changes in fiber fraction were responsive to hollow spindle twist. While at different levels of hollow spindle twist, the change in trends of fiber fraction according to the hollow spindle rotational speed were more different. The fiber fraction changed slightly with the change in hollow spindle rotational speed up to a moderate level (from −0.5 to 0.5), while showed a decreasing trend at low levels of hollow spindle twist with increase in hollow spindle rotational speed, but showed an increasing trend at high levels. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311430155">Figure 6</xref> shows the contour plots of 40, 50, and 60%, and the change of rotational speed (from 3600 to 5600 rpm) had slight effects on the fiber fraction at the moderate levels of hollow spindle twist (about 800−1200 t/m), so in the actual process, we could adjust the setting values of hollow spindle twist and hollow spindle rotational speed to get different required flax fiber fractions.

<sec id="sec9-0021998311430155"><title>Effects of fabrics’ weave density on mechanical properties</title>
<p>To analyze the effects of weave density of fabric on the mechanical properties of fabric preforms, some plain fabrics with different warp density and weft density had been studied, and the tensile properties of different density fabrics were tested in the warp and weft direction, respectively.</p>
<p>The changes in weaving density (warp/weft) had a great impact on the tensile properties of fabric preforms (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311430155">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311430155">8</xref>). From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311430155">Figure 7</xref>, when the weft densities of the three fabrics were same, the tensile strength in warp increased as the warp density increases, while the tensile strength in weft decreased. Similarly, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311430155">Figure 8</xref>, when the warp densities of the three fabrics were same, the tensile strength in warp decreased as the warp density increases, while the tensile strength in weft increased.
<fig id="fig7-0021998311430155" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>The impact of warp density changes on the tensile properties of composite sheets.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311430155-fig7.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig8-0021998311430155" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>The impact of weft density changes on the tensile properties of composite sheets.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311430155-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>As shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311430155">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311430155">8</xref>, at the same weft density, the number of warp yarn to bear the load increased with increase in warp density, so the tensile strength in warp increased. But, the tensile strength in weft decreased with increase in weft density, the main reason was as follows: When the warp yarns were stretched, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311430155">Figure 9</xref>, the load <italic>F</italic> on the point <italic>P</italic> of warp yarn could be dispersed into two efforts (<italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>F</italic><sub>2</sub>). The first force <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub>, perpendicular to the core yarns, was the most direct and effective destruction force of the interface of flax and PP; the other was the force <italic>F</italic><sub>2</sub>, along the axial direction of core yarn, which had a certain impact damage on the interface; and angle α is the angle between <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>F</italic>. With increase in weft density, the woven frequency of warp and weft yarns increased, and intercross point increased too, which results in the increase of curve degree of warp. When stretching, the angle between load direction and the core yarn would be increased gradually, while α decreased (α ∈ (0°,90°) and <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> = <italic>F</italic> cos α), so with increase in weft density, α decreased and <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> increased, which made it easier separating the reinforcement from the surrounding PP, thereby the tensile strength of warp decreased. The effects of warp density changes to the tensile properties were also similar to the weft density, the difference between them was that the curve degree of weft yarns in the fabric was relatively small, and the degree of change was also small for warp yarns, so the influence of the weft density changes on the tensile strength was to a larger extent than the warp density changes.
<fig id="fig9-0021998311430155" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Schematic of tensile force on plain fabric.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311430155-fig9.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>At the same time, if the warp density increased, two adjacent warp yarns would come even closer and the friction between the cross-points increased, which made it difficult for weaving. And, if weft density increased, because of the smooth surface of cowrapped yarns, the weft yarns would move forward to shed and then result in the actual weft density not reaching the set value. Therefore, an integrated facilitative weaving and a collaborative role between the tensile properties in warp and weft of fabric preforms could be set at a smaller warp density range and a moderate level of weft density.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0021998311430155"><title>Effect of fabric structure and yarn orientation on mechanical properties</title>
<p>To compare the effects of yarn orientation and fabric structure on the mechanical properties of fabric preforms, we weaved some kind of fabric preforms with the cowrap spinning yarns according to the actual requirements. The three structure fabrics (Plain, Twill, and Basket; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311430155">Figure 10</xref>(a)–(c)) were of the same warp density (122 picks/10 cm) and weft density (72 picks/10 cm), and the fabric was cut in to samples of 300 mm × 50 mm for tensile test.
<fig id="fig10-0021998311430155" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p>The tensile properties of three different fabrics: (a)plain), (b) twill, (c) basket, and (d) tensile strength vs. elongation in warp direction (0°).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311430155-fig10.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311430155">Figure 10</xref>(d), there was a larger difference in the stretch curve among the three types of fabric structure when the tensile was in warp direction (0°). Although the maximum tensile strength of different structures of fabric were close, the tensile elongation was largest in plain fabric, while twill fabric had the minimum with basket fabric between them. According to the tensile curve shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311430155">Figure 10</xref>(d), the largest tensile modulus was basket fabric and the smallest was plain. The results showed that the friction and compressibility and the fabric structure effects were not negligible, which relates directly with the influence of the cowrap yarn properties on the friction behavior and intercross points of warp and weft yarns in different structure fabrics. The main reason for these differences was due to a different fabric structure, different numbers of interwoven yarn in warp and weft, the varying crook degrees of flexion, and the angle of woven yarn. In plain fabric, there were more intercross points and crook degrees of warp and weft yarns in periodic unit cell than twill and basket, so the clamp points were more, which results in more clamp force on yarns at intercross points during stretching and had more elongation.</p>
<p>The comparison of tensile properties in different orientations is shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311430155">11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998311430155">12</xref>. For each different structure fabric, the tensile strength and elongation had differences when stretching along different directions. As the structure of three types of fabrics, the largest tensile strength was along the warp direction (0°) followed by the weft direction (90°), and the minimum was in the direction of 45°. But the elongation was largest in the direction of 45°, and elongation in the direction of warp and weft was smaller. These differences were caused due to the fabric structure and yarn’s orientation under tensile stretching. The tensile curves of plain fabric in different orientations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998311430155">Figure 13</xref>. The tensile strength in the warp and weft direction was higher than that in the direction of 45°, because the yarns along the axial direction of tensile force could effort much more force, while in the direction of 45° the yarns had a big angle between the axial of force, which resulted in larger deformation and more elongation but less force component along the axial. So, from the effects of fabric structure and yarn’s orientation on the tensile properties, we concluded that there were some inherent influences of fabric structure and layer-up pattern, and numbers of layers on fabric structure preforms and composites.

<sec id="sec11-0021998311430155"><title>Effects of pretreatments on impregnation interface and properties of flax/PP</title>
<p>Due to the presence of hydroxyl and other polar groups in the constituents of natural fiber, natural fiber exhibits high moisture absorption property. To improve compatibility and wettability in hydrophobic polymer matrix, and strong bonding adhesion in the fiber/matrix interface, flax had been modified by using alkali and silane coupling agent treatment for natural fiber polymer composites. The surface properties of flax were changed after alkali treatment and coupling agent treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0021998311430155">Figure 14</xref>). After alkali treatment, flax yarn linear density increased because of the occurrence of radial expansion and vertical contraction in cellulose fiber. Fiber cross-section shape changed and was more round and cell fibers expanded to a large extent, which led to the fiber cross section becoming a hollow circle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311430155">21</xref></sup> At the same time, the flax fiber expanded because the alkali solution molecules filled the holes and pores in the yarn.
<fig id="fig14-0021998311430155" position="float"><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><p>Surface of flax yarns and scanning electron microscope (SEM) of flax fiber after treatment: (a) untreated surface, (b) alkali-treated surface, (c) coupling-treated surface, (d) untreated, (e) alkali treated, and (f) coupling treated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311430155-fig14.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0021998311430155">Figure 14</xref>, radial expansion and vertical shrinkage of fiber not only made the yarn’s linear density increase but also made the yarn’s original structure change and decreased the tensile strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0021998311430155">Figure 16</xref>). The hold together between flax fibers in yarns became weak, and even fiber ends on the yarn surface that lost the hold together were exposed on the surface, which leads to the decrease of breaking strength of yarn and increase of hairiness of the surface, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0021998311430155">Figure 14</xref>(b) and (e). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0021998311430155">Figure 14</xref>(c) and (f) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0021998311430155">16</xref>, the yarn's change by coupling agent treatment was like the yarns by alkali treatment, and the liquid molecules came also into the internal yarns, and mechanical change was similar to alkali treatment, but not so significantly. So yarn’s strength decreased a little, line density and diameter changed a little, and yarn hairiness of the surface was less after the alkali treatment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0021998311430155">Figure 16</xref>, after these two pretreatments, the tensile strength of fabrics was also decreased due to decreasing strength of flax yarns, and the degree of decrease due to alkali treatment was much higher, nearly decreased by 10%. So to some certainty, there were some damages on flax and fabrics after the pretreatments on flax.
<fig id="fig15-0021998311430155" position="float"><label>Figure 15.</label><caption><p>Interfacial scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of flax/polypropylene (PP) composite: (a) untreated, (b) alkali treated, and (c) coupling treated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311430155-fig15.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>But, for composite sheets produced by hot-press process, the cowrapped yarns and preforms would be good as they not only enhance the distribution of reinforcing fibers and thermoplastic matrix fibers but also improve the protective effect on reinforcing fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0021998311430155">Figure 17</xref>). As tensile strength of composites depended mainly on the interface properties, peel test was used as one of the most important methods to measure the interface mechanical properties, which were significantly important for designing an optimized high-quality interface. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0021998311430155">Figure 14</xref>(d) and (f)) also indicated that the surfaces of the fibers became rougher which enhanced the mechanical interlocking between resins after treatment. There was strong evidence that physical microstructure changes occurred at the fiber surface. It was observed that silane coupling treatment gave surface coating to the fibers, and surface features of fibers were not clearly visible. Since flax fibers exhibited some micropores on their surface, the coupling agent penetrated into the pores and formed mechanically interlocked coating on their surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311430155">22</xref></sup> Micropores, particles adhering to the surface, groove-like portions, and protruding structures made the fiber surface very rough. These effects on natural fibers were of particular importance for fiber–matrix adhesion and the creation of high fiber surface area required for the optimization of fiber–resin reinforcement. Therefore, the modification of cellulose fibers developed into changes in morphology and replaces some of the hydroxyl groups. These changes would effectively result in improved surface tension, wetting ability, swelling, adhesion, and compatibility with polymeric materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311430155">13</xref></sup> From the interfacial SEM images of flax/PP composites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021998311430155">Figure 15</xref>(a)–(c)), it was found that there were some clear gap interface in untreated flax fiber composites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021998311430155">Figure 15</xref>(a)) and after alkali treatment and coupling agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021998311430155">Figure 15</xref>(b) and (c)), the reinforcing fibers and resin matrix together formed good interface and reduced the material defects caused because of the presence of pores. The reinforcement flax fiber could be fully impregnated with resin which filled the pores between the fibers to promote a chemical interaction between the fibers and the matrix. Especially, the silane coupling agent deposited on flax fibers had shown that adhesion between the natural fibers and matrix played an important role on the final mechanical properties of the composite.

<p>Different to the effects of pretreatments on tensile strength of yarns and fabrics, on the contrary, were certain positive impacts on the mechanical properties of composite materials due to the physical and chemical changes and on the interface between flax and PP after pretreatment. From the tensile tests, we found that though the tensile strength of yarns decreased after the treatments, the mechanical properties of composite materials were improved. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0021998311430155">Figure 17</xref>, the tensile strength of composites after coupling agent treatment achieved the highest mechanical strength, the second was by alkali processing, and both treatments resulted in mechanical strengths higher than that of untreated composites. The peel force was decreased a little, by 5% after alkali treatment, but increased higher, nearly to 50%, after coupling agent treatment. So, the mechanical properties of composites increased higher after coupling treatments. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0021998311430155">Figures 14</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021998311430155">15</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0021998311430155">17</xref>, the fiber alkalization treatment improved the wettability and interfacial shear strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311430155">15</xref></sup>; it did also change the tensile strength significantly. All composites showed remarkably higher tensile and peeling forces, because the mobility of PP chains were even more restricted on the fiber surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311430155">23</xref></sup> Fibers tended to agglomerate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998311430155">24</xref></sup> hence became unevenly distributed throughout the matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311430155">14</xref></sup> due to the remarkable differences in character between the flax fiber bundles and the matrix.</p>
<p>The tensile and peeling properties of composites showed that the pretreatment increased the reinforcement and matrix interface bonding, and also increased the fracture strength and peeling property. Alkali-treated fiber composites also showed clean fiber surface indicating poor permeability, however, the slight improvement could be a consequence of the higher roughness observed in alkali-treated fibers but also to their higher aspect ratio after processing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311430155">21</xref></sup> which improved the mechanical interlocking of the interface. Therefore, although the strength of yarn and fabric decreased, alkali treatment increased the interfacial bond strength, which improved the strength of composite materials. Alkali treatment of the flax in the process with PP matrix induced the β-crystalline formation with PP that had a good toughening effect. Coupling agent treatment to composite material as a result of the role of silane coupling between flax and PP matrix by forming a layer of an effective interface improved the bonding between the two parts, and the coupling agent treatment formed a lot of hairiness on the surface of the flax fiber, which also improved the fracture strength and peeling force of composites. The enhancement in the tensile strength and peeling property of the composites indicated that silane coupling agent sufficiently improved the wettability of the fiber with the polymer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998311430155">25</xref></sup> so that leads to the improved dispersion of the fiber and the permeability of resin, which in turn leads to an increase in the stress transfer efficiency from the matrix to the fiber.</p>
<p>Most of the silane coupling agents can be represented by the following formula<sup>2</sup>:R—(CH)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic>—Si(OR′)<sub>3</sub>, where <italic>n</italic> = 0–3, OR′ is the hydrolyzable alkoxy group, and R is the functional organic group. The organofunctional group (R) in the coupling agent caused the reaction with the PP polymer matrix. This could be a copolymerization and/or the formation of an interpenetrating network.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311430155">2</xref></sup> The curing reaction of a silane-treated fiber enhanced the wetting by the polymer resin. The general mechanism of how alkoxysilanes form bonds with the fiber surface which contains hydroxyl groups is as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0021998311430155">Figure 18</xref>).
<fig id="fig18-0021998311430155" position="float"><label>Figure 18.</label><caption><p>Schematic of interaction between flax fiber and coupling agent.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311430155-fig18.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The chemical bonding between the anhydride and the hydroxyl groups caused a better stress transfer from the matrix onto the fibers, which leads to a higher mechanical strength. This may suggest that flax fiber bundles were coated, probably by the matrix, and therefore, the failure mainly occurred in the matrix and not at the fiber surface. All these results indicate that the natural flax/PP along with the coupling agent could be used as a valuable alternative to natural fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites.</p>

<sec id="sec12-0021998311430155" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The processability and mechanical properties of cowrap spinning yarns based on the natural flax fibers and PP thermoplastics, and manufacturing textile preforms and textile structural composites were investigated in this article. The natural flax fibers were twistless in yarns and preforms, and PP served as a carrier for flax and prevented damage to flax fibers during processing, and became the polymer matrix in the final composites. To get an even distribution of fibers and thermoplastic resins in preforms, and a good surface compaction and different flax fiber content, the main spinning parameters (hollow spindle twist and hollow spindle rotational speed) were analyzed and optimized by the RSM and QGRUD approaches. The hollow spindle twist and hollow spindle rotational speed had different impacts on flax fiber fraction, which also had interactive effect on it. The change of rotational speed (from 3600 to 5600 rpm) had slight effects on the fiber fraction at moderate level of hollow spindle twist (about 800–1200 t/m), so in the actual process, we could adjust the setting values of hollow spindle twist and hollow spindle rotational speed to get different required flax fiber fractions (such as 40, 50, and 60%).</p>
<p>Besides, fabric structure parameters had a great influence on the mechanical properties of flax/PP preforms and composites. An integrated facilitative weaving and a collaborative role between the tensile properties in warp and weft of fabric preforms could be set at a smaller warp density range and a moderate level of weft density. The fabric density, fabric structure (including plain, twill, and basket weave fabric), and yarn tensile orientation (at 0°, 90°, and 45°), had a great influence on the tensile strength and elongation of preforms, due to different fabric structure, different numbers of interwoven yarn in warp and weft, the varying crook degrees of flexion, and the angle of woven yarn.</p>
<p>To improve the impregnation and bonding interface during processing, different pretreatments on flax/PP were investigated, and the microstructure and mechanical properties of thermoplastic composites showed improved wettability of impregnation and good adhesion and bonding interface between flax fiber and PP matrix in composites. Natural flax/PP along with the coupling agent could be used as a valuable alternative to natural fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites. Cowrap spinning commingled methods could open up a broader prospect for development of natural fiber thermoplastic preforms and composites with high-quality components and in economically feasible ways.</p>
