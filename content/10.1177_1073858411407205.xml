<p>Real-time fMRI permits simultaneous measurement and observation of brain activity during an ongoing task. One of the most challenging applications of real-time fMRI in neuroscientific and clinical research is the possibility of acquiring volitional control of localized brain activity using real-time fMRI–based neurofeedback protocols. Real-time fMRI allows the experimenter to noninvasively manipulate brain activity as an independent variable to observe the effects on behavior. Real-time fMRI neurofeedback studies demonstrated that learned control of the local brain activity leads to specific changes in behavior. Here, the authors describe the implementation and application of real-time fMRI with particular emphasis on the self-regulation of local brain activity and the investigation of brain-function relationships. Real-time fMRI represents a promising new approach to cognitive neuroscience that could complement traditional neuroimaging techniques by providing more causal insights into the functional role of circumscribed brain regions in behavior.</p>

<p>Brain imaging in cognitive and affective neuroscience adopts experimental paradigms correlating a particular behavioral manipulation as independent variable and recording the brain response as dependent variable. This approach generated a large amount of data demonstrating a significant relationship between the two levels of observation: brain and behavior. An opposite but complementary approach in human experimentation, in which brain activity is noninvasively manipulated as an independent variable to observe the effects on behavior, is represented by brain stimulation methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS is currently an established investigative tool in the cognitive neurosciences that has made a remarkable contribution to the understanding of perception, attention, language, learning, and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1073858411407205">Walsh and Cowey 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Alternatively to brain stimulation, neurofeedback represents a noninvasive paradigm in which learned regulation of local brain activity is used as an independent variable. An extensive body of literature on neurofeedback based on electroencephalographic (EEG) signals demonstrated that individuals following training can learn to control oscillatory and evoked brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1073858411407205">Elbert and others 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073858411407205">Birbaumer and others 1990</xref>). Several studies also provided solid evidence that controlling brain activation can modify behavior and have a therapeutic effect in particular in patients with otherwise pharmacologically intractable epilepsy and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, but only a few indications passed rigorous clinical-experimental testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1073858411407205">Barber and others 1971–1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073858411407205">Birbaumer and Kimmel 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073858411407205">Birbaumer and Cohen 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Both TMS and EEG techniques have a limited spatial resolution, and subcortical brain regions are not accessible; thus, their usability and applications are limited. The advent of functional neuroimaging, particularly fMRI, permitted noninvasive assessment of brain function with high spatial resolution by measuring changes in the blood-oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) signal. Although the BOLD response is an indirect measure, there is growing evidence for a correlation of the BOLD signal with electrical brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1073858411407205">Logothetis 2008</xref>). The BOLD signal is modulated by increases and decreases in deoxygenated hemoglobin concentration resulting from changes in cerebral blood volume, cerebral blood flow, and oxygen metabolism following sensory stimulation or cognitive tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1073858411407205">Uludağ and others 2009</xref>). Innovations in high-performance magnetic resonance scanners and computers and developments in techniques for faster acquisition, processing, and analysis of MR images have now allowed us to perform real-time fMRI analysis and have consequently extended fMRI applications. Real-time fMRI permits simultaneous measurement and observation of brain activity during an ongoing task. Online single- subject preprocessing and statistical analysis of functional data is possible within a single repetition time (TR; 1 –2 s).</p>
<p>One of the most challenging applications of real-time fMRI in neuroscientific and clinical research is the possibility to acquire volitional control of localized brain activity using real-time fMRI–based neurofeedback protocols. Real-time fMRI neurofeedback studies showed that learned control of the local brain activity leads to specific changes in behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073858411407205">deCharms and others 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1073858411407205">Rota and others 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073858411407205">Caria and others 2010</xref>). Ratings of pain intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073858411407205">deCharms and others 2005</xref>), prosody judgments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1073858411407205">Rota and others 2009</xref>), and valence of emotional stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073858411407205">Caria and others 2010</xref>) have been observed to vary concurrently to the learned control of specific brain activations. These studies demonstrated the feasibility of using the change in BOLD signal in circumscribed regions of interest (ROIs) as an independent variable and indicated real-time fMRI as a complementary tool to investigate brain functions.</p>
<p>Here, we describe the implementation of real-time fMRI and its application in healthy subjects and patients. Particular emphasis is placed on the methodological aspects related to the self-regulation of local brain activity and the investigation of brain-function relationships. We then illustrate the concept by studies on self-regulation of the insula activity in healthy participants and clinical populations. Finally, we provide guidelines on the main experimental aspects of real-time fMRI–based neurofeedback.</p>

<title>Real-Time fMRI Acquisition and Analysis</title>
<p>Online image reconstruction of whole-brain echo-planar imaging (EPI) scans is now provided by most manufacturers of MR scanners. Nevertheless, additional software is necessary for feeding back participants with useful quantitative real-time fMRI information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073858411407205">Fig. 1</xref>). Once a connection to MRI scanners is established (e.g., via TCP/IP protocols), EPI images can be immediately retrieved for further processing and analysis. A tradeoff needs to be made between spatial and temporal resolution as rapid acquisition of whole brain images (1–2 s) limits the number of slices that can be acquired, typically about 16 to 20.</p>

Real-time acquisition methods, such as multiecho EPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1073858411407205">Posse and others 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1073858411407205">Posse, Shen, and others 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1073858411407205">Weiskopf and others 2005</xref>) and adaptive multiresolution EPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1073858411407205">Yoo and others 1999</xref>), have been optimized to ensure high speed and data quality. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1073858411407205">Tang and Huang (2011)</xref> proposed a real-time feedback method that automatically and rapidly determines the optimal z-shim gradients for GE-EPI experiments to compensate for susceptibility-induced local magnetic field inhomogeneity.</p>
<p>Real-time fMRI methodology has been mainly explored using block design paradigms in which task conditions are alternated with the rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073858411407205">Fig. 1</xref>). Conventional block designs provide high functional sensitivity as the statistical power is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1073858411407205">Aguirre and D’Esposito 2000</xref>). Yet single-event real-time fMRI has also been applied. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1073858411407205">Posse and colleagues (2001)</xref> characterized the variability of the hemodynamic impulse response in primary and supplementary motor cortex in consecutive trials using single movements.</p>
<p>Online preprocessing of fMRI data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1073858411407205">Hollmann and others 2008</xref>) includes distortion correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1073858411407205">Zaitsev and others 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1073858411407205">Weiskopf and others 2005</xref>), prospective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1073858411407205">Thesen and others 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1073858411407205">Speck and others 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1073858411407205">Zaitsev and others 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1073858411407205">Ooi and others 2009</xref>) or retrospective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1073858411407205">Cox and Jesmanowicz 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1073858411407205">Mathiak and others 2001</xref>) 3D motion correction, temporal filtering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1073858411407205">Weiskopf and others 2004</xref>), spatial smoothing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1073858411407205">Posse, Fitzgerald, and others 2003</xref>), spatial normalization to stereotactic space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1073858411407205">Lee and others 2008</xref>), and multivariate classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1073858411407205">LaConte and others 2007</xref>). Artifacts caused by participants’ motion during scanning are serious problems in functional imaging. At present, offline as well as online retrospective motion compensation algorithms are well-established methods for motion correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1073858411407205">Mathiak and Posse 2001</xref>). However, retrospective correction might generate image blurring as it involves interpolation, whereas the prospective approach, by keeping the image plane at a fixed orientation with respect to the participant’s head during the acquisition, overcomes this problem. An integrated method for real-time prospective correction was implemented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1073858411407205">Zaitsev and others (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1073858411407205">Speck and others (2006)</xref>, who developed an efficient optical tracking device that improves real-time slice-by-slice correction in 2D EPI. Although optical tracking needs additional hardware to be implemented, it does not require modification of the pulse sequence.</p>
<p>Online statistical analyses can be performed not only using univariate methods such as <italic>t</italic>-tests and correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1073858411407205">Voyvodic 1999</xref>), the general linear model (GLM), and multiple regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1073858411407205">Voyvodic 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1073858411407205">Smyser and others 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073858411407205">Bagarinao and others 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1073858411407205">Weiskopf and others 2004</xref>) but also with more advanced multivariate methods such as independent component analysis (ICA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073858411407205">Esposito and others 2003</xref>) and pattern recognition analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1073858411407205">LaConte and others 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1073858411407205">Laconte 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1073858411407205">Sitaram and others 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1073858411407205">Sorger and others 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Two main approaches have been proposed for univariate methods: sliding window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1073858411407205">Gembris and others 2000</xref>) and incremental analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1073858411407205">Cox and others 1995</xref>). The sliding-window correlation and detrending technique limits the correlation computation to a susbset of measurement time points, enabling one to maintain the sensitivity to changes in the brain throughout the whole experiment but reducing the statistical power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1073858411407205">Gembris and others 2000</xref>). In contrast, the incremental algorithms increase the statistical power by recursively and cumulatively computing correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1073858411407205">Cox and others 1995</xref>),multiple regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1073858411407205">Smyser and others 2001</xref>), or GLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073858411407205">Bagarinao and others 2003</xref>) on the available data.</p>
<p>Alternatively to the traditional hypothesis-driven processing methods, data-driven approaches, such as ICA, have been adapted to real-time fMRI data analysis. By reducing the ICA input to a few points within a time series in a sliding-window approach, comparable performance was obtained with respect to standard linear regression analysis applied either in a sliding window or in a cumulative mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073858411407205">Esposito and others 2003</xref>). Moreover, recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1073858411407205">LaConte and others 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1073858411407205">Laconte 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1073858411407205">Sorger and others 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1073858411407205">Sitaram and others in press</xref>) proposed the implementation of a real-time fMRI pattern classification system using the Support Vector Machine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1073858411407205">Fig. 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1073858411407205">LaConte and colleagues (2007)</xref> showed the feasibility of online decoding and feedback from a single TR of fMRI scanning during block design left- and right-hand motor imagery and further demonstrated the classifier’s ability to decode other forms of cognitive and emotional states. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1073858411407205">Sitaram and colleagues (in press)</xref> extended the above work by showing robust online classification and feedback of multiple emotional states.</p>

A centrally controlled communication between the subsystems involved in the real-time fMRI experiments based on an XML software framework called Experiment Description Language has been recently proposed. Such implementation permits one to define and control parameters relevant for real-time data acquisition, real-time fMRI statistical data analysis, stimulus presentation, and activation processing during the experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1073858411407205">Hollmann and others 2008</xref>).</p>

A number of studies have shown that by providing real-time fMRI feedback to a human person (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1073858411407205">Fig. 3</xref>), learned regulation of the BOLD signal in several brain areas involved in motor, sensory, cognitive, and emotional processing is achievable in a few training sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1073858411407205">Yoo and Jolesz 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1073858411407205">Weiskopf and others 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1073858411407205">Posse, Fitzgerald, and others 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073858411407205">deCharms and others 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1073858411407205">Weiskopf and others 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073858411407205">deCharms and others 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1073858411407205">Yoo and others 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073858411407205">Caria and others 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1073858411407205">Rota and others 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1073858411407205">Haller and others 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1073858411407205">Johnston and others 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1073858411407205">Hamilton and others 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1073858411407205">McCaig and others 2011</xref>). Despite the inherent low temporal resolution of fMRI and so of real-time fMRI technique, human participants successfully achieved control of the BOLD response through operant learning. The functional characteristics essential for effective operant learning correspond to the key elements of classical and operant conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073858411407205">Brogden 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073858411407205">Ferster and Skinner 1957</xref>). In particular, feedback training should be configured to provide for discrete trials, in which each rewarded response interspersed with a short pause is an independent event. The response and reward must be contingent for optimal learning to occur, with reward immediately following response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1073858411407205">Felsinger and others 1947</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1073858411407205">Grice 1948</xref>). The brain implicitly takes into account the delay between response and reward (feedback delay) and adapts its performance. Specific schedules of reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073858411407205">Ferster and Skinner 1957</xref>) to maximize learning can be applied to real-time fMRI neurofeedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073858411407205">deCharms and others 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073858411407205">Bray and others 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1073858411407205">Johnson and others 2010</xref>). In accordance with learning theories, such as prediction error theories, learning occurs through updating expectations of the outcome proportionally to prediction error, in a way that across trials the expected outcome converges to the actual outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1073858411407205">Rescorla and Wagner 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1073858411407205">Pearce and Hall 1980</xref>). This accepted learning strategy, also called model-free learning, distinguishes from a model-based learning in which cognitive maps describing the relationship between different situations are used to generate a state prediction error. Recent neuroimaging findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1073858411407205">Gläscher and colleagues (2010)</xref> supported the existence of these two forms of learning models in humans.</p>

<p>Although mechanisms underlying self-regulation of brain activity through electroencephalography (EEG)-based neurofeedback have been extensively documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1073858411407205">Elbert and others 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073858411407205">Birbaumer and others 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073858411407205">Birbaumer 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1073858411407205">Kotchoubey and others 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1073858411407205">Hinterberger and others 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1073858411407205">Strehl and others 2006</xref>), formal models of real-time fMRI neurofeedback have not been elaborated yet.</p>
<p>Using real-time fMRI brain-function relationships can be investigated by training participants to self-regulate BOLD activity in specific brain regions and by testing them for concurrent changes in behavior. In fact, real-time fMRI studies demonstrated that the learned regulation of the neurophysiological activity in circumscribed brain regions can be used as an independent variable to observe its effects on behavior. Studies reported behavioral changes due to self-induced alterations of brain activity in specific areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073858411407205">deCharms and others 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073858411407205">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073858411407205">Bray and others 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1073858411407205">Rota and others 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073858411407205">Caria and others 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073858411407205">DeCharms and colleagues (2005)</xref> demonstrated that participants were able to learn to control activation in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), a region implicated in mediating the conscious perception of pain. Learned control of the rACC activation was associated with changes in pain perception induced by noxious thermal stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1073858411407205">Fig. 4a</xref>). A group of chronic pain patients was also trained to control activation in the rACC and reported reduction in the level of chronic pain after training. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1073858411407205">Rota and colleagues (2009)</xref> explored the effects of self-regulation of brain areas involved in language processing, the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Participants succeeded in achieving voluntary regulation of their right Brodmann’s area (BA) 45. In addition, two linguistic tasks were performed immediately before and after the training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1073858411407205">Fig. 4b</xref>). A significant improvement of accuracy was observed for the identification of emotional prosodic intonations but not for syntactic processing.</p>

<p>Real-time fMRI experimental paradigms. (a) Experimental design used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073858411407205">deCharms and others (2005)</xref>. Each scanning run consisted of five increase/decrease cycles. Each cycle consisted of a 30-s rest block, followed by a 60-s increase block, during which participants were trained to increase the activation of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), followed by a 60-s decrease block during which participants were trained to decrease activation in the target region of interest. A noxious thermal stimulus was applied for 30 s during each increase and decrease block, starting 10 s after the beginning of the block. After completion of each training run, participants rated the noxious stimulus. During a posttest run, identical to the training runs, the noxious stimulus was rated immediately after its presentation. (b) Experimental design used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1073858411407205">Rota and others (2009)</xref>. The training consisted of four sessions, each of which was composed of six activation blocks (50 s) separated by five baseline blocks (30 s). During activation blocks, the participants had to increase the level of activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; BA 45). During baseline blocks, they were instructed to relax by performing mental imagery. At the end of the real-time fMRI training, participants were instructed to focus on the cognitive strategies previously adopted and to up-regulate BA 45 while carrying out two linguistic tasks. No real-time fMRI feedback was provided to the participant in this phase. (c) Experimental design used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073858411407205">Caria and others (2010)</xref>. Training sessions for insula regulation consisted of five regulation blocks (30 s) alternating with rest blocks (30 s), both followed by a picture presentation block (9 s) and a rating block (12 s). Immediately after picture presentation, participants were required to rate the emotional valence and arousal of the stimuli.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073858411407205">Caria and colleagues (2007)</xref> first demonstrated the possibility of specifically increasing the BOLD signal in the anterior insula in healthy participants through real-time fMRI training. Second, they tested the hypothesis that voluntary modulation of activity in the anterior insula induces changes in the subjective response to emotional stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1073858411407205">Fig. 4c</xref>). Enhanced anterior insula activity was associated with increased negative perception of aversive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073858411407205">Caria and others 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, manipulation of visual perception has been demonstrated in a real-time fMRI neurofeedback experiment in which participants were instructed to regulate activation of a target ROI in the early visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1073858411407205">Scharnowski and others 2010</xref>). The level of ongoing activity in retinotopically specific areas of the human visual cortex caused by effective self-regulation had a causal effect on the detectability of visual stimuli. Specifically, a significant improvement in visual sensitivity was observed when participants up-regulated BOLD activity.</p>
<p>Most of the studies so far described assessed the specificity of the observed changes in behavior with control groups. Groups performed real-time fMRI training with unspecific feedback, receiving information either from distinct brain regions supposedly not involved in the target task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073858411407205">deCharms and others 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1073858411407205">Rota and others 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073858411407205">Caria and others 2010</xref>) or from a previously tested experimental participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073858411407205">deCharms and others 2005</xref>). In addition, the effects of cognitive strategies such as performing a mental imagery training alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073858411407205">Caria and others 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1073858411407205">Scharnowski and others 2010</xref>) or modulating the attention to the target stimuli were also tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073858411407205">deCharms and others 2005</xref>). None of the control groups learned to regulate the activity in target brain region and concurrently no changes in behavior were observed. Control conditions indicated that unspecific feedback or behavioral training performed in the absence of contingent feedback does not lead to learned regulation of localized brain activity. A combination of cognitive, emotional, and motor strategies and real-time fMRI information drives participants to acquire successful control. Whether this is a sufficient condition has still to be ascertained. Nevertheless, time-contingent feedback of the physiological response (BOLD) constitutes a necessary ingredient of brain self-regulation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073858411407205">Bray and colleagues (2007)</xref> demonstrated that monetary reinforcement of increased activity in motor/somatosensory regions provided after a conditioning trial was sufficient for participants to voluntarily control their BOLD signal. The instrumentally conditioned brain activity was observed to have a facilitator effect on reaction times when the physical response engaged activity of the same regions. However, a clear negative correlation between reaction-time measure and BOLD signal change was not reported.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the studies so far conducted indicate that the acquired control does not result from general arousal and/or global brain activation. Physiological signals should be monitored to detect and prevent subjects from developing undesirable regulation strategies, consciously or unconsciously, for example, developing unspecific brain activation by general arousal, variation of heart beat or tongue movement, and changes in breathing patterns. Real-time routines can be adopted to determine physiological artifacts by parallel monitoring of the fMRI signal changes and physiological parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1073858411407205">Glover and others 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1073858411407205">Smyser and others 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073858411407205">Birn and others 2006</xref>). An open-source hardware and software system for acquisition and real-time processing of electrophysiology has been recently proposed for high-field MRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1073858411407205">Purdon and others 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Effects of real-time fMRI training were also demonstrated in terms of functional brain reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1073858411407205">Rota and others 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1073858411407205">Lee and others 2011</xref>). Changes in functional and effective connectivity were investigated in subjects who learned to deliberately increase activation in the right IFG (rIFG) and improved their ability to identify emotional intonations after real-time fMRI training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1073858411407205">Rota and others 2010</xref>). The initial training process is characterized by a massive connectivity of the rIFG to a widespread network of frontal and temporal areas, which decreased and lateralized to the right hemisphere with practice. Volitional control of activation strengthened connectivity of this brain region to the right prefrontal cortex, whereas training increased its connectivity to the bilateral precentral gyri.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1073858411407205">Lee and colleagues (2011)</xref> examined brain changes while individuals were trained to regulate the insular cortex by using imagery of emotional episodes guided by real-time fMRI feedback information. Multivariate pattern-based spatial analysis indicated that real-time fMRI training leads to more spatially focused recruitment of areas relevant for processing of emotions. Effective connectivity analysis revealed that initial training causes an increase of network density, whereas further training prunes redundant connections but strengthens relevant connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1073858411407205">Lee and others 2011</xref>). These findings suggest that changes of connectivity in a functionally specific manner can be achieved with real-time fMRI training.</p>
<p>Moreover, multivariate methods were applied not only for evaluating cerebral reorganization due to prolonged neurofeedback training but also for the implementation of real-time fMRI.</p>
<p>Recent studies indicate that the application of multivariate pattern classification analysis to real-time fMRI overcomes the limitations of considering a single or combination of ROI and does not require prior assumptions about functional localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1073858411407205">LaConte and others 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1073858411407205">Laconte 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1073858411407205">Sitaram and others 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1073858411407205">Sorger and others 2010</xref>). Therefore, participants can be trained to manipulate their brain state by providing feedback of the BOLD activity in a network of brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1073858411407205">Fig. 2</xref>). This would allow the experimenter to establish a more clear relationship between patterns of cerebral activity and the observed behavior.</p>
<p>In the perspective of using real-time fMRI-based training as an interventional approach, a recent pilot study trained chronic subcortical stroke patients to regulate the BOLD response in the ventral premotor cortex. The participants’ ability to learn self-regulation was found to depend linearly on the intracortical facilitation and correlated negatively with the intracortical inhibition measured by TMS prior to feedback training. After training, intracortical inhibition decreased significantly with the volitional increase of the BOLD in the PMv, indicating a beneficial effect of self-regulation training on motor cortical output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1073858411407205">Sitaram and others in press</xref>).</p>
<p>Further studies assessed the feasibility of real-time fMRI neurofeedback as a behavioral intervention for nicotine dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073858411407205">Chiu and others 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1073858411407205">Stoeckel and others 2010</xref>). The authors first showed that the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) is involved in processing smoking-related information and anticipating future smoking-related episodes. Second, they reported that nine nicotine-dependent smokers successfully increased activation in the left NAcc over six training runs. Finally, they suggested that generating a future rewarding, smoking-related episode, as opposed to a past memory, may be a potential cognitive strategy nicotine-dependent individuals can use to self-regulate reward-related brain activation and, ultimately, the craving to smoke.</p>
<p>Driven by the same intent but inspired by the multivariate approach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073858411407205">Chiu and colleagues (2010)</xref> have shown data indicating the suitability of multivoxel pattern analysis–based real-time fMRI for modeling craving versus noncraving brain states and that chronic smokers can learn to modulate a neurofeedback interface reflecting these states. These results highlight the potentiality of the integration of real-time fMRI and advances in computational approaches to feedback to understand the neurobiology and treatment of substance dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1073858411407205">Laconte 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Learned Regulation of Insula Activity through Real-Time fMRI</title>
<p>Recently Caria and colleagues investigated the modulatory effect of the BOLD response in the left anterior insula on the perception of visual emotional stimuli. Three groups of participants were tested: two underwent four real-time fMRI training sessions receiving either specific or unspecific feedback of the insula’s BOLD response, respectively, and one group used emotional imagery alone without receiving real-time fMRI feedback information. The experimental protocol consisted of four real-time fMRI sessions performed on one day. Sessions consisted of five regulation blocks alternating with six baseline blocks, both followed by a picture presentation block and a rating block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1073858411407205">Fig. 4c</xref>). During the regulation blocks (30 s), indicated by a red background, participants were asked to increase insula activity, whereas during baseline (30 s), indicated by a blue background, they had to return the activity to the baseline level. Participants were provided with a graphical thermometer displaying online changes of BOLD activity with increasing or decreasing numbers of bars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1073858411407205">Fig. 4c</xref>). Thermometer bars were updated every 1.5 s when a new BOLD signal from the ROIs was available. After both regulation and baseline blocks, one emotionally negative or neutral picture from the International Affective Picture System (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1073858411407205">Bradley and Lang, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073858411407205">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1073858411407205">Lang and others 2008</xref>) was presented (9 s) and rated using a button-based control device inside the MRI scanner. Pictures were evaluated in terms of subjective emotional valence and arousal using the Self-Assessment Manikin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073858411407205">Bradley and Lang 1994</xref>). Participants in the experimental group, who learned to significantly increase the BOLD signal in the target region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1073858411407205">Fig. 5</xref>), rated aversive pictures more negatively after regulation. The larger the positive difference in the BOLD activation in the anterior insula between regulation and baseline conditions, the higher the level of perceived negative emotion of the aversive stimuli. Conversely, the smaller or more negative this difference of the BOLD amplitude, the lower was the level of perceived negative emotion of the aversive stimuli. The groups trained with unspecific feedback and using only mental imagery were unable to successfully achieve control of the target brain region over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1073858411407205">Fig. 6</xref>) and showed no significant changes in the evaluation of the emotional stimuli.</p>

<p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1073858411407205">Lawrence and colleagues (2010)</xref> reported that healthy participants are able to modulate the BOLD signal in the right anterior insula after real-time fMRI neurofeedback training. Interestingly, they observed higher valence ratings and increased skin conductance response to positive stimuli (the International Affective Picture System) presented after increase blocks during the posttraining runs in the contingent feedback group only. Altogether, these results complement traditional neuroimaging studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1073858411407205">Critchley and others 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1073858411407205">Craig 2009</xref>), indicating the anterior insula as critical region for the explicit appraisal of emotional stimuli, and they suggest a potential role of the real-time fMRI approach in clinical applications of emotional disorders.</p>
<p>Using an analogous experimental protocol, ongoing studies are currently investigating the ability of patients with emotional disorders to achieve volitional control of this region and whether this has an effect on behavior and brain reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1073858411407205">Sitaram 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1073858411407205">Ruiz and others 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1073858411407205">Sitaram (2007)</xref> assessed whether criminal psychopaths could be trained to self-regulate left anterior insula. Four psychopathic individuals who underwent real-time fMRI neurofeedback sessions have learned to regulate their left anterior insula after two to three days of training, each day consisting of four feedback runs. Participants with higher psychopathic checklist-revised (PCL-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1073858411407205">Hare 2003</xref>) scores were less successful at self-regulation than their lower PCL-R counterparts, supporting the existing notion that psychopaths have deficient anticipatory fear-conditioning capacity. Effective connectivity analysis using Granger causality modeling showed that learning to regulate the anterior insula not only increases the number of connections (causal density) in the emotional network but also increases the difference between the number of outgoing and incoming connections (causal flow) of the left insula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1073858411407205">Sitaram 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A further real-time fMRI study recruited chronic schizophrenic patients with negative symptoms for more than 20 real-time fMRI training sessions targeting the left and right anterior insula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1073858411407205">Ruiz and others 2008</xref>). The percentage BOLD signal increased from an early weak regulation session to a late strong regulation session. The success in regulation was accompanied by an increase in the causal density of the functional connections of the network involved in self-regulation of emotions, including insula; emotion recognition tests of participants who completed regulation training showed a better accuracy in the recognition of disgust faces after up-regulation compared with the baseline condition; and both emotions disgust and happiness were rated as more intense after up-regulation.</p>
<p>These preliminary results indicate the feasibility of real-time fMRI-based neurofeedback training in clinical groups. However, more controlled studies assessing short- and long-term effects in clinical populations still need to be carried out before adopting real-time fMRI training as a clinical tool.</p>

<title>Guidelines for Real-Time fMRI Experimental Paradigms</title>
<p>In neurofeedback applications, training to self-regulate localized brain activity can be implemented by providing information about the BOLD signal from selected ROIs. A typical implementation of a real-time fMRI-based neurofeedback experiment consists of three separate components aimed to signal acquisition, signal preprocessing and analysis, and feedback computation and presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1073858411407205">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1073858411407205">7</xref>).</p>

<p>Besides the technical aspects related to signal acquisition and analysis (above described), there are some important methodological issues to be considered when investigating the effects on behavior of learned regulation of a specific brain region, specifically ROI selection, feedback computation, behavioral assessment, and instructions to be provided to the participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1073858411407205">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>
<p>Once a specific anatomical location is identified as target brain ROI, delineation of the area can be accomplished anatomically and/or functionally. T1-weighted structural imaging can be used to define specific anatomical landmarks, whereas specific functional localizer sessions, acquired before real-time fMRI training, can be devoted to the detection of brain areas involved in motor, visual, emotional, and higher cognitive processing. The ROI is chosen by drawing a rectangular area on the anatomical image or by selecting active clusters on functional maps computed by the signal analysis software (e.g., Turbo-BrainVoyager). To improve accuracy of the selection of ROIs, functional maps can be co-registered with previously acquired anatomical scans of the participant.</p>
<p>After one or more ROIs are selected, further processing of the fMRI signal needs to be performed to arrive at a suitable representation of brain activity to be presented as feedback. Effective signal change is usually computed as a difference of the average BOLD signal between the activation and the baseline blocks in a single ROI or a combination of ROIs. It is also possible to cancel out the effects of global drifting, scaling, physiological fluctuations, and unspecific arousal by using differential feedback; that is, the BOLD signal changes in one reference region are subtracted from the targeted ROIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1073858411407205">Weiskopf and others 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073858411407205">Caria and others 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1073858411407205">Rota and others 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073858411407205">Caria and others 2010</xref>). Recently, online methods to explicitly model and remove nuisance signals in fMRI data have been shown to improve the quality of neurofeedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1073858411407205">Hinds and others 2011</xref>). The authors also proposed an alternative approach for a more flexible ROI combination scheme via voxel efficiency weighting.</p>
<p>In additioin, a multiecho coarse voxel pulse sequence has been proposed to increase contrast-to-noise ratio and temporal sampling of BOLD signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1073858411407205">Kuo and others 2011</xref>). This technique might increase the fraction of the total brain voxels covered by the selected ROIs and enhance the ability to regulate brain activity.</p>
<p>Real-time fMRI neurofeedback paradigms are particularly sensitive to task-related BOLD signal artifacts. However, appropriate scan parameters (e.g., specific phase encoding direction) can reduce BOLD signal vulnerability to contamination from nonneuronal sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1073858411407205">Zhang and others 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to select circumscribed brain regions by the ROI method employing univariate analysis, pattern-based methods permit extracting brain activity from spatially distributed interacting regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1073858411407205">LaConte and others 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1073858411407205">Laconte 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1073858411407205">Sorger and others 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1073858411407205">Sitaram and others in press</xref>; Table 1). Multivariate approaches enable the optimal weighting to combine ROIs and thus provide a flexible and more comprehensive model, in terms of spatiotemporal relationships, of the brain network dynamics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1073858411407205">Magland and colleagues (2011)</xref> have developed a new real-time processing technique (spatio-temporal activity in real time [STAR]) that takes advantage of noise-reduction properties of multivoxel techniques without significantly affecting regional specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1073858411407205">Magland and others 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus far, preselection of the ROI for feedback control has been shown to be a successful approach for achieving BOLD control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073858411407205">deCharms and others 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1073858411407205">Weiskopf and others 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1073858411407205">deCharms and others 2008</xref>). Alternatively, using multivariate classification models, neurofeedback signals can cue participants about a specific brain state, rather than time series fluctuations in localized brain regions. To this aim, participants can be trained with feedback information of the classifier’s output to learn to control their pattern of brain activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1073858411407205">LaConte and others 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073858411407205">Chiu and others 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1073858411407205">Sorger and others 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1073858411407205">Sitaram and others in press</xref>; Table 1).</p>
<p>Overall both the univariate-, ROI based- and the multivariate approaches can be beneficial for self-regulation of brain activity through real-time fMRI. While the ROI based approach is geared to study how self-regulation of specific brain regions can influence mental states and behavior through concomitant changes in a distributed neuronal network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1073858411407205">Lee and others 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1073858411407205">Rota and others 2010</xref>), the multivariate methods directly target brain patterns. Although many feedback modalities are possible, visual feedback has been the most frequently used method. A variety of visual stimuli has been employed to indicate the required level of activation at different time points, such as scrolling time-series graphs and curves of BOLD activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1073858411407205">Weiskopf and others 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073858411407205">deCharms and others 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1073858411407205">Weiskopf and others 2004</xref>), functional maps of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1073858411407205">Yoo and Jolesz 2002</xref>), and a graphical thermometer that shows varying levels of ROI activity as changing bars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073858411407205">Caria and others 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1073858411407205">Rota and others 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073858411407205">Caria and others 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Real-time fMRI neurofeedback is based on the principles of operant learning, and it uses the feedback of the neurophysiologic signal (BOLD) as intrinsic reward to learn to acquire control over the brain activity. External factors such as participants’ selection, instructions prior to and during neurofeedback training, the interaction between participants and experimenter, and, in general, the experimental environment can influence learning. Pilot experiments showed that learning without any guidelines for mental strategies was not achievable in a short training period and led to a drop of motivation, especially in the uncomfortable environment such as the MRI scanner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073858411407205">deCharms and others 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1073858411407205">Sitaram 2007</xref>). For this purpose, participants are usually instructed to use cognitive or emotional or motor imagery to influence the feedback signal in the required direction. Areas with unknown function or participants without cognitive abilities to imagine are treated identically, but participants receive only the instruction to influence the feedback signal in the required direction, and participants are rewarded for successful attempts to modify the metabolic flow in the particular brain region. Whether these instructions have any specific effect or constitute mere placebo motivators remains to be shown. Previous studies have shown that contingent feedback is the critical variable for learning BOLD control, and cognitive or emotional imagery instructions have no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073858411407205">deCharms and others 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073858411407205">Caria and others 2010</xref>). Similar results were reported for slow cortical potential biofeedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1073858411407205">Rockstroh and others 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073858411407205">Birbaumer and others 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1073858411407205">Laconte and colleagues (2007)</xref> demonstrated using a multivariate technique that by receiving brain-state feedback, participants are able to gain control over different brain patterns with no need of cognitive strategy guidelines.</p>
<p>Typically, during operant conditioning of behavioral responses, participants have a conscious awareness of the responses leading to rewards, whereas in neurofeedback experiments, change of the neurophysiological signals may take place with little or no direct experience of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1073858411407205">Elbert and others 1984</xref>). Accordingly, no instructions for feedback control may actually constitute the more successful real-time fMRI paradigm. On the other hand, awareness of a direct association between mental strategies and specific brain activity seems to help participants to achieve successful brain regulation through real-time fMRI.After training participants retained the ability to control the BOLD signal even in the absence of fMRI feedback information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073858411407205">deCharms et al 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073858411407205">Caria and others 2007</xref>). Transfer runs, where participants are instructed to perform the same task as during training but without fMRI feedback, are usually adopted to test whether training effects persist beyond the experimental situation.</p>
<p>A further critical aspect in investigating the effects of learned regulation of local brain activity is the behavioral assessment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1073858411407205">Fig. 4</xref>). EEG-based neurofeedback studies on operant control of slow cortical potentials (SCPs) assessed the behavioral effects of different types of motor, perceptual, and cognitive tasks after training and during self-generated SCP amplitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1073858411407205">Elbert and others 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1073858411407205">Rockstroh and others 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073858411407205">Birbaumer and others 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073858411407205">Birbaumer 1999</xref>). In clinical applications, such as those for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, changes in behavior and in clinical scores were assessed immediately after training and in a subsequent follow-up after a few months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1073858411407205">Strehl and others 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Hence, a clear distinction between volitional regulation, stimulus-induced activity, and response collection is necessary to reasonably infer the influence of volition (instrumental learning) on behavior. Timing of stimulus presentation and collection of participants’ response is thus a critical issue to be carefully considered. In some real-time fMRI studies, self-regulation was performed simultaneously with the stimulus presentation and the subjective response was recorded after each training run (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073858411407205">deCharms and others 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1073858411407205">Fig. 4a</xref>) or session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1073858411407205">Rota and others 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1073858411407205">Fig. 4b</xref>). Although this approach enables one to directly test the ability to regulate brain activity in the presence of a stimulus, it does not clearly resolve the issue of attentional workload and dual task processing, which might influence the behavioral performance. To circumvent this problem, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073858411407205">deCharms and colleagues (2005)</xref> asked participants to additionally rate the stimulus immediately after its presentation during a posttest run, after training. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073858411407205">Caria and colleagues (2010)</xref> separated the effects of self-regulation on the behavioral response by asking participants to evaluate the stimuli presented after regulation conditions, during the real-time fMRI training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1073858411407205">Fig. 4c</xref>). Yet this approach raises the question about short-term effects, that is, how long after regulation the behavioral effects can still be observed. Future studies should clearly address this issue.</p>
<p>Very recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1073858411407205">Scott and others (2010)</xref> investigated the effects of long-term real-time fMRI training in the motor cortex. Participants, involved in eight neuroimaging sessions over the course of several weeks, were required to maintain their level of brain activation within a specified range. Results demonstrated performance improvements associated with real-time fMRI feedback over multiple scanning sessions; participants continued to demonstrate successively greater control over activation in their somatomotor cortex.</p>
<p>Thus far, most of the studies tested for changes in behavior concurrent with learned regulation of specific brain activity using explicit tasks such as subjective ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073858411407205">deCharms and others 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073858411407205">Caria, Sitaram and others 2010</xref>) or linguistic tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1073858411407205">Rota and others 2009</xref>). Nonetheless, implicit tasks and/or recordings of physiological responses such as skin conductance response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1073858411407205">Lawrence and others 2010</xref>) might strengthen the consistency of the observed effects. The behavioral and cognitive assessment of the real-time fMRI neurofeedback effects is critical for the scientific as well as the clinical future of this methodology. Behavioral measures should test not only the specific behavioral variable targeted but also several other nontargeted behavioral variables to exclude unspecific effects such as arousal, emotional excitation, attention, and so forht. With the appropriate control conditions and control groups, a double dissociation is highly desirable.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Real-time fMRI enables the investigation of brain-function relationships through the observation of the effects on behavior of self-regulation of local brain activity. There is growing evidence that learned control of the BOLD signal in localized brain regions leads to changes in behavior in both healthy participants and clinical populations.</p>
<p>Real-time fMRI inspired a promising new approach to cognitive neuroscience that could complement traditional neuroimaging techniques by providing more causal insights into the functional role of brain regions in behavior. These findings also raise a fundamental question as to how learned regulation of the BOLD signal in target brain regions might influence behavior. A clearer understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the fMRI BOLD response will help us to extend the neuroscientific and clinical applications of real-time fMRI. Eventually, simultaneous EEG acquisition during real-time fMRI based neurofeedback experiments might provide useful insights about the relationship between the BOLD signal and the underlying electrophysiological brain activity.</p>
