<p>The Vice Chancellor of one of Australia’s leading universities recently attracted media attention when he flagged the idea of devising a canon, not just a set of prescribed subject texts, but a collection of books (such as <italic>War and Peace and Moby Dick</italic>) that would, he hoped, give all his students a broader frame of reference and the opportunity to delve into great ideas of the past.</p>
<p><italic>Understanding Corporate Life</italic>, a collection edited by Philip Hancock and André Spicer does not purport to have such lofty ideals, but, it does seek to offer a management text which introduces students to ideas beyond those normally covered by mainstream management texts. This collection of essays, written by members (past or present) of the Faculty of Warwick Business School, aims to discuss areas of contemporary corporate life that has been largely ignored or at best marginalized in most mainstream textbooks from the particular perspective of the authors (p. 3).</p>
<p>In most management texts, ideas aren’t seen as having any currency unless they are new. The focus is on the latest trend, innovation or management fad. In contrast, in this collection what we have is recognition that there is indeed nothing new under the sun. Take for example, Morgan’s chapter on globalization. In many mainstream management texts ‘globalization’ is presented as a new phenomena, yet, Morgan reminds us that there is nothing new about globalization (p. 97). Morgan provides the examples, including trade routes across the Eurasian land mass (the silk route), across the southern oceans (the Spice route), to remind us that global capital has been a feature of life for centuries. Understanding that globalization has a long history ensures that we will be able to identify and explore what is different about the current era and the effects these differences have on individuals and corporations. Morgan is of the view that globalization has lead to a greater independency and encourages corporate leaders (and future corporate leaders) to look beyond their own organization in not only identifying opportunities but also to appreciate risk: a perspective which many clearly didn’t exercise in the lead up to the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>Most of the chapters in this book take us back in time to show, if only briefly, that most ideas in management and corporate life derive from ideas that originated a long time ago. For example, Hancock’s chapter on aesthetics takes us back to the very root of the concept and ideas from art and art theory. In their chapter on emotions, Surman and Sturdy located their discussion within the broader 19th century obsession with rationality which served to marginalize and ‘gender’ emotions. It is only through an appreciation of the development of ideas that we can truly understand the way in which they are used (and in some cases abused) by corporations. This book does just that by introducing us the seminal works of scholars such as: Heidegger (chapter 1, technology); Marx (chapter 2, speed); Bohme and Kant (chapter 3, aesthetics); Merleau-Ponty and Lefebvre (chapter 4, space); Foucault and Thompson (chapter 5, time); Mills, Smith and Goffman (chapter 8, identity).</p>
<p>Not surprisingly there are also themes that run across a number of chapters and these themes could be picked up on and used to structure courses that incorporated a number of the chapters under the one topic. For example, the effects on corporate and daily life of the compression of time and space, where distance and time no longer hold the constraints they once did, finds its way into the chapters on speed (chapter 2 ), time (chapter 5) and globalization (chapter 6): although surprisingly not the chapter on space. Students could explore, amongst other things, the way that the compression of time and space has created opportunities for corporations, while in some ways, having deleterious effects on workers. Common themes also run through chapters on technology (chapter 1), aesthetics (chapter 3) and knowledge (chapter 9). These ideas could be harnessed to show how practices and processes of technology, knowledge and aesthetics are mutually implicated and together shape corporate life.</p>
<p>There are some chapters where the readers will immediately identify with the ideas being presented and find themselves nodding their heads in agreement, in particular I am thinking of the chapters on speed (chapter 2), space (chapter 4) and time (chapter 5). For example, the idea drawn from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350508411417599">Roth (1963)</xref> and explained by Legge in chapter 5, that life in the corporation can be conceptualized as ‘doing time’ (p. 90). Legge explains that ‘doing time’ is central to establishing our identity or identities in the eyes of others: ‘The work of doing time in formal and informal socially sanctioned or deviant organisations normally involves enacting a career over time’ (p. 90). Imagine if future human resource managers and CEOs could be taught to think about their own future careers and the careers of those that they will one day manage in these terms, rather than the taken-for-granted assumption that underpins many management texts, that a career is about a linear progression along a trajectory that is largely of our own making. As Legge (p. 90) herself suggests, conceptualizing a career as ‘doing time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350508411417599">Roth, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350508411417599">Sennett, 1998</xref>) may enable individuals ‘to reinterpret the exercise of disciplinary practices as benevolent aids to career development’.</p>
<p>I wasn’t entirely convinced by the Editors’ claims that the book was taking us inside corporate life and was actually pleased to see that the book doesn’t limit itself to the confines of the corporation because, as the Editors and some of the contributors argue, corporate life extends well beyond the confines of the workplace. Chris Land’s chapter on ‘community’ shows just why it is important to appreciate this. As he concedes: at first glance a chapter on community might seem out of place in a book aimed at increasing our understanding of corporate life, and yet as he shows, corporate life extends out into community just as communities extend back into the corporate world. We see this in the way ‘the idea of community is held out as both a salve to ease the ontological insecurity of our postmodern, fragmented selves, and as a management tool to increase motivation, commitment and knowledge sharing’ (p. 115).</p>
<p>Indeed, one thing I particularly liked about this book was the way in which a few of the authors encourage us to move our thinking beyond the confines of the modern, western corporation and to imagine or consider other forms of organization or society. Not surprisingly Land’s chapter on community laments the paucity of research, exploring: ‘small, countercultural, Gemeinschaft-like organizations that have contested capitalism’ (p. 128) as an alternative form of organization to the modern corporation. Grey, in his chapter on ‘speed, also encourages us to look beyond the corporation and to consider the potential in alternative ways of being, such as the ‘slow’ movement (coupled with an understanding of the relationship between speed and capitalism) (pp.41–45). While Legge, drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350508411417599">Adams (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350508411417599">2002)</xref>, asks us to consider the nature of time in non-Western societies not as different from our own conception of time but to challenge our own taken-for-granted assumptions around the nature of time. Having recently returned from a research trip to East Timor where I visited a women’s weaving co-operative these invocations to understand alternative forms of organization and to rethink my own conceptualization of time were (sorry for the pun) timely indeed.</p>
<p>Since the global financial crisis there has been lots of hand wringing (perhaps not enough) and some recrimination and blame. Not surprisingly fingers have been pointed at management schools and as a consequence there has been a lot of talk about the need to make the teaching of ethics and CSR compulsory in business schools. However, moves to introduce a ‘cannon’ in one Australian university and ideas presented in this book suggest that a broader and much deeper approach is needed. Not with Spicer’s somewhat Pollyanna aim, expressed at the end of <italic>Understanding Corporate Life</italic>, to ‘remake corporate life into something that is more fruitful, engaging and beautiful’ (p. 188). Rather, that business school students are introduced to ideas that will challenge assumptions about the primacy of the present age by engaging with core (and often long standing) concepts and constructs that underpin managerial practice but are rarely unpacked. This book offers management students and their educators a start to developing that broader view.</p>
