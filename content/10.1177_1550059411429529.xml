<abstract>
<p>The purpose of our study was to establish the guidelines for interpreting neonatal flash visual-evoked potentials (FVEPs) by examining the correlation between maturation of the waveforms and conceptual age (CA). We retrospectively analyzed 220 consecutive neonatal FVEPs performed on premature and full-term infants. The CA of the participants ranged from 28 to 52 weeks. The FVEPs were categorized into 6 groups according to CA: 28 to 31<sup>+</sup> weeks, 32  to 35<sup>+</sup> weeks, 36 to 39<sup>+</sup> weeks, 40 to 43<sup>+</sup> weeks, 44 to 47<sup>+</sup>weeks, and 48 to 52 weeks. The data were analyzed in each group and compared among these 6 groups. The waveforms changed from 28 weeks to 52 weeks of CA. In the CA age range 28 to 31<sup>+</sup> weeks N3 was well visualized, followed by P3. The morphology of P2 including both latency and amplitude became prominent starting from CA age range 32 to 35<sup>+</sup> weeks. The triphasic waveform with clear negative-positive-negative components (N2-P2-N3) presented after 32 weeks. Mean P2 latencies decreased steadily with increasing age. Mean amplitudes of all waveforms (P2-N3 and N3-P3) varied except that of N2-P2 which increased steadily with CA. We conclude that FVEPs can be useful in the evaluation of maturation and function of the visual pathway in neonates. The FVEP is abnormal when the waveforms N3 and P3 are nondetectable in neonates at 28 weeks of CA or older; and when the waveform P2 is non-detectable, or has low amplitude or prolonged latency, in neonates at 36 weeks of CA or older.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>FVEP has been used to study the visual system in neonates. The waveforms of the FVEP change with the maturation of the visual system. A large negative wave is first seen with a latency of around 300 milliseconds at the gestational age of over 24 weeks. After 27 weeks of gestational age, a late positive wave at the latency of 400 milliseconds (P3) is seen. Between 30 and 35 weeks, a positive wave is seen at the latency of 200 milliseconds.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059411429529">1</xref>
</sup> By 2 months of age, all waveforms of an adult FVEP are present, but with longer latency values.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059411429529">2</xref>
</sup> The latency of FVEP peaks decreases with increasing age and reaches adult levels by 1 to 2 years of age.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059411429529">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1550059411429529">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>However, these changes in the morphology and latency of FVEP waveforms are reported to demonstrate a high degree of variability, limiting its usefulness in individual clinical evaluation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1550059411429529">4</xref>
</sup> One study showed that latencies and amplitudes of FVEP in neonates were not useful in clinical evaluation,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059411429529">1</xref>
</sup> but another showed that the latency of the VEP was a useful criterion of CA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1550059411429529">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>There is no standard guideline as to how to interpret FVEP in neonates. Some authors attempted to categorize FVEPs as abnormal when waveforms were absent, abnormal, or had delayed latencies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059411429529">6</xref>

</sup> Another study classified FVEPs into typical, atypical, immature or nondetectable.<sup>

<p>Our study examines the correlation between maturation of the waveforms and CA.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>A retrospective analysis of 220 consecutive FVEPs was performed on premature and full-term infants who were delivered at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, Anaheim, California, from 1990 to 1999. The CA of the participants ranged from 28 to 52 weeks.</p>
<p>Participants were tested in the waking state as much as possible. The FVEPs were recorded by using gold cup electrodes attached with paste and tape, with impedance below 5 kΩ. A bandpass of 1 to 100 Hz was employed, with a gain of 10 K, a sweep of 1 second and automatic artifact rejection. The FVEPs were recorded from a single active electrode at Oz referenced to Fz (electrodes in International 10/20 electrode placement system). The LED goggles were held lightly over the infant’s eyes and stimuli were presented at 0.5/seconds. At least 2 averages of 64 trials each were collected with unilateral stimulation. Latency was measured at the peaks of waveforms and amplitude of waveforms was determined by measuring the vertical distance from peak to peak.</p>
<p>In the previous study, the waveform of FVEP changed at monthly intervals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059411429529">1</xref>
</sup> Therefore, FVEP participant data in our study were categorized at monthly intervals according to CA into 6 groups which were 28 to 31<sup>+</sup> weeks, 32 to 35<sup>+</sup> weeks, 36 to 39<sup>+</sup> weeks, 40 to 43<sup>+</sup> weeks, 44 to 47<sup>+ </sup>weeks, and 48 to 52 weeks (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1550059411429529">Table 1</xref>). The data were analyzed in each group and the 6 groups were compared.</p>

<p>There were 7 participants in the CA group 28 to 31<sup>+</sup> weeks, 82 in the 32  to 35<sup>+</sup> weeks, 57 in the 36 to 39<sup>+</sup> weeks, 48 in the 40 to 43<sup>+</sup> weeks, 17 in the 44 to 47<sup>+</sup>weeks, and 9 in the 48 to 52 weeks. Representative FVEP waveforms of individual participants from different CAs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1550059411429529">Figure 1</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1550059411429529">Table 1</xref>, there were 6 waveform peaks recorded in FVEPs. P represented positive peak and N negative peak, which were P1, N2, P2, N3, P3, and N4. The range of latencies and amplitudes of each peak is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1550059411429529">Table 1</xref>. There was no significant difference in waveforms between both eyes of these participants as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1550059411429529">Table 1</xref>. The percentage of waveform peaks of FVEP in each group of neonates in either eye is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1550059411429529">Table 2</xref>. On reviewing the percentage of all waveform peaks of FVEP from both eyes, P1 was not well visualized in our study (16 of 440 FVEPs or 3.6%). N2 was present in 185FVEPs or 42.1%. P2 was the only waveform present in every participant. The N3 peak was noted in 436 FVEPs or 99.1%, and P3 was seen in 393 FVEPs or 89.3%. N4 was visualized in 99 FVEPs or 22.5%. The waveforms changed from 28 weeks to 52 weeks of CA. In the age range 28 to 31<sup>+</sup> weeks of CA, N3 was well visualized, followed by P3. However, the latency of P3 showed more variation than the N3 waveform. Due to low amplitude of N2-P2 at this age, a positive peak at about 200 milliseconds (P2) was not well seen. N2-P2 amplitude increased steadily from 32 to 52 weeks of CA. The morphology of P2 became prominent starting from age range 32 to 35<sup>+</sup> weeks of CA in both, P2 latency showed less variability than N3, P3, and N4 latencies, and N2-P2 also showed less variation than P2-N3, N3-P3, and P3-N4. The triphasic waveform with clear negative-positive-negative components (N2-P2-N3) presented after 32 weeks of CA.</p>

<p>Mean P2 latencies decreased steadily with increasing age. Mean N3 latencies decreased from 28 weeks to 47<sup>+</sup> weeks of CA and increased after 48 weeks of CA. Mean P3 latencies decreased, respectively, from 28 weeks to 43<sup>+</sup> weeks of CA and then increased after 44 weeks to 52 weeks of CA. Mean amplitudes of waveforms (P2-N3 and N3-P3) were variable over most age groups. However, it was observed that the mean amplitude of N2-P2 increased steadily with CA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1550059411429529">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Physiologically, the waveforms of FVEP correlate with developmental changes in visual pathway and cortical structures. Neuronal migration in the neocortex is completed by 24 weeks of gestational age, although the cortical layers are still quite thin, with only layer V dendritic branches well developed and numerous by that time. By 28 weeks, layer III pyramidal cells are more developed with small dendritic branches, and increased development of layer V dendrites has occurred. By 30 weeks, superficial layers have developed some basal and apical dendrites, and by 35 weeks, much more widespread dendritic changes have occurred, with lateral and radial spread. The increase in actual numbers of neurons is greatest between 32 and 40 weeks.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1550059411429529">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Our study clearly showed that at CA of 28 to 31<sup>+</sup> weeks, N3 and P3 were well seen while P2 was not well visualized. N3 and P3 waveforms of FVEP were found to correlate with the completion of neuronal migration and well-developed layer III pyramidal cells and some basal and apical dendrites.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059411429529">1</xref>
</sup> This correlation can be useful in clinical evaluation. If N3 and P3 waveforms do not appear at 28 weeks of CA or later, it suggests that there is a delay in the maturation or a dysfunction of visual pathway in these newborns. However, due to a great variability of latencies and amplitudes of N3, P3, and N4, they may not be useful in clinical evaluation. A previous study confirmed that the waveform of the FVEP, rather than the peak latencies, was the most valuable tool for distinguishing between true preterm and small-for-date infants, especially in those older than 37 weeks of CA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059411429529">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>P2 is another prominent waveform that begins to appear from about 30 weeks onward as a small positive deflection just preceeding the onset of N3 at the time when basal and apical dendrites begin to develop. It becomes a more clearly defined waveform at 36 weeks of CA during widespread dendritic changes with lateral and radial spread.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059411429529">1</xref>
</sup> Our study also showed that the P2 peak component appeared consistently after 36 weeks of CA. This agreed with previous studies that from 36 weeks of gestation onward, the P2 wave was always present in neonates.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059411429529">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1550059411429529">8</xref>
</sup> In clinical evaluation, if the P2 waveform does not appear at 32 weeks of CA or later, it suggests that there is a delay in the maturation or a dysfunction of visual pathway in these neonates.</p>
<p>Our study also showed that the mean P2 latencies decreased steadily with increasing age while N2-P2 amplitude increased steadily from 32 weeks of CA to 52 weeks of CA. In addition, the standard deviations of latencies of P2 are less broad when compared to those of N3 and P3. Therefore, P2 latency and N2-P2 amplitude may be most useful in clinical evaluation in neonates.</p>
<p>We conclude that FVEP can be useful in evaluation of maturation and function of the visual pathway in neonates. FVEP is abnormal when the waveforms N3 and P3 are absent or nondetectable in neonates at 28 weeks of CA or older, and when the waveform P2 is nondetectable, or has low amplitude or prolonged latency in neonates at 36 weeks of CA or older.</p>
