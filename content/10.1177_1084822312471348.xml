<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this article is to provide health care providers with a set of core strategies to situate hope into the context of their clinical encounters with patients. This article further stresses that providers should know how to be a compassionate presence, convey dignity, and attend to the spiritual needs of the patient. If providers are to be fully present to the patient, they must prepare through reflection on their own sense of transcendence, meaning, purpose, call to service, and connectedness to others. This article represents a nontechnical approach to understand some of the dynamics in the clinical encounter in health care settings.</p>

<p>Many patients are religious, have religious beliefs and traditions related to health, and have health problems that often give rise to spiritual needs. Religious beliefs will frequently influence the kind of health care that patients wish to receive as well as what sort of care they are willing to accept, or even what they interpret as constituting care. Those beliefs affect how patients cope with illness and derive meaning and purpose when feeling bad physically or unable to do the things they used to do that give them joy and pleasure. Such beliefs help patients maintain hope in the midst of overwhelming and grave illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1084822312471348">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Religious and spiritual commitments by providers and patients shape clinical encounters because these commitments influence medical decisions, assign meaning to the experience of illness, and provide resources for coping with suffering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822312471348">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1084822312471348">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1084822312471348">4</xref></sup> In situating hope within the context of clinical encounters, providers can institute ways in which they can bring the patient’s faith and values into a proper context and help to make the clinical engagement more effective. Hope, considered in these contexts, provides us with the ability to look at each clinical encounter through a spiritual lens that gives it meaning. This implies a sense of the possible and a feeling of empowerment. Hope, therefore, “is a vital function of imagination lying at the heart of humanity.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1084822312471348">5</xref></sup> Specifically, it is the capacity to imagine otherwise, to transcend the boundaries of the present in a quest for something more, something better, than the present affords.</p>
<p>Experience has taught the authors that whether you are religious, spiritual, or an atheist, there will always be questions about illness and its companion questions regarding meaning, values, and relationships. The ultimate question always comes down to, “Why me?” These questions regarding the meaning of life, death, suffering, purpose, and afterlife are probes that are spiritual in nature. All of these questions engender a series of finite responses that lead one, at the limit, to the brink of transcendence and a quest for some sort of hope.</p>
<p>Conversations about existential and spiritual issues transform the clinical encounter and its participants, as the provider and the patient move into a nontechnical and personal domain of experience.</p>
<sec id="section1-1084822312471348">
<title>What Is Hope?</title>
<p>The <italic>Oxford English Dictionary</italic> defines hope as “expectation of something desired, a feeling of expectation and desire combined.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1084822312471348">23</xref></sup> In a review of the contextual usage of the word, hope has been identified as part of human development—a process, a theory, and a source of meaning in life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1084822312471348">6</xref></sup> Hope as a concept is simple enough to find use in everyday conversation and complex enough to interest health care providers and academic researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084822312471348">7</xref></sup> In the past 40 years, there have been three identifiable theories of hope. Stotland defined hope as “an expectation greater than zero of achieving a goal.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1084822312471348">8</xref>(p2)</sup> Averill, Catlin, and Chon defined hope as an emotion that possesses cognitive rules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1084822312471348">9</xref></sup> Snyder and colleagues defined hope as the perceived capability to derive pathways to desired goals and to motivate oneself via agency thinking to use those pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1084822312471348">10</xref></sup> Hope has also been defined by Bauckham and Hart as a vital function of imagination lying at the heart of our humanity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1084822312471348">5</xref></sup> Specifically, hope is a vital function of imagination otherwise, to transcend the boundaries of the present in a quest for something more, something better, than the present affords.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1084822312471348">5</xref>(p72)</sup></p>
<p>Within a Christian context, hope is the confident expectation of divine blessing and the beatific vision of God.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1084822312471348">11</xref></sup> If we search the <italic>New Compact Bible Dictionary</italic>, we will find that hope is a gift of the Holy Spirit that is an essential characteristic of Christian lives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1084822312471348">12</xref>(p31)</sup> Hope is not mere expectation and desire, as in the Greek literature, but it includes trust, confidence, and refuge in God, the God of hope.</p>
<p>Sacredness is a necessary companion to hope in Christian thinking, indeed in other religious traditions too. Both rest on the belief that the real significance of things is not found in the apparent, the easily perceived, but on another plane altogether. In a very real sense, if actions are not seen as being pursued in the name of something sacred, having greater significance than immediately seen, then our actions and their outcomes are limited to a sheer cause and effect process. Hope is then nothing more than rolling the dice and waiting to see if the odds come down on our side. On the purely human scale, this is in fact the limit of our control, our ability to predict results and attempt through our actions and choices to play what seem to be, within our imperfect knowledge, the best odds.</p>
<p>Along this line of thinking, one could say that ultimate hope provides a very necessary awareness of human limits. We must stay within the proper limits of our own createdness and not reach for divine mastery over all things. Christian hope lacks the prometheanism of the myth of progress, the attempt to achieve utopia. It offers instead hopes and actions appropriate and possible within the limits of this world.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1084822312471348">
<title>Hope in the Context of Other Religious Traditions</title>
<p>Although we have approached the role of hope along the lines of the Judeo-Christian tradition, there is of course no expectation that all the persons served will subscribe to, or even be particularly familiar with, that tradition. The aware practitioner will therefore try to help patients locate a path to hope within the terms they find most congenial. There are two ways in which this can be approached, and they are not by any means mutually exclusive and can, if skillfully used, reinforce each other.</p>
<p>First, if possible the practitioner should be aware of the general differences in perception that are implied by different religious and spiritual traditions. In fact, even clients who reject all of these traditions may draw on them in various ways of which they may be unaware, because beliefs about the divine or ultimate truths permeate cultures to the extent that people who disbelieve or just ignore the tenets of the faiths practiced around them have incorporated attitudes and perceptive habits from them without being consciously aware of, or even sympathetic to, their origins. Thus, general notions of sacredness and sources of hope can be discussed without specific reference to the underlying belief systems that may differ from the distinct beliefs of either patient or practitioner.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one can think of religious traditions as divided into two broad categories. Those most familiar in the West are known as revealed religions, basing their claims on the belief that God made a personal revelation of Himself at some definite time in the historical past and intends to end the world at an unknown point in the future. Thus, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all see time as being linear, with time beginning as the world was created. Virtually all other religions see time as circular, with everything happening at a specific point on an eternal circle of time. The earth always existed and always will, or at least until all have achieved something, such as enlightenment or understanding of the true nature of the world, thus being able to get off the circle into a place of perfect contentment. Although there are countless variations on both these themes, it is helpful for the practitioner who is trying to help a patient make contact with hope to have at least a general understanding of what the patient may be hoping for, and how he or she understands the concept.</p>
<p>Even if the practitioner is not familiar with particular beliefs held by patients, he or she should recognize that despite profound differences, many commonalities and parallels exist. With only a general understanding of other faith traditions, the practitioner can still engage patients from perspectives other than his or her own by questioning patients about beliefs and expectations of the ultimate future and locate the sense of, and desire for, hope in that context. It is entirely possible to create the sense of engagement with these issues in discussion of the differences and parallels that both can find in their different perspectives as long as the practitioner remembers that the point is to find the place where those of other beliefs or no set beliefs at all can locate their own area of sacredness that will guide them toward a sustaining and ennobling hope.</p>
<p>So, to be well versed in comparative religious thought is helpful, but general understanding of the possible patterns of spiritual thought and experience can be very helpful even when extensive knowledge is not available. Either way, to be willing to sensitively engage the patient on this level, can facilitate a way to help the patient to make contact with ‘hope’ in their own way, in terms they can accept and experience on an emotional level.</p>

<sec id="section3-1084822312471348">
<title>False Hope</title>
<p>False hope is destructive on several levels. It creates an unreal world and then invites the patient to live there, which is merely substituting illusion for the chance to experience hope. Practitioners may feel they are doing some kind of good deed, but the more common motive is to avoid feeling pain and disappointment of their own. Not only will the truth eventually have to surface, but the time lost cannot be regained. Such time can be precious in terms of thinking about what is really important to do with the rest of one’s life, when one knows that time is short. It can be used to prepare for the end of life, to connect loose ends, or to clean up messes that we inevitably leave behind. Most of all, it is an opportunity to try reconciling with things and people, knowing there will not be another chance. Hope and sacredness imply that all of life is valuable, and the last days and hours of it are far too valuable to be squandered entertaining unfounded beliefs and false hope.</p>

<sec id="section4-1084822312471348">
<title>Hope’s Purpose</title>
<p>In this article, we use the terms <italic>hope</italic> and <italic>sacredness</italic> to refer especially to health care providers’ collective sense of being involved in that “something higher,” deeper, and genuine that gives purpose and meaning to their work daily and that inspires them to communicate the same sense to patients in the clinical encounter. If such hope and sacredness has been lost in society in general, it would not be surprising that it should be lost in the clinical encounter as well; if both are true, we could expect that healing the health care profession would, in the process, make a substantial contribution to healing our sorely stressed society. In an age when ever-increasing demands are made on health care resources, and much of cost containment is obtained by increasing the burden of providers, some greater sense of purpose that can be communicated to patients may reflect back to sustain the provider’s own feeling of being involved in a sacred endeavor.</p>
<p>Hope in the clinical encounter is the prime determinant that connects and reconnects self with the Divine or Holy. Each clinical encounter involves a conscious effort to institute and reach the point where actions are reflective of the preservation of humanity. Hope, therefore, can be perceived as the flower bud of the human community. Hope provides patients and health care providers with a window to view the universe of humanity as part of our past, present, and future—and all at the same time. Hope provides the participants in the clinical encounter the opportunity to view the universe of higher being, no matter which lens they are looking through.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1084822312471348">
<title>The Clinical Encounter</title>
<p>Within the health care field, one of the most misunderstood paradigms is the clinical encounter. The clinical encounter is the epicenter and the most important dynamic that determines which course the patient’s health can take. Pellegrino argues that the clinical encounter is special. It is not a chance meeting of individuals—one proffering a service and the other seeking one. It is an encounter structured by the fact of illness and so comes replete with meanings and moral obligations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1084822312471348">13</xref></sup> The person comes to the encounter as a person in need, as a vulnerable individual, possibly one whose very existence is at stake.</p>
<p>Achieving effective encounters with patients is the core responsibility of the health care setting. These encounters are necessarily face-to-face interactions that allow health care providers to effectively engage in ascertaining a sense of sacredness that can assist in obtaining a more holistic assessment of the patient’s being. Illness can trigger profound existential questions for the patient and family, as well as for health care professionals. Whether directly asked or not, questions about why people suffer, die, or have to deal with unbearable stress are often at the heart of the clinical encounter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1084822312471348">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patients generally come to these encounters with a developed spiritual or religious sense that may cause them to experience the health care system as hostile, or at least insensitive, to the sacredness of life. Whether or not they have a developed religious sense, many patients generally present with a sense of spiritual emptiness or a lack of hope that is needed in moments when the patient is confronted by a major loss or grave terminal disease. In these cases, if health care providers and professionals are truly to offer a return to health or well-being to their patients, they must institute hope into the context of the clinical encounter. They must be intentional in developing an appropriate concept and language constructs for discussing hope and sacredness in the clinical encounter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1084822312471348">15</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1084822312471348">
<title>Promoting Messages of Hope</title>
<p>The process and direction of situating hope into the clinical encounter must be explicit and intentional about shaping messages that will instill the attribute of hope. These messages must be both ethical and theological in nature and their content must also embrace the integration of the historical, cultural, and spiritual constructs of the patient’s roots and “spiritual storage bin.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1084822312471348">16</xref></sup> When we refer to one’s spiritual storage bin, we are referring to the <italic>soul</italic>—the deep, sacred part of their being. It is there that patients find sacredness in their lives. It is there that they nourish their relationship or lack of a relationship with a spiritual transcendent being, or perhaps experience a vague sense of lacking such a relationship.</p>
<p>To situate these messages into the context of the clinical encounter, the provider must understand which core communication strategies to deploy, as described by the following. The <italic>first step</italic> that a health care provider must take is to recognize how he or she communicates within the context of the clinical encounter. Pointedly, providers must understand what their purpose is and what they hope to accomplish, thus how they intend to convey the most appropriate messages within the confines of Medicaid and Medicare restrictions. An unspoken restriction that we are speaking about is the “10 to 12 minute” clinical encounter rule, which states that a provider’s rate of reimbursement is tied into the ability to complete the clinical encounter within a specific timeframe. This puts pressure on the provider to engage, question, analyze, and make a determination on the patient’s presenting information. If providers lack the requisite communication skills, they will be out in the woods without a compass to guide them. When this happens, the clinician has become “lost” without a way back home, unable to determine or help focus the patient’s purpose for the encounter, or see how the encounter may need to be reframed.</p>
<p>Within the restrictive nature of the clinical encounter, full and accurate communication is difficult even in the best of conditions. Along with the time pressure and the sheer volume of encounters faced by practitioners, the cross-cultural nature of so many clinical encounters means that communication has never been so complicated. This means that learning how to hear a message and learning how to make it hearable may be as important today as it ever has been in the history of health care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1084822312471348">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The <italic>second step</italic> that a health care provider must take is to recognize that he or she must develop a trusting and therapeutic relationship. Trust has traditionally been considered the cornerstone and foundation of clinical encounters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1084822312471348">17</xref></sup> The need for interpersonal trust relates to the vulnerability associated with being ill, the information asymmetries arising from the specialist nature of medical knowledge, and the uncertainty and element of risk regarding the competence and intentions of the practitioner on whom the patient is dependent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1084822312471348">18</xref></sup> The first task for the provider is to establish his or her own <italic>bona fides</italic>—who are you that the patient should listen to you, or grant your input greater credence than what the patient may have gotten from other sources or his or her culture or fears? If this cannot be accomplished, trust will likely never crystallize, and without trust, patients may not access medical services at all. If patients’ experience of the encounter cannot overcome their fear and mistrust, they may withhold medically relevant information, whether deliberately or inadvertently. Trust is a basic human feeling that not only shapes our view of the world of health care but also helps us make sense of an emotionally difficult, possibly threatening process and gives us a framework for our actions, behavior, and decisions. It allows us to enter into that most human of all relationships, the exchange relationship. If the provider is giving a sense of hope and confidence, the patient becomes more willing to respond by willingly and cooperatively giving back that most personal of commodities—real information about what is truly going on. It must also be understood that this relationship has to be forged in the context of betrayal, because the patient’s most intimate self—the body and mind—is turning on him or her, failing the patient in dramatic and usually painful ways. Thus, the manner in which information is shared becomes the bedrock of this nascent exchange relationship. That patients can give out information that is then returned to them, transmitted into an explanation they can really hear, forms the basis of the trusting encounter, itself the anchor of hope.</p>
<p>Trust will continue to be an elusive element within the context of the clinical encounter until providers make a paradigm shift in their thinking regarding the way they relate to their patients. Without instilling trust into the context of clinical encounters, there can be no mutuality and there can be no hope.</p>
<p>The <italic>third step</italic> that health care providers must take is to recognize that their patients who are suffering chronic illnesses or end-of-life decisions do not suffer abstractly. Victor Frankl noted that “to live is to suffer, to survive is to find meaning in the suffering.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1084822312471348">19</xref></sup> The critical meaning for the health care provider is to help the patient interpret the question not of suffering but of loving again. <italic>It becomes the patient’s hope!</italic></p>
<p>The provider’s messages of hope must be intentional because the message of hope for many poses a very significant challenge to uncover things that they have buried and don’t wish to unearth. It challenges them to look at the intimate elements of their spiritual selves because it is only here that one can be healed or made whole again. Finding the first threads of hope must start with the patient because it is an internal job, not an outside job. One must explore the innermost caverns of the self, the spirit, and the soul. Many patients don’t want to be explorers because it means exploring what many of us have placed into our storage bins—years of hurt, disappointments, and our most intimate secrets. In many cases, patients are faced with the possibility of having a shorter life expectancy. Honest exploration may challenge fragile senses of identity by forcing a confrontation with the gap between who a person has actually been and the identity that he or she has complacently accepted for years. Am I the <italic>noumenal</italic> me I think of as really a good person, or that disconnected <italic>phenomenal</italic> me who has done so many wrong and foolish things in life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1084822312471348">20</xref></sup> Patients do not want to replay these old tapes of their lives again. Doing so reminds them of the negative aspects of their lives and of the disconnectedness from spirituality, family, loved ones, and most important, themselves. It challenges a more convenient, if distorted, sense of self that has made it possible to live as they have for so long, and that is a very painful and threatening thing to have to give up.</p>
<p>Health care providers must have some prior knowledge of what is contained in their patients’ spiritual storage bins if they are going to be intentional in providing appropriate messages of hope. All of one’s hope is based in this storage bin called a soul, the deep, sacred part of one’s being. It is here that they find spirituality, and it is here that they find hope.</p>
<p>The <italic>fourth step</italic> that health care providers must take is to recognize that a majority of their patients believe in a “spiritual being,” whoever that may be. This being so, what role does the patient’s spiritual beliefs play in the context of the clinical encounter? This must be investigated by the provider because spirituality is a complex and multidimensional set of elements that constitute the cognitive, experiential, and behavioral functioning of human beings. Providers need to investigate these elements using the following parameters and include the following definitions: (1) that the cognitive or philosophic aspects include the search for meaning, purpose, and truth in life and that these inform the beliefs and values by which an individual lives; (2) the experiential or emotional aspects involve feelings of hope, love, connection, inner peace, comfort, and support. These are reflected in the quality of patients’ inner resources, the ability to give and receive spiritual love, and the type of relationships and connections that exist with self, their community, their environment and nature, and the transcendent, and (3) the behavioral aspects involve the way patients externally manifest their individual spiritual beliefs and their inner spiritual state. In sum, understanding the patient’s spirituality involves the way he or she externally manifests his or her individual beliefs and inner spiritual state.</p>
<p>When providers understand the patient’s spiritual state, they are in a better position to understand how they can present messages of hope in the gravest of times in the context of the clinical encounter.</p>
<p>The <italic>fifth step</italic> that health care providers must take is to consider the use of prayer within the context of clinical encounters. The provider should determine if it is acceptable to the patient, and if not, the provider can pray privately for the patient’s well-being. Many physicians are accustomed to fielding many challenging questions from their patients, but there is one query that they find especially flummoxing, considering the delicate terrain it requires them to traverse. The question, “Doctor, will you pray with me?” In today’s health care landscape, this is not a far-fetched scenario. About two-thirds of patients believe that doctors should know about their spiritual beliefs, said a survey of nearly 500 adults from Florida, North Carolina, and Vermont.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1084822312471348">21</xref></sup> This multicenter survey of outpatients found that in the setting of dying, 70% of patients would welcome physician inquiry into their religious beliefs, 55% would appreciate silent prayer, and 50% believe that their physician should pray with them.</p>
<p>Prayer may well be the primordial human language. Patients at many times are caught in a situation of fundamental insecurity, aware of the disjunction between what is and what might be. With a cry of anguish or of joy, a cry of terror or the silent search for, or affirmation of, whatever can help in living with the insecurity of human existence, the patient seeks hope in the situation. Hope requires the ability to live in a future that seems in some way real in the present, and that is the strength that is prayed for.</p>
<p>Providers must bear in mind that true prayer within the context of the clinical encounter involves the articulation of that which is deepest in human life, often at an unconscious or nonverbal level. Prayer is what distinguishes living religion from a purely intellectual view of the world and from philosophical interpretations of human nature and destiny. Prayer presupposes a responsiveness in that which transcends the human.</p>
<p>The <italic>final step</italic> for providers to recognize is that they must understand their own personal limitations regarding their communication skills, their faith beliefs, their cultural competency issues, and what they really stand for. Is the provider a person who has lived his or her life as manifested in the Hippocratic Oath, or as governed by obtaining a higher income and marginalizing the patient as a result?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1084822312471348">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The therapeutic value of conveying hope in clinical encounters, especially when situations may appear grave or hopeless, should not be underestimated. Particularly in the context of terminal illnesses and end-of-life care, hope should not be discouraged. There continues to be a question that providers are challenged by: “How deeply do you recognize your own human spiritual dimensions and allow them to be in dialogue with your scientific perspectives on health and illness?” Providers must take a step back before each clinical encounter and reflect on what lies in their spiritual storage bin and make a determination of how it will affect the needs of their patients relative to their desire to have hope in their lives.</p>
