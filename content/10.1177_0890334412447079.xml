<title>Background:</title>
<p>The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) is the most widely promoted program for increasing breastfeeding rates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0890334412447079">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>To evaluate the impact of BFHI training on hospital practices and breastfeeding rates during the first 12 months of life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0890334412447079">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Eighty percent of maternity medical and nursing staff at the University Hospital in Split, Croatia, completed the updated and expanded United Nations Children’s Fund/World Health Organization 20-hour course. Seven hundred seventy-three mothers (388 in the pre- and 385 in the post-training group) were included in a birth cohort and interviewed at discharge and at 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum to evaluate hospital practices and infant feeding. Six out of 10 Baby-Friendly practices were assessed using standard BFHI forms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0890334412447079">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Three months after training was completed, 3 of the Baby-Friendly practices assessed (Step 4, “Initiate breastfeeding within a half-hour of birth”; Step 7, “Rooming-in”; and Step 8, “Feeding on demand”) had significantly improved. The proportion of newborns exclusively breastfed during the first 48 hours increased from 6.0% to 11.7% (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .005). There was no difference in breastfeeding rates at discharge or at 3, 6, or 12 months between the pre- and post-training groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0890334412447079">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Training of health professionals, based on the BFHI, was associated with significant improvement in some Baby-Friendly hospital practices and initial exclusive breastfeeding rates. A high rate of in-hospital supplementation may partly explain the lack of improvement in breastfeeding exclusivity and duration after discharge. Strong institutional support and commitment is needed to enable full implementation of recommended Baby-Friendly practices.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Evidence is mounting on the detrimental effect of not breastfeeding on infant and maternal health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412447079">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334412447079"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412447079">3</xref></sup> Associated health care costs have prompted governments to give precedence to breastfeeding promotional activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334412447079">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334412447079">5</xref></sup> One of the most widely promoted international programs for increasing breastfeeding rates is the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334412447079">6</xref></sup> The initiative was introduced by the United Nations Children’s Fund/World Health Organization (UNICEF/WHO) in 1991, and more than 21,000 health care facilities in over 152 countries have achieved Baby-Friendly certification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334412447079">7</xref></sup> The BFHI is based on the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334412447079">8</xref></sup> and the training of all maternity health care staff on practices and policies conducive to breastfeeding (Step 2), including the adoption and implementation of the International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes (Code),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334412447079">9</xref></sup> is the cornerstone of the program.</p>
<p>Croatia adopted the BFHI in 1993, and by 1999, 15 out of 34 maternity facilities were “Baby-Friendly.” Nationwide introduction of hospital discharge packs in 1998, which violated the Code, resulted in a deterioration of hospital standards. Consequently, none of the Baby-Friendly facilities renewed their status, and the Initiative came to a standstill. In 2006, with the support of UNICEF, the BFHI was reintroduced after formation of a National Breastfeeding Committee (NBC). Lobbying of the Ministry of Health by the NBC led to the issuing of a recommendation by the minister, in 2007, for the withdrawal of the discharge packs from all maternity facilities in Croatia. Implementation of the BFHI provided us with the opportunity to study health professionals’ breastfeeding knowledge, attitudes, and individual practices, as well as hospital practices and breastfeeding rates, before and after training of hospital maternity staff.</p>
<p>In our previous paper, we found that knowledge and case-based practices improved significantly among staff of 5 maternity facilities in southern Croatia 3 months after completion of the UNICEF/WHO 20-hour course.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334412447079">10</xref></sup> The proportion of health professionals who recognized hospital practices that support breastfeeding nearly doubled after training (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The number of staff with positive attitudes toward breastfeeding, based on the validated Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale, increased from 65% to 79%, whereas the number of staff with neutral attitudes dropped from 26.6% to 9.9% (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>The goal of this study was to determine whether the documented significant improvement in health professionals’ breastfeeding knowledge, attitudes, and case-based practices translated into a higher prevalence of Baby-Friendly hospital practices and better breastfeeding rates. We hypothesized that, in comparison with the situation immediately prior to staff training, implementation of the UNICEF/WHO 20-hour course would increase compliance with Baby-Friendly practices and exclusivity and duration of breastfeeding.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section10-0890334412447079">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>We followed mother/infant pairs over a 12-month period both before and after training of maternity staff. The first cohort of mothers was recruited from February to May 2008, and the second group between April and August 2009. Both groups consisted of mothers who had delivered during the given time periods. The same sampling and data collection methods were used for both groups. Approval to conduct this study was received from the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Split. Informed, written consent was obtained from study participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0890334412447079">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>The study was conducted at the University Hospital in Split, and mother/infant pairs were recruited from the postnatal ward of the maternity unit. The hospital is a tertiary referral center that provides services for the region of Dalmatia and parts of bordering Bosnia and Herzegovina, accounting for approximately 1 million people. Its unit for obstetrics, gynecology, and human reproduction was, at the time of this study, a 159-bed ward, of which 88 were postpartum beds. A total of 4468 deliveries were performed in 2008, with a perinatal mortality rate of 5.9/1000. On average, women remained in the hospital for 3 days following a normal vaginal delivery and for 6 days after a cesarean section.</p>
<p>Following birth, newborns were separated from their mothers and placed in an observation room until they were seen by a pediatrician (usually within several hours after birth), after which they were transferred to a semi-glass-walled room located between mother’s rooms. Here, newborns were cared for by nursing staff and fed according to a 3-hour schedule, either by their mothers, if awake and willing, or alternatively, by the nurses, in which case formula was given by bottle. Although placing infants into the semi-glass-walled room was standard of care, mothers were allowed to keep their babies with them throughout their stay if they requested to do so.</p>
<p>Hospital infant feeding data were collected using new “every-feed observations,” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334412447079">11</xref></sup> introduced for the purpose of the research project, in which nursing staff were requested to record everything the newborn received. In return for their assistance, the heads of the maternity unit were offered summary feedback from the study, enabling them to assess compliance with Baby-Friendly practices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0890334412447079">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants in the study were a consecutive sample of women located on the postnatal ward during study visiting times (Monday, Wednesday, Friday 1:30-4:30 PM) who had given birth to a healthy, term infant that weighed ≥ 2500 g. Since our aim was to interview mothers who had spent some time on the ward with their babies, mothers who had given birth in the previous 24 hours or whose infants had to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit/special care ward were excluded, as were mothers who had given birth to multiples. To minimize selection bias, mothers were approached from opposite ends of the ward on each study day. That is, on Monday we started recruiting all mothers from one end of the ward and on Wednesday we started from the other end of the ward; by doing so mothers were recruited from the whole ward, regardless of placement. Mothers were interviewed by the main researcher and medical students who had been previously trained in the study protocol.</p>
<p>After discharge, we contacted mothers by telephone around 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum, or up to the time that they discontinued breastfeeding. We used a structured questionnaire to obtain information about the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding, based on 24-hour recall. In order to reduce bias, we avoided asking about EBF directly, by collecting data on other food/fluids given. Up to 10 phone calls per mother were made. Invalid phone numbers were checked against contact details recorded in the patient’s medical records. Breastfeeding definitions recommended by the WHO were used to determine infant feeding practices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0890334412447079">12</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0890334412447079">
<title>Data Sources</title>
<p>Adherence to recommended hospital practices was assessed using the Questionnaire for Monitoring Baby-Friendly Hospitals,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334412447079">13</xref></sup> in which the mother is asked about her breastfeeding experience, based on Steps 3-10 of the BFHI, and compliance with the International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334412447079">9</xref></sup> The extent of implementation of a given step was obtained by calculating the percentage of compliant answers. Data were collected for 7 of the 8 steps covered in the questionnaire. Data for Step 10 could not be obtained because mothers were interviewed prior to discharge, and hence they had not yet received potential advice from staff about how or where to get help if upon returning home they had difficulties with breastfeeding. Of the 7 steps assessed, Step 3 (antenatal education) was exempt from the final analysis, since the hospital does not have an antenatal clinic, that is, women are seen throughout pregnancy by independent primary care obstetricians. Although Step 7 (24-hour rooming-in) could not be properly assessed, because babies were routinely separated from their mothers for several hours following birth, we included this step in the final analysis by comparing groups after the initial separation period. In total, 6 steps (Steps 4-9) were amenable to change and able to be assessed.</p>
<p>Additional information on place of residence, age, marital status, level of education, number of children, previous breastfeeding experience, smoking status, employment status, planned duration of maternity leave, and family income was collected. We added a question about antenatal course attendance, whether newborns had suckled during initial skin-to-skin contact and, if not, the timing of the first breastfeed. To improve the questionnaire and data collection process, we performed and analyzed a pilot project on 30 mother-infant pairs prior to study initiation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0890334412447079">
<title>Intervention</title>
<p>The 2006 UNICEF/WHO 20-hour course for maternity staff was the intervention studied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0890334412447079">14</xref></sup> The course consisted of 15.5 hours of theory and 4.5 hours of practice relating to breastfeeding promotion and support. “Training of trainers” was organized in Zagreb by the national BFHI team, in November 2007, and consisted of a 2-day training session covering all components of the 20-hour course. Attendees, including representatives from every maternity facility in Croatia, were provided with standard course materials including guidelines for course facilitators, outlines for course sessions, and PowerPoint slides for the course, and they were encouraged to form BFHI teams at their respective hospitals, complete the BFHI self-appraisal form, and conduct the 20-hour course.</p>
<p>Course facilitators at the only maternity hospital in Split were perinatal clinicians, including a neonatologist; a gynecologist; a pediatrician; a general practitioner who is also a board-certified lactation consultant, midwife, and community nurse; an economist/representative of a voluntary parenting group; and a psychologist. Step 2 of the <italic>Global Criteria</italic> requires that at least 80% of clinical staff members who have contact with mothers and/or infants and have been on the staff 6 months or more receive at least 20 hours of targeted training. Hence, the UNICEF/WHO 20-hour course was conducted twice, in May 2008 and February 2009, in order to reach at least 80%, of a total of 271 staff members from all shifts. A description of the attending staff’s characteristics has been published elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334412447079">10</xref></sup>; in brief, the majority were midwives, followed by nurses, pediatricians, and gynecologists, aged between 36-50. Eighty percent of the staff had children, of whom the majority were breastfed. Training (free of charge) was provided in a lecture theatre that was able to accommodate approximately 100 people, and attending staff members were required to sign in. Difficulty in implementing change was anticipated because of the maternity hospital’s case load and outdated practices, and so the training of staff was preceded by the UNICEF/WHO “Course for Decision Makers,”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334412447079">15</xref></sup> a 1-day information session for the hospital’s directors, administrators, heads of departments, and policy makers, to gain their commitment toward promoting and supporting the BFHI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0890334412447079">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Factors considered potential confounders in regard to the exclusivity and duration of breastfeeding were sociodemographic data, number of antenatal visits, mode of delivery, birth weight, maternal and neonatal health problems, and household income.</p>
<p>With a projected 20% loss to follow-up, we required 330 mother and baby pairs to detect a difference of 10% in EBF at hospital discharge, with an α level of 5% and power 90%. The data were entered into preset EpiData record files (The Epidata Association, Odense, Denmark) and analyzed by SPSS (version 14, SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL, April 30, 2006). Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used to detect differences between pre- and post- training groups of mother-infant pairs. A logistic regression model was built to control unbalanced variables between pre- and post-intervention groups. The dependent variable considered was exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) at 48 hours. Independent variables were tested in the model if the <italic>P</italic> value at bivariate analysis was less than .05.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>According to the list of signed-in staff, at least 80% of the total number of medical and nursing staff completed the required 20-hour BFHI training course.</p>
<p>In the pre-intervention phase: 79.9% of women who gave birth were assessed for eligibility; 94.2% of the eligible mothers were recruited. At 3, 6, and 12 months, loss to follow up was 7.5%, 2.2%, and 5.0%, respectively. In the post-intervention phase, follow-up rates were similar to the pre-training group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0890334412447079">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>There were no significant differences between the samples for most of the characteristics studied (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0890334412447079">Table 1</xref>). A larger proportion of mothers in the post-training group were 35 or older and tended to visit their primary care obstetrician less often during pregnancy. The infants in the 2 cohorts were also very similar to each other with respect to sex, birth weight, mode of delivery, and general health. At the time of the interview, 59 neonates had jaundice, 1 had been diagnosed with a heart murmur, and 1 had a renal cyst, but none required admission to the special care nursery. Although 7% of mothers in both groups stated that they had a medical condition, none reported illnesses incompatible with breastfeeding.</p>

<p><italic>Step 4</italic> (“Help mothers initiate breastfeeding within a half-hour of birth”) was the best supported Baby-Friendly practice, both before and after training, with 93.8% of mothers pre- and 90.1% of mothers post-training receiving their baby within 5 minutes of birth, leaving minimal room for improvement. The BFHI further specifies that newborns should be placed in skin-to-skin contact with their mothers, immediately following birth, for at least an hour. No improvement was found in the proportion of babies placed in skin-to-skin contact, though it was already being practiced at an acceptable level of 77.1% pre- and 75.7% post-training, but a significant increase was noted in the duration of early contact; the number of mothers holding their babies for at least an hour following delivery was 4-fold higher in the post-intervention group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .03)</p>
<p>Both before and after staff training, 70.3% and 69% of mothers, respectively, received assistance from staff with breastfeeding prior to discharge. Similarly, no improvement was seen in the number of mothers shown how to maintain lactation, if separated from their infant (Step 5), remaining at a low 44.8% post-training (44.1% pre-training).</p>
<p>Step 6, “Give newborn infants no food or drink other than breast milk, unless medically indicated,” remained the most poorly implemented step. Eighty-one percent of mothers in 2008 and 79.4% in 2009 stated that their baby was given something other than breast milk since birth. Of these mothers, just over half, in both groups, stated that they were not informed of the need for supplementation before it was given.</p>
<p>Although the policy on separation of mother/infant pairs did not change during the study period, the proportion of mothers who stated that their baby was with them both day and night (Step 7) increased significantly 3 months after training (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Significant improvement following training was also seen in the advice given by staff to mothers in regard to the recommended frequency and duration of breastfeeding, with 21.1% of mothers before and 29.3% after training stating they were told to breastfeed their infant “on demand” (Step 8; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .009).</p>
<p>Pacifiers were not used by staff at the maternity unit, either before or after training, but babies were routinely supplemented by bottle, contrary to Step 9 (“Give no artificial teats or pacifiers to breastfeeding infants”). None of the mothers, in either cohort, stated that they had been given any leaflets or supplies that promote breast milk substitutes (results not shown).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0890334412447079">
<title>Breastfeeding Rates</title>
<p>The proportion of newborns exclusively breastfed during the first 48 hours in the hospital improved significantly post-training, increasing from 6% to 12% (p&lt;0.005). Unfortunately, this effect did not persist (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0890334412447079">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The proportion of mothers who initiated breastfeeding in the hospital was 387/388 (99.7%) in the pre-training group and 378/385 (98.2%) in the post-training group (<italic>P</italic> = .04, Fisher exact test). A logistic regression model was built to analyze whether maternal age and number of antenatal visits was associated with EBF at 48 hours. The model also included as an independent variable group designation (pre- and post-intervention). The only significant variable was the group designation (post vs pre: odds ratio = 1.94, 95% confidence interval = 1.14-3.29). There was no difference in breastfeeding rates at 3, 6, or 12 months between the pre- and post-training groups. At 3 months, 34.6% and 40.5% of mothers in the pre- and post- training group were EBF their babies. This dropped to 9.3% and 14.2% at 6 months, a time when most mothers introduce solids (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0890334412447079">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>One-third and just over one-half of women in both groups had stopped breastfeeding by 3 and 6 months, respectively, despite 61.9% (pre-training) and 67.9% (post-training) of women planning to stay home for a full 12 months on paid maternity leave. At 12 months, only 20.6% of mothers in 2008 and 24.2% of mothers in 2009 were breastfeeding. The most common reasons cited by both groups for weaning included: not enough milk, baby was not gaining weight, new pregnancy, breast infection, and taking medication.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study suggests that breastfeeding training alone is insufficient to bring about significant overall change in the University Hospital of Split’s routines or in breastfeeding rates post-discharge, despite the improvement in staff’s knowledge, attitudes, and case-based practices pertaining to breastfeeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334412447079">10</xref></sup> This finding is contrary to that of Cattaneo and Buzzetti’s study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334412447079">16</xref></sup> in which the investigators described the effect of the 18-hour UNICEF course, augmented by 2 hours of additional counseling skills, on 8 maternity hospitals in Italy. All hospitals improved compliance with the <italic>Ten Steps</italic> and significant differences were found in EBF at discharge, full breastfeeding at 3 months and any breastfeeding at 6 months. In the Italian study, hospitals had a strong breastfeeding policy and emphasis was placed during training on practical sessions and counseling skills, which could partly explain the differing results; the hospital in Split did not have an endorsed breastfeeding policy, and training was largely didactic in style, with practical sessions attended primarily by junior nursing staff. Interventions using a combined interactive and didactic educational format have greater effect than those using a predominantly didactic format.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0890334412447079">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0890334412447079">18</xref></sup> Minimal interaction was further compounded by the large training group size. Small groups of only 10 health professionals were thought to have contributed to the success of a 3-day training program in France, which improved maternity ward practices and the rate of EBF at discharge (pre, 15.8% vs post, 35.2%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334412447079">19</xref></sup> In the same study, mothers in the post-training group showed a significant increase in the duration of breastfeeding, from 13 to 16 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334412447079">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite significant improvement in some Baby-Friendly practices, the level of implementation of most recommended maternity ward practices remained unacceptably low in our facility. This minimal practice change does not reflect lack of individual competency. Implementation of a step requires more than staff competency; it requires adequate staffing, structure, policy, routines, managerial support, interdisciplinary care, and patient-centered care. Health practitioners are affected by organizational constraints on their ability to provide effective breastfeeding support, such as the 3-hour feeding schedule in Split. We expected the course for decision makers to have had more of an impact on staff support and practices, which would have allowed other changes to happen. For this effect to occur, it seems that true commitment is necessary.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have shown an association between the rate of supplementation in hospital and breastfeeding rates post-discharge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334412447079">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334412447079">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0890334412447079">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0890334412447079"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0890334412447079">23</xref></sup> The large proportion of newborns in our study that were still supplemented post-training may partly explain the lack of improvement in breastfeeding exclusivity and duration after discharge.</p>
<p>A clear dose-response relationship has been found between the number of implemented <italic>Ten Steps</italic> and the duration of breastfeeding; mothers in the United States who experience none of the Ten Steps are 13 times more likely to stop breastfeeding early, in comparison with mothers who experience 6 Baby-Friendly practices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0890334412447079">22</xref></sup> Since the majority (&gt; 50%) of mothers in the post-training group experienced only 2 <italic>Steps</italic> in our facility (Step 4, early contact; and Step 5, assistance with breastfeeding), it is unrealistic to expect a significant improvement in any breastfeeding rates post-discharge.</p>
<p>This study had several methodological limitations. The impossibility of interviewing all eligible mothers who delivered during the study period and the absence of randomization are associated with a risk of bias in participant selection and outcome measurement. We attempted to minimize the former by approaching women in a consecutive order from different ends of the ward on alternate interviewing days, thereby increasing the chance of all women being included in the study. The negligible number of women who refused study participation and the similarity in sociodemographic characteristics between the 2 groups suggests that our sample of mother-baby pairs is representative of the population giving birth in Split at the time. To avoid the risk of bias in outcome measurements, we used standardized forms and procedures for data collection before and after the intervention. Mothers were primarily interviewed by medical students, who were not associated with the mothers’ care and who had undergone training in interviewing skills during the pilot phase. In addition, withdrawals from the study were accounted for, all outcomes were reported, and loss to follow-up was minimal.</p>
<p>Uncontrolled before-after study designs are often criticized for being unable to show differences between secular changes and changes resulting from the intervention. It is impossible to say with any certainty that the results of our study were not influenced by other confounding variables or historic events taking place at the same time. The intervention was part of a nationwide, 5-year (2006-2011) BFHI campaign, which included the production and distribution of posters, leaflets, a DVD, and other materials intended for the public on breastfeeding. The minimal improvement in hospital practices and no change in breastfeeding rates post- discharge suggest that the intervention was independent of the public campaign. The setting for the study, a teaching hospital in a transitional country with outdated maternal and child health practices, limits the generalizability of the findings; however, the use of a standardized teaching tool and assessment forms allows some transferability to other settings. Another limitation is the short time interval between the training and the post-intervention collection of data. A longer period may be required for changes in maternity practices to be implemented and for these to have an influence on breastfeeding rates. At the same time, several strengths make this study unique: it is the first study to report the use of the official UNICEF/WHO Questionnaire for Monitoring Baby-Friendly Hospitals; it is the first study to assess the effects of the revised, updated, and expanded UNICEF/WHO 20-hour breastfeeding course on maternity staff; a relatively large, representative sample of mothers was studied prospectively; outcome measures were recorded for several time points; and attrition rates were very low.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Training of health professionals, based on the BFHI, was associated with a significant improvement in some Baby-Friendly hospital practices and initial exclusive breastfeeding rates. A high rate of in-hospital supplementation may partly explain the lack of improvement in breastfeeding exclusivity and duration after discharge. Institutional support and commitment is needed to enable full implementation of recommended Baby-Friendly practices. Future research may need to allow more time, following training, for changes to occur.</p>
