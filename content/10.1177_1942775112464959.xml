<abstract>
<p>According to Daresh, collaboration between veteran and new or aspiring leaders can promote an environment that is conducive to high levels of student achievement. This study sought to understand the mentoring relationship between veteran school leaders and aspiring leaders within a district that is in Year 2 of a School Leadership Program grant. Results focused on two main themes: (a) accountability time pressures and (b) development and sustainability of the mentor/mentee relationship. Implications for school district leadership and university leadership preparation programs are discussed.</p>

<p>In educational settings, mentoring relationships play an important role in the leadership development of aspiring school leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1942775112464959">Browne-Ferrigno &amp; Muth, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1942775112464959">Crow &amp; Matthews, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1942775112464959">Daresh, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1942775112464959">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942775112464959">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1942775112464959">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1942775112464959">Ehrich, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1942775112464959">Ehrich, Hansford, &amp; Tennent, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1942775112464959">Gardner, Enomoto, &amp; Grogan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1942775112464959">Mertz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1942775112464959">Playko, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1942775112464959">Ryder, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1942775112464959">Winn, 1993</xref>). Mentoring benefits are significant for both mentees and mentors, including the opportunity to share, reflect, and participate in mutual professional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1942775112464959">Ehrich et al., 2004</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1942775112464959">Daresh (2004)</xref>, collaboration between veteran and new or aspiring leaders can promote an environment that is conducive to high levels of student achievement. However, to date, little research has been conducted on the challenges faced by small, rural schools in sustaining a mentoring network for new leaders while under intense state scrutiny due to accountability pressures. This study sought to better understand the phenomenon of the mentoring relationship between veteran and aspiring leaders within one rural school district. Specifically, we addressed the following research question: What are the perception<bold>s</bold> of mentors and mentees about the mentoring relationship, inclusive of its purpose, implementation, challenges, and benefits?</p>
<p>The study was conducted in a rural school district in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. A long-standing partnership between this district and a nearby university has focused recently on sustainability of educational leadership reculturing or revisioning efforts. As a component of the leadership revisioning process, a cohort of aspiring leaders within the district was enrolled in an accelerated master’s degree program offered by the university. The cohort program, funded primarily through a United States Department of Education (U.S. DoE) School Leadership Program (SLP) grant, has a strong mentorship component embedded in it. Mentors for the program were selected from among the district- and school-level cohort of leaders. Participants in this study included teachers who were members of the grant-funded cohort and administrators serving as mentors within one rural district.</p>

<title>Leadership Development Programs</title>
<p>Preparation of school leaders has been a focal point of discussion and debate for at least the past 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1942775112464959">Hackmann &amp; Wanat, 2007</xref>). “The lack of a clear understanding about what educational leadership preparation programs should be and what content, instructional methods, and structures should frame them is at the heart of this tension” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1942775112464959">LaMagdeleine, Maxcy, Pounder, &amp; Reed, 2009</xref>, p. 130). Critics of leadership preparation programs argue there is little connection between theory espoused in preparation programs and the practical on-the-job experiences of school leaders. According to Darling-Hammond, LaPointe, Meyerson, Orr, and Cohen (2007), “Traditional coursework in principal preparation and development programs often fails to link theory with practice, is overly didactic . . . and is not aligned with established theories of leadership” (p. 5). Supporting this argument, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1942775112464959">Portin, Schneider, DeArmond, and Gundlach (2003)</xref> found in their examination of preparation programs that principal training was out of touch with the needs of building leaders and many felt “short-changed” by their programs. The list of concerns about leadership preparation is lengthy, and an exhaustive detailing of these is beyond the scope of this article. Rather, it is crucial to note that there is a call to action for improvement and immediate changes in the preparation of K-12 school leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1942775112464959">Levine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1942775112464959">Murphy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1942775112464959">Young, Petersen, &amp; Short, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>One area of particular focus in the literature on leadership preparation has been the variety of delivery modalities for preparation programs. A “traditional” program is considered to be university based and led by university faculty, although the “traditional,” “on-campus” features of some of these university-based programs are changing to include distance learning technologies, off-site locales, and course delivery formats designed to meet the needs of “working professionals” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1942775112464959">Grogan, Bredeson, Sherman, Preis, &amp; Beaty, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1942775112464959">Preis, Grogan, Sherman, &amp; Beaty, 2007</xref>). University-based programs are still the predominant delivery modality; however, the effectiveness of such programs has been challenged. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942775112464959">Crow (2006)</xref>, “[E]vidence regarding the quality of university preparation programs is scant, and most arguments resort to anecdotal evidence or have questionable methodologies” (p. 312). This lack of quality control at the university level has led, in part, to the proliferation of alternative preparation programs, including school district-based leadership preparation programs, as well as not-for-profit and for-profit programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1942775112464959">Grogan et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Whatever the delivery modality, it is widely recognized that the inclusion of district personnel in a collaborative process for the preparation of school leaders is critical. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1942775112464959">Browne-Ferrigno and Muth (2004)</xref> stated, “Although professors can design leadership preparation programs that focus on the theoretical underpinnings of educational administration, active engagement by practicing principals who serve as mentors to prospective candidates and novice school leaders provides authenticity” (p. 471). This question of authenticity and a connection to “real practice” is addressed in preparation programs through <italic>active</italic> involvement and collaboration of both district and university personnel. Given this issue, one of the original purposes of our current work, which began in 2004, was to develop a truly collaborative effort, as few programs were found to have “authentic” partnerships between schools and universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1942775112464959">Blumenfeld, Fishman, Krajcik, Marx, &amp; Soloway, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Successful partnerships between districts and universities to prepare educational leaders can provide the partners a great deal of flexibility—and opportunity—for preparing the aspiring leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1942775112464959">Grogan et al., 2009</xref>). Darling-Hammond et al. (2007) suggested that innovative and successful leadership preparation programs have “collaborative relationships” with K-12 schools and districts across their region. For example, the internship has often been a source of difficulty and stress for students in leadership programs that do not have direct ties to a district. Often the students are left to their own devices to set up internships and identify mentors (who most likely are not trained in how to serve as a mentor), and are often delegated noninstructionally focused, more managerial tasks. Well-articulated and coordinated programs with authentic university–district collaboration can bridge that theory to practice gap and work to provide authentic, in-depth, and meaningful experiences that will allow candidates to be much better prepared to become school leaders.</p>
<p>Due to widely publicized criticisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1942775112464959">Levine, 2005</xref>) of university-based preparation programs that, by and large, question whether universities should even be involved in the preparation of school leaders, along with calls for change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1942775112464959">Young et al., 2002</xref>), many universities have begun to make efforts to collaborate with local school districts. University educators also seek input and feedback from practitioners—initiating the first step toward building bridges between knowledge and practice. The utilization of internal district leaders trained to serve as mentors to university program participants is one way that districts and universities can collaborate to effectively build those bridges.</p>

<title>Mentoring</title>
<p>Mentoring has been found to provide many benefits to individuals aspiring to leadership positions in educational settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1942775112464959">Browne-Ferrigno &amp; Muth, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1942775112464959">Crow &amp; Matthews, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1942775112464959">Daresh, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1942775112464959">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942775112464959">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1942775112464959">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1942775112464959">Ehrich, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1942775112464959">Ehrich et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1942775112464959">Gardner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1942775112464959">Mertz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1942775112464959">Playko, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1942775112464959">Ryder, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1942775112464959">Winn, 1993</xref>). Darling-Hammond et al. (2007) learned from case studies of exemplary leadership preparation programs that such programs have “well-crafted mentoring.” In fact, all the programs that were analyzed through their case studies included “formalized mentoring and advising from expert principals” (p. 150). Mentoring can be of benefit to both the mentee and the mentor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1942775112464959">Ehrich et al., 2004</xref>). For example, mentees can be provided with the opportunity to share their experiences, be provided with meaningful feedback and support, and increase their levels of confidence in their own leadership abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1942775112464959">Daresh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1942775112464959">Ehrich et al., 2004</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1942775112464959">Sherman and Crum (2008)</xref> stated, “Protégés gain leadership knowledge and skill through dialogue with mentors and opportunities to enact best practice” (p. 110). In turn, mentors are able to grow professionally and reflect on their own administrative practices through their interactions with their mentees as well as increase their own potential for career advancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1942775112464959">Daresh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1942775112464959">Ehrich et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the definition of a mentor varies in the literature, the term typically emphasizes how an individual works with a protégé to assist that person on the career path and provide professional development and experience as needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1942775112464959">Mertz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1942775112464959">Skinner, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1942775112464959">Crosby (1999)</xref> stated that a mentor is “a trusted and experienced supervisor or advisor who by mutual consent takes an active interest in the development and education of a younger, less experienced individual” (p. 13). Mentors can assist their mentees in learning how to acclimate to the new set of roles and expectations for school leaders. This socialization into the role is a complex and multilayered process. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1942775112464959">Normore (2004)</xref>, expectations and guiding principles are crucial to socializing leaders. In addition, aspiring leaders need to be provided responsibilities in the organization as well as the structure to effectively carry out their tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1942775112464959">Normore, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1942775112464959">Muth (2002)</xref> also emphasized the need for reflection and discussion of the mentee’s experiences with the mentor. The mentor should be someone who can envision his or her role in supporting future school leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1942775112464959">Normore, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The mentoring process is not always positive. Individuals who are coordinating mentor–mentee relationships in school districts must be aware of potential pitfalls in the relationships as well as in the selection process of mentors. A possible concern of mentoring is that it can lead to a reinforcement of the status quo, often through exclusionary practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112464959">Kanter, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1942775112464959">Mendez-Morse, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1942775112464959">Ortiz, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1942775112464959">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1942775112464959">Reskin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1942775112464959">Samier, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1942775112464959">Sherman, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1942775112464959">2005</xref>). In addition, through this maintenance of the status quo, the possibility exists for historically underserved populations, such as women and racial minorities, to not have their voices heard or leadership styles develop more organically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112464959">Kanter, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1942775112464959">Mendez-Morse, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1942775112464959">Ortiz, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1942775112464959">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1942775112464959">Reskin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1942775112464959">Samier, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1942775112464959">Sherman, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1942775112464959">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1942775112464959">Valverde, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>As within-district leadership programs increase in popularity, more formal mentoring activities have increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1942775112464959">Skinner, 2010</xref>). In part this has occurred due to the degree of uncertainty and discomfort many new principals report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1942775112464959">Browne-Ferrigno &amp; Muth, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1942775112464959">Fusarelli and Smith (1999)</xref> have found that a formal mentoring program helps prepare future leaders for responsibilities in finance, curriculum and instruction, and school law. Mentoring paired with a district-based leadership program provides districts an opportunity to reach a more diverse candidate pool, increase the number of aspiring leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1942775112464959">Fleming, 1991</xref>), and increase the level of support provided to mentees from their mentors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1942775112464959">Ehrich et al., 2004</xref>). These programs need to ensure that appropriate individuals are selected and assigned as mentors to aspiring leaders with recognition of the leadership styles of those being paired, their learning needs, and their professional development needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1942775112464959">Daresh, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>As the field seeks to understand the challenges and benefits of mentoring relationships, it is important to examine how mentoring networks are established and nurtured. Knowledge about the benefits of mentoring is clear; however, how best to implement such systems remains more questionable. This study sought to understand the mentoring relationship between veteran school leaders and aspiring leaders within one small, rural school district.</p>

<title>Setting and Sample</title>
<p>The setting for this study was a university–school district partnership in a rural mid-Atlantic district. The rural school district and university began engaging in university–district partnerships in 2004 with the focus of enhancing student achievement via quality instructional practices. The district did not make adequate yearly progress (AYP) in 2008 to 2009 and currently has two of its three schools in improvement status under Title I. In 2008, the university and district jointly applied for a SLP 5-year grant from the U.S. DoE, and the program was 1 of 22 funded projects in 2008. The grant-funded “Futures Program” (a pseudonym) provides tuition and other costs to 8 students enrolled in a cohort-based, accelerated master’s degree in educational leadership. Each of the 8 cohort members has been paired with a trained mentor who is a school leader in the district, which is in a rural county in the southeastern United States. The county is geographically isolated and arguably one of the most economically disadvantaged counties in the state with a per capita income that is roughly half the state average. The school district has two K-6 elementary schools and one 7-12 high school, and is a high-need district that serves approximately 1,850 students, 76% of whom are economically disadvantaged, receiving free or reduced-price lunch.</p>
<p>The Futures Program was jointly developed by university faculty and district leaders based on a review of literature on leadership preparation as well as the unique needs of the rural school district. The accelerated leadership program was developed to meet Interstate School Leadership Licensure Consortium (ISLLC) and state accrediting standards. Embedded into the program were a strong mentoring component and a three-semester internship with experiences designed collaboratively between the student, mentor, university faculty, and central office leaders. Students were also required to be actively involved in district professional development with a specific focus on instructional leadership, diversity, and data-based decision making.</p>
<p>The mentoring aspect of the Futures Program was designed to contribute to the overall success of the aspiring leaders and to fulfill grant objectives. Mentors included members of district- and school-level administration. Mentors were selected primarily from outside the building where the mentees worked. This afforded mentees the ability to develop understandings of leadership beyond the scope of what they experienced on a daily basis through the course of their natural teaching positions and allowed them to gain a broader understanding of the wide range of district challenges and priorities. The eight mentor and mentee pairs engaged in an in-depth written and oral interview process to allow the university team to create the most productive professional relationships possible. The mentors and mentees were asked to meet face to face a minimum of once a month and to interact a minimum of three other times per month through communication modalities such as email, videoconferencing, and phone calls. In addition, they were asked to journal about their mentor/mentee experiences a minimum of once a month and to utilize the Leadership Performance Planning Worksheet (LPPW) as a basis for their ongoing dialogue and internship experiences design.</p>
<p>The LPPW is a tool designed by the New York City Leadership Academy to help aspiring and new leaders “identify, organize and effectively lead instructional improvement in their schools” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1942775112464959">New York City Leadership Academy, 2008</xref>). The reflective tool iteratively assesses 40 leadership behaviors, which fall into nine dimensions that were derived from a synthesis of principal leadership protocols used across the country. These leadership dimensions are personal behaviors, resilience, communication and the context of learning, focus on student performance, situational problem solving, learning, supervision of instructional and noninstructional staff, management, and technology. The worksheet was used in conjunction with mentor/mentee relationships to explore strengths and weaknesses of the aspiring leaders and set professional development goals for the future.</p>

<sec id="section6-1942775112464959">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data collection took place during Year 2 of the SLP grant and included a wide array of qualitative sources. The researchers collected information through interviews, document collection, researcher notes, review of cohort member coursework and internship projects, and analysis of multiple iterations of the LPPW.</p>
<p>All mentors and mentees in the cohort program were invited for interviews to ensure gaining a broad perspective and feedback on the implementation, challenges, and benefits of the mentoring relationship. Seven of the eight mentees and four of the eight mentors agreed to be interviewed. Participants included nine females and two males. The group included 1 who self-identified as Asian and 10 who self-identified as White (non-Hispanic). To protect the identity of the participants, additional details regarding position within the division cannot be provided. All participants were interviewed for 60 min using a semistructured interview guide (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1942775112464959">appendix</xref>) to ensure consistency among interview questions but to allow for topics to be explored in more depth where appropriate and useful. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, and the interviewer maintained a reflexive journal to record observations and comments. After transcription, identifying information was redacted to ensure the confidentiality of participants. In addition, documents, correspondence, and cohort members’ work products were collected and organized by categories and maintained by the research team. Last, the research team maintained field notes from meetings and training activities, and researcher debriefing sessions.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The research team utilized several qualitative analysis tools to assist in analyzing the large quantity of data. Interview transcriptions were placed into a chart format to allow the team to look at the multiple responses to each question. Each team member then independently coded the interview responses. Strauss and Corbin (1998) emphasized the need to use open coding to avoid focusing too narrowly early on in the analysis and then to use constant comparison to continue to update the list of codes, leading to eventual themes. The team collaboratively collapsed the codes into categories and then recoded responses using the iterations of the codebook. This process was repeated until the team determined that all possible codes had been identified and collapsed into meaningful categories. These categories were then used to conduct document analysis on researcher notes, reflexive journals, and cohort member work products. The LPPW responses were also analyzed according to the final version of the codebook.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this study, validity and trustworthiness were ensured through triangulation of data sources—interviews, journals, researcher notes, and work products—member-checking through ongoing research team meetings to compare coding and updating of the codebook, and constant comparison. One validity threat that had to be addressed was that of reactivity of the interviewees based on the perception of fear of retribution from colleagues, university faculty, or supervisors based on their responses. The interviewer assured all participants that responses were confidential and that they would be identified only as a mentor or mentee in the program. The participants’ reflexive journals allowed the researchers to note these types of affective responses and to describe them adequately.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to better understand the mentoring relationship between veteran and aspiring leaders by exploring the perceptions of mentors and mentees. Our findings are categorized into two main themes: (a) Time Pressures of Accountability and (b) Development and Sustainability of the Mentor/Mentee Relationship.</p>
<sec id="section9-1942775112464959">
<title>Time Pressures of Accountability</title>
<p>Within the theme related to time pressures, we found two important trends relevant to accountability and time allocation. First, participants reported a sense of time pressure and conflicting priorities that centered on accountability demands and that interfered with meaningful mentoring interaction; second, participants and mentors discussed more positive and meaningful interaction when projects of mutual beneficence (sometimes specifically about assessment or with a clear connection to assessment) were the focus of time allocation or communication efforts.</p>
<p>Generally, participants reported a lack of time or other priorities that interfered with their monthly mentor meetings and the ability for them to participate in productive mentor/mentee projects. One mentor reported, “I’ll be honest, I’ve kept it fairly informal because the expectation of the program, journaling, etc., I just don’t have time for it.” The same mentor continued, “That [mentoring] is a backburner for me when I am running a school.” The focus on benchmark testing and accountability created conflict in the mentees’ ability to utilize the built-in and budgeted paid leave to engage in activities with their mentors. This conflict was illustrated by principals’ reluctance to grant leave to mentees due to a fear of the mentee missing time in the classroom. One mentor reported, “One issue from building level . . . the teacher was going to be out for 11-13 days . . . that was an issue because she was missing valuable instructional time.” Another mentor echoed the sentiment about time out of class by saying, “It’s the concerns I hear from principals is that there is too much time out of class for those who have classroom responsibilities. Requirements of 15 days . . . 3 weeks . . . that is tough.” The mentees interviewed shared the sense of the time conflict in regard to the opportunity to meet with their mentors. One mentee reported, “She [the mentor] has no time for me. The system is overwhelmed as a whole. This program and specifically the mentoring is a low priority.” Another mentee shared, “In the beginning, in the summer, it was great. Since the school year began and everybody became very busy, and I feel like there are a lot of pieces missing from the program, and it seems related to time.” A third mentee commented,
<disp-quote>
<p>A major factor is time. She is principal and we are under scrutiny. Her plate has runneth over. She would never say she doesn’t have time, but she <italic>doesn’t</italic> [word emphasized] have time to meet with me. It has taken a back seat unfortunately.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The internship hours, designed in coordination with the mentors, also have not been implemented with fidelity due to the focus on test preparation. One mentee reported,
<disp-quote>
<p>I find myself struggling wildly with this and I write this in my log every month. I am struggling with the decision of, do I spend time in my class and teach or do I get my internship done? It’s really difficult. I feel torn because I don’t have time. Lots of people don’t have classrooms . . . they have flexibility. I have students taking the reading SOL [state assessment] in May. This is not just my perception, but my principal’s. They don’t want me leaving to do internship hours.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These findings indicate a view held by district leaders and some mentees that the leadership development program and mentoring piece are peripheral to the overall effort to improve student learning and reach accountability benchmarks. The goal of the Futures Program is to build internal leadership capacity through training aspiring principals; however, a secondary outcome should be that mentors and mentees, through their mutual activities, can work together to help improve student achievement through their joint efforts. As of yet, it appears that district leadership does not see these links clearly.</p>
<p>However, when Futures Program projects and internship activities have been focused on authentic needs of the school district related to strategic improvement plans, mentors do recognize the benefit of such projects when directly asked about them. For example, one mentor described a joint project between her and her mentee:
<disp-quote>
<p>We are working together to reach our vision. We are building a computer warehouse for lack of better words that will have curriculum pacing guides, lesson plans, all of that, so they can work, so that is what we have done so far and it has been good.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another mentee reported in the interview as well as through her journal that she was working with her mentor on a joint professional development to provide training to new teachers in the district about how to use data from their students’ assessments (formative and benchmark) to make instructional changes. Some of the discussions with mentors also seemed to focus on district needs, as reported by a mentee: “My mentor has been extremely involved in my internship . . . I asked her what would be good for school system and she gave me a list and we talked about the projects best for me.” These types of projects have the potential to improve student achievement and are exactly the model the investigators had in mind when designing the grant program.</p>
<p>Despite the pressures of accountability at play in this district and for our participants, these pressures were mitigated when the mentors and mentees were engaged in mutual projects of benefit to the district. Specifically, we saw the level of engagement increase and priority be assigned to internship activities when mutual projects were intended to concretely benefit the school district. This finding highlights the need for more explicit articulation and mutual understanding of the connections between leadership mentoring and school district initiatives and plans.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1942775112464959">
<title>Development and Sustainability of the Mentor/Mentee Relationship</title>
<p>Within the theme of the development and sustainability of mentor/mentee relationships, we found three important trends. First, careful attention to the pairing process between mentors and mentees impacted the success of the working relationship; second, the use of a tool (in this case the LPPW) to facilitate conversations, particularly at the initiation of the interaction, was effective; and third, both mentors and mentees profited from reflecting on and comparing their leadership styles, based on their interactions.</p>
<p>Careful attention to pairing mentors and mentees was appreciated by study participants. In developing these pairs, it is important to recognize differing communication styles, job responsibilities, and personal past experiences with mentoring, as well as considering commitment to the mentoring process. Generally, the study participants reported satisfaction with the method of pairing and result of that process. For example, mentees made these statements:</p>
<list id="list1-1942775112464959" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>When they chose my mentor, they could not have done any better.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I am wondering if they did a psych profile because we have such similar backgrounds.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>My mentor’s level of enthusiasm mirrors mine. I respect her and am so lucky to have her as a mentor.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I feel like she and I are just, for lack of a better word, two peas in the same pod. We share so many similar psychological traits.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Similarly, mentors reported satisfaction with the outcome of the pairing process, stating,</p>
<list id="list2-1942775112464959" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>We’ve been paired up wonderfully.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>They did a wonderful match with us. I don’t know how it was done . . . I guess through surveys on our personalities. For me, it worked beautifully.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Participants also benefited from a structured approach (use of the LPPW) to facilitate conversations, particularly at the beginning of the mentor–mentee relationship. All mentor/mentee pairings met in the summer before school began, and most mentor/mentee pairs discussed using the LPPW as their kick start to their first interaction. Many respondents noted this instrument gave them a nice framework from which to work and start conversations about strengths and weaknesses. One mentee discussed the content of the instrument in saying,
<disp-quote>
<p>The benefits are great; it truly conveys the qualities of a good leader from their personal strengths as an instructional leader to their ability to create positive school community relationships, and it encompasses everything that a good leader should have.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Likewise, a mentor reported,
<disp-quote>
<p>We have been through each of the categories/objectives, and the good part of that was it gave us in the beginning a focus for meetings/discussion, and she had used that as a reflection and then we discussed a couple things . . . she rated herself lower than I thought she should have. I thought she was higher.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mentors also talked about how the LPPW began their process of thinking of instructional leadership differently. One mentor reported, “It was particularly good for me because I was not familiar with new objectives in leadership development. They weren’t around when I got my endorsement so it brought me up to date.”</p>
<p>Mentors and mentees discussed the manner in which their interactions changed over time, indicating a developmental process and confidence building on the part of the mentees. One mentor reported,
<disp-quote>
<p>When she first came, it was she wanted to get information and now it’s more she is taking responsibility for certain projects, and that is very helpful for both of us. It brings me up with competence and helps her grow professionally.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A similar response was given by a mentee,
<disp-quote>
<p>Our relationship has changed for the better, because as I’m learning more, she’s given me more responsibility. “You’re learning how to handle this so let me give you a situation where you can demonstrate your professional judgment.” She has given me knowledge of how to do it then lets me go do it. She is giving me a chance to demonstrate what I’ve learned from her. “Now you put your spin on it, you do it.” She then can say, “Yes you’ve really grown,” or “We need to continue to work.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One final finding related to the development and sustainability of the mentoring relationship was the opportunity for mentor–mentee pairs to compare their leadership styles and philosophies. These similarities and differences were evident in the interview data and across other data sources, including journaling. We saw this expressed through mentees’ reflections on their new understanding and philosophy about instructional leadership compared with the traditional roles and responsibilities of the building leader. One mentee reported about her mentor’s leadership style:
<disp-quote>
<p>We share the same vision and we have many personality traits that are the same, but I would not . . . I don’t see myself being like her as an administrator, however. She is very, I don’t want to say controlling, but she likes to do everything herself. Instead of asking someone or delegating, she does it herself, which is why she’s pulled in 17 different ways. That is one thing that worried me . . . how do you deal with so many things at one time? I see the toll it takes on her as an instructional leader. She is taking care of other tasks that she could delegate to others and does not get into the classrooms.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It was in this area that we saw the most specific feedback from mentors about the theoretical approaches being voiced by the mentees new to the field. One mentor reported,
<disp-quote>
<p>Speaking with my mentee and other cohort members has been helpful and nice. Normally, you have routine . . . if this, then this. It has been nice to have fresh outlooks and different points of view. And that has been very nice. My AP and I bounce ideas off each other, but with the cohort, they share classroom issues they’ve had and they have new perspectives.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, another mentor said,
<disp-quote>
<p>My mentee has kept me abreast of new things to try. This is a new group of people going through program I completed in the 90s, so you kind of get to see through their eyes what are the important topics. You see what is emphasized as they go through university.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section12-1942775112464959">
<title>Time Pressure of Accountability</title>
<p>The Futures Program sought to provide an embedded leadership preparation program that fostered a spirit of communication and community among veteran and aspiring district leaders to work toward improvement in student achievement. It was important that the veteran leaders and cohort members gained an understanding of how the mentoring program fit into the larger picture of district improvement priorities. The school district, as previously stated, is under a microscope of state and federal accountability measures due to not making AYP and having two of three schools in improvement status under Title I. The increased focus on these external accountability pressures requires a restructuring and reculturing of district leadership skills and priorities. Unfortunately, in some districts, these pressures have led to more of a culture of benchmark testing and remediation, and a focus on recipe style instruction, without affording teachers the opportunity to engage in professional judgment or build internal capacity. We found in this study that this sometimes myopic focus on accountability was an impediment to a successful and functional mentoring program for the aspiring leaders.</p>
<p>However, the time pressure of accountability and its negative impact on the mentoring process were mitigated when mentor/mentee pairs focused their mutual work on meaningful and sustainable projects related to strategic plan goals and to improving student achievement. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1942775112464959">Fullan and Hargreaves (1991)</xref>, to reculture schools to become energized to make important changes and build the capacity to sustain these improvements, educators need opportunities to collaborate with one another with trust, candor, and commitment to continuous improvement. In this respect, effective mentoring can become a central way of promoting this kind of open and professional dialog. The mentor/mentee relationship should be a two-way interaction that helps aspiring and current school leaders to push beyond the usual top–down, managerial forms of leadership practices to develop those that are more instructionally informed and supportive of practices known to impact student learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1942775112464959">Waters, Marzano, &amp; McNulty, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>This type of open, professional dialog can be a challenge in the high pressure, high-stakes accountability environment where many sitting administrators are heavily focused on test preparation, curricular alignment, pacing guides, and benchmark testing, even at the risk of replicating instructional strategies that are ineffective and can undermine students’ engagement, self-efficacy, and motivation. This kind of test preparation environment can narrow curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1942775112464959">Mills, 2008</xref>) and instructional and assessment practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1942775112464959">McMillan, Myran, &amp; Workman, 1999</xref>). Given the pressures of accountability and testing, leaders are “caught in the nexus of accountability and improvement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1942775112464959">Earl &amp; Fullan, 2003</xref>, p. 383). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1942775112464959">Mintrop and Trujillo (2005)</xref> stressed that the increasing pressure on teachers to continually increase student test scores has created a situation where principals have become “conduits of pressure.” This kind of pressure to perform can limit the kind of open dialog and mutual trust that is needed to support effective mentor/mentee relationships.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1942775112464959">
<title>Development and Sustainability of the Mentor/Mentee Relationship</title>
<p>As we examined the data to understand the impact of the time pressure of accountability, other findings related to the development and sustainability of the mentoring relationship emerged. As participants generally recognized a positive pairing process, we began to understand the importance of the interpersonal connection for positive mentoring interaction. Given the proper tools, time, and guidance, it was still necessary for our participants to feel “a match” with their mentoring partner. It was also clear that the instrument of the LPPW helped the pairs to navigate initial communications and provided a type of “to-do” list when it came to appropriate first steps and talking points.</p>
<p>An important third finding was that the mentoring relationship had a positive impact on the leadership development of mentors as well as mentees. Mentees in some cases reported having a different leadership style than their mentors; however, rather than reacting negatively to this, we simultaneously heard from mentors that several reported feeling challenged in their own philosophies and beliefs to think about new ways of looking at leadership with a focus on instructional leadership and data-based decision making. In their journals, several mentors commented on enjoying hearing the coursework discussions and projects as relayed by the mentees, and how the information could assist them in their own practice.</p>

<title>Implications and Recommendations</title>
<sec id="section15-1942775112464959">
<title>Taking a global view</title>
<p>Although this was a small study, the findings lead to implications for university leadership preparation programs and school districts with internal mentoring programs. It was clear that the mentoring relationship was valued by both mentors and mentees in the program, despite the frustration of time constraints related to accountability. It is important for university faculty and district leadership to clearly articulate the goals of mentoring programs and to highlight the ways in which they can directly impact student achievement. In the current high-stakes testing environment, many educators feel a need to focus only on issues and programs that can affect student performance and sometimes lack the global vision to see the interconnectedness of such efforts. Aspiring leaders need time to engage in authentic practices afforded to them through mentoring and internship experiences, but many are vital classroom teachers. This constant tug of war between time needed for leadership development activities and teachers’ instructional time needs to be managed and creatively addressed by designers of mentoring programs. Striking a balance requires strategic visioning and planning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1942775112464959">
<title>Projects of mutual benefit</title>
<p>As internship projects and mentoring interactions are designed, university faculty and district personnel should remember that when a sense of energy and urgency is attached to the project, mentors and mentees interact and engage in a way that provides for quality work products and rich interaction. Specifically, when our partners recognized the benefits of a focus on accountability and developed projects directly tethered to practical, strategic goals, we saw richness in product and process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1942775112464959">
<title>Developing meaningful mentoring relationships and projects</title>
<p>Mentoring relationships take time to develop and often require guidance to maximize the benefit of the engagement for both parties. University programs and district leadership development programs should examine methods for developing the skills of mentors prior to having them initiate conversation with their mentees. It is also clear that a willing mentor is more productive than one who is serving simply because of a duty of his or her position. These prerequisites will open the mentor up to not only providing professional guidance and experience to the mentee but also receiving new ideas and theories from the mentee in return.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1942775112464959">
<title>Further research and next steps</title>
<p>Given the emphasis placed on mentoring relationships by mentors and mentees, further research to better understand the benefits and challenges of these professional relationships is warranted, in both traditional educational leadership programs as well as cohort-based models within school divisions. Specifically, researchers should examine the variance in definitions associated with mentors, such as mentor, site contact, supervisor, clinical faculty, and the like; the nature of each of these relationship structures; and the impact on the holistic development of the aspiring leader.</p>
<p>Most significantly, based on our findings, it is imperative that school districts and institutions of higher education work together in a collaborative fashion to develop projects for aspiring leaders and mentors to complete together that have connections to the vision and goals of the district. The importance of conducting a needs assessment for the district and systemically examining how aspiring leaders can contribute during their preparation phase will not only benefit the aspiring leader but also the district in two ways. First, the district’s leadership pool will be more qualified and ready to step into formalized leadership/administrative positions, and second, the district’s needs will be addressed with an additional cadre of committed educators attending to district goals. In doing so, the quality of education administration preparation programs will improve as the true connection between coursework teachings and theory and school-based practical experiences emerges.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As mentoring programs continue to be developed and refined, it is important to acknowledge the myriad challenges to forging and sustaining productive mentor/mentee relationships. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1942775112464959">Daresh (2004)</xref>, collaboration between veteran and new or aspiring leaders can promote an environment that is conducive to high levels of student achievement. To achieve these benefits, mentoring programs need to realistically address the time pressures of accountability and the need for school districts to improve student achievement and attend to program design elements that can sustain meaningful and mutually beneficial mentoring experiences in these challenging environments. This vital collaborative relationship should remain a priority for university-based and within-district leadership development programs.</p>
