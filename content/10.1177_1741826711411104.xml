<p><bold>Background:</bold> Patients with type-2 diabetes are at risk for treatment- and disease-related complications. Little is known about the interrelation of hypoglycaemia and co-morbid vascular disease (VD), defined as coronary heart disease, stroke and peripheral arterial disease.</p>
<p><bold>Hypothesis:</bold> Hypoglycaemia is associated with co-morbid VD in diabetic patients.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> DiaRegis is a prospective registry that included patients with type-2 diabetes in 2009/2010. Metric variables are displayed as median and quartiles. For the comparison of patients with or without VD Odds Ratios (OR) were determined from univariate analyses and adjusted for differences in patient characteristics (multivariable analysis).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Data on hypoglycaemia and VD within the last 12 months were available for 3741 patients (98.2%) with a median (IQR) age of 65.9 (57.6–72.9) years; 46.7% were female. VD patients (<italic>n</italic> = 909; 24.3%) were older (70.7 vs 63.9 years; <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.0001), less often female (33.6% vs 50.9%; <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.0001) and had had diabetes for a longer duration (6.4 vs 5.4 years; <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.0001). Mean cholesterol (total, HDL and LDL) was also slightly lower (<italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.0001). Glycaemic control (HbA1c, fasting and postprandial glucose) was comparable. VD patients received less metformin (80.7 vs 85.2%; <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.01) and more sulfonylureas (31.8 vs 27.6%; <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.05). There was an increased incidence of symptomatic hypoglycaemia with or without requiring help and with a need for medical assistance. After adjusting a number of baseline variables the rates of symptomatic hypoglycaemias with help remained significantly increased (OR 3.73 (95% CI 1.31–10.65) in patients with VD.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> As hypothesized there is a strong association between the incidence of hypoglycaemia and vascular disease at comparable glycaemic control, which confirms prior randomized controlled trial data suggesting an interrelationship between hypoglycaemia and vascular disease.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1741826711411104" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Patients with type-2 diabetes are at increased risk for treatment- and disease-related complications such as hypoglycaemia. Accordingly a recent meta-analysis of UKPDS, ADVANCE, VADT and ACCORD trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711411104">1</xref></sup> found that intensive antidiabetic treatment was associated with an increased risk for major hypoglycaemic events (HR 2.48; 95% CI 1.91–3.21). At least for the ACCORD trial,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711411104">2</xref></sup> it was further suggested that severe hypoglycaemia might be responsible for the excess deaths from cardiovascular disease. Later analyses implied that while symptomatic, severe hypoglycaemia was associated with an increased risk of death, it was not responsible for the difference in mortality between intensive and standard therapy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711411104">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711411104">4</xref></sup> pointing at the possibility that achieved HbA1c values may not be as important for this observation as previously thought.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711411104">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The post-hoc analysis from the ACCORD trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711411104">3</xref></sup> confirmed a link between symptomatic, severe hypoglycaemia and mortality in patients with type-2 diabetes irrespective of HbA1c target achieved. It was found that while one or more episodes of hypoglycaemia were associated with an increased risk of death in each study arm, the risk of death was lower in patients with tight blood glucose control. The analyses from the ADVANCE trial,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711411104">4</xref></sup> aimed at exploring a relationship between severe hypoglycaemia and adverse clinical outcomes in patients assigned to intensive glucose-lowering treatment, revealed that severe hypoglycaemia might contribute to adverse outcomes, but the authors concluded that hypoglycaemia is just as likely to be a marker of vulnerability to such events.</p>
<p>Against this background we wanted to assess whether these observations from clinical trials are also relevant for routine clinical practice, hypothesizing that hypoglycaemia and overt vascular disease (VD) might be interrelated. For this purpose we performed an analysis of the cross-sectional part of the <italic>Diabetes Treatment Patterns and Goal Achievement in Primary Diabetes Care</italic> (DiaRegis) registry (2009/2010),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711411104">6</xref></sup> which included patients with type-2 diabetes on oral mono or dual combination antidiabetic therapy (not on injectables such as insulin and GLP-1 analogues).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1741826711411104" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>DiaRegis is a prospective, observational, national, multicentre registry. The registry is conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and adhere to International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), Good Epidemiology Practices (GEP), and applicable regulatory requirements. The protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Landesärztekammer Thüringen in Jena, Germany on 4 March 2009. Patients being enrolled provided written informed consent. The study protocol and baseline characteristics of the patient population have been described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711411104">6</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec3-1741826711411104" sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title>
<p>Between June 2009 and March 2010 a group of patients with type-2 diabetes aged ≥40 years on oral mono or dual combination antidiabetic therapy (not on injectables such as insulin and GLP-1 analogues) were included because the treating physician indicated a change of therapy to be necessary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711411104">6</xref></sup> Patients not under regular supervision of the treating physician for the duration of the study, patients with type-1 diabetes, pregnancy, diabetes secondary to malnutrition, infection or surgery, with maturity onset diabetes of the young, known cancer or limited life expectancy, acute emergencies, participation in a clinical trial and patients with further reasons that make it impossible or highly problematic for the patient to participate and come to the follow-up visits were excluded from the registry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711411104"><title>Documentation</title>
<p>Patient characteristics at baseline were entered via a secure website directly into an electronic database at the Stiftung Institut für Herzinfarktforschung, Ludwigshafen, Germany. At this stage they were automatically checked for plausibility and completeness. Data from the patient questionnaire (paper version) were transferred to the Clinical Research Organization Winicker Norimed GmbH, Nürnberg, Germany and entered into the electronic database.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711411104"><title>Definitions (hypoglycaemia, vascular disease)</title>
<p>At the inclusion visit patients were asked to indicate the frequency and severity of any anamnestic episode of hypoglycaemia that they remembered within the 12 months prior to enrolment. Hypoglycaemia was classified as mild, moderate or severe: patients with mild hypoglycaemia were defined as being with or without specific symptoms but manageable without help. These were usually detected by self-measurements of blood glucose (&lt;2.22 mmol/l; 40 mg/dl in any case; 2.22–2.78 or 50 mg/dl in case of symptoms). Patients with moderate hypoglycaemia experienced symptoms of hypoglycaemia and required assistance from a second person (e.g. a relative or friend), but attention of a medical professional was not necessary. Patients with severe hypoglycaemia were seeking medical attention or were admitted to hospital because of hypoglycaemia.</p>
<p>Vascular disease (VD) included any patient with a physician diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD), prior stroke/transitory ischemic attack (TIA) and/or peripheral arterial disease (PAD). No objective confirmation of VD was requested and no further diagnostic workup of patients with subclinical disease was performed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711411104"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The present analysis was based on the cross-sectional part of DiaRegis, for which all patients with valid information regarding anamnestic hypoglycaemia within the last 12 months prior to enrolment and the presence or absence of vascular disease were included.</p>
<p>The statistical computations were performed using SAS, version 9.2 (Cary, North Carolina, USA). The distribution of metric variables is described with medians and quartiles. All descriptive statistics are based on the available cases. Comparisons were made with the χ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711411104">2</xref></sup> or Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test. For patient characteristics crude odds ratios with 95% CI are shown. Adjusted odds ratios with 95% CI were calculated by logistic regression for the outcomes. A fixed model with clinical defined parameters was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% CI for the incidence of hypoglycaemia. Variables entered into the multivariable model were identified from univariate analysis and included age, gender, heart failure, serum creatinine, dialysis, blood glucose self-measurement and depression. <italic>P</italic>-values&lt;0.05 were considered significant (2-tailed).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741826711411104" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 3741 patients had complete information on the presence of VD with a median (IQR) age of 65.9 (57.6–72.9) years; 46.7% were female, 18.0% had coronary heart disease, 4.7% a history of stroke/TIA and 6.1% had PAD resulting in 909 patients (24.3%) with and 2832 patients (75.7%) without VD. Patients with VD were older, less often female, and had longer history of diabetes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711411104">Table 1</xref>).

<p>Vascular disease was a frequent co-morbid condition in our cohort of patients with type-2 diabetes: 18.0% of patients had CAD, 4.7% a history of stroke/TIA and 6.1% had PAD. This is important since patients with VD are more likely to develop complications from antidiabetic pharmacotherapy. One such complication is an increased incidence of (severe) hypoglycaemia despite average glycaemic control. We were able to show that in patients with vascular disease the risk of hypoglycaemia was increased in daily clinical practice. The increased risk for symptomatic hypoglycaemia with the need for help persisted even after adjusting for a number of baseline variables.</p>
<sec id="sec12-1741826711411104"><title>Risk factor management</title>
<p>The diffuse nature and severity of atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes necessitates aggressive use of established therapies to minimize cardiovascular risk. Treatment should include correction of the metabolic disturbances and modification of related atherosclerotic risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Target-driven, intensive intervention directed at multiple risk factors reduces the risk of cardiovascular events, as well as microvascular events, by about 50% in patients with type-2 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711411104">7</xref></sup> In DiaRegis, diabetics with vascular disease received significantly more drugs for the management of vascular risk than patients without a history of vascular disease. On the other hand, the use of either agent did not exceed 70%, leaving a substantial proportion of patients untreated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1741826711411104"><title>Incidence of hypoglycaemia</title>
<p>Reported rates of severe hypoglycaemic events in clinical studies vary between 0.4% (standard therapy group in the ADVANCE study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711411104">8</xref></sup>) and 3.1% per year (intensive therapy group in the ACCORD trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711411104">9</xref></sup>). In UKPDS the rates of major hypoglycaemic episodes per year were 1.4 % with glibenclamide and 1.8 % with insulin;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711411104">10</xref></sup> 0.3% of patients in the present study had hypoglycaemic episodes with the need for medically qualified help and a further 0.3% were admitted to hospital at least once. These numbers were increased in patients with vascular disease (0.9% and 0.6% respectively) and are in agreement with data from previous randomized controlled trials.</p>
<p>However, the rates were obtained from anamnestic data, making the rates prone to selective reporting and also misclassification. Therefore, incidence rates might have been underestimated in the present analysis and the planned follow-up will supply more precise estimates. On the other hand a considerable number of patients had either mild or moderate degrees of hypoglycaemia with or without symptoms and in many cases without the need for specific help. Hypoglycaemia not requiring medical assistance is not trivial however. In these cases a substantial reduction of cognitive and motor function is observed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1741826711411104"><title>Association of hypoglycaemia with vascular disease</title>
<p>After adjusting for a number of confounding variables that were significantly different at baseline, the association of hypoglycaemia (e.g. moderate hypoglycaemia with symptoms and a need for help) remained significant with an odds ratio of 3.73 (95% CI 1.31–10.65). A similar but non-significant association was seen for hypoglycaemia with the need for medical assistance (OR 2–36; 95% CI 0.58–9.60) and, to a lesser degree, for hospitalization due to hypoglycaemia (OR 1.89; 95% CI 0.51–7.03). The confidence intervals were wide because of the low absolute incidence rates. The data neither allow establishment of a causal relationship nor decide whether vascular disease triggers hypoglycaemia or hypoglycaemia triggers vascular disease. Either option has been subject to critical evaluation but no consensus has been established to date.</p>
<p>The benefits of achieving strict glycaemic control in reducing the risk of long-term micro-angiopathic and macrovascular complications are well established. Unfortunately, however, as a consequence, these efforts increase the likelihood of hypoglycaemia. Of note, it is not limited to patients with strict glycaemic control but also occurs in disorganized patients who have a poor degree of self-management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711411104">3</xref></sup> Optimal glycaemic control may have potential adverse effects on vasculature in people with established vascular complications, as a consequence of the induction of hypoglycaemia. It even appears reasonable to expect that acute hypoglycaemia, in patients with established coronary artery disease (which was the most frequent reason for being classified as a patient with vascular disease in our registry), may provoke myocardial ischaemia or infarction. Indeed there have been reports of myocardial infarction or cardiac death that have been associated with hypoglycaemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711411104">11</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711411104">13</xref></sup> A direct association of hypoglycaemia and myocardial ischaemia has been described in a small study of type-2 diabetic patients who had coexistent coronary heart disease, and were receiving treatment with basal–bolus insulin regimens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711411104">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Studies in type-2 diabetic patients with CAD, which examined the influence of glycaemic control on mortality at the time of an acute coronary event, have shown a positive association between both hypoglycaemia and all-cause mortality risk over the course of 2 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711411104">15</xref></sup> Finally, in a large study from Israel that followed patients with CAD for an 8-year period, hypoglycaemia at initial presentation emerged as a marker for increased all-cause mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711411104">16</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1741826711411104"><title>Hypoglycaemia, pharmacotherapy and vascular disease</title>
<p>Hypoglycaemia has previously been reported to be associated with the use of insulinotropic agents such as insulin or sulfonylureas. Insulin use was not permitted in DiaRegis prior to inclusion in this study, but the prior use of sulfonylureas was clearly associated with hypoglycaemia overall and in the subgroup of patients with vascular disease. On the other hand, metformin was less often administered to patients with VD as compared to controls without VD.</p>
<p>This finding is of particular importance, given that substances that improve insulin sensitivity have been reported to be associated with better outcomes. In the UKPDS, one arm of the study demonstrated that enhancing insulin sensitivity with the biguanide metformin decreased macrovascular events. Yet the combination of metformin and sulfonylureas increased the risk of cardiovascular sequelae.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711411104">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711411104">17</xref></sup> On the other hand sulfonylurea therapy was implicated as a potential cause of increased CVD mortality in the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP) study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711411104">18</xref></sup> Concerns raised by the UGDP that sulfonylureas, as a drug class, may increase CVD mortality in type-2 diabetes were, however, not substantiated by the UKPDS or ADVANCE study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711411104">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711411104">10</xref></sup> The higher use of SUs might also have confounded the reported higher odds ratios (although not significant) for symptomatic hypoglycaemia with a need for hospitalization in our registry. We were, however, not able to report on the relative proportion of long-acting SUs such as glibenclamide, which may have resulted in hospitalization to prevent further hypoglycaemia. Another important drug class, whose use did not differ between patients with or without VD, are thiazolidinediones. These improve insulin sensitivity by binding the peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor- γ (PPAR-γ), which is expressed in monocyte/macrophages of atherosclerotic lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711411104">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711411104">20</xref></sup> Thiazolidinediones have been reported to improve endothelial function in patients with type-2 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711411104">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711411104">22</xref></sup></p>

<p>At comparable glycaemic control there is a strong association between the incidence of hypoglycaemia and vascular disease, which confirms prior randomized controlled trial data suggesting an interrelationship of hypoglycaemia and vascular disease.</p>
