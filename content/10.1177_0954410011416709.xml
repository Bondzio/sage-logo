<abstract>
<p>Results of numerical and experimental investigations of steady state supersonic viscous corner flows in simplified geometries that resemble typical wing body–fuselage intersections are presented. These flows are numerically calculated using the computational fluid dynamics code of Fluent and include the use of standard turbulence models. Experimental work includes the use of the oil film flow visualization technique to visualize the surface flow patterns. The flows considered are symmetric about the corner bisector. This article focuses on the development of the three shock structure along the various geometries, specifically focusing on the formation and growth of the shear layers that result from the Mach reflection. The resultant effects of this shear layer on pressure distributions, shear stress, and changes in Mach numbers are discussed. The shock wave boundary layer interaction is also presented.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954410011416709"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<sec id="sec2-0954410011416709"><title>1.1 Shock wave reflections</title>
<p>The study of shock wave reflections dates back to the late 1800 s at which time Ernst Mach was the first to make the important discoveries related to shock wave reflections. Subsequent studies have yielded various shock wave structures that are used in the modern era to classify each type of reflection. Two types of reflections result from the interaction of an incident wave and a wedge surface and these are dependent on the incident Mach number and the reflecting wedge angle. These reflections are referred to as regular (RR) or irregular (IR) and are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954410011416709">Fig. 1</xref>. The RR is referred to as a two-shock structure, the incident wave (i) and the reflected wave (r). These two shocks meet at the reflection point (R) on the wedge surface. The IR is regarded as a three-shock structure which comprises the incident wave (i), the reflected wave (r), and the Mach stem (m). These three shocks intersect at the triple point (T). A slipstream commonly referred to as a shear layer (S) emanates from this triple point and propagates towards the wedge surface. The simple two-dimensional (2D) cases for the IR show that the Mach stem is in contact with the wedge surface while the reflected wave is away from the wedge surface.

<sec id="sec3-0954410011416709"><title>1.2 Supersonic corner flows</title>
<p>The study of supersonic flows in corner configurations is a topic that has generated a great deal of interest among aerodynamicists and shock wave researchers. Interest in this topic lies in both the practical and theoretical aspects of supersonic flows. Researchers have associated the corner configurations to intersections between certain aircraft components, namely, wing body–fuselage intersections, several air intake configurations, and, in recent times, the wing–wingtip/winglet configurations. Simplifying these types of intersections has enabled both the theoretical and experimental evaluation of simplified corner flow interactions.</p>
<p>Shock wave researchers have studied these types of corner configurations to analyse the shock structure that is formed by two intersecting aerodynamic surfaces. This analysis has led to numerous numerical and analytical investigations of steady state supersonic inviscid flows in corner configurations. The foundation of the early research revolved around the shock wave reflections and interactions. The corner configuration produces a complicated 3D shock wave reflection pattern.</p>
<p>Studies have been conducted on simplified geometries which comprise two aerodynamic surfaces (plane wedges) at a specified dihedral angle to each other, commonly referred to as the sharp corner case. In these cases, two oblique bow shock waves are attached to the leading edges and interact with one another to form a 3D shock structure, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011416709">Fig. 2</xref>. Early experimental work was done on these geometries by Charwat and Redekopp [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410011416709">1</xref></bold>]. A Mach stem surface (m) develops between the two incident shocks (I) and the reflected shocks propagate back to the airfoil surface. As in the case of the Mach reflection shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954410011416709">Fig. 1</xref>, a shear layer develops from the shock intersection and also propagates towards the surface.
<fig id="fig2-0954410011416709" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Schematic of supersonic corner flow with Mach reflection on two plane wedges</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011416709-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Additional research conducted by Watson and Weinstein [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954410011416709">2</xref></bold>] and West and Korkegi [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954410011416709">3</xref></bold>] into supersonic and hypersonic corner flow interactions all showed a similar corner flow structure to that of Charwat and Redekopp [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410011416709">1</xref></bold>]. However, further experimental research conducted by Korkegi [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954410011416709">4</xref></bold>] showed a region of disturbed flow that extended from the corner interaction far beyond the location of the reflected shocks in a spanwise direction and Korkegi associated this to boundary layer separation.</p>
<p>The research that followed the early experimental work focused on the development of numerical techniques that enabled the accurate prediction of the shock structure (Mach reflection) within a supersonic sharp corner. These shock structures were detected in the numerical solutions of the Euler equations using either a second-order shock capturing finite difference technique or a second-order shock-fitting finite difference technique. The shock-capturing techniques were used by Kutler [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954410011416709">5</xref></bold>] and Shankar <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954410011416709">6</xref></bold>] while the shock-fitting techniques were used by Marconi [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954410011416709">7</xref></bold>]. Due to the fact that the inviscid corner flows are conically self-similar, all these researchers reduced the 3D problem to a 2D one. Kutler [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954410011416709">5</xref></bold>] and Marconi [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954410011416709">7</xref></bold>], both replicated the experimental conditions used by West and Korkegi [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954410011416709">3</xref></bold>] and the results produced by the numerical techniques were found to be in good agreement with each other.</p>
<p>The early inviscid numerical research conducted on supersonic sharp corners was extensive; however Martin [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954410011416709">8</xref></bold>] extended this research by including a rounded internal corner (fillet profile) between two wedge surfaces. Martin investigated, both numerically and experimentally, the supersonic flow field in a rounded internal corner. Numerically, Martin developed a shock-fitting scheme that differed from those utilized in previous publications as it included a rounded internal corner in the numerical setup. The geometries investigated consisted of a conical segment at the leading edge. The radius of the rounded corner increased along the length of the chord, hence rendering the flow conical and self-similar. Given the lack of available data on the flow field conditions for a rounded internal corner at the time, a comparison had to be made with previous data obtained for the sharp corner case. Martin's [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954410011416709">8</xref></bold>] results did, however, show that as the radius of the rounded corner increased along the length of the chord, the pressure gradient towards the corner increased. This early research, thus, provided an initial insight into the flow field within a rounded internal corner.</p>
<p>Subsequent study completed on supersonic corner flows which included a rounded internal corner between two wedge surfaces was done by Skews <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954410011416709">9</xref></bold>]. In contrast to the study done by Martin [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954410011416709">8</xref></bold>], this research focused on non-conical flows by including fillets and camber and varying the dihedral angles of the respective geometries. Both experimental and inviscid numerical investigations were considered. Unlike the work done by Martin [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954410011416709">8</xref></bold>], Skews <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954410011416709">9</xref></bold>] used a corner with a constant radius fillet, i.e. the fillet radius was constant along the length of the chord, to ensue a non-conical flow. The inviscid numerical research was a fully 3D problem. The preliminary experimental and numerical results produced showed that the incident shock profile initially corresponds to that of the leading edge of the geometry, but as the shock moves away from the leading edge, the cross-sectional shock profile becomes that of the commonly known Mach reflection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011416709">Fig. 2</xref>). Skews <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954410011416709">9</xref></bold>] also established that both the fillet radius and dihedral angle affect the transition criteria for the formation of the Mach reflection.</p>
<p>The most recent work into supersonic inviscid corner flows was performed by Gunko Yu <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954410011416709">10</xref></bold>]. This research was a comprehensive numerical and analytical study of steady state supersonic inviscid flows within sharp corner geometries. The flow features that resulted from the formation of the wedge-generated shocks were identified and compared to previous available data. The research focused on the transition criterion that enables the transition from RR to IR. The transition values of the wedge, sweep, and dihedral angles were the foundation of the study. The analytical results showed that for corner flows with unswept wedges and a 90° dihedral angle between the wedge surfaces, the conditions of regular–irregular shock reflection transition correspond to either the detachment or sonic criterion [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954410011416709">10</xref></bold>]. The results produced also showed that the von Neumann transition is possible and achieved in corner configurations with a forward swept angle ≤0° and 90° dihedral angle between the wedges. Gunko Yu <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954410011416709">10</xref></bold>] thus focused on transition criterion for shock reflections and the results were in good agreement with previous analytical investigations into supersonic inviscid corner flows.</p>
<p>The early numerical research that solved the Navier–Stokes equations for 3D corners were done by Shang <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954410011416709">11</xref></bold>]. A numerical scheme that utilized the Navier–Stokes equations in combination with a turbulence model was developed and this scheme was used to capture the shock structure within a supersonic sharp corner. The preliminary results produced first showed that the concept of utilizing a turbulence model is not restricted to 2D flows but can be extended to 3D flows. The results also predicted the shock structure well and were in good agreement with the experimental data obtained.</p>
<p>Settles <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954410011416709">12</xref></bold>] focused on experimental investigations for a shock wave boundary layer interaction (SWBLI) on swept compression corners. Compression leading edge angles of 16° and 24° were used on all the geometries and these angles caused near-incipient and wall-separated 2D flows at Mach 3. The compression corners were also swept incrementally from 0° to 50°. The study focused on surface flow patterns and surface pressure distributions, among many other aspects, similar to that being investigated in this study. Settles and Teng [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954410011416709">13</xref></bold>] also conducted a study on the above-mentioned compression corners but focused on flow visualization techniques. These techniques included vapour visualization, stereoscopic schlieren, conical shadowgraph, particle tracer methods, and kerosene–lampblack surface streak traces, i.e. the oil film technique. The study explored the validity of using these techniques for 3D SWBLI.</p>
<p>The research into corner flow interactions has thus been extensive on plane wedges, both experimentally and computationally; more specifically, the simple sharp corner case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011416709">Fig. 2</xref>) has been the core case of study for many researchers. Skews <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954410011416709">9</xref></bold>] produced inviscid computational results as well as preliminary experimental results for the rounded internal corner case, but apart from this, very little research has been conducted and documented on these types of geometries, i.e. geometries that include a rounded corner between two aerodynamic surfaces. More specifically, the effect of the rounded corner on the formation of the Mach reflection and shear layer as well as the effect on the surface pressures is yet to be fully investigated.</p>
<p>Numerically, these cases have limited data available when using a viscous turbulence model. The SWBLI resulting from the interaction of the reflected wave and the surface has not been investigated. More so, the transition from the original wedge geometry to a more realistic camber profile for both the sharp corner case and the rounded internal corner case has not been investigated.</p>
<p>Experimentally, the flow patterns on the surface of the above-mentioned geometries have not been investigated. Skews <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954410011416709">9</xref></bold>] performed experimental work using the laser vapour screen technique and this flow visualization method enabled the cross-sections of the shock structure to be viewed. This study will make use of an alternate flow visualization technique to study the flow patterns on the surface of the geometries.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0954410011416709"><title>1.3 Shock wave boundary layer interaction</title>
<p>The interaction of a shock wave with a boundary layer is a common viscous interaction problem. Interactions between shock waves and boundary layers can profoundly influence the flow characteristics over supersonic aircrafts. These interactions can occur in engine inlets, near wing body junctures, and over control surfaces. This SWBLI often results in separation or distorts the flow field. It is for this reason that the study of SWBLI is an important aspect in high-speed aerodynamics.</p>
<p>Flow distribution in the boundary layer depends on the pressure distribution along the wall. If the pressure gradient is favourable, i.e. the pressure decreases downstream, then the boundary layer remains well attached to the wall. With adverse pressure gradients, when the pressure starts to rise in the direction of the flow, the boundary layer tends to separate from the surface of the wall.</p>
<p>The common interaction between a shock wave and a boundary layer is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410011416709">Fig. 3</xref>. This figure depicts the simplest case that describes SWBLI in two dimensions, i.e. the interaction on a flat plate. When an incident shock wave impinges on the boundary layer, a severe adverse pressure gradient is imposed on the boundary layer [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954410011416709">14</xref></bold>]. This may cause the boundary layer to separate. SWBLI has a major effect on pressure and shear stress along the walls of the object being analysed.
<fig id="fig3-0954410011416709" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Schematic of SWBLI on a flat plate</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011416709-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410011416709">Figure 3</xref> illustrates the standard SWBLI case, i.e. the impingement of the incident shock wave and flow direction occur in the same plane. The SWBLI within a supersonic corner occurs perpendicular to the flow direction.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0954410011416709"><title>2 SUPERSONIC GEOMETRIES</title>
<p>The geometries created represented the intersections between a wing body and a fuselage. It should be noted that although the flow over a wing body–fuselage intersection was simulated, a realistic geometry was not used. Geometrically much simpler cases or idealized cases that represent wing body–fuselage intersections were investigated. This was done so that the basic flow physics associated to these types of intersections may be obtained and understood. The creation of the geometries for the computational investigation also took into account the experimental investigation that was performed. This was done so that a direct computational–experimental comparison could be conducted.</p>
<p>The geometries investigated have two spanwise profiles; the first profile includes a fillet which has a rounded internal corner between two aerodynamic surfaces and the second profile is that of the already-mentioned sharp corner profile (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-0954410011416709">section 1.2</xref>) which neglects the influence of a rounded corner. The camber profile chosen was a circular arc profile (radius constant in the chordwise direction). The maximum thickness of all the geometries occurs at 50 per cent of the chord length. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954410011416709">Table 1</xref> summarizes the geometric characteristics utilized and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954410011416709">Fig. 4</xref> illustrates the 90° dihedral angle geometry with the camber and fillet profile between the two aerodynamic surfaces on the left and the one on the right, the 90° dihedral angle geometry which neglects the influence of the fillet profile between the two aerodynamic surfaces.

<sec id="sec6-0954410011416709"><title>3 EXPERIMENTATION</title>
<sec id="sec7-0954410011416709"><title>3.1 Supersonic wind tunnel</title>
<p>The experiments were carried out in the supersonic wind tunnel situated at the University of Witwatersrand. The supersonic wind tunnel is a blow-down wind tunnel capable of reaching Mach numbers between 2.5 and 3.4. The test section has a cross-section of 100 × 100 mm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Four test specimens were manufactured for experimental investigation. The 90° and 120° dihedral angle fillet and sharp corner profiles were chosen. These models had a chord length of 0.035 m and a total wing span of 0.075 m. These were the maximum dimensions that could be used in order to avoid choking of the wind tunnel. In order to draw an accurate comparison with the numerical results, the test Mach numbers and reference conditions used in the experimental testing were employed during the numerical simulations. Experimental tests were conducted at Mach 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0954410011416709"><title>3.2 Surface flow visualization</title>
<p>The preferred flow visualization method for the investigation was the oil film technique. The oil film technique aids in the visualization of boundary layer transition, shock wave location, as well as regions of separation and reattachment on the surface, which are all significant to the investigation.</p>
<p>For the oil flow technique to be effective, the required oil mixture had to be a precise mixture of a certain carrier fluid and a fine pigment. Transformer oil and titanium dioxide were the chosen as the carrier fluid and pigment, respectively. Settles and Teng [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954410011416709">13</xref></bold>] suggests a pigment to carrier mixture ratio of 1 : 4 for supersonic flows, but for this investigation, the oil flow mixture showed the best results by utilizing a 5 : 4 carrier fluid to pigment ratio while simultaneously adding a few drops of oleic acid to thin the mixture and prevent agglomeration. A thin layer of the oil mixture was applied to all the test specimens before a test. Once the test specimen is subjected to the desired Mach number, frictional forces in the air flow carry the oil with it and the remaining deposits reveals specific characteristics regarding the shock formation. The patterns revealed by the oil flow visualization provide information about the flow near the surface. The oil film technique can only be of a qualitative nature. After the test was completed, the resultant surface pattern was photographed using a standard high-resolution camera.</p>

<sec id="sec9-0954410011416709"><title>4 NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS</title>
<p>Numerical solutions were obtained by solving the Navier–Stokes equations. Mesh generation for the numerical investigations were performed using Gambit, a commercially available pre-processing grid generator. A commercial computational fluid dynamics package, Fluent, was implemented for processing and post-processing. Tecplot 360 2010 was also used for post-processing.</p>
<sec id="sec10-0954410011416709"><title>4.1 Mesh generation</title>
<p>The meshes created utilized the various tools available in Gambit. The curvature size function tool was used to account for the respective curvature associated with the camber and fillet profile. Each face on the geometry was meshed using this size function and the respective boundary layer meshes were applied to these meshed faces. A final volume mesh was created using the volume mesh function and a second size function that enabled the mesh to grow from the already meshed faces to the outer volume. In order to monitor the refinement of the mesh in the near wall layer, the surface <italic>y</italic><sup>+</sup> values were plotted along the centre of the geometry. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954410011416709">Figure 5</xref> shows the plot of the surface <italic>y</italic><sup>+</sup> versus position along the geometry.

<p>Once the initial solution had converged, the respective meshes were refined to obtain more accurate results. The general purpose of mesh refinement is to reduce the solution error and since most errors occur in areas of large gradients, the meshes were adapted with respect to gradients. Mesh refinement was performed twice on each mesh. The Fluent adaptation/refinement technique involves increasing the number of nodes for each cell with a gradient above a certain threshold value. Once this value was set, the iterative process was started again until convergence was reached for the second time. Thereafter, the maximum levels of refinement were changed and the process was started again until a final solution was attained. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954410011416709">Table 3</xref> describes the general mesh refinement parameters.

<sec id="sec13-0954410011416709"><title>4.4 Mesh independence</title>
<p>Mesh independence tests were performed to ensure that all the results produced were independent of the type of mesh chosen for the numerical simulations. These tests were performed using the mesh refinement technique as a means of checking mesh independence (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec12-0954410011416709">section 4.3</xref>). This procedure ensured that three meshes were available for all the geometries to prove mesh independency, i.e. initial/coarse mesh (600 000 cells), first adapted/medium mesh (1.2 million cells), and the second adapted/fine mesh (4 million cells). The 90° dihedral angle fillet case was used to show mesh independence. These simulations were conducted at Mach 3.2. A comparison was made by producing line plots of the pressure, Mach number, and temperature changes across the geometry. These values were taken at a height of 6 mm above the surface of the geometry as it accounts for the various changes in flow properties in the regions surrounding the Mach stem and reflected wave at various stages during the formation of the shock structure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954410011416709">Figure 7</xref> shows the plots for these thermodynamic properties.
<fig id="fig7-0954410011416709" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Graphs of pressure, temperature, and Mach number showing mesh independence for the 90<bold>°</bold> circular arc fillet profile at Mach 3.2</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011416709-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The supersonic mesh independence tests show that the numerical results produced for the coarse, medium, and fine meshes, all predict the shock formation and changes in flow properties well. These results show that the coarse mesh predicts a very slight change in the Mach number, pressure, and temperature values when compared to those of the medium and fine meshes The flow properties are in good agreement considering the variation in cell sizes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954410011416709">Table 3</xref>) for each mesh. The finer mesh does, however, produce a much sharper image of the shock structure when compared to the medium and coarse meshes. This is due to the fact that the fine mesh is refined specifically around the shock structure and has a cell count of approximately six times more than that of the coarse mesh. The results using a coarse mesh are slightly unclear as it is calculating average flow properties over a larger cell size when compared to the finer mesh. The variation in flow properties is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954410011416709">Fig. 7</xref>.</p>
<p>The line plots for the supersonic mesh independence tests show that simulated numerical results produced for each mesh are in good agreement with each other. The finer meshes do, however, provide a much sharper image of the shock waves and the visualization of flow features is an important consideration in the analysis of supersonic shock waves. As a result of the mesh independence tests performed, the numerical results produced for the supersonic investigations are mesh independent.</p>

<sec id="sec14-0954410011416709"><title>4.5 Turbulence modelling</title>
<p>All previous numerical research conducted on supersonic corner flow interactions utilized an inviscid solver (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-0954410011416709">section 1.2</xref>). Fluent conducted a validation study and showed that the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model is the most effective turbulence model to use when predicting shock wave location and separation characteristics on airfoils [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954410011416709">15</xref></bold>]; however, this study involved the comparison of three different viscous models which include the Spalart–Allmaras, <italic>κ–ε</italic>, and the <italic>κ–ω</italic> shear stress transport (SST) variant available in Fluent. These models are well understood and established in literature. The choice of the turbulence model was based on its capability to accurately predict the shock structures within the flow field while also being computationally feasible for its use. The study conducted by Fluent was also taken into consideration in deciding the turbulence model to be used for the study. The 90° dihedral angle sharp corner supersonic geometry was used to validate the different turbulence models. These simulations were conducted at Mach 3. The comparison of the turbulence models is obtained by comparing pressure, temperature, and Mach number changes along the length of the geometry for each turbulence model. These values were again taken at a height of 6 mm above the surface of the geometry. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954410011416709">Figure 8</xref> shows the comparisons for these properties. The results show that the <italic>κ–ε</italic>, <italic>κ–ω</italic> SST, and the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence models predict similar changes in the flow properties. The three turbulence models also predict the formation of the shock structure, i.e. Mach reflection, very well. The <italic>κ–ε</italic> and <italic>κ–ω</italic> SST turbulence models do, however, predict a slightly higher Mach number to that seen by the Spalart–Allmaras model. Although the results produced for the respective turbulence modes are similar, the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model was ultimately chosen as the final turbulence model to be used for all the required numerical simulations.

<sec id="sec15-0954410011416709"><title>5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Shock wave reflections and interactions can have a profound effect of the flow within a supersonic corner. Minimizing the impact of these reflections which produce varying pressure and temperature changes on supersonic vehicles is seen as a primary objective in the design phase of supersonic vehicles. The results presented are an insight into the flow field within a supersonic corner and illustrates how the various geometric characteristics of a simplified supersonic corner impacts the flow field. Numerical simulations were conducted on geometries that varied in dihedral angles, thickness/chord ratios, and profiles, i.e. fillet or sharp corner. All these characteristics enabled a variety of geometries to be analysed; hence, a complete range of results were produced and more data was available for the analysis on supersonic viscous corner flow interactions. For the purpose of this study, only the numerical and experimental results conducted at Mach 3 will be presented.</p>
<p>The results to be discussed include the 90° dihedral angle fillet and sharp corner profiles, both of which had a 10 per cent thickness/chord ratio. This was done to distinguish the effect of including a fillet profile between two aerodynamic surfaces rather than a sharp corner profile. The third set of results to be discussed is the 135° dihedral angle case with a 3 per cent thickness/chord ratio. The results are shown for this geometry as it has the largest dihedral angle and the smallest thickness/chord ratio. These three geometries enable the flow field and shock structures within a simplified supersonic corner to be analysed in terms of varying dihedral angles and thickness/chord ratios. The associated shock structures and changes in pressure, Mach number, and shear stresses are presented.</p>
<sec id="sec16-0954410011416709"><title>5.1 Development of the shock structure</title>
<p>The presence or absence of the fillet profile together with the combined effect of the camber profile, dihedral angle, and thickness/chord ratio, all play a significant role in the development of the shock structure across the respective geometries.</p>
<p>The formation of the shock structure is described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-0954410011416709">section 1.2</xref>. This shock structure is presented in the form of iso-surfaces and contour plots of Mach number. Both the iso-surfaces and the contour plots are used to analyse the formation of the shock structure. The contour plots are cross-sectional views taken perpendicular to the flow direction at four distinct points, namely, 10, 20, 30, and 35 mm from the leading edge. These contour plots are used specifically to track the changes in the shock structure along the chord of the geometry and not the changes in Mach number. The incident wave (I), reflected wave (R), Mach stem (M), and shear layer (S) are shown on each figure.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011416709">Figure 9</xref> shows the shock structure for the 90° fillet profile. The oblique incident shock wave is initially a smooth curved wave. The incident shock wave corresponds in shape to that of the leading edge of the geometry but as transition occurs, it becomes a wave with discontinuities in slope, i.e. the formation of the Mach reflection is evident. As a result, it is seen that the existence of the fillet profile delays the formation of the Mach reflection as well as the shear layer.
<fig id="fig9-0954410011416709" position="float"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Shock structure cross sections for the 90<bold>°</bold> fillet profile</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011416709-fig9.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Neglecting the effect of the fillet profile shows a distinct change in the formation of the shock structure and the Mach reflection, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954410011416709">Fig. 10</xref>. The results indicate that the Mach reflection and shear layer formation starts at the leading edge of the geometry. More importantly, the shear layer initially propagates onto the surface. As the shock structure evolves, the shear layer grows with the Mach reflection, but gradually pulls away from the surface. This initial propagation of the shear layer onto the surface leads to a decrease in the Mach number at the leading edge.
<fig id="fig10-0954410011416709" position="float"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><p>Shock structure cross-sections for the 90<bold>°</bold> sharp corner profile</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011416709-fig10.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954410011416709">Figure 11</xref> shows the development of the shock structure for the 135° dihedral angle geometry which includes a fillet profile and a 3 per cent thickness/chord ratio. By increasing the dihedral angle while simultaneously decreasing the thickness/chord ratio, the oblique shock wave that forms remains a continuous smooth curved wave all along the geometry, i.e. the incident shock wave corresponds in shape to the leading edge of the geometry and remains this way across the chord of the geometry. As a result, the formation of the Mach reflection is not seen.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954410011416709">Figures 12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954410011416709">13</xref> are iso-surfaces of Mach number. The iso-surfaces are shown from two directions, a front view which shows the formation of the shock structure in the flow direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954410011416709">Fig. 12</xref>) and a rear view which shows the shock structure from behind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954410011416709">Fig. 13</xref>). These two views illustrate the important flow features associated with the shock formation within a simplified supersonic corner. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954410011416709">Figures 12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954410011416709">13</xref> show the development of the shock structures for the 90° fillet and sharp corner geometries as well as the 135° fillet profile.

<p>The iso-surfaces and contour plots illustrate the changes in the flow properties for the respective geometries. The inclusion of a fillet profile instead of a sharp corner within a supersonic geometry is seen to affect the formation of the Mach reflection which results in lower changes in pressure, Mach number, temperature, and shear stresses when compared to the sharp corner profiles. These results also indicate that the addition of a larger dihedral angle and a smaller thickness/chord ratio will delay the formation of the Mach reflection which results in a lesser variation in the thermodynamic properties when compared to smaller dihedral angles.</p>

<sec id="sec17-0954410011416709"><title>5.2 Pressure, shear stress, and Mach number distributions</title>
<p>The changes in the pressure, shear stress, and Mach number are dependent on the geometric characteristics, i.e. the presence or absence of a fillet profile, the dihedral angle, and the thickness/chord ratio. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954410011416709">Figures 14</xref> to 16 show the numerical results for the above-mentioned thermodynamic properties for the 90° fillet and sharp corner profiles, both of which have a 10 per cent thickness/chord ratio as well as the 135° fillet profile which has a 3 per cent thickness/chord ratio. The values presented on the images give an indication of the change in these parameters along the chord of the geometry. These values are taken at a height of 1 E−05 m above the surface of the geometry.
<fig id="fig14-0954410011416709" position="float"><label>Fig. 14</label><caption><p>Surface properties for the 90<bold>°</bold> fillet profile: (a) pressure (Pa); (b) shear stress (Pa); and (c) Mach number</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011416709-fig14.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954410011416709">Figure 14</xref> shows the results for the 90° fillet profile, from which it is seen that the formation of the Mach reflection occurs at approximately 50 per cent of the chord. Before this point, the oblique shock wave is a continuous curved wave and the resultant effect on the thermodynamic properties is evident. The change in the pressure, shear stress, and Mach number is gradual up until the point of maximum thickness and is a result of the incident shock wave only. Thereafter, the impact of the reflected wave back onto the surface affects the changes in these properties. Although the formation of the shear layer is evident and can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011416709">Fig. 9</xref>, the direct impact of the shear layer on the surface pressure is negligible as the shear layer is away from the surface. The reflected shock wave has a greater influence on the surface pressure and shear stress profiles than the shear layer.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954410011416709">Figure 10</xref> shows the development of the shock structure for the 90° corner profile, from which it is seen that the formation of the Mach reflection and shear layer start at the leading edge of the geometry. The variation for this case is that the shear layer initially propagates onto the surface. This has a direct impact on the surface pressure, shear stress, and Mach number distributions. The shear layer causes an increase in the shear stress and pressure at the leading edge of the geometry. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954410011416709">Figure 15</xref> shows the surface pressure, shear stress, and Mach number distributions for the 90° sharp corner profile.

<p>By varying the dihedral angle and the thickness/chord ratio, the changes in the flow properties are clearly evident. Increasing the dihedral angle results in a decrease in the strength of the Mach stem surface; this had a direct impact on the formation of the Mach reflection and the shear layer. The same effect is seen when decreasing the thickness/chord ratio. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0954410011416709">Figure 16</xref> shows the numerical results for the surface pressure, shear stress, and Mach number distributions for the 135° geometry which has 3 per cent thickness/chord ratio. Due to the delay in the formation of the Mach reflection, the changes in the pressure, shear stress, and Mach number result from the oblique shock wave only.

<sec id="sec18-0954410011416709"><title>5.3 Experimental and numerical surface streamlines</title>
<p>The oil film flow visualization technique was used as the preferred method of flow visualization. The experimental images for the 90° fillet and sharp corner profiles are presented. These experimental images are validated by plotting the surface streamlines obtained from the numerical analysis. The nature of the interaction between the oblique shock wave and the supersonic geometry results in the reflected wave impinging on the surface. The use of the oil film flow visualization technique enables the path of the reflected waves to be accurately predicted. The comparison between the experimental images and the surface streamlines is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0954410011416709">Figs 17</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0954410011416709">18</xref> for the 90° sharp corner and fillet profiles, respectively. Isometric views of the entire geometry are shown for the surface streamlines. Both the experimental images and numerical surface streamlines are shown for the experiments and numerical simulations that were conducted at Mach 3. The important flow features are identified on each experimental and numerical image.

<p>The experimental image for the 90° sharp corner profile validates the formation of the shock structure established in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec16-0954410011416709">section 5.1</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0954410011416709">Figure 17</xref> shows the experimental and surface streamline images for this geometry. The path of the reflected wave is seen to occur at the leading edge of the test specimen, which indicates that both the formation of the shock structure and Mach reflections occur at the leading edge of the geometry. This is also seen on the surface streamlines. The reflected waves are identified by the dark regions on the image.</p>
<p>The experimental image for the 90° fillet profile further validates the premise that there is a delay in the formation of the shock structure for geometries that include a fillet profile between two aerodynamic surfaces (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec16-0954410011416709">section 5.1</xref>). The reflected wave which results from the formation of the Mach reflection is seen to occur at approximately 50 per cent of the chord on the experimental image. Before this point, the oblique shock wave is a smooth curved wave. This effect is also seen on the surface streamlines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0954410011416709">Fig. 18</xref>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0954410011416709">Figures 17</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0954410011416709">18</xref> both show a bow shock wave that forms near the trailing edge of the test pieces. This bow shock formation is a result of the support sting that holds the test piece in place during the experimental testing. This shock wave does not influence the formation of the reflected waves in any way.</p>
<p>The results produced from both the experimental and numerical investigations show the respective formations and developments of the shock structures on the various supersonic geometries that were analysed. The experimental and numerical comparisons shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0954410011416709">Figs 17</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0954410011416709">18</xref> are seen to validate one another. The formation of the Mach reflection that occurs at the leading edge of the sharp corner geometries and the fillet profiles delays this formation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-0954410011416709"><title>5.4 Shock wave boundary layer interaction</title>
<p>This investigation of the SWBLI differs from previous studies in that the reflected wave impinges on the boundary layer and this impingement is inclined to the flow direction. This results in a fully 3D SWBLI. The numerical and experimental results produced verified that the reflected wave impinges on the surface of the respective geometries. As a result, the interaction between the reflected wave and the boundary layer on the surface forms the basis for the SWBLI.</p>
<p>With the exception of the 135° dihedral angle, 3 per cent thickness/chord ratio geometry, all the other numerical results produced yielded the three-shock structure, i.e. the incident and reflected waves as well as the Mach stem were present. Further analysis of the numerical results showed that the smaller the dihedral angle of the geometries, the higher the strength of the Mach stem surface; hence, the 90° dihedral angle cases produced the highest strength shock waves. This had a direct impact on the SWBLI in that the interaction of the reflected wave and the boundary layer was more pronounced for the 90° dihedral angle profiles.</p>
<p>As a result of the higher shock intensity for the 90° dihedral angle cases, emphasis was placed on the SWBLI involving a comparison between the fillet and sharp corner profiles for the 90° geometries.</p>
<p>This analysis revealed that the impingement of the reflected wave on the boundary layer results in an increase of the boundary layer thickness at this point. The greatest increase or deviation in the boundary layer thickness is seen for the sharp corner profiles. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0954410011416709">Figure 19</xref> shows the region at which the reflected wave impinges on the boundary layer. This section is taken at the trailing edge of the respective geometries and the close-up view of the regions marked with a circle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954410011416709">Figs 13</xref>(b) and (c). The larger variation in the boundary layer thickness between the fillet and sharp corner profiles is evident. Although the boundary layer thickness is seen to increase, the adverse pressure gradients associated with the SWBLI is not strong enough to cause reversed flow and a fully separated region for the geometries analysed, i.e. the shock intensity was not high enough to produce flow separations.

<p>The boundary layer velocity vectors of Mach number are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-0954410011416709">Fig. 20</xref>. These vectors are taken at three points within the boundary layer, at the leading edge, midpoint, and the trailing edge of the geometry. These velocity vectors do not indicate any reversed flow within the flow field which further confirms that no separation is evident.

<p>A numerical and experimental investigation of steady state supersonic viscous corner flows has been conducted. Geometries that resemble simplified wing–body fuselage intersections or other similar corner configurations that are found in supersonic aircrafts were simulated using the numerical code of Fluent. These geometries varied in dihedral angle and thickness/chord ratios and comprised either a fillet or sharp corner profile. A turbulence modelling validation study was performed and the results showed that the <italic>κ–ε</italic>, <italic>κ–ω</italic> SST, and the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence models, all predict similar changes in the flow properties. The numerical results produced confirm that the formation of the Mach reflection and shear layer are dependent on the geometric characteristics as well as the presence or absence of a fillet profile. The inclusion of a fillet profile results in the delay of the formation of the Mach reflection and shear layer. This also results in lower pressure and temperature changes across the geometry. Neglecting the effect of the fillet profile resulted in the formation of the Mach reflection and shear layer starting at the leading edge of the geometry. A much higher pressure and temperature variation is seen for the sharp corner geometries. The impingement of the reflected shock waves on the boundary layer results in a large variation in the boundary layer thickness for the sharp corner geometries; however, no separation is observed. The experimental work validates the numerical results produced by accurately depicting the surface flow patterns.</p>
