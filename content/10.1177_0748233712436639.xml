<abstract>
<p>Pollution in water used for irrigation is a major cause of stress generation in plant system. Under these stress conditions, reactive oxygen species derived from molecular oxygen can accumulate in plant, resulting in the oxidation of nucleic acids, lipids, chlorophyll and so on. This study was conducted in <italic>Allium cepa</italic> to analyze the alteration in the levels of nonenzymatic antioxidants as a consequence of Mathura refinery waste water (MRWW) exposure. The studied antioxidants were glutathione (GSH) and ascorbic acid (ASC). Their determination was carried out in <italic>A. cepa</italic> bulbs exposed to different concentrations of MRWW that is 0.25×, 0.5×, 0.75× and 1.0×. A significant increase in the levels of these nonenzymatic antioxidants in onion bulbs upon treatment with MRWW suggested that these can serve as suitable biomarkers of toxicity. The toxicity of waste water was also tested on the level of tocopherol (Toc) and carotenoid (CAR) in onion bulbs, and in both the cases a high level of these metabolites was noticed. Phenolic content of <italic>A. cepa</italic> after the waste water insult was found to be increased, again a manifestation of adaptation against heavy metal and oxidative stress. It is clear from our findings that GSH, ASC, Toc and CAR in <italic>A. cepa</italic> system could serve as potential biomarkers for the presence of toxicants like heavy metals and its hazards in MRWW. The test waste water demonstrated profound effects on these parameters which is suggestive of the warrior strategies adopted by the plant system against the pollution-induced stress.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Refinery waste water (RWW) is a very complex and variable mixture which is released into rivers and lakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748233712436639">Heidarzadeh et al., 2010</xref>). The sludge that results from various treatment processes in oil refinery has a high content of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons, mainly alkanes and paraffins of 1–40 carbon atoms, along with cycloalkanes, aromatic compounds and heavy metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0748233712436639">Overcash and Pal, 1979</xref>), making them a potentially dangerous waste product.</p>
<p>There has been a growing need to monitor and check the pollution of RWW. Present study was designed to explore whether <italic>Allium cepa</italic> system could serve as a potential candidate for RWW biomonitoring. <italic>A. cepa</italic> is the common onion and has been widely used in all parts of the world as a flavouring vegetable. <italic>A. cepa</italic> root-length inhibition bioassay has been recommended for the routine monitoring of water pollution since it is quite sensitive and a valid indicator of toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748233712436639">Fiskesjo, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748233712436639">Gupta and Ahmad, 2011</xref>). <italic>A. cepa</italic> has been well documented to respond to externally imposed stress, like that of heavy metals, organic solvents, trichloroethylene (TCE), pesticides, and hence serves as plausible candidate for biomonitoring the pesticides/heavy metal/TCE pollution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748233712436639">Fatima and Ahmad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0748233712436639">Tabrez and Ahmad, 2010</xref>). </p>
<p>Plants functioning in an aerobic environment are often subjected to continuous threat from molecular oxygen which is converted into toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) like superoxide radical (O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>γ−</sup>), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), hydroxyl radical (OH<sup>γ−</sup>) and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748233712436639">Khan and Panda, 2002</xref>). These ROS have the capacity to degrade almost all cell components including membrane lipids, proteins and DNA. Toxic hydrogen peroxide is a product of peroxisomal and chloroplast oxidative reactions and can act both as an oxidant and as a reductant. It is the most stable form of the ROS and is capable of rapid diffusion across cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233712436639">Del Rio et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Heavy metals are known to cause irreversible damage to a number of vital metabolic constituents and important biomolecules. They also cause irreversible injury to the plant cell and its membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748233712436639">Chandra and Kulshreshtha, 2004</xref>). Therefore, heavy metal analysis seemed to be necessary both in the test water sample and in the exposed <italic>A. cepa</italic> bulbs.</p>
<p>The toxic effects of ROS are counteracted by both the enzymatic and the nonenzymatic antioxidant systems such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), ascorbate peroxidases (APXs), ascorbic acids (ASCs), glutathione (GSH), tocopherol (Toc; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748233712436639">Ahmad et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748233712436639">Gupta and Ahmad, 2011</xref>). Normally cellular compartment contains more than one enzymatic activity that detoxifies particular ROS: for example, the cytosol contains at least three enzymatic activities that scavenge H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>—that is APX, GPX and peroxiredoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748233712436639">Nobuhiro and Mittler, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>GSH is the major nonprotein thiol and a versatile antioxidant in most plants, prokaryotes and animals. GSH is involved in the enzymatic detoxification of activated oxygen species and participates in the ASC-GSH cycle, for peroxide removal in the chloroplasts of plants. Its function in stress reactions is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748233712436639">Gill and Tuteja, 2010</xref>). </p>
<p>Ascorbate (ASC) is a major metabolite in plants. It is an antioxidant and, in association with other components of the antioxidant system, protects plants against oxidative damage resulting from aerobic metabolism, photosynthesis and a range of pollutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748233712436639">Drazkiewicz et al., 2003</xref>). ASC is also a cofactor for certain enzymes. ASC occurs in the cell wall where it provides a first line of defence against ozone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0748233712436639">Smirnoff and Pallanca, 1996</xref>). </p>
<p>Toc is a lipid-soluble antioxidant found in all plant parts and is a potential scavenger of ROS and lipid radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748233712436639">Kruk et al., 2005</xref>). α-Toc is the major vitamin E found in leaf chloroplasts, where it is located in the chloroplast envelope, thylakoid membranes and plastoglobuli, and functions both as an antioxidant and as a nonantioxidant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748233712436639">Bosch, 2005</xref>). Toc prevents the chain propagation step in lipid auto-oxidation, and this makes it an effective free radical trap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0748233712436639">Serbinova and Packer, 1994</xref>). In addition, Toc acts as a scavenger of oxygen radicals, especially O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>γ−</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748233712436639">Fryer, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Carotenoids (CARs) are the pigments that are found in plants and micro-organisms. There are over 600 CARs occurring in nature. These lipid-soluble antioxidants play a multitude of functions in plant metabolism including oxidative stress. CARs harbour light energy and transfer it to chlorophyll. They also protect the photosynthetic apparatus by quenching a triplet sensitizer, singlet oxygen and other harmful free radicals which are naturally formed during photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748233712436639">Ahmad et al., 2009</xref>). They are responsible for the orange colour of the carrot, for which this class of chemicals is named, and for the colours of many other fruits and vegetables, such as sweet potatoes and orange cantaloupe melon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748233712436639">Anderson, 1994</xref>). </p>
<p>All plants produce an amazing diversity of secondary metabolites. One of the most important groups of these metabolites is the phenolic compound. An increased phenylopropanoid metabolism as well as the amount of phenolic compounds has been reported under different environmental factors and stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233712436639">Diaz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0748233712436639">Sakihama and Yamasaki, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The functions of the aforementioned biomolecules under stress conditions are well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748233712436639">Ahmad et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748233712436639">Gill and Tuteja, 2010</xref>). Hence, their levels could serve as a good estimate of oxidative stress generated in the plant system exposed to MRWW. Moreover, application of sewage sludge on agricultural, arable fields for enhancing productivity has been a common practice in India, for many years. Use of surface water, obviously contaminated with various toxicants, for agricultural purpose is also well known. Continuous use of waste water for irrigation leads to the enrichment of micronutrients including heavy metals in the soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0748233712436639">Singh and Agrawal, 2010</xref>). Nutritional status of vegetables like onion especially obtained by irrigation with water carrying the refinery waste seemed to be essential to study the harmful effect of RWW. Furthermore, present investigation was also aimed at the estimation of various antioxidants and pro-oxidants in the <italic>A. cepa</italic> system exposed to RWW. </p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>Ascorbate oxidase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, horseradish peroxidase (HRPO) and perchloric acid were obtained from Sigma Chem. Co. (St Louis, Missouri, USA). Calf thymus DNA, phenol red, dextrose, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), triton-X-100, sulphosalicylic acid, dinitrophenyl hydrazine, 5,5′-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) and thiourea were obtained from SRL, Chemicals, Mumbai, India. ASC and thiobarbituric acid were obtained from Himedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd (Mumbai). Tricarboxylic acid was collected from Qualigens Fine Chemical (Mumbai). All other chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade. The small bulbs of <italic>A. cepa</italic> (red variety) were purchased from the local market. The waste water was collected from the surrounding area of Mathura refinery, Mathura, UP (India) in sterile glass bottles as per the method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748233712436639">APHA (2005)</xref>. Prior to use, the particulate matter was removed by means of filtration using Whatman No. 1 filter paper.</p>
<p>Present study was based on the exposure of <italic>A. cepa </italic>(onion) to different concentrations of Mathura refinery waste water (MRWW) that is 0.25×, 0.5×, 0.75× and 1.0× along with untreated control to estimate the levels of certain nonenzymatic antioxidant biomolecules.</p>

<p>The basic protocol of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748233712436639">Fiskesjo (1985)</xref> was followed with slight modification. Test tubes (60 ml capacity) filled with serially diluted MRWW (0.25×, 0.50×, 0.75× and 1.0×) were taken and on each test tube one onion bulb was placed. Aquaguard-purified water was used as the negative control in all the experiments. The treatment was continued for 2 days in a dark chamber at room temperature. After 2 days, all the onion bulbs were taken out and used for enzymatic studies.</p>

<italic>GSH estimation</italic>. GSH levels were estimated by the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748233712436639">Jollow et al. (1974)</xref>, in 100 μl of <italic>A. cepa</italic> homogenates using the classical thiol reagent DTNB (0.1 mol L<sup>−1</sup> phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) at 25°C. The yellow colour developed by the reaction of GSH with DTNB was read at 412 nm.</p>
<p>
<italic>ASC estimation. </italic>ASC content was determined using the bipyridyl method as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748233712436639">Knorzer et al. (1996)</xref>. An ASC standard calibration curve was previously run, and an extinction coefficient of 16.5 mol (L cm)<sup>−1</sup> was obtained. For the determination of ASC contents, <italic>A. cepa</italic> homogenates (125 μl) were neutralized with 25 μl of 1.5 mol L<sup>−1</sup> triethanolamine, and after mixing, 150 μl of 150 mmol L<sup>−1</sup> sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) and 150 μl of water were added. For the determination of total ASC (ASC + docosahexaenoic acid), the samples were neutralized, phosphate buffer and water were added and then 75 μl of 10 mmol L<sup>−1</sup> dithiothreitol was added and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The absorbance of the reaction mixture was recorded at 525 nm.</p>
<p>
<italic>Toc estimation. </italic>Toc content was assayed as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748233712436639">Backer et al. (1980)</xref>. Five grams of fresh tissue was homogenized with 100 ml of a mixture of petroleum ether and ethanol (2:1.6, v/v), and the extract was centrifuged at 10,000 r/min for 20 min and the supernatant was used for estimation of Toc. To 1 ml of the extract, 200 μl of 2% 2,2-dipyridyl in ethanol was added and mixed thoroughly and kept in dark for 5 min. The resulting red colour was diluted with 4 ml of distilled water and mixed well. The colour in the aqueous layer was measured at 520 nm.

<italic>Total phenolic estimation. </italic>Total phenol was estimated by the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748233712436639">Malick and Singh (1980)</xref>. Five grams of fresh plant tissue was ground in a pestle and mortar with 100 ml of 80% ethanol. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 r/min for 20 min. The supernatant was evaporated to dryness. The residue obtained was dissolved with 100 ml of distilled water and used as extract. To 2 ml of the extract, 500 μl of Folin-Ciocalteau reagent was added. After 3 min, 2 ml of 20% Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> solution was added and mixed thoroughly. The mixture was kept in boiling water for exactly 1 min and after cooling the absorbance was read at 650 nm (phenols react with phosphomolybdic acid in Folin-Ciocalteau reagent in alkaline medium and produce blue coloured complex called molybdenum blue). Total phenol was determined using a standard curve prepared using different concentrations of gallic acid (0.1%).</p>

<title>Discussion </title>
<p>It is well known that RWW exposure induces an alteration in enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant defence system of the exposed organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748233712436639">Ilangovan and Vivekanandan, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748233712436639">Khan et al., 2001</xref>). However, very few reports have documented the effect in plant system. This study explores the alterations in nonenzymatic antioxidants of model plant system, <italic>A. cepa</italic>, exposed to varying concentrations of MRWW. GSH, ASC, Toc and CAR levels were quantified in MRWW-exposed onions and compared with untreated control. The enhancement in the level of these antioxidants would be an indication of the toxicity of MRWW on <italic>A. cepa</italic> system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748233712436639">Gill and Tuteja, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>
<italic>A. cepa</italic> is a simple vegetable and offers a good experimental model for <italic>in vivo</italic> evaluation of toxicity of pure chemicals and complex mixture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748233712436639">Lerda et al., 2010</xref>). It has been reported that roots of <italic>A. cepa</italic> are very useful in toxicity testing because the root tips are often the first to be exposed to chemicals in the water and soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748233712436639">Abu and Mba, 2010</xref>); and therefore, <italic>A. cepa</italic> toxicity test is used all over the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748233712436639">Grant, 1999</xref>). </p>
<p>The test antioxidants are found at high concentrations in chloroplasts as well as in other cellular compartments and present a major defence function against oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748233712436639">Noctor and Foyer, 1998</xref>). In the present study, the effect of the MRWW on nutrient contents and antioxidant status in <italic>A. cepa</italic> (onion) was investigated. The level of ASC, GSH, Toc, CAR and phenolics was found to be increased after MRWW treatment as compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233712436639">Figures 1</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748233712436639"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748233712436639"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748233712436639"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0748233712436639">5</xref>). These are the major nonenzymatic biomolecules of antioxidant system which are required for the detoxification of ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748233712436639">Ahmad et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0748233712436639">McKersie et al., 1990</xref>). ASC and GSH are considered as the most important antioxidants involved in protection against ROS/free radicals through the ASC/GSH cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748233712436639">Drazkiewicz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748233712436639">Kuzniak and Maria, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0748233712436639">Tabrez and Ahmad, 2010</xref>). A rise in GSH level (76%) and ASC level (64%) with respect to control may account for the significant reduction in free radical levels.</p>
<p>GSH functions as an antioxidant in many ways. It can react chemically with singlet oxygen as well as superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, and thus functions directly as a free radical scavenger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0748233712436639">Valko et al., 2007</xref>). The ASC-GSH cycle also plays an important role in maintaining the ASC level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233712436639">Hancock and Viola, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748233712436639">Noctor and Foyer, 1998</xref>). In addition to the importance of ASC-GSH cycle, it plays a role in preventing the activities of enzymes that contain prosthetic group. In this way, ASC and GSH are recycled when H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is scavenged in living cells.</p>
<p>A significant increase in GSH content was recorded by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748233712436639">Mishra et al. (2006)</xref> in <italic>Bacopa monnieri</italic> L. exposed to heavy metal, Cd<sup>2+</sup>. The increased level of GSH during Cd<sup>2+</sup> stress may possibly be due to induced transcription of the genes for GSH biosynthesis such as γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione synthetase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0748233712436639">Xiang and Oliver, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0748233712436639">Zengin and Munzuroglu (2005)</xref> reported a remarkable induction in ASC level in <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> L. under the treatment of heavy metal mixture.</p>
<p>Tocs significantly contribute to the plant tolerance against oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748233712436639">Bosch, 2005</xref>). They interact with the polyunsaturated acyl group of lipids, stabilize membrane, scavenge and quench various ROS and lipid-soluble by-products of oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0748233712436639">Shao et al., 2006</xref>). The induction in Toc level in onion bulbs following MRWW exposure is also indicative of oxidative stress generated by toxicants present in the test waste water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748233712436639">Figure 3</xref>). This draws support from previous workers who demonstrated that oxidative stress actually triggered synthesis of certain low-molecular-weight antioxidants like Toc by activating their genes in some plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0748233712436639">Shao and Chu, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0748233712436639">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). This antioxidant somehow deactivates photosynthesis-derived ROS (mainly O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>γ−</sup> and OH<sup>γ</sup>) and prevents the propagation of lipid peroxidation by scavenging lipid peroxyl radicals in thylakoid membranes.</p>
<p>The induction in CAR levels in MRWW-treated onion bulbs can serve as a good biomarker of some toxicants, like hydrocarbons and/or heavy metals, in the test waste water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748233712436639">Foyer and Harbioson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0748233712436639">Siefermann-Hams, 1987</xref>). This waste water-imposed insult was obviously sufficient to induce the CAR levels which were found to be positively correlated with the concentrations of MRWW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748233712436639">Figure 4</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0748233712436639">Singh and Sinha (2005)</xref> also reported an increased CAR content in <italic>Brassica juncea</italic> L. grown on soil amended with tannery waste.</p>
<p>Phenolics possess hydroxyl and carboxyl groups with the ability to bind metal ions in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748233712436639">Jung et al., 2003</xref>). Antioxidant action of phenolic compounds is due to their high tendency to chelate metal ions. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748233712436639">Ilangovan and Vivekanandan (1992)</xref> reported a high level of total phenolic compounds in the leaves of <italic>Vigna mungo</italic> L., Hepper plant grown in oil-polluted soil containing high level of hydrocarbons. Present study clearly suggests that the induction in the levels of phenolic compounds in <italic>A. cepa</italic> bulbs might be due to the interference of both the heavy metals and the hydrocarbons present in MRWW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0748233712436639">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0748233712436639">Table 1</xref>; communicated data). The enhanced levels of phenolic compounds were recorded in several plants against the exposure with heavy metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748233712436639">Agrawal and Deepak, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748233712436639">Arora et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748233712436639">Giertych et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0748233712436639">Rice-Evans et al., 1997</xref>). In fact, phenolics are supposed to facilitate the chelation of metal ions and thus to prevent ROS production through Fenton’s reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0748233712436639">Rice-Evans et al., 1997</xref>). </p>
<p>A uniform rise in the levels of reduced GSH, ASC, Toc and CAR as a result of MRWW exposure to <italic>A. cepa </italic>bulbs can also serve as a potential biomarker for RWW toxicity. In fact, <italic>A. cepa </italic>root inhibition test is a cost-effective toxicity bioassay routinely used in water-monitoring studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748233712436639">Fiskesjo, 1985</xref>). Therefore, its efficacy would be greatly increased if antioxidant studies are also included in the same onion bulbs exposed to the sample for the standard <italic>A. cepa</italic> bioassay.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Waste water stress signalling in plants is an important area of studies to activate their nonenzymatic defence system. Therefore, the basic understanding of the mechanisms underlying the functioning of stress genes is important for the survival of plant under stress. Based on our present study, we conclude that GSH and ASC in <italic>A. cepa</italic> system could serve as a potential biomarker for the presence of toxicants like heavy metals and their hazards. <italic>A. cepa</italic> system can also be successfully used for monitoring the changes in the levels of nonenzymatic biomolecules as a result of exposure with MRWW. Phenolic compounds could be a major determinant of antioxidant potential of food plants. The enhanced level of Toc and CAR implies that the stress was sufficient to affect the plant system in a variety of ways.</p>
