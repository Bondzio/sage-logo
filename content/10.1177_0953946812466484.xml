<p>Does human nature possess normative significance? If so, what is it and what implications does it have for biotechnology? This essay critically examines three answers to these questions. One answer focuses on human nature as the ground of natural goods or goods dependent on human nature, another answer finds normative significance in the indeterminacy or malleability of human nature, and a third answer treats human nature as a natural sign of divine grace. Kathryn Tanner, who offers the second answer, and Karl Barth, who offers the third, deny that nature has normative status in itself, apart from grace, but differ over the relation of grace to human nature as created. While indebted to Tanner, this essay favors Barth’s view as best suited to a Christian ethics of biotechnology.</p>

<body>
<p>Modern ethics is often thought to have banished nature from the normative realm, but nature seems ever capable of slipping past the guards and re-entering, if not as a welcome member in good standing then at least as a vocal petitioner for inclusion. This circumstance is nowhere more apparent than in the ethics of human biotechnology, where sometimes contentious arguments for and against the normative significance of human nature have been prominent during the past decade.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0953946812466484">1</xref></sup> Most of the literature assumes that it will one day be possible to deliberately alter human functions, traits and capacities by biomedical technology. This assumption is plausible, but it is difficult to determine what implications it has for human nature. Specifically, it is far from clear (1) which interventions would truly alter these functions, traits or capacities (in contrast, say, to having only a temporary effect on them); (2) whether human nature itself or only these functions, etc., would be altered; and (3) if human nature is indeed altered, whether the alteration would be to the human species or only to the individual human beings who have undergone the alteration(s). For the sake of the argument, this essay will assume the lowest threshold, namely, that the technological alteration of certain functions, traits or capacities may indeed count as an alteration of human nature, whether of individuals or of the species. If so, then such alterations raise the question whether human nature has meaning or value that must be taken into account when evaluating them.</p>
<p>Does human nature possess normative significance, and if so, what is it, and what implications, if any, does it have for biotechnology? To answer this question we must begin with human nature itself. Because this essay focuses on biotechnology, it can dispense with a comprehensive definition. Instead, human nature will be understood narrowly to denote human functions, traits and capacities insofar as these are now or may someday be alterable by biomedical intervention (as distinct from environmental interventions). To ascribe normative status to human nature is therefore to claim that one or more of these functions, traits or capacities, or some relationship among them, or even some feature that characterizes them as a whole, possesses value or significance, whether in themselves or in relation to other values, and that this value or significance must be taken into account, where relevant, in ethical evaluations of human biotechnology.</p>
<p>This essay articulates the claim that the normative significance of human nature, so understood, is found in the relation of human nature to divine grace. More precisely, the claim is that human nature has meaning and value as a natural sign of God’s grace to humanity in Jesus Christ. This claim differs from a kind of claim that is often made regarding the normative significance of human nature. That significance is often identified with nature itself or with some natural state or condition. In these cases, nature can at least in principle be considered apart from divine grace. It is not surprising that the result of this kind of theology is often a grace-less ethic, one that has had problematic implications in the areas of sex, gender and disability. A vigorous alternative to this tendency to invest nature with normative significance apart from grace is found in the recent work of Kathryn Tanner.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0953946812466484">2</xref></sup> This essay shares Tanner’s conviction that the normative status of nature is strongly determined by grace and is indebted to her clear and rigorous exposition. At the same time, Tanner denies that human nature in its creaturely form possesses any meaning or value that conditions efforts to transform it. To deny that human nature possesses normative significance in this sense is to deny that there is anything about our creaturely nature that must be respected by biotechnological interventions into human functions, traits or capacities, and this denial is difficult to reconcile with the claim that our creaturely nature is good. The question, then, is whether it is possible to hold, with Tanner, that human nature as created by God is related to divine grace in such a way that it has no meaning or value merely in itself while also holding that it does have meaning and value precisely in its relation to grace. An affirmative answer to this question is found in Karl Barth’s view that human nature possesses normative significance insofar as it is created by God to be a natural sign of God’s grace.</p>
<p>This essay begins by considering several versions of the claim that human nature possesses moral significance as the ground of goods that are either natural or dependent on human nature. In all of these versions the normative significance of nature is intelligible apart from divine grace (even if some proponents would argue that this significance is ultimately dependent on grace). The essay next considers several versions of the claim that human nature is too indeterminate or malleable to ground natural goods or goods that are dependent on nature, even though normative significance of a mostly formal kind may attach to the very indeterminacy or malleability of nature itself. The most compelling version of this claim is that of Tanner, for whom the normative significance of human nature lies entirely in the susceptibility of nature to the working of divine grace. The essay then turns to Barth’s view of human nature as the creaturely sign of divine grace, focusing on the normative status he ascribes to the biological lifespan (‘allotted time’) in relation to the temporality God assumed in the humanity of Jesus Christ. The essay concludes with a very brief consideration of the relevance of Barth’s position for radical life-extension technologies.</p>
<sec id="section1-0953946812466484">
<title>Human Nature as Ground of Human Goods</title>
<p>What does it mean to claim that human nature has normative significance in itself, apart from its relation to divine grace? It has often meant that human nature consists of essential characteristics that cannot be deliberately altered without violating the order in which the goodness of creation inheres. On this view someone might argue that while efforts to increase life expectancy by curing diseases and improving sanitary and environmental conditions are laudable, inasmuch as they enable more people to approximate the biological lifespan of roughly 120 years, the lifespan itself is an essential characteristic of human nature and cannot be extended without violating the created order. However, it is more typical of this approach to the normative significance of human nature to argue that there are complex connections between human nature and human goods, so that to alter human nature is to threaten certain goods or to forfeit them in favor of inferior goods. For example, some opponents of life-extension technologies, including Leon Kass, argue that a determinate lifespan, as opposed to one that can be indefinitely extended, enables human beings to have a determinate good as well as one that can in principle be fulfilled. Conscious that we have by nature a limited lifespan, we conceive and pursue goods as goods that could in principle be realized in a temporally limited human life, and we proportion our desires and preferences to our natural limit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0953946812466484">3</xref></sup> If all goes well we can hope to approach the end of our lives with the sense that we have completed our projects. By contrast, some proponents of life-extension technologies envision scenarios in which individuals have virtually unlimited time to pursue the objects of their desires and preferences. Desires have no natural termination point, so human beings are free to follow their desires until they simply grow tired of their objects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0953946812466484">4</xref></sup> Here, projects are not so much completed (in principle they can always go on further) as abandoned.</p>
<p>In short, the argument that there is meaning or value in the biological limits of the human lifespan need not appeal directly to nature. It may appeal instead to what is thought to be a widely shared or more attractive conception of the human good, one that is inseparable from a feature of our biological nature and would be endangered by technological alteration of that feature. In this case, human nature has normative significance as the ground of natural goods. A different version of this approach proceeds in the opposite direction, arguing from a non-natural good to a natural condition that grounds it. Thus, Francis Fukuyama argues that the most fundamental values and commitments of liberal democratic societies, such as the mutual recognition of fellow human beings as equals, rest on the natural equality of human beings. By threatening the natural equality on which they are based, technological alteration of human nature undermines these values and commitments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0953946812466484">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In whatever form they take, these conceptions of the normative significance of human nature presuppose that human nature is stable enough for determinate and enduring human goods or liberal democratic values to attach to it. If human nature is in flux or varies radically from one individual to another, then natural human goods will also be changing and variable and liberal democratic values will be unmoored from human nature. Is this presupposition of a stable human nature tenable? The most widely accepted versions of it are Aristotelian: Human nature consists of a set of essential characteristics which all humans and (at least in their distinctively human versions) only humans share. It is often thought that the Darwinian discovery that species are the product of contingent evolutionary processes has invalidated the notion of unchanging essences shared by all humans and only humans. Against this assumption Jean Porter argues that while species themselves are the products of contingent evolutionary processes it does not follow that our concepts of species share their contingency. Even in a post-Darwinian context we can explain traits or behaviors of an organism only if we know what kind of organism it is and can understand its traits or behaviors as characteristic of that kind. Similarly, we can explain the development of organisms and the variability among them only by referring to concepts of a fully formed or paradigmatic member of their kind.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0953946812466484">6</xref></sup> Porter thus preserves the basic Aristotelian understanding of essences as formal and final causes in the face of the variation and change that characterize species as products of evolutionary processes.</p>
<p>Porter’s defense of Aristotelian essentialism in the light of Darwinian evolution is convincing, but because biological nature possesses normative significance for her only indirectly, as mediated through human inclinations and ultimately through social and historical forms of life, her position is not directly relevant to the topic of this essay. By contrast, Francis Fukuyama argues for a form of Aristotelian essentialism that is consistent with evolutionary biology and has direct normative significance. As indicated above, Fukuyama worries that biotechnological alterations of human nature threaten liberal democratic commitments to equality and rights. In the face of this threat our task is to protect ‘the full range of our complex, evolved natures from attempts at self-modification’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0953946812466484">7</xref></sup> But if our natures are complex and evolved, how can we determine whether a biotechnological intervention alters human nature and thus threatens liberal democracy? Fukuyama’s answer rests on a biostatistical conception of human nature as ‘the sum of the behavior and characteristics that are typical of the human species, arising from genetic rather than environmental factors’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0953946812466484">8</xref></sup> By ‘typical’, Fukuyama has in mind a statistical norm which allows for variability and change (and is thus compatible with evolutionary biology). A trait counts as a component of human nature if its distribution among humans can be represented on a bell curve with a median point and a relatively small standard deviation. The median need not be fixed but may shift over time as, for example, median height and life expectancy have for humans during the past century.</p>
<p>However, Fukuyama’s argument fails at two points. First, it is unclear which alterations of human traits count as alterations of human nature itself. Should we consider the dramatic changes in human height and life expectancy over the past century as changes of human nature? Fukuyama believes that we should not. But then it seems that equally dramatic changes to other traits brought about by technology would not count either. If, on the other hand, changes in height or life expectancy do count as changes of nature, then there seems to be nothing wrong in principle with changing human nature. In general, the problem with every attempt to ground the normative significance of nature in a biostatistical norm is that any norm that is flexible enough to accommodate the change and variation we observe in the human species will also permit a wide range of technological alterations. Such a norm is therefore unable to secure the stability of human nature that is needed in order to ground determinate and enduring goods that are either natural or dependent on human nature.</p>
<p>The second problem pertains to Aristotelian approaches more generally. These approaches treat metaphysical forms (Porter) or biostatistical norms (Fukuyama) as paradigms, namely, as ideal or fully realized states of functions or traits on the basis of which we can identify variant instances of the same function or trait and determine their degrees of approximation to the ideal or fully realized state. In this way forms or norms supply a ground for normative judgments while also accommodating the extraordinary change and variation in human functions and traits. But what if biological science does not support the assumption that human functions and traits conform to paradigmatic forms or norms at all? In this case it becomes even less likely that human nature is stable enough to ground natural goods or goods that depend on human nature. Whatever normative significance human nature may possess, it will not consist in or rely on a stable human nature. It is beyond the scope of this essay to judge whether biological science favors the position we are about to examine over the Aristotelian positions we have just examined. But this newer position is of interest insofar as it requires a radically different approach to the normative significance of human nature in relation to biotechnology.</p>

<title>Normative Significance without Human Nature</title>
<p>In a highly influential study Georges Canguilhem criticized the attempt to define pathologies as quantitative divergences from a normal state, arguing instead that living organisms establish their own norms under different conditions. Canguilhem rejects the notion that we can represent the normal state of an organism as a statistical norm from which pathologies diverge and which medical treatment attempts to restore. Rather, biological life is itself a norm-generating process, and a healthy state is one in which an organism is able to generate norms that enable it to thrive in whatever environment it is in. Thus, as Canguilhem demonstrates with numerous examples, statistical norms of functions and traits differ in accordance with environments. In the case of human beings, moreover, the environment is significantly social as well as biological, so that statistical norms reflect not only natural conditions but also social values. For example, statistical norms of life expectancy partly reflect the value a society places on efforts to ameliorate conditions that shorten life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0953946812466484">9</xref></sup> From this perspective it is misleading to think of pathologies as divergences from the norm. ‘To the extent that living beings diverge from the specific type, are they abnormal in that they endanger the specific form or are they inventors on the road to new forms?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0953946812466484">10</xref></sup> Canguilhem opts for the latter alternative. Thus, an anomaly may reflect a severe limitation in the capacity of an organism to generate new norms, but it may also represent the organism’s solution to an environmental challenge which eventually turns out (via natural selection) to be the new normal state in that environment. Anomalies, then, are themselves norms rather than departures from a norm.</p>
<p>In sum, Canguilhem argues that physiological norms are not natural givens but the provisional effects of the norm-generating capacity of biological life in specific natural (and, for human beings, social) environments. His argument thus suggests that from a biological perspective human nature is simply the history of the past and present adaptations of the human organism to its many environments. If so, then human nature is fundamentally variable, indeterminate and malleable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0953946812466484">11</xref></sup> François Dagognet, a onetime student of Canguilhem, has taken his teacher’s position a step further. Noting, for example, the inherent manipulability of DNA as bits of information, he proposes that the indeterminacy, malleability and open-endedness of nature are, in themselves, an invitation to alter it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0953946812466484">12</xref></sup> What is significant about nature is precisely its plasticity. None of the authors we will now encounter refers to Canguilhem or Dagognet, but they emphasize the same indeterminacy and plasticity of nature. It would seem that to concede that human nature is indeterminate or plastic is to deny it any normative significance at all. But what distinguishes these authors is their insistence on finding normative significance in the very indeterminacy and plasticity of nature.</p>
<p>The first position we will consider places greater stress on the indeterminacy of nature than on its plasticity. This position is rooted in German philosophical anthropology. Its lineage has been traced by Jürgen Mittelstrass from its origin in Nietzsche to its subsequent development by Max Scheler, Helmut Plessner and Arnold Gehlen. For thinkers in this lineage, man, in Nietzsche’s terms, is ‘the not-yet-determined being’, or in Scheler’s terms, ‘the ‘X that can behave in a world-open manner to an unlimited extent’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0953946812466484">13</xref></sup> According to Mittelstrass himself, ‘There is no “natural” fate in the becoming of man, as an individual or as a species, that might be definitely determined by biological laws’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0953946812466484">14</xref></sup> Human nature thus requires human beings to determine themselves. In Mittelstrass’s words, ‘self-determination is not only the fate of the individual, but is also the fate of humanity itself; it belongs to the essence of humanity’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0953946812466484">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is worth noting that the very indeterminacy of nature assumes normative significance at precisely this point. If continual self-determination of the indeterminate is of our essence, it follows that we would violate our essence if biotechnology were to bring an end to this process by bringing our nature to some ideal but fixed state. Our nature must remain indeterminate. In principle, this requirement might limit what biotechnology can justifiably do. This point can be illustrated by Karl Rahner, who contributed significantly to the influence of this school of thought in Catholic moral theology after the Second Vatican Council. Rahner’s opposition to genetic technology in the second of his two essays on the topic is often thought to contradict his emphasis on the openness and indeterminacy of human nature in the first essay.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0953946812466484">16</xref></sup> However, his position is consistent given his assumption that by determining the genetic identity of our offspring we are denying them the freedom to determine their own nature. Nevertheless, Rahner’s position is problematic on other grounds. For one thing, we now know that genes alone are responsible for very few human traits. Moreover, even if a child’s genetic identity significantly limits her self-determining freedom, it is not clear how parental determination of that identity would limit her freedom any more than its determination by the natural lottery (and if the natural lottery itself limits her freedom, then her nature is not as open-ended and indeterminate as Rahner supposes in the first place). Finally, as Foucaultians remind us, the conformity of bodies to societal norms operates most effectively by respecting our allegedly self-determining freedom rather than by suppressing it. From this perspective, this German tradition of philosophical anthropology is unaware that the combination of indeterminate and malleable nature with formally free choice is what enables society to normalize populations. But in any case, the normative significance of human nature according to this position is purely formal. No longer the ground of natural or nature-dependent goods, nature is merely the impetus to the ongoing task of determining what nature shall be.</p>
<p>The second position we will consider in this context stresses the plasticity of nature in addition to its indeterminacy. As it is for Dagognet, the susceptibility of nature to intentional human alteration is for the representatives of this position an invitation to transform it. According to Philip Hefner, we cannot ignore the extent to which contemporary science and technology have breached the boundaries between humans, nature and technology. On the side of nature, terms such as ‘self-generating’, ‘autocatalytic’ and ‘autopoeisis’ indicate a kind of freedom of unprogrammed behavior once thought exclusive to humans but now shared by humans, nature and technology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0953946812466484">17</xref></sup> Meanwhile, from the human side, terms such as ‘cyborg’ and ‘technosapiens’ indicate a condition in which technology is no longer external to humans but inextricable from their nature. Indeed, we must now realize that ‘humans and their technology are a set of nature’s possibilities’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0953946812466484">18</xref></sup> It is in this context that Hefner invokes the <italic>imago Dei</italic>: ‘If self-generation, autopoeisis—the making of ourselves—is written into the very substance of nature, as well as into the fundamental code of human nature and technology, we must consider that it is a clue to the nature of reality and, therefore, to the nature of God.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0953946812466484">19</xref></sup> Nature itself is a restless drive for new possibilities, and ‘[w]hen we participate in this drive for new possibilities, we participate also in God’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0953946812466484">20</xref></sup> Thus for Hefner no less than for Mittelstrass, human nature is characterized by a feature that only appears to deny normative significance to nature. In Hefner’s case the plasticity of nature constitutes it as both the key to human meaning and divine purpose and the site of the ongoing enactment of this meaning and purpose. Once again, however, the normative significance of human nature is purely formal, an insistent yet empty summons to self-alteration.</p>
<p>Hefner’s overcoming of the boundaries between nature, technology and humanity; his description of human nature as endless becoming; and his panentheist concept of God are all driven by a combination of process theology with a quasi-Hegelian drama of technology as alienation from our nature and reconciliation with it. It is more a theological vision than a rigorously articulated theological statement, as befits the genre of the popular lecture in which it is articulated. By contrast, Kathryn Tanner’s ascription of normative significance to the plasticity of human nature plays a key role in what is the strongest theological statement of this position to date. Tanner’s explicit remarks on biotechnology are very few, and to present her position in this context is to risk exaggerating those remarks and drawing implications from them which she would not endorse. Nevertheless, her unusually thoughtful and rigorous treatment of human nature and the <italic>imago Dei</italic> compels attention to her position. Tanner distinguishes two ways of understanding human beings in the image of God. One way attempts ‘to specify some set of clearly bounded, self-enclosed properties, a given human nature, which both reflects the divine nature and sets humans off from all other creatures’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0953946812466484">21</xref></sup> Drawing on Greek patristic theologians such as Cyril of Alexandria and Gregory of Nyssa, Tanner proposes another way, one that begins with the Word of God, the second person of the Trinity, as the primary image of God, and only then turns to human beings, who image God in an important yet secondary sense. In Tanner’s words, human beings ‘come to image God only when they take on that divine image and are deified, formed according to the divine Word as Christ’s humanity was’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0953946812466484">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>For Tanner these two ways of understanding the <italic>imago Dei</italic> correlate with distinct conceptions of human nature. The first way is associated with ‘an interest in a stable, fixed, and clearly demarcated human nature, the sort of nature that biogenetics calls into question’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0953946812466484">23</xref></sup> This of course recalls the Aristotelian position with which we began. The second way breaks sharply with any such conception of human nature. As Tanner puts it, ‘Since human beings do not image God in and of themselves but only when radically reworked into the divine image through Christ, it is the plasticity of human nature that becomes important. Plasticity is the capacity that allows humans to image God.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0953946812466484">24</xref></sup> This claim about the plasticity of human nature demands our attention, but clarity regarding these implications requires us to look more closely at the various levels of the <italic>imago Dei</italic> in her position. At the highest level, of course, is the Word, the second person of the Trinity who shares the divine nature and thus images God as ‘the perfect manifestation of all that the first person is’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0953946812466484">25</xref></sup> By contrast, humans image God ‘by participating in what they are not’, namely, God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0953946812466484">26</xref></sup> By virtue of its hypostatic union with the Word, however, Christ’s humanity ‘has the divine image for its own’ and thus images God perfectly, much as the second person images the first person.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0953946812466484">27</xref></sup> Other humans, of course, lack this hypostatic union with the Word. Nevertheless, they image God by approximating it in their own manner as they draw near, through Christ, to the divine image and cling to it. In this sense they too may be said to image God in a strong sense. Moreover, in what Tanner calls a ‘strong weak sense’, humans image God as their creaturely lives are remade in accordance with their attachment to the Word. In both of these senses, humans image God by participation in what they are not, namely, the divine image itself. Finally, humans image God in the very indeterminacy or plasticity of their nature, inasmuch as these qualities of their nature resemble God’s own limitless and incomprehensible nature. For Tanner this is the <italic>imago Dei</italic> in its weakest sense, as the resemblance to God of human nature as it is in and of itself, apart from participation in what humans are not.</p>
<p>How is it that the <italic>imago Dei</italic> as Tanner describes it implies the plasticity of human nature? For Tanner the question of human nature is posed as the question of the qualities or capacities human nature must have in order to receive the presence of the divine image and be remade by it. What must human nature be in order to receive and be transformed by what it is not, namely, the divine image? Tanner’s answer is that humans have by nature an almost unlimited capacity to shape themselves by intentionally acting on themselves, and that it is this open-ended plasticity that equips them to receive the divine image and be remade by it. Meanwhile, in addition to this strong weak sense, the same plasticity resembles God’s own unbounded and incomprehensible nature and thus images God in the weak sense, by what it is in and of itself.</p>
<p>At the root of Tanner’s position is the notion of deification. For her, ‘God wants to give us the fullness of God’s own life’, which occurs as we receive the divine Word and are remade by it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0953946812466484">28</xref></sup> Because ‘it is the gift of God’s own life’ that we are given—that which we are not and never will be—our conformity to the divine image is not a gradual process by which our capacities incrementally approximate the divine image but rather a discontinuous leap in which ‘we are aided by grace to live in ways that are not natural to us because in keeping with divine power’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0953946812466484">29</xref></sup> It follows that while our reception of the gift of the Holy Spirit brings about new created capacities in us, such as the dispositions of faith and love, through which our lives are remade in conformity to the divine image, these new capacities remain entirely dependent on the power of the Spirit to accomplish their end of conformity to the divine Word.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0953946812466484">30</xref></sup> In conforming us to the divine image the power of the Holy Spirit does not insinuate itself, as it were, into natural human capacities so that the latter are supernaturally elevated yet still human. Instead this power retains its divine otherness, and we possess it only by clinging to what we are not.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0953946812466484">31</xref></sup> Tanner’s claim regarding the plasticity of human nature thus appears to amount to this: Human capacities which in themselves are incapable of conformity to the divine Word who is the image of God in the most proper sense are enabled by their plasticity—their open-ended and relatively unbounded character—to receive the Holy Spirit as a power that is not in any sense their own and to be remade by this power to conform to the divine Word whose being and goodness are infinitely beyond anything they can claim as their own.</p>
<p>Tanner offers the strongest theological version of the claim that the normative significance of human nature resides in its malleability or plasticity. Moreover, she clearly and decisively grounds this normative significance not in human nature itself but in the relation of human nature to divine grace. It is precisely their openness to divine grace that gives malleability and plasticity their meaning and value. However, there are two problems with her position. First, in her stress on the nearly limitless capability of human beings to alter themselves Tanner privileges reason and will. In her words, ‘These faculties are of interest because of their excessive openness to what exceeds their own or any limited nature.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0953946812466484">32</xref></sup> The point is not only that Tanner endorses a problematic feature of the traditional Western account of the <italic>imago Dei</italic> and one she explicitly criticizes elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0953946812466484">33</xref></sup> Nor should it be overlooked that the principal feature of plasticity for Tanner is not susceptibility to the shaping powers of reason and will but rather to the formative influences of natural and social environments. For human beings, she stresses, external inputs do not merely conform to human nature; rather, human nature is open to being formed in profound ways by the external inputs it takes in while reason and will add to and direct this extraordinary flexibility of human beings in their environments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0953946812466484">34</xref></sup> However, we may ask whether the subordination of the rest of human nature to reason and will understood as purely formal self-forming capacities is inevitable if, as in Tanner’s position, the capacity for intentional self-alteration is stressed while indeterminacy and plasticity are taken to be the definitive characteristics of human nature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0953946812466484">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Second, Tanner’s position deprives our human nature as it is—that is, our capacities and traits as we presently experience and exercise them—of theological and ethical significance. Our nature has meaning and worth only insofar as it is capable of becoming other than it now is, or more precisely, other than what it is as created. Tanner writes, ‘If God wants to give [God’s own goodness] to humans, they have to be elevated beyond what they are themselves as creatures.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0953946812466484">36</xref></sup> It follows that ‘Our nature is perfected and completed, ironically, by making us act unnaturally, in a divine rather than human way.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0953946812466484">37</xref></sup> In Tanner’s theology, God wants to give us the fullness of God’s own life, but to enjoy that life we must be taken beyond our creaturely human nature. Such a theology appears to exclude all grounds on which meaning and value could attach to our nature in its mere creatureliness, prior to its being worked over and remade by the power of the Spirit. At least implicitly, it is a transhumanist theology. And while it is compatible with criteria for the ethical evaluation of actual or proposed transformations of human nature, human nature itself will contribute no normative content to such evaluations.</p>

<sec id="section3-0953946812466484">
<title>Human Nature as Sign of Divine Grace</title>
<p>Is it possible to hold that meaning and value attach to human nature in its creaturely form while also holding, with Tanner, (1) that this meaning and value are found in the relation of human nature to divine grace, and (2) that human nature is indeterminate and plastic in the ways suggested by Canguilhem and Dagognet? If so, then it is possible to hold that human nature has normative significance that must be accounted for in ethical evaluations of biotechnological interventions <italic>without</italic> endorsing any conception of a grace-less nature which leads to the problems Tanner and other critics seek to overcome. This final section of the essay shows how such a position can be found in Karl Barth’s effort, in his theological anthropology, to delineate ‘the reference to the grace of God in human nature itself’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0953946812466484">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>In turning to Barth we are not leaving Tanner behind so much as taking issue with the deificationist orientation of her thought. For Barth as for Tanner, God wills to give human beings a share in the divine life. In Barth’s words, to be human is to be ‘determined by God for life with God’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0953946812466484">39</xref></sup> For Barth as well, Christ is the key to what God resolves from eternity and accomplishes in time in this regard. Finally, as for Tanner, the question of human nature for Barth is the question of the characteristics of human nature that equip the latter to share in the divine life. But in contrast to Tanner, Barth insists that human nature in its creaturely form is suited to this participation and need not undergo any alteration in order to be fit for it.</p>
<p>Barth’s theological anthropology rests on the ontological status of the covenant relationship of human beings with God. In his words, ‘The being [<italic>Sein</italic>] of man … is the being which is … drawn into this [covenant] history inaugurated and controlled by God.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0953946812466484">40</xref></sup> Human beings do not, for Barth, enter into covenant fellowship with God as those whose being is constituted prior to or apart from this covenant. Rather, by virtue of their shared humanity with Jesus Christ, as determined by God from eternity, fellowship with God in the covenant of grace involves the very being of humans. They are ontologically constituted to be God’s covenant partners. The question concerning human nature is therefore the question of the kind of creature who is determined in this way for fellowship with God. And because we know that God created us as the being whose being is this determination for fellowship with God, we also know that God did not create us as beings whose creaturely nature is in conflict with our divine determination. On the contrary: ‘If God gives him this determination … he is obviously … a being to which this determination is not strange but proper.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0953946812466484">41</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Even in his distinction from God, even in his pure humanity, or, as we might say, in his human nature [<italic>Natur</italic>], man cannot be man without being directed to and prepared for [<italic>hingewiesen und vorbereitet</italic>] the fulfillment of his determination, his being in the grace of God, by his correspondence and similarity to this determination for the covenant with God… Consciously or unconsciously, he is the sign [<italic>Zeichen</italic>] here below of what he really is as seen from above, from God. And so he is wholly created with a view to God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0953946812466484">42</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This final point—that our creaturely nature is the sign of our divine determination for fellowship with God—is at the heart of Barth’s conception of the normative status of human nature. We begin with two implications of the relationship between natural sign and divine determination. On the one hand, and in contrast to Tanner, human nature for Barth does not need to become anything other than what it is, as created by God, in order to participate in God’s life, that is, to enjoy covenant fellowship with God. In its very creatureliness, as created by God, human nature is a sign of humanity’s divine determination. To enjoy God’s life requires neither supernatural versions of human capacities (as Thomists argue) nor an external power that transforms human capacities into something other than their creaturely form (as Tanner argues). Fellowship with God is enjoyed in the exercise of our traits and capacities as God created them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this is far from the whole story. For Barth, God’s covenant with us is a covenant of grace. God acts alone, entirely apart from our nature and our activity, to establish and maintain us in it. Even apart from sin human nature has no ability (<italic>Fähigkeit</italic>) or power (<italic>Potenz</italic>) to enter into or remain in covenant fellowship with God. The creaturely nature that is ordained to the covenant is one whose traits and capacities are suited to active enjoyment of fellowship with God. They are <italic>not</italic> suited to attainment of this fellowship in the first place or to continuation in it. For the same reason, although it assumes no supernatural addition and undergoes no transformation to enjoy fellowship with God, our creaturely nature is unintelligible, in its very creatureliness, apart from its ordination to fellowship with God. It has normative significance not in itself or as such but insofar as it is ‘the sign here below of what [it] really is as seen from above’, that is, from its divine determination for fellowship with God. The normative significance of human nature, then, does not rely on any strictly natural form or norm. Barth’s position does not presuppose an Aristotelian concept of human nature, and it is at least compatible with the indeterminacy and plasticity suggested by Canguilhem and Dagognet.</p>
<p>With these implications in mind we are now in a position to examine in more detail Barth’s claim that our creaturely nature is the sign of our divine determination for fellowship with God. We will consider this claim in relation to one aspect of our creaturely nature, namely, our biological lifespan. Human life is not infinite but is bounded by birth and death. For Barth this fact presents an immediate problem. It seems not to signify our divine determination but to contradict it. The problem is not that our desire for life is insatiable or that our preferences exceed the time we are allotted to satisfy them. It is that our divine determination itself seems to require duration rather than limit. ‘For man belongs to God. And he belongs to his fellows… What but an unlimited, permanent duration could be adequate for the fulfillment of this determination?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0953946812466484">43</xref></sup> We are determined for covenant relationships with God and our fellow humans, but how could a limited lifespan allow for the fulfillment of <italic>these</italic> relationships? The very content of the covenant for which we are determined appears to be incompatible with limitation or lack. If so, then our limited lifespan is incompatible with our divine determination and we are by no means justified in acquiescing in it. ‘Man cannot abandon the demand that he should endure and burst the limits of temporality.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0953946812466484">44</xref></sup> ‘Resignation [to a limited lifespan] is incompatible with the fact that life is created by God.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0953946812466484">45</xref></sup> Yet, in spite of the strong case he has just made against it, Barth will nevertheless insist that our natural lifespan <italic>is</italic> a sign of our divine determination. His argument rests on Jesus’ own humanity as the <italic>imago Dei</italic>.</p>
<p>Like Tanner, Barth’s <italic>imago Dei</italic> begins in the Trinity. It refers first of all to God as the model or prototype of whom humanity is the copy, made ‘in the image’ and ‘after the likeness’ of God. In what sense, then, is God the prototype to which the human creature corresponds? For Barth, the ‘Let us make’ of Gen. 1.26 implies differentiation within God’s own being between the summoning I and the summoned Thou. The human I-Thou relation in turn corresponds to this divine prototype.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0953946812466484">46</xref></sup> In keeping with Gen. 1.26-27, Barth goes on to identify the encounter of man and woman as the paradigmatic I-Thou relation and thus the fundamental form in which the human creature corresponds to the divine prototype. This identification is controversial and in various respects problematic. The problems with it should not be denied or minimized, but the topic of this essay directs our attention to a less fundamental but still important aspect of the <italic>imago Dei</italic> that is not encumbered by such problems. Thus Barth asserts that in a derivative but still significant sense we should understand God’s eternity, in which past, present and future are simultaneous, as the divine prototype for creaturely temporality in which past, present and future occur in inexorable succession.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0953946812466484">47</xref></sup> Human beings in their movement from past to present to future are the copy corresponding to God’s eternity, in which past, present and future are simultaneous, as the prototype.</p>
<p>If we apply this point directly to the matter of human temporality, we can immediately see something like Tanner’s weak sense at work: a characteristic of human nature—its relationality or its temporality—resembles the divine nature. But for Barth as for Tanner, if we move directly from God to humanity in this way, we only get a weak imaging of God, and again like Tanner, Barth identifies the <italic>imago Dei</italic> in the strong sense with Christ. However, for Barth it is not the Word as such, as the second person of the Trinity, who is the <italic>imago Dei</italic> in the strong sense as it is for Tanner. Rather, following Col. 1.15, it is the Word incarnate, ‘the firstborn of all creation’. It is in his humanity, and thus in his creaturely nature, that Christ is the <italic>imago Dei</italic> in the primary sense.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0953946812466484">48</xref></sup> I-Thou relationality is fundamental to the <italic>imago Dei</italic> in this strong sense, but once again we may also find it exhibited in a derivative sense in temporality. As for relationality, what characterizes Jesus’ humanity for Barth is his absolute and unconditional being for his fellow humans, which accomplishes in time God’s absolute and unconditional being for humanity that is God’s eternal covenant. However, God’s being for humanity actualized in the humanity of Jesus is itself the repetition of the love that characterizes God’s intra-Trinitarian being. ‘God repeats in this relationship <italic>ad extra</italic> a relationship proper to Himself in His inner divine essence.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0953946812466484">49</xref></sup> Thus, ‘the humanity of Jesus … is the repetition and reflection of God Himself… It is the image of God, the <italic>imago Dei</italic>.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0953946812466484">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the strong sense, then, the <italic>imago Dei</italic> means that in Jesus’ humanity, all that God is in Godself, God is also, <italic>ad extra</italic>, for us. And, as we have suggested, temporality exhibits the same point in a derivative sense. God’s being for us <italic>ad extra</italic> is specifically a being in time. God resolves from eternity to give human beings, who are not eternal, a share in God’s eternity. To realize this purpose God takes on time, becoming temporal in the bounded life-span of Jesus’ humanity. And by raising Jesus from the dead God frees his life in time from its temporal confines and establishes its universal significance; this very time which God has assumed in becoming human is now a gift to all human beings of every time. The time of every human being is thus determined by the time God has taken on and given to them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0953946812466484">51</xref></sup> In this way, namely, by virtue of the determination of their own time span by the time span of Jesus, other human beings participate in what Tanner calls the strong sense of the <italic>imago Dei</italic>.</p>
<p>Finally, according to Tanner’s strong weak sense, humans image God as their lives are worked over and remade in conformity to the Word. They image God as they go beyond their creatureliness and act in unnatural ways. For Barth, by contrast, the strong weak sense is found in the relationship of the humanity of other humans to the humanity of Jesus. As an inter-human reality this strong weak sense remains on the creaturely level rather than transcending it. What must human nature be in order for Christ in his humanity to be for us? How is it that other humans can be represented by Jesus, who in his humanity is for them? In what characteristics of human nature do we find ‘the presupposition of the fact that Jesus can be for them’?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0953946812466484">52</xref></sup> Yet again, the I-Thou relationship is fundamental for Barth; it is in their being with one another that Jesus is among them as the one who is for them. Once again, however, human temporality exhibits the same thing in a derivative way. It is the limited, bounded nature of human life that is ‘the presupposition of the fact that Jesus can be for’ other human beings. And it is on this basis that Barth can now show how our biological lifespan, which seems to contradict our divine determination, in fact confirms it. If our lives are determined by the gift of God’s life in Jesus’ humanity, then it is fitting that they should be bounded by a beginning and an end. An infinite life would still be determined by the gift of God’s human life, in which Jesus fulfilled our divine determination in our place. But it would not attest in its very structure the dependence of our lives on the gracious gift of God’s time that determines our lives from outside themselves. As it is, however, our temporal limit refers us to God’s grace in precisely this way. Bound as it is by a beginning and an end that elude our control, our lifespan signifies our belonging to God. ‘By his nature, in virtue of its peculiar character as an allotted span, he is referred and bound to the gracious God as the One who is wholly and utterly outside him but wholly and utterly for him.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0953946812466484">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>This general point illuminates two more specific senses in which our creaturely limit signifies our divine determination. Both have to do with our constitution as responsible subjects, that is, as genuine covenant partners with God. First, recall Barth’s initial point that fellowship with God seems unintelligible if it involves limit or lack. Life with God and our fellow humans is abundant life, and its very abundance seems to entail duration and perfection. Yet, Barth points out, in an unbounded life one would not be confronted with the limits of one’s own responsibility for the perfection which fellowship with God demands. Responsibility would be endless and life would be perpetually <italic>in via</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0953946812466484">54</xref></sup> The very fulfillment that seemed to require endless duration would in fact never reach completion. By contrast, a bounded life is one in which we can live in time in the knowledge that the perfection required of our lives has already been accomplished in the time of God that determines our time. The fulfillment has already occurred, and the very finitude of our duration signifies our freedom to live our lives as those for whom that burden of accomplishment has been lifted by God. Second, an unbounded life would lack the specificity without which one cannot be a subject and thus a genuine covenant partner. In one’s birth and death, Barth points out, one is ‘irreplaceable, indispensable, and non-interchangeable’. In these two events one cannot be represented by another; unlike all other events in one’s life, here one is uniquely, unqualifiedly and unalterably oneself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0953946812466484">55</xref></sup> These two events thus give the life that runs from the one to the other the singular identity that is a necessary condition of responsibility.</p>
<p>Far from being inimical to our divine determination, Barth shows in all of these senses how it is only in the affirmation of our biological lifespan as a sign of our divine determination that we can live in accordance with our divine determination at all. Like Tanner, Barth has argued that the normative significance of our human nature lies entirely in its relation to our sharing in God’s life. Yet, unlike Tanner, Barth argues that this significance attaches to our nature in its creaturely state and not to its susceptibility to transformation into another state. At the same time, Barth has no need to identify our creaturely state with a metaphysical form or a statistical norm. For him the normative significance of our biological lifespan rests entirely on the mere fact that our lives are bounded at all. This means that if his arguments hold, they hold whether the lifespan is long or short, constant or shifting, fixed or alterable. The radical variability and indeterminacy of the human lifespan stressed by Canguilhem poses no problem at all, and neither would its plasticity if technology makes its indefinite extension possible. Barth’s normativity is in no need whatsoever of a stable or norm-governed biological nature.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0953946812466484">
<title>Toward the Ethical Evaluation of Biotechnology</title>
<p>A conception of the normative significance of human nature is not applicable to biotechnology unless it is clear what it would mean to take it into account in the ethical evaluation of biotechnological interventions. Does Barth’s conception pass this test of applicability? At first it appears not to. His conception is, first of all, in principle compatible with any length of lifespan, so long as that lifespan is bounded by birth and death. It is therefore compatible in principle with all but the most extreme radical life-extension scenarios. While mainstream advocates of radical life extension sometimes use the language of immortality, they typically refer to the expectation or hope that science and technology will progressively eliminate the causes of cell and tissue degeneration to the point that humans live dramatically longer lives and death is indefinitely, though not infinitely, forestalled.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0953946812466484">56</xref></sup> They do not argue that eventually humans will no longer die.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0953946812466484">57</xref></sup> Life, they expect, will be very, very long but still bounded. Not only does Barth have no direct objection to such proposals; his conception of the normative significance of human nature seems to have nothing at all to say about them, unless it is simply to issue a warning not to cross the line into actual immortality and thus eliminate one boundary of our lives.</p>
<p>There are, of course, less direct ways for normative conceptions of human nature to apply to biotechnology. Barth could press a consequentialist objection against radical life-extension technologies, arguing that while the latter do not directly violate or threaten the normative significance of the biological lifespan as a sign of grace, their development and use would undermine if not eliminate <italic>our awareness</italic> of our lives as bounded by God’s grace in the ways described above. With the indefinite postponement of the end of our lives, we might cease to think of and live our lives as bounded, considering ourselves instead to be infinitely responsible for the perfection demanded by our covenant determination and experiencing our ethical subjectivity as indeterminate. These negative effects, one might argue, outweigh whatever advantages such technologies may offer. This argument, however, is unlikely to succeed. The reason is that it is difficult to predict what effects technology will have on our attitudes and dispositions, and consequentialism is usually unkind to factors that elude predictive knowledge.</p>
<p>However, a conception of the normative significance of human nature can apply to biotechnology in a third way. What if, instead of asking whether life-extension technologies destroy the meaning and value of the biological lifespan or undermine our awareness of its meaning and value, we instead ask whether or not these technologies express that meaning and value? As we deliberate over these technologies, do the reasons that support them express the meaning and value of the biological lifespan as a natural sign of divine grace? If we engage in them, does our activity express the meaning and value of the biological lifespan as a natural sign of divine grace? In short, would our involvement in these technologies bear witness to the sign given in our biological lifespan of our determination to be partners in God’s covenant of grace? From Barth’s perspective, then, the question concerning technology would be this: How is the sign that is our creaturely nature most faithfully expressed in our creaturely activity? If we were to practice life-extension technologies would we be obscuring the sign our nature offers in its boundaries by relentlessly pushing it in the direction of a life without such boundaries? Or would we instead be illuminating the sign it offers of the fullness or abundance of the covenant relationships which, as we have seen, prohibits us from simply resigning to our allotted span of time, even as we must finally and decisively accept the gracious character of this limitation?</p>
<p>It is obvious that these questions do not admit of a straightforward answer. An adequate response to them is beyond the scope of this essay. But enough has been said to show how human nature can possess normative significance even though it is indeterminate and malleable, and that this normative significance can attach to its creaturely nature even though it consists entirely in the relation of this creaturely nature to divine grace.</p>

<p>That Canguilhem’s argument—as it is presented here—is incompatible with formal and final causes taken as metaphysical or statistical paradigms does not entail that it is incompatible with other notions of natural kinds. Whether there is a notion of natural kinds that can accommodate his position is beyond the scope of this essay.</p>

<p>Tanner, ‘Grace without Nature’, p. 364. Tanner is not necessarily inconsistent. In this text and in <italic>Christ the Key</italic>, p. 1, she criticizes attempts to identify the <italic>imago Dei</italic> with reason and will, while in the passage just quoted she is referring to reason and will as the central features of human nature in its ability to image God, not to the identity of the image of God itself. Nevertheless, it is striking that her position privileges reason and will as the central features of human nature just as the traditional conception of the <italic>imago Dei</italic> does.</p>

<p>Tanner includes materiality as an essential feature of human nature and proposes that the plasticity of human nature is the ground of hope for the plasticity of material nature more generally. In ‘Grace without Nature’ this hope is signified by transgenic organisms (Tanner, ‘Grace without Nature, p. 368). This example implies that the hope for the transformation of materiality is inseparable from the mastery of nature by human reason and will.</p>
