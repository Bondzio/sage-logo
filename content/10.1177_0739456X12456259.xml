<p>After several years of record numbers of mortgage foreclosures and personal bankruptcies, borrowing has gotten a bad name. The popular press has accused consumers of “using their homes like ATMs.” Scholarly articles take aim at subprime lenders, some of whom are seen as using predatory practices to lure lower-income borrowers into loans they struggle to repay. In these narratives, consumer credit itself sometimes seems to be the villain—we no longer trust lenders to behave ethically, and we cast aspersions on consumers who take on debt. Will we find ourselves returning a preindustrial morality in which money lending is deemed unsavory and immoral?</p>
<p><italic>Moving Forward: The Future of Consumer Credit and Mortgage Finance</italic> is a collection of scholarly articles that remind us that credit is a fundamental part of a functioning economy; that access to credit is crucial for economic advancement across economic classes; and that finding better regulatory mechanisms and market models to create fair, transparent credit arrangements is in everyone’s interest. It’s a timely message, delivered in a series of rigorous essays covering a number of aspects of consumer finance, from home mortgages to payday lending. The book collects papers presented at a February 2010 conference sponsored by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, written by scholars from the academic world and financial industry who know quite a bit about credit. <italic>Moving Forward</italic>, as the title implies, asks where we go next, not only in creating more stable mortgage markets but in developing and sustaining systems of consumer credit that guard against excessive risk-taking without returning to the days in which entire populations were denied access to credit.</p>
<p>Each of the essays presents compelling research and analysis on topics such as disclosure laws, consumer credit in low income communities, and mortgage lending. Authors rely on a variety of data sources and methods. For example, Courchane and Zorn make extensive use of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) and proprietary mortgage databases to examine quantitatively the role of risk-based pricing, looking at interest rates and default rates to explore their connections. Other articles are more reliant on descriptive statistics and analysis of policies, with “take away” points focused recommendations for improvement. The book would be best appreciated by those already engaged in the topic of lending and credit; it is also useful, however, to those who are more casually engaged in these topics because it successfully challenges what may be some commonly held assumptions.</p>
<p>First, the authors of this book do not assume that subprime lending is necessarily a problem. They are hardly blind to the horrendous ripple effects of poor underwriting standards and lax oversight in the mortgage market in recent years (articles by Belsky and Richardson, and by Courchane and Zorn make note of this debacle), but they don’t jump to the conclusion that extending credit to those failing to meet “prime” lending standards is necessarily the cause of the financial collapse. And they make an excellent point. This reviewer can recall working with prospective homeowners as staff member of a nonprofit housing group in the 1980s, and talking to a woman with a stable job, some savings, and a willingness to put in sweat equity who was shut out of the credit market because of a default on a student loan from when she was in her teens. “Couldn’t they just give me a higher interest rate,” she wondered, “and then they could lower it when they see I’ve been making my payments?” At the time, that was not possible. The mortgage industry basically had a single product—a mortgage at a standard rate—and one either qualified for it or one did not. Subprime lending was the means for people like this woman to buy a house, and more often than not such borrowers repaid their loans and enjoyed the stability of home ownership. Belsky and Richardson note that until the second half of 2007, subprime default rates were lower than 10%, which means that for every ten subprime loans there were nine successful borrowers who would otherwise have been renters. (Courchrane and Zorn further observe that the “democratization” of credit that preceded the housing bubble collapse was in many ways a good thing whose benefits should not be forgotten.) The era of subprime lending, unfortunately, eventually coincided with the spread of other exotic loan features and predatory practices so that now all lending outside prime channels is deemed suspect. But in fact, if one can extract the subprime from the predatory—as was done in at least one study cited by Belsky and Richardson—nonprime lending is shown to be quite successful. Outside of a few pilot programs, however, they claim we have never really put “prudent nonprime lending” to a fair test.</p>
<p>Second, these authors do not repeat truisms about how people need to “live within their means.” While certainly these authors are not advocating excessive debt, they note that credit is important. It is important to a flourishing economy, and is the key to both survival and economic progress for the poor as well as the wealthy. As Ludwig notes, “Whether it is for the promise of homeownership, a college education, or the start of a new business, when made prudently and used responsibly, credit put in the hands of low- and moderate-income borrowers is a powerful tool to better their lives” (p. 7). Schneider and Koide make this point even more forcefully in their perceptive article on serving the credit needs of lowest-income groups, whose resources are insufficient to make them of interest to traditional lenders but who nonetheless need access to credit in order to establish credit history, to finance larger purchases, or to pay for education. But supplying credit to this population is expensive—the risks are apparent, the amounts lent (and therefore returns) are low, and the customer service requirements are high. The authors consider models for serving lower-income communities that account for these higher costs without imposing predatory terms on consumers.</p>
<p>Third, this collection provides a rare (for most U.S. publications) look at housing finance in other countries, which prompts questions about which parts of our system are most and least functional. Lea compares U.S. housing finance to the systems in place in several other OECD countries and finds there are many ways to support homeownership while minimizing risk. For example, our system of income tax deductions for mortgage interest is often associated with our high rates of homeownership, so it is interesting to see that several countries with homeowner rates as high as our own (Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom) do not permit mortgage interest deductions. And while critics have seen the move toward adjustable-rate mortgages as part of the downfall of the U.S. mortgage market, in fact the dominance of fixed rate mortgages found in the United States is quite exceptional—Austria, the United Kingdom, and Spain are examples of nations with high rates of homeownership in which variable-rate mortgages are the norm. Lea suggests that our system—which ironically has the highest level of government involvement of all those studied and yet suffered the most dramatic collapse—can learn from home lending practices in other nations.</p>
<p>Other articles in this collection focus on regulatory questions, asking how we can do better in the future. Articles by Fishbein and Essene; Jackson; and Campbell et al. examine such issues as how to improve disclosure laws so that they provide greater transparency or how to minimize the asymmetries of information that keep parties in the lending and securitization process from fully understanding the risks they are incurring. Several authors make note of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which will have far-reaching implications for many aspects of consumer credit, but whose full impact has yet to be felt. Ludwig’s “Comment” section summarizes many of these recommendations for “moving forward,” concluding that the benefits of an improved credit system “are sweeping and tangible, with the results clearly seen within households, neighborhoods, cities and states throughout the country” (p. 8).</p>
<p>The individual contributions of <italic>Moving Forward</italic> all provide insight into various aspects of mortgage and consumer financing; taken together, the book offers an opportunity to reflect on the role of consumer finance in the recent financial crisis as well as an opportunity to learn lessons from that crisis that can be applied to future policy and practice.</p>
