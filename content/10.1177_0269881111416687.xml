<abstract>
<p>Oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP), in their capacities as neuromodulators, are believed to play an important role in mood control, including regulation of the anxiety response. In the present study, the contributions of oxytocin and vasopressin receptor modulation to anxiety-like behaviors were examined in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The behavioral effects of the OT receptor agonist, carbetocin (intracerebroventricular, intravenous and intraperitoneal routes), the AVP receptor agonist desmopressin (intravenous route), and the OT/AVP<sub>1A</sub> receptor antagonist atosiban (intravenous route) were evaluated in the elevated plus maze. The benzodiazepine diazepam was included as a positive control. Central but not systemic administration of carbetocin produced pronounced anxiolytic-like behavioral changes comparable to those measured following systemic diazepam treatment. The anxiolytic efficacy of carbetocin was maintained following 10 days of once-daily treatment, contrasting with the effects of diazepam which were no longer distinguishable from saline treatment. Systemic administration of desmopressin produced anxiogenic-like effects whereas systemic atosiban produced anxiolytic-like effects. Co-administration of desmopressin with atosiban resulted in saline-like behavioral responses, implicating an AVP<sub>1A</sub> receptor mechanism in the anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects of these neuropeptides following systemic administration. A peripherally-mediated antidiuretic effect of desmopressin on water consumption was also demonstrated. These results highlight the potential therapeutic utility of AVP<sub>1A</sub> receptor blockade in the modulation of anxiety-related behaviors; AVP<sub>1A</sub> receptor blockade appears to be a more promising pharmacological target than does OT receptor activation following systemic drug administration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are mammalian nonapeptide hormones synthesized primarily in magnocellular elements of the hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881111416687">Insel et al., 1999</xref>). Their neuromodulatory activity in the central nervous system (CNS) is mediated by OT receptors as well as by two AVP receptor subtypes (AVP<sub>1A</sub> and AVP<sub>1B</sub>), which have been visualized in the limbic system as well as autonomic centers in the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881111416687">Bale et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881111416687">Insel et al., 1999</xref>). Among the key neuromodulatory functions of OT and AVP in the CNS is the regulation of mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881111416687">Frank and Landgraf, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269881111416687">Neumann, 2008</xref>). It has been speculated that OT and AVP may have direct and/or indirect actions in the pathophysiology of both depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881111416687">Arletti and Bertolini, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881111416687">Detke et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881111416687">Frasch et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881111416687">Meisenberg, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269881111416687">Purba et al., 1996</xref>) and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881111416687">Huber et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881111416687">Kirsch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881111416687">Klenerova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881111416687">Landgraf et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269881111416687">Uvnäs-Moberg et al., 2005</xref>). In general, this research suggests that central OT receptor activation induces antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like (decreasing anxiety) effects, whilst central AVP receptor activation may be anxiogenic (increases anxiety).</p>
<p>Central and peripheral release of neuropeptides are thought to be independently regulated such that peripheral measurement of OT and AVP levels may not reflect changes in brain neuropeptide release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881111416687">Neumann et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881111416687">2000</xref>). Once neuropeptides are released into the systemic circulation, their access to the central nervous system is limited due to the blood–brain barrier (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881111416687">Ermisch et al. 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881111416687">Landgraf and Neumann, 2004</xref>). Therefore the source of neuropeptides most likely to mediate anxiety-like behaviors is of central origin, modulating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA or ‘stress’ axis) activity as opposed to hypothalamic–neurohypophysial axis activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0269881111416687">Wotjak et al., 1996</xref>). Indeed, both OT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269881111416687">Uvnas-Moberg, 1998</xref>) and AVP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0269881111416687">Wotjak et al., 1996</xref>) are known to modulate the activity of the stress axis, which may have a direct bearing on behavioral endpoints indicative of anxiety.</p>
<p>The roles of centrally released OT and AVP in the regulation of anxiety-related endpoints have been demonstrated in studies of animal physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881111416687">Gibbs, 1986</xref>) and through pharmacological studies of behaviors believed to be indicative of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269881111416687">Ring et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269881111416687">Stoehr et al., 1992</xref>). Animal studies, utilizing a range of behavioral models, consistently find centrally administered OT to be anxiolytic-like in the context of acute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881111416687">Blume et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881111416687">McCarthy et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269881111416687">Ring et al., 2006</xref>) and chronic exogenous OT administration in brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269881111416687">Windle et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0269881111416687">2004</xref>). Evaluation of endogenously released oxytocin by the selective application of OT antagonists has confirmed this modulatory role of OT in anxiety-related behavior and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA or ‘stress’) axis activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881111416687">Neumann et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0269881111416687">Waldherr and Neumann, 2007</xref>). Similarly a range of studies has shown AVP to have anxiogenic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881111416687">Bhattacharya et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881111416687">Bleickardt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881111416687">Engin and Treit, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881111416687">McCarthy et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269881111416687">Stoehr et al., 1992</xref>), as reviewed recently by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881111416687">Frank and Landgraf (2008)</xref>.</p>
<p>A widely used animal model of anxiety-like behavior is the elevated plus maze (EPM), an unconditioned behavioral assay based on the conflict between the drive to explore and the natural aversion that rodents have for open spaces and heights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881111416687">Handley and Mithani, 1984</xref>). The EPM comprises two opposing pathways or arms that are enclosed by walls (closed arms), and two opposing arms which lack walls (open arms). Anxiety-like behavior is inferred from the pattern of exploration on the EPM. Rodents spontaneously show a preference for the closed arms rather than the open arms of the maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881111416687">Dawson and Tricklebank, 1995</xref>). These features have led to the adaptation of the EPM as a simple and reliable tool for examining the psychological and neurochemical aspects of anxiolytic drug activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881111416687">Dawson and Tricklebank, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881111416687">Griebel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881111416687">Jung et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The EPM has been used to investigate OT using female OT knockout mice. These mice displayed an anxious phenotype (i.e. reduced open-arm entries and open-arm time) as compared with wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881111416687">Mantella et al., 2003</xref>), and secreted more corticosterone after exposure to the EPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881111416687">Amico et al., 2004</xref>). The link between deficient oxytocin secretion and the anxious phenotype was evaluated using intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of synthetic OT. This resulted in an increase in the number of open-arm entries and the time spent in the open arms, as compared with OT deficient mice treated with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881111416687">Mantella et al., 2003</xref>). Reductions in anxiety-related behavior in the EPM have also been reported following intraperitoneal administration of AVP<sub>1A</sub> (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881111416687">Bleickardt et al., 2009</xref>) and AVP<sub>1B</sub> (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881111416687">Griebel et al., 2002</xref>) antagonists, with similar results found in AVP gene-knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881111416687">Bielsky et al., 2004</xref>). Microinfusion studies suggest that the anxiolytic-like effects of AVP<sub>1A</sub> antagonism may be specific to its actions in the ventral hippocampus, whilst the anxiolytic-like effects of AVP<sub>1B</sub> antagonism may be specific to its actions in the dorsal hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881111416687">Engin and Treit, 2008</xref>). Conversely, an anxiogenic-like effect of AVP has previously been demonstrated in the EPM using central administration of AVP in rats, which resulted in a significant reduction in open-arm entries and open-arm duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881111416687">Bhattacharya et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of TGOT ([Thr4,Gly7]-oxytocin), also known as carbetocin (Durotocin®), an oxytocin receptor agonist with a binding profile similar to oxytocin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881111416687">Gimpl et al., 2005</xref>), following administration via central and systemic routes in the male Sprague-Dawley rat using the EPM. The behavioral effects of desmopressin (1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin; Minirin®), which non-selectively targets the AVP<sub>1A/B</sub> and AVP<sub>2</sub> receptor subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881111416687">Mechaly et al., 1999</xref>) as well as atosiban (1-deamino-2-D-Tyr(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin; Tractocile®), an oxytocin and vasopressin 1A receptor antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881111416687">Manning et al., 1995</xref>) were also evaluated. Atosiban was examined separately, as well as in combination with carbetocin and desmopressin. Diazepam (Valium®), a benzodiazepine, was used as a positive comparator. Since desmopressin is known to affect water balance via a peripheral AVP<sub>2</sub> mechanism of action, it was also evaluated for its effects on drinking behavior. The effect of repeated OT receptor agonist administration on anxiety-like behaviors has not been reported previously and was therefore also investigated using carbetocin in the present study. It was hypothesized that carbetocin would produce anxiolytic-like responses, whereas desmopressin would result in anxiogenic-like behavioral effects, with the behavioral effects of both attenuated by co-administration with atosiban. It was also anticipated that although the benzodiazepine would produce anxiolytic effects following acute administration, these would diminish with repeated administration; by contrast, the anxiolytic effects of carbetocin were expected to be maintained following repeated administration.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>One hundred and forty-two adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 300–550 g, were used in this study (Monash University Animal Services, Clayton, Australia). Rats were housed 2–5 per cage prior to testing. All rats were kept under standard laboratory conditions, on a reversed light/dark cycle (dark between 09.00 and 21.00 hours) and controlled temperature (19–22°C), relative humidity (36–57%), with free access to food (Specialty Feeds, Glen Forest, Australia) and water. The rats were acclimatized to these conditions for at least four weeks before the start of each experiment. Animals in i.c.v. treatment groups were individually housed and allowed a minimum of one week to recover after surgery. For the acute administration experiments, each rat was trialed once on the EPM following a single drug treatment; for the repeated administration experiments, each rat was trialed twice. Rats were tested during the dark period when they were most active (i.e. starting at 09.00 hours). The study protocols were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the School of Psychology and Psychiatry, Monash University, in accordance with guidelines from the Bureau of Animal Welfare (Australia), specifically the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes.</p>

<title>Intracerebroventricular cannulation procedure</title>
<p>Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (Abbott Australasia Pty Ltd, Australia) in carbogen gas and administered morphine (3.2 mg/kg) at a volume of 1 ml/kg via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route prior to surgery. The head of each rat was shaved from the glabella to the posterior aspect of the skull and the rat was placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. A mid-sagittal incision was made, extending from the glabella to the frontal plane. The fascia and periostium were cleared away from the exposed skull. Using bregma as a reference point, the coordinates used were 1.5 mm lateral to the midline (cannula placement was alternated between the left and right sides), 0.8 mm posterior and 3.5 mm deep. Holes for the cannula and bone screws were made using a small electric drill. A 22 gauge cannula custom-cut to a length of 3.5 mm (Plastics One Inc., Roanoke, VA, USA) was carefully inserted. Two bone screws were used to stabilize the cannula; one was placed posterior to the cannula and the other was placed on the opposite side of the midline. Paladur® dental-cement (two parts powder to one part solvent) was used to bond the cannula to the bone screws and skull.</p>
<p>Following surgery, each rat was placed under a warming-lamp for a short time until consciousness was regained. During the week post-surgery, frequent monitoring of each rat’s condition (including daily recording of weight, physical appearance and behavioral responses) was carried out. The i.c.v. cannula was flushed daily with 5 μl of sterile saline to familiarize the animals to the handling and injection procedure as well as to avoid the formation of occlusions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269881111416687">
<title>Determination of cannula patency and placement</title>
<p>One day prior to both acute and repeat testing, rats with an i.c.v. cannula were administered 10 µg/rat angiotensin II (Sigma-Aldrich, Australia) in a 5 μl injection via the i.c.v. route. Rats were gently restrained on the lap of the experimenter, the cannula cap was removed, the hollow guide cannula on the end of flexible silicon tubing was inserted into the cannula and the 5 μl solution was infused over 30 s. The guide cannula was kept in place for another 30 s to allow distribution of the solution before being removed and the cap replaced. Angiotensin II is important in the regulation of electrolyte and water balance and is a potent dipsogen. Rats with a patent cannula demonstrated a clear drinking-response immediately upon return to their cages following treatment with angiotensin II.</p>
<p>At the end of treatment and testing, rats were euthanized with sodium pentobarbitone (Lethobarb®) and then injected i.c.v. with 10 μl of 2.5% methylene blue solution to check the placement of the cannula. If the ventricular system was clearly visible upon removal and coronal slicing of the brain, correct placement of the cannula was assumed. Only data from rats whose ventricular system was partially or completely stained were included in the analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269881111416687">
<title>Intraperitoneal and intravenous injection procedures</title>
<p>Each rat was snugly wrapped in a soft cotton cloth leaving its hind quarters uncovered. The i.p. injection was then administered into the lower right or left abdomen. In the case of the intravenous (i.v.) injection, the rat’s tail was first soaked in 40°C water to soften the skin and promote vasodilation. A 23 G needle was used to inject the drug solution into a tail vein. Pressure was then applied at the injection site to prevent bleeding and the rat was returned to its home cage. The injection volume for both routes was 1 ml/kg.</p>

<title>Elevated plus maze test</title>
<p>Anxiolytic-like behavioral activity was measured using the EPM apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881111416687">Handley and Mithani, 1984</xref>). The EPM was constructed out of black polyurethane and consisted of two open arms (i.e. without walls) and two closed arms (i.e. with walls). The closed arms had opaque walls (43 cm high). All arms were 50 cm long × 10 cm wide) and connected by a common central area (10 cm × 10 cm). The maze was located above the ground at a height of 72 cm. Rats were placed in the center of the maze alternately facing an open or closed arm. Each rat was allowed 10 minutes to explore the apparatus undisturbed under conditions of minimal noise and dim illumination (11 lux in closed arms; 83 lux in open arms). Behavioral activity was automatically scored using Ethovision XT© (Noldus, Netherlands) and was concurrently monitored by an experimenter from an adjoining room. Outcome measures of interest were the proportion of time spent in the open arms (% open-arm time) and the proportion of arm entries that were into the open arms of the EPM (% open-arm entries). Closed-arm entries were also scored as an indication of overall locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881111416687">Cruz et al., 1994</xref>). Entry into a maze arm was scored once the center-point of the rat’s body was inside it. A statistically significant increase in the proportion of time spent in the open arms and/or in the proportion of entries into the open arms was indicative of anxiolytic drug activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269881111416687">Michelini et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269881111416687">Pellow et al., 1985</xref>). Conversely, a decrease in either measure was interpreted as indicative of an anxiogenic treatment effect.</p>

<title>Measuring drinking behavior following i.v.desmopressin administration</title>
<p>As desmopressin is known for its antidiuretic effects in addition to its centrally mediated behavioral effects, water consumption was assessed over 12 h during the dark period to determine whether a centrally active intravenously administered dose of desmopressin also exerted effects in the periphery. A single i.v. injection of desmopressin (5 mg/kg) or saline was administered at 09.00 hours. Rats were then individually housed in cages measuring 45 cm long × 32 cm wide; free access to food and water was provided. Measurement of water consumption was done at hourly intervals for the first four hours (i.e. at 10.00, 11.00, 12.00, and 13.00 hours), after which it was measured at 17.00 hours and at 21.00 hours.</p>

<sec id="section9-0269881111416687">
<title>Drugs</title>
<p>All systemic drug injections were administered at a volume of 1 ml/kg. Diazepam (Pamlin® 5 mg/ml solution; Parnell Laboratories Pty Ltd, Australia) was diluted in saline and injected i.p. at a dose of 0.2, 1, or 2 mg/kg with a 30 min pretreatment time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269881111416687">Pellow et al. 1985</xref>). Carbetocin (Ferring Ltd, Denmark), a peptide analog of OT, was administered i.c.v. at doses of 10, 32 and 100 µg/rat in a volume of 5 μl, using a 10-min pretreatment time. Carbetocin was also administered i.v. (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) and i.p. (6.4 and 20 mg/kg) in a volume of 1 ml/kg using a 15-min pretreatment. Dose selection was based on behaviorally active doses reported in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881111416687">Chaviaras et al. (2010)</xref>. Desmopressin and atosiban (Ferring Ltd, Denmark) were only administered i.v. (desmopressin: 1 and 5 mg/kg; atosiban: 1 mg/kg). Vehicle-treated animals received saline injections in volumes of 0.4 ml i.p. and i.v. or 5 μl i.c.v. For repeated administration experiments, carbetocin (i.c.v.), diazepam (i.p.) or saline were administered once daily for 10 consecutive days.</p>

<p>Raw data were used to calculate the percentage of arm entries into the open arms, the percentage of time spent in the open arms and the number of closed-arm entries for each treatment condition. All analyses were conducted using SPSS for Windows, version 17.0. Where data satisfied the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance, parametric analyses (one-way independent measures ANOVA using univariate analysis) were performed to assess differences between drug treatment conditions for % open-arm time, % open-arm entries, and closed-arm entries; Tukey’s HSD post hoc test was subsequently used where appropriate. Conversely, non-parametric alternatives (Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>) were used when these assumptions were violated. For the assessment of water consumption, repeated measures ANOVA followed by a one-way ANOVA for post hoc evaluation of the interaction between time and treatment was used.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study investigated the effects of several neuropeptide ligands on anxiety-like behavior in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Carbetocin, an oxytocin analogue, desmopressin, a vasopressin analogue, and the oxytocin-vasopressin 1A receptor antagonist atosiban were examined using the elevated plus maze, which is sensitive to both anxiolytic and anxiogenic treatment effects. Carbetocin, given centrally via the i.c.v. route, had anxiolytic effects following acute and repeated administration, consistent with our hypothesis. In contrast, the benzodiazepine comparator, diazepam, demonstrated anxiolytic efficacy only after acute administration. However, when carbetocin was administered systemically (i.v. and i.p. administration), it was ineffective. As anticipated, desmopressin treatment resulted in anxiogenic activity following i.v. administration. Atosiban, which has oxytocin and vasopressin 1A receptor antagonist effects, showed robust anxiolytic activity. With respect to possible mechanisms mediating atosiban’s anxiolytic effects, the complete abolition of both desmopressin and atosiban’s effects when they were co-administered suggests a common AVP<sub>1A</sub> mechanism of action.</p>
<p>Carbetocin, diazepam, desmopressin and atosiban treatments had mixed effects on locomotor activity as assessed by the change in closed-arm entries. Carbetocin did not affect closed-arm entries at any dose, whereas the effects of diazepam varied depending on dose (lower dose – stimulatory; higher dose – sedative). Atosiban reduced closed-arm entries when given alone or in combination, although the total number of arm entries remained unaffected. In an earlier study, we measured the locomotor effects of carbetocin and atosiban using the open field test and found that neither significantly increased locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881111416687">Chaviaras et al., 2010</xref>). The effect of i.v. desmopressin at AVP<sub>2</sub> receptors in the periphery was also investigated using water consumption as a measure of antidiuretic activity. Consistent with its indication as an antidiuretic, desmopressin-treated animals drank less water during the 12 h observation period.</p>
<p>The results for carbetocin reported in the current study are consistent with earlier reports of anxiolytic-like effects of centrally administered OT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881111416687">McCarthy et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269881111416687">Ring et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269881111416687">Stoehr et al., 1992</xref>). In the present study, carbetocin treatment resulted in anxiolytic-like changes in EPM behavior following acute i.c.v. administration, an effect that was maintained following repeated treatment. This contrasted with the results following repeated administration of diazepam, which was ineffective after 10 days of once daily administration. A well-known problem associated with the clinical use of benzodiazepines is the tolerance that develops to their effects following repeated use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269881111416687">Soderpalm et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269881111416687">Treit, 1985</xref>). The data from the present study are consistent with the development of behavioral tolerance previously reported in rats following 6–10 days of benzodiazepine treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269881111416687">Soderpalm et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269881111416687">Treit, 1985</xref>). Although it is possible that once daily dosing with carbetocin and diazepam may not be equivalent with respect to the pharmacokinetic properties of each drug, the reported half-lives of carbetocin and diazepam are comparable in the rat, with carbetocin having a longer elimination half-life than oxytocin (85–100 min versus 3–4 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881111416687">Engstrom et al., 1998</xref>)) and diazepam having a comparatively short half-life in rats (0.88 h following 5 mg/kg i.p. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881111416687">Friedman et al., 1986</xref>)) as compared with humans (36 h following 5–10 mg i.v. diazepam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881111416687">Greenblatt et al., 1980</xref>)). Therefore the differences in their effects following repeated administration in the rat are unlikely to be due to pharmacokinetic differences between them. Our findings differ from a recently published study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269881111416687">Slattery and Neumann (2010)</xref> in which they evaluated male and female Wistar rats selectively bred for high or low anxiety in the light/dark box and did not find an anxiolytic effect following acute i.c.v. administration of OT (1 µg). They did, however, find an anxiolytic effect following a six day i.c.v. infusion of OT (10 ng/h), but only in female high anxiety rats. One difference is that the doses of oxytocin used in their study were small in comparison with the lowest effective dose of carbetocin used in the present study (32 µg) and the relative half-lives of OT and carbetocin are very different (see above). An explanation for this difference, as has been suggested in the case of vasopressin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0269881111416687">Van Dijk et al., 1981</xref>), is that injection of larger doses into the lateral ventricle potentially enables the drug to diffuse to a wider range of brain targets (e.g. the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881111416687">Blume et al. 2008</xref>)), thereby affecting behavior more broadly.</p>
<p>Study designs that involve the use of more than one exposure to the EPM are uncommon (for a recent example, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0269881111416687">Waldherr and Neumann, 2007</xref>), as there is some difference of opinion regarding whether prior exposure to the EPM might affect the results of a subsequent exposure (discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0269881111416687">Walf and Frye, 2007</xref>). Our results suggest that there may have been a reduction in % open-arm entries and % open-arm time on the second exposure to the EPM across all of the treatment conditions. Despite this, carbetocin continued to have a statistically significant anxiolytic effect whereas after 10 days of once daily treatment, diazepam’s anxiolytic effect was no longer evident. Previous work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881111416687">File et al. (1990)</xref> highlighted a finding with chlordiazepoxide that they termed ‘one trial tolerance’, in which they found that benzodiazepine treatment resulted in a loss of anxiolytic activity on the second exposure to the EPM. However, in a later study they determined that this was only the case with brief (5 min) exposure to the EPM, whereas diazepam continued to have anxiolytic activity if the duration of exposure was 10 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881111416687">File et al., 1992</xref>), as was the case in the present study. Therefore we conclude that the loss of anxiolytic effect of diazepam in the present study was due to pharmacological tolerance to its anxiolytic effects.</p>
<p>In comparison with diazepam, carbetocin appeared to have a wider therapeutic dose range and lacked the locomotor stimulating and attenuating effects seen with sub-threshold and larger doses of the benzodiazepine respectively. Despite this, carbetocin’s lack of anxiolytic efficacy following systemic administration suggests that the peptide may have limited access to the CNS. However, there is clear evidence that carbetocin and atosiban (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881111416687">Beringer and Broadbear, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881111416687">Broadbear et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881111416687">Chaviaras et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881111416687">Klenerova et al., 2009</xref>) as well as oxytocin itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881111416687">Arletti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881111416687">Arletti and Bertolini, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269881111416687">Nowakowska et al., 2002</xref>) produce centrally mediated effects in rats following systemic administration in other behavioral tests. In addition, the clear behavioral changes following systemic administration of desmopressin and atosiban, which are structurally similar to carbetocin, also suggest that lack of access to the CNS is not the sole explanation for carbetocin’s reduced systemic efficacy in the EPM. Our results suggest the possibility that systemic administration of carbetocin and atosiban results in behaviorally active concentrations of these ligands in AVP (e.g. PVN) but not OT (e.g. amygdala) modulated brain structures important for anxiety, but further study is needed to confirm this.</p>
<p>The findings of the present study in relation to atosiban and desmopressin are of considerable importance to the field. The demonstration of the expected anxiogenic-like effect of desmopressin, which dose-dependently reduced the time rats spent in the open arms of the maze; the robust anxiolytic-like responses measured following atosiban treatment, which increased the time spent as well as the number of entries made into the open arms of the maze; and the observation that the combination of these two compounds negated their individual effects, rendering them no different from the saline control, are strongly suggestive of a role for central AVP<sub>1A</sub> receptors in modulating anxiety-like responses. The use of larger systemic doses of carbetocin and desmopressin than might be indicated by previous work with oxytocin and vasopressin highlight the complexity of working with peptidic compounds and are not without precedent (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881111416687">Arletti and Bertolini, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269881111416687">Ring et al., 2006</xref>). Earlier work done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881111416687">Ermisch et al. (1985)</xref> showed that small amounts of peptides including oxytocin and vasopressin do cross into the brain at low but detectable concentrations following carotid injection. Our use of large intravenous doses increases the likelihood that these ligands will enter the CNS, particularly since several regions where the blood–brain barrier is most permeable to peptides (i.e. the circumventricular organs) are in the vicinity of the third ventricle, close to where the target CNS areas regulating OT and AVP anxiolytic actions (e.g. hypothalamus) are located. If these effects are indeed centrally mediated (as the results in the present study as well as those published previously by our group suggest is the case for carbetocin and atosiban), then passage of these ligands into the CNS following systemic administration does occur in sufficient concentrations to affect behavioral outcomes. With respect to whether the doses used in this study produce physiologically relevant concentrations, the CSF and plasma concentrations of these ligands corresponding to the systemic doses have not been published as far as we can ascertain. However, the measurement of a ‘physiologically relevant’ outcome, water consumption, following 5 mg/kg desmopressin confirmed that this dose does result in a predictable peripherally mediated consequence consistent with its antidiuretic actions.</p>
<p>Desmopressin is a synthetic analogue of vasopressin that non-selectively targets all three AVP receptor subtypes – AVP<sub>1A</sub>, AVP<sub>1B</sub>, and AVP<sub>2</sub>. As such, it is not an ideal ligand with which to investigate behavior thought to be regulated by central AVP<sub>1A</sub> and AVP<sub>1B</sub> receptors. It is theoretically possible that desmopressin may stimulate multiple physiological events that could contribute to an anxiolytic behavioral response. Although it is prescribed mainly for its antidiuretic actions, desmopressin does not simply target AVP<sub>2</sub> receptors ((primarily located in the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0269881111416687">Zingg, 1996</xref>)). AVP<sub>1B</sub> receptors located on the adenohypophysis are likely activated by desmopressin at the doses that were used in our study, possibly resulting in enhanced HPA axis activation in response to the EPM. In addition, activation of AVP<sub>1A</sub> receptors by desmopressin in vascular smooth muscle may have resulted in vasoconstriction (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269881111416687">Ring, 2005</xref>). Both of these physiological consequences of vasopressin receptor activation could occur in the absence of desmopressin having access to the CNS and may contribute to the anxiogenic effects of desmopressin on behavior. However, the evidence that atosiban reversed the anxiogenic effects of desmopressin (as shown by their opposing effects on % open-arm time) and desmopressin negated the increased % open-arm entries measured following atosiban administration suggests that AVP<sub>1B</sub> enhancement of HPA axis consequent to desmopressin administration (which is unlikely to be attenuated by AVP<sub>1A</sub>-selective atosiban) does not entirely explain the anxiogenic effects of desmopressin. The most likely explanation is that this behavior is at least in part mediated by a central AVP<sub>1A</sub> mechanism, prime candidates for which are AVP<sub>1A</sub> receptors in the PVN (also regulating HPA axis activation) and the lateral septum (as demonstrated by anxiolytic actions following the application of a AVP<sub>1A</sub> receptor antisense or AVP<sub>1</sub> antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881111416687">Landgraf et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881111416687">Liebsch et al., 1996</xref>)). Without directly measuring plasma ACTH and corticosterone, it is difficult to know how the treatments used in the present study affected HPA axis regulation or indeed how endogenous AVP release may have been modified by these treatments. A behaviorally active dose of desmopressin also produced pharmacological effects likely to have been mediated by AVP<sub>2</sub> receptors in the kidney, reducing cumulative water consumption consistent with its known antidiuretic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0269881111416687">Rittig and Frøkiær, 2007</xref>). Since changes in kidney function would be an unwanted side effect of any vasopressinergic anxiolytic, this highlights the need to develop more AVP<sub>1A</sub> and AVP<sub>1B</sub> selective agonists and antagonists with which to investigate the roles of central AVP receptors in anxiety. There is recent evidence that more selective AVP<sub>1A</sub> antagonists may indeed have utility in this regard (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881111416687">Bleickardt et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that carbetocin administered centrally has anxiolytic-like efficacy that, unlike treatment with diazepam, remains efficacious following repeated administration. The opposing behavioral effects of desmopressin and atosiban following systemic administration and their mutual antagonism when they were given in combination strongly suggest that their anxiety-related effects on behavior are likely to have been mediated by central AVP<sub>1A</sub> receptors for which both have affinity. As a preclinical investigation, the current findings substantiate previous studies and exemplify the anxiolytic-like properties of OT and AVP ligands. Further studies are required, however, to better understand the complementary mechanisms and brain regions via which OT and AVP ligands modulate mood in the pursuit of novel pharmacotherapies for the treatment of anxiety disorders.</p>
