<abstract>
<p>This study presents new palynological data from Caution Bay, south-central Papua New Guinea (PNG). It explores Holocene mangrove transitional events along a tide-dominated shoreline, and expands reconstructive detail for the wider southern PNG lowlands. Coinciding with recent regional archaeological research, this study also holds implications for interpretations of the Holocene settlement of Caution Bay and long-term people–landscape interactions. Data demonstrate a late-Holocene mangrove to mudflat transition, with vegetation patterns largely a function of low sediment loading, sedimentary redistributions and salinisation upon sea level decline c. 2000 cal. yr BP. These trends appear unique to Caution Bay, highlighting a variety of Holocene shoreline vegetation changes along the PNG south coast, each dependent on geomorphologic setting and hydrological fluxes. Further work is required to elucidate vegetation change inland of the coastal zone. Greater understanding of burning patterns and an archaeological collaboration are required to determine more concisely dryland plant spatial and temporal variability.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The term ‘mangrove’ refers to plant species demonstrating physiological and morphological adaptation to the intertidal environment; to conditions of high-salinity, low oxygen, low nutrient availability and substrate mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0959683613483620">Shearman, 2010</xref>). ‘Mangrove’ is used in equal reference to the plant community as it is to individual plant species. Global mangrove diversity is at its highest across the Indo-Pacific region, and the ecosystems of the Gulf of Papua (the Gulf) in southern Papua New Guinea (PNG) are some of the largest and most pristine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683613483620">Ellison, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0959683613483620">Shearman, 2010</xref>). Across the Gulf, mangrove communities occupy a number of different environmental settings. These settings vary in their geomorphological context and in the physical processes responsible for sediment transport and deposition. Accordingly it is difficult to extrapolate from one setting to another to understand a particular locality’s historical trajectory.</p>
<p>The Gulf shoreline incorporates a number of rivers draining the mountains of central PNG. These rivers, with high sediment loads and/or seasonally variable outflow, form complex deltas. Here, mangroves distribute in response to microtopographic characteristics including distributary channels, point bars, river levees and interdistributary basins. Changes in mangrove patterning occur as a result of changes in geomorphological processes operating within the deltalic setting itself, mangroves being opportunistic in their habitat colonisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959683613483620">Krauss et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0959683613483620">Woodroffe, 1990</xref>). The bulk of late-Quaternary mangrove research in PNG has been carried out within river-dominated settings, documenting rates of siltation (deltaic plain vertical accretion) and shoreline progradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683613483620">Chappell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683613483620">Ellison, 2005</xref>) or the upriver extent of mangrove establishment (spatial positioning of upper and lower deltaic plains) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683613483620">Chappell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0959683613483620">Thom and Wright, 1983</xref>). Comparatively, little work has been conducted on tide-dominated settings, where the behavioural arrangement of mangroves and associated ecosystems is expected to differ. As the name suggests, tidal action (tidal range and directional current) is responsible for sediment distributions and environmental character. More extensive areas of low-gradient shoreline are available for mangroves, and plant successional patterns are more likely. The relationship between land and sea is also more open and direct (uninsulated). Complex fluvially formed mangrove habitats are absent, replaced by colluvial and alluvial deposits, saline-flats and chenier ridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959683613483620">Krauss et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0959683613483620">Woodroffe, 1990</xref>). More generally, a lack of descriptive information from tide-dominated coastlines occurs on a background of little available palaeoecological data on the southern and coastal lowlands of PNG.Currently palaeoecological and palynological records on the whole are concentrated in the highlands of PNG (see reviews by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683613483620">Haberle, 2007</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683613483620">Hope, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study area encompasses Caution Bay, a mangrove-fringed and inland savanna-dominated embayment on the southern mainland PNG coast. The purposes of this paper are (1) to provide palynological evidence describing mangrove Holocene history and littoral zone successional events along a tide-dominated shoreline east of the Gulf of Papua, and (2) to extend Caution Bay Holocene description inland thereby expanding reconstructive detail for the southern PNG lowlands more widely. Further, Caution Bay has been the focus of recent intensive archaeological research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959683613483620">David et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683613483620">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959683613483620">McNiven et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683613483620">2012</xref>). Therefore, the purpose of this paper is also (3) to comment where possible on the palaeoecology of Caution Bay for the timespan of the known archaeological record and its implications for people–environment relations.</p>

<title>Caution Bay</title>
<p>Caution Bay centres 20 km west of Port Moresby, positioned along the south coast, east of the Gulf of Papua within the Central Province of PNG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683613483620">Figure 1</xref>). Climate encompassing Caution Bay is Tropical Savanna (a classification with limited range across PNG, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683613483620">Gillison (1983)</xref> for mapping). Conditions strongly reflect a seasonal alternation in wind direction, temperature, humidity and, most significantly, rainfall which are broadly controlled by two systems. A northwest monsoonal system (known locally as <italic>lahara</italic>) occurs between December and April, associated with frequent-significant rainfall and warm, high humidity conditions. Southeasterly trade winds (<italic>laurabada</italic>) prevail between June and October during which drier-cooler conditions occur. Brief transitional phases occur between these two predominant wind and rainfall patterns. Annual rainfall averages 1000 mm and the seasonal temperature range is 28–32°C (mean maximum) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683613483620">Fitzpatrick, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683613483620">McAlpine et al., 1983</xref>).</p>

<p>The south-central coast of PNG is an embayed reef-fringed coast. A number of environmental zones run parallel (in partly discontinuous form) to the shoreline. In succession inland a littoral plains complex, alluvial plain, coastal lowland and coastal hill-ridge formation comprise the Caution Bay catchment (and corresponding to the Papa, Boroko and Fairfax land-systems mapped by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959683613483620">Mabbutt et al., 1965</xref>). Each environmental zone has a distinctive geology, pattern of topography, soils and vegetation. In this paper descriptions concentrate on the littoral plain.</p>
<p>Along Caution Bay the littoral plains zone is up to 1 km wide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683613483620">Figure 2</xref>). Coastal features occur in the form of plains, spits and barrier-beaches and the main occurrence of tidal flats is behind these protective formations. The tidal flats (outer tidal, lower inner and higher inner flats) are differentiated on the basis of inundation depth and frequency. Sediments show a transition from the outer shore where wave and current action remove fine materials leaving sandy deposits, through a range of intermediate textures to peaty-clays in highest areas of shallow inundation and above. The area is drained by small creeks (many with shallow, shifting, transient, occasionally irregular channels). Here, estuarine patches combine inland watercourse and tidal influence (freshwater to brackish) (author observation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959683613483620">Löffler, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959683613483620">Mabbutt, 1965</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959683613483620">Mabbutt et al.’s (1965)</xref> outline of the Caution Bay littoral zone, the outer tidal flats are described as occurring on an accreting coast, with the inner tidal flats (between current and inner beach ridges) slightly below to slightly above mean high water mark.</p>

</fig>
<p>Landward the littoral plain is vegetated with mixed scrub and evergreen-deciduous thicket (frequently disturbed, author observation), grading to grassland. Shrubs and low trees (notably <italic>Terminalia, Clerodendrum, Scaevola, Hibiscus</italic>) combine with scattered herbs and lianes (<italic>Flagellaria</italic> and unidentified climbing ferns). Initially the grasslands are dense, composed of <italic>Imperata, Themeda</italic> and herbs (noting here greater sedge or broadleaf herb growth and shrub recruitment in localised moist <italic>Pandanus</italic> depressions). With distance inland the groundcover thins and becomes drier and lower in stature. In the landward to seaward transition bare saline mudflat occurs with low <italic>Tecticornia</italic> (chenopod salt marsh) and <italic>Sesuvium</italic> tussock-like vegetation, concentrated on occasional slight rises within or at the fringes of the mudflat (author observation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683613483620">Heyligers, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683613483620">Paijmans, 1976</xref>). From field observation this patchy mudflat may be seasonally flooded by fresh water, while covered by seawater at extreme high tide.</p>
<p>At Caution Bay two mangrove communities predominate. A tall, dense canopied, one-layered forest of almost pure <italic>Rhizophora</italic> occurs seaward and at lower elevations subject to frequent tidal inundation. Secondary to <italic>Rhizophora</italic> is <italic>Bruguiera</italic>. On appearance, the <italic>Rhizophora</italic> forest is even-aged. <italic>Avicennia</italic> then dominates inland of <italic>Rhizophora</italic>, occupying a higher tidal position and forming an irregular to low-height open canopy woodland. <italic>Ceriops</italic> and <italic>Bruguiera</italic> were sparsely observed and tentative identifications of <italic>Aegiceras</italic> and <italic>Lumnitzera</italic> were made. The woodland incorporated no groundcover except for numerous <italic>Avicennia</italic> pneumatophores, marked also with the common occurrence of dead trees and fallen wood. The <italic>Avicennia</italic> woodland to open mudflat transition was largely abrupt (author observation).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section4-0959683613483620">
<title>Field coring and sample preparation</title>
<p>Three sediment cores were collected along a southwest–northeast transect spanning the outer to higher inner tidal flats and vegetation zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683613483620">Figure 2</xref>; with high and consistent pollen preservation in cores 1 and 3, as discussed in this paper). Having a series of cores reduces the influence of local land effects and maximises the recording of influential non-local factors such as sea level and climate (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683613483620">Ellison, 2008</xref>). The transect orientation is complementary to a second collection sequence carried out by the first author, transgressing the coastal lowland. Core 3 is also c. 190 m from the archaeological site Bogi 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959683613483620">McNiven et al., 2011</xref>) located on the landward dune above the mudflat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683613483620">Figure 2</xref>). Sampling was conducted by hand and at low tide. A sidewall D-Section corer was used, facilitating penetration through mangrove roots and sands while also minimising sediment compaction. Each core section was described in the field before being securely wrapped and prepared for transport. Core chronology is provided through an AMS <sup>14</sup>C analysis of bulk organic samples secured at regular intervals from the sediment core centres prior to pollen sample collection. Dating samples were submitted to the Waikato Radiocarbon Dating Laboratory and resulting AMS determinations calibrated using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683613483620">Fairbanks et al. (2005)</xref> and OxCal 4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0959683613483620">Ramsey, 2009</xref>) programs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0959683613483620">
<title>Laboratory technique</title>
<p>Pollen sample preparation followed standard technique as detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683613483620">Bennett and Willis (2001)</xref> and as experimented with by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959683613483620">Rowe (2007)</xref> for mangrove sediments elsewhere. Chemical preparations were selected to initially disperse then progressively remove humic acids, calcium carbonates, bulk organics and cellulose, silicates, and to ensure the pollen wall ornamentation was suitably visible. Particular attention was paid to the treatment of carbonates, given much of the coastal lowland to ridge systems are underlain by limestone. Silicate removal required equal diligence owing to the strong silicification observed in some subsurface lowland materials (i.e. quartz-filled pores or rock seams). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959683613483620">Jorry et al. (2008)</xref> also describe the Gulf of Papua as a tropical mixed siliciclastic/carbonate system. <italic>Lycopodium</italic> spike additions served relative concentration calculations of both pollen and charcoal. Sediment subsamples were 2 cm<sup>3</sup> in size.</p>
<p>Pollen identifications were assisted by the authors’ own floral field-specimen collection from the Caution Bay area, text reference material (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0959683613483620">Thanikaimoni, 1987</xref>), preserved reference collections held within Monash University’s School of Geography and Environmental Science, and online photographic sources such as the Australasian Pollen and Spore Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683613483620">AustralianPollen and Spore Atlas Members, 2007</xref>). Charcoal identification incorporated fragments of angular form, black and opaque. The charcoal count is defined as microscopic (10–125 µm), deemed representative of regional (catchment) fire activity (see principles outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0959683613483620">Whitlock and Larson, 2001</xref>). For the diagrammatic presentation of data the Tilia suite of programs was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683613483620">Grimm, 1991</xref>). Pollen counts are expressed as a total pollen percentage, a sum value of 300 grains minimum.</p>

<title>Mangrove palynology: Interpretative considerations</title>
<p>Factors impacting pollen assemblage development and composition include plant pollen production, dispersal strategy, as well as the deposition site itself. Pollen analysis is classically applied to stratified waterlogged deposits. Grains fall on a water surface, sink and incorporate into a steadily building deposit. Waterbody study sites such as lakes or swamps are typically regarded as closed systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683613483620">Chappell and Grindrod, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959683613483620">Pearsall, 2000</xref>). Different interpretative assumptions are apparent through the mangrove literature.</p>
<p>Palaeo-ecological intertidal studies classify such environments as open systems (occupants of dynamic settings). While distinct floristics, neat species segregation, and a precise ecological niche align mangroves to palynological study, as open systems the capability of sediment to retain pollen varies widely. Sediments may be lost or redistributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683613483620">Chappell and Grindrod, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683613483620">Grindrod, 1988</xref>). Mangrove soils are re-worked by tidal currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683613483620">Furukawa et al., 1997</xref>) and are subject to biogenic mixing. High tide muds are subaerially exposed for long periods and may suffer floodwater scouring and aerial erosion. Optimal conditions occur along muddy, low energy shores which support luxuriant plant communities containing high pollen producers, and where sediment accumulation is not excessive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683613483620">Grindrod, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683613483620">1988</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683613483620">Grindrod (1988)</xref> provides a good summary of differential pollen preservation and redistribution through north Australian case studies.</p>
<p>Many mangrove taxa are disproportionately represented via pollen. Considerable interpretative weight may be placed on the simple appearance of certain grains just as numerical guidelines are required for others in high proportion. <italic>Avicennia</italic> pollen is in general under-represented as distribution is closely related to source plants. Localised dispersal is a consequence of floral arrangement suited to bee pollination, small volume pollen production, and heavy ornate <italic>Avicennia</italic> grain structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959683613483620">Duke, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683613483620">Grindrod, 1988</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Ceriops</italic> and <italic>Bruguiera</italic> are inefficient wind dispersers reliant on insect pollination. From all <italic>Bruguiera</italic> species and <italic>Ceriops tagal</italic>, pollen is ‘spring load’ ejected from the flower only when triggered by the body of a pollinator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0959683613483620">Wightman, 2006</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Rhizophora</italic> species demonstrate abundant localised pollen distribution close to the parent source, with strong representation inshore to offshore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683613483620">Grindrod, 1988</xref>). High pollen/ovule ratios, short pollen generation time, lack of nectar secretion and down-pointing flowers (unobstructive to dispersal) result in <italic>Rhizophora’s</italic> high production wind pollination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0959683613483620">Tomlinson, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Mangrove community pollen assemblages skew toward an over-representation of wind dispersed-pollinated taxa. In response to <italic>Rhizophora</italic> behaviour, interpretative guidelines have been generated from modern sediment studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959683613483620">Rowe (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959683613483620">2012)</xref> established <italic>Rhizophora</italic> values up to 95% as indicative of lower-tidal mangrove sites, between 30% and 60% as representative of upper tidal and &lt;30% at the landward extremity of mangroves (extending into adjacent ecosystems such as mudflat). A 90% pollen proportion of <italic>Rhizophora</italic> has been outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683613483620">Ellison (2008)</xref> as a <italic>Rhizophora</italic> stand, with a 30% proportion as immediately adjacent to <italic>Rhizophora</italic> growth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683613483620">Bartlett and Barghoorn (1973)</xref> state between 45% and 95% <italic>Rhizophora</italic> plus <italic>Avicennia</italic> as representative of a mangrove swamp and 10–45% <italic>Rhizophora</italic> pollen (declining further to &lt;10%) representing sediments immediately landward.</p>
<p>Major pollen types delivered long-distance into intertidal sediments are also wind dispersed. The open woodland structure dominating the Caution Bay coastal lowlands provide conditions ideally suited to wind dispersed-pollinated plant types. These are expected to demonstrate a ubiquitous pollen signal. Conversely, taxa of the mud flat and dune ridges display predominantly localised pollen distributions. Excessive close-range input may swamp regional representation (Poaceae, for example, may derive from inland-upland sources but its significance can be masked by pollen from the dune and littoral plain). In all cases the closed-canopied nature of mangrove growth can unfavourably filter or obstruct longer-distance pollen. Offshore winds may also limit landward airborne pollen deposition. Favourably, offshore winds may help to localise transport of mangrove pollen types such as <italic>Rhizophora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683613483620">Chappell and Grindrod, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683613483620">Grindrod, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683613483620">1988</xref>).</p>

<p>Maximum hand-action core depths were recovered. Core 1 reached a depth of 180 cm and core 3 148 cm. Pale, inorganic, gritty (shell and stone) consolidated clays were observed at the base of each core and could not be penetrated further. In core 1 from 180 to 105 cm pale grey clay (10YR 7/1 to 6/1) is present incorporating significant shell fragment and sand proportions (a gradual decrease in shell continues to 92 cm). No fibrous organics or root materials occur through this lower unit. Above 105 cm is organic (patchy fibrous and mud-like) clay, very dark brown in colour (10YR 2/1). Fine root material occurs throughout and complete molluscan shells are occasional. In core 3 dark coarse organic clay (7.5YR 3/1 to 2.5/1) is present from 148 to 14 cm. Unidentifiable organic remains and fine root material occur (the former contributing to some clay staining) but the proportions of clay, shell grit and sand decrease up-core, particularly above 80 cm. The upper 14 cm is mottled fine grey clay (2.5YR 4/1) with localised red-brown colour (7.5YR 3/4). This clay includes neither sand nor shell fragment and visible plant material is almost absent. A narrow interface blends the two core 3 units, spanning 9 to 14 cm.</p>

<title>Chronology</title>
<p>Twenty samples were submitted for AMS <sup>14</sup>C analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683613483620">Table 1</xref>). Each core demonstrates a number of dating inconsistencies. To counterbalance dating problems, numerous dates were obtained in a scheme aimed toward (at minimum) highlighting ‘populations’ of dates with depth, revealing broad time periods. Where inversions do occur, these discrepancies may still be considered within a reasonably similar age range or ‘group’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683613483620">Björck and Wohlfarth, 2001</xref>, discussions). Therefore, while <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683613483620">Table 1</xref> reveals some mixture of AMS results, an overall chronological–stratigraphical integrity is demonstrated. That is, broad vertical core integrity exists with youngest dates found toward the surface and oldest with depth. Core 3 incorporates an upper 12 cm spanning the past c. 950 years. Below this age dates consistent with depth span c. 950–1740 cal. yr BP, followed by a lowest zone of mixing with an age up to c. 1860 cal. yr BP prior to a basal date approaching 2000 cal. yr BP (between 80 and 90 cm depth two dates are near-identical at 1732±38 and 1738±36 cal. yr BP). The upper 20 cm of Core 1 appears to be modern, below which a mixed zone centres across c. 450–650 cal. yr BP before a single date of 1714±34 cal. yr BP at 140 cm depth. This lower age is anomalous, although noted to correspond to a majority of results from Core 3, simultaneously recorded within a horizon of comparable sedimentary character.</p>

<p>Core 3 incorporates a significantly more diverse pollen assemblage relative to core 1, and is the only record demonstrating the replacement of one Caution Bay vegetation community by another. The core 3 pollen record is divided into four zones, as follows:</p>
<p>Zone 1 (148–90 cm; c. 2000–1740 cal. yr BP). Throughout the zone mangrove representation is at or above 80% of the pollen sum with clear <italic>Rhizophora</italic>-<italic>A</italic> dominance. Other mangrove taxa (<italic>Rhizophora</italic>-<italic>B, Bruguiera/Ceriops</italic> and <italic>Avicennia)</italic> are secondary and record ongoing minor percentages (&lt;10%). <italic>Lumnitzera</italic> and <italic>Excoecaria</italic> are occasional. Notably, <italic>Rhizophora</italic>-<italic>A</italic> values fluctuate to a greater extent than the secondary mangrove taxa (a trend apparent for the entire core). A diverse suite of non-mangrove pollen is represented (Poaceae aside, terrestrial taxa are intermittent). Herbaceous taxa cluster toward the lower half of zone 1 with Boraginaceae, Chenopodiaceae, <italic>Zornia, Flagellaria</italic>, Menispermaceae and Acanthaceae recorded at an earlier stage to <italic>Desmondium</italic>, Asteraceae and Apiaceae. Tree types, Myrtaceae, <italic>Pandanus, Ficus</italic> and the Ulmaceae genera occur somewhat more frequently than other taxa. Proteaceae, <italic>Stemonurus</italic>, Araliaceae, <italic>Kleinhovia</italic> and <italic>Bombax</italic>, Apiaceae and <italic>Crotalaria</italic> only occur in zone 1. Charcoal concentrations are variable but tend to decrease toward the top of the zone.</p>
<p>Zone 2 (90–50 cm; c. 1740–1300 cal. yr BP). Collectively, high mangrove values are maintained. Individually, increases in the representation of secondary mangrove taxa occur, notably toward the top of the zone. <italic>Rhizophora</italic>-<italic>A</italic> numbers continue to predominate. The non-mangrove component is again dominated by Myrtaceae, <italic>Pandanus</italic>, Ulmaceae, Poaceae and <italic>Desmodium</italic>, but with a shift toward increased Fabaceae and <italic>Nothofagus</italic>. Cyperaceae and Pteridophyta are periodically missing within zone 2 and Boraginaceae noticeably declines. Charcoal concentrations increase sharply from zone 1 and remain elevated (peaking at 80 cm depth).</p>
<p>Zone 3 (50–12 cm; c. 1300–1000 cal. yr BP). Mangroves continue to represent over 90% of the pollen sum. <italic>Rhizophora</italic>-<italic>A</italic> alone contributes to 80%, but begins to demonstrate fluctuating decline. <italic>Avicennia</italic> (and <italic>Rhizophora</italic>-<italic>B</italic> to a lesser extent) increase further on values seen in zones 2 and 1. <italic>Bruguiera/Ceriops</italic> remain constant and all other mangrove taxa are sporadic. Terrestrial tree and shrub taxa continue to be dominated by Myrtaceae and Fabaceae. <italic>Trema, Terminalia</italic>, Euphorbiaceae and Arecaceae are present in the lower half of the zone, prior to Araucariaceae and expansion in <italic>Pandanus</italic> and <italic>Casuarina. Barringtonia</italic> increases up core from zone 2. Poaceae and <italic>Desmodium</italic> percentages remain dominant, although the number of minor herbaceous taxa observed has declined. Cyperaceae values are constant. <italic>Flagellaria</italic> and Boragninaceae increase toward the top of the zone. Charcoal concentrations decrease from zone 2 but show a single sample rise at 16 cm.</p>
<p>Zone 4 (12–0 cm; c. 1000 cal. yr BP to present).The prominent feature of this zone is the marked decline in <italic>Rhizophora</italic>-<italic>A</italic> values and corresponding strongest representation of <italic>Avicennia. Rhizophora</italic>-<italic>A</italic> declines to 24% of the pollen sum as <italic>Avicennia</italic> increases to 32%. <italic>Excoecaria</italic> and <italic>Rhizophora-B</italic> also increase and <italic>Lumnitzera</italic> is introduced to the record. <italic>Bruguiera/Ceriops</italic> values are maintained; <italic>Sonneratia</italic> is lost. Total non-mangrove pollen sum contributions rise significantly to 38%. Myrtaceae, <italic>Pandanus</italic>, Arecaceae and <italic>Casuarina</italic> all show sustained increases and combine with new taxa <italic>Hibiscus</italic>, Aracariaceae, <italic>Podocarpus</italic> and <italic>Phyllocladus. Celtis</italic> and <italic>Barringtonia</italic> show an initial presence only to decline in the top samples. The record of Poaceae, Cyperaceae and Pteridophyta increases sharply and Chenopodiaceae is well represented. Interestingly, in the transition into zone 4 the higher total non-mangrove presence has not included a more diverse suite of taxa. Charcoal concentrations decrease to near-lowest.</p>

<title>Late-Holocene mangrove succession at Caution Bay</title>
<p>The sediments collected at Caution Bay were deposited over a late-Holocene period spanning the past 2000 years. The consolidated nature of sediments below cores 1 and 3 is considered to pre-date site vegetation development. The change in site sedimentation, to fibrous dark muds, and the earliest timeframe c. 2000–1700 cal. yr BP mark the onset of mangrove growth. Mangroves are a group of highly reactive opportunists. They rapidly colonise newly deposited but stable intertidal sediments and in doing so help reinforce these sediments and promote further sedimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683613483620">Blasco et al., 1996</xref>). Across the Greater Australian monsoonal tropics <italic>Rhizophora</italic>(ceae) forest is shown to have established directly upon postglacial saltwater inundation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683613483620">Grindrod, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959683613483620">Rowe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0959683613483620">Woodroffe et al., 1985</xref>). This is also the case at Caution Bay; approaching 2000 cal. yr BP sediment accumulation initiating a lower tide permitted a well-formed <italic>Rhizophora</italic> mangrove forest to colonise and become entrenched across the area.This was to an extent greater than that seen today (with ‘big swamp’ spatial and character equivalency, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959683613483620">Rowe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0959683613483620">Woodroffe et al., 1985</xref>). The genus <italic>Rhizophora</italic> requires frequently inundated habitat and demonstrates optimal and continuous development on well-drained perennially wet muddy substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683613483620">Duke and Bunt, 1979</xref>). <italic>Rhizophora</italic> pollen sum content of at least 85% indicates that suitable sedimentation was present and provided conditions for dense Caution Bay plant growth at c. 2000 until approximately 1300–1000 cal. yr BP. <italic>Rhizophora</italic> forest appears to have established right up the tidal profile to border the terrestrial fringe during this period.</p>
<p>Enough minor pollen evidence exists to demonstrate that the <italic>Rhizophora</italic> forest was not a monospecific ecosystem, but subject to local structural variations. Openings are a common occurrence in young to middle-aged <italic>Rhizophora</italic> stands for example(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683613483620">Paijmans, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0959683613483620">Wightman, 2006</xref>). Canopy gaps would have facilitated the non-mangrove pollen inclusions recorded through core 1 and the lower zones of core 3, also admitting sufficient light for patches of undergrowth development including scattered ferns (e.g. <italic>Acrostichum</italic>), Acanthaceae, <italic>Brownlowia</italic> and occasional palm types. As the <italic>Rhizophora</italic> forest matures greater timber volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683613483620">Paijmans, 1976</xref>) largely closes the canopy and the penetrative ability of light and long-distance pollen declines (as portrayed in core 1 zone 3). <italic>Bruguiera</italic> is a common <italic>Rhizophora</italic> associate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683613483620">Duke and Bunt, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0959683613483620">Wightman, 2006</xref>) and the <italic>Bruiguiera/Ceriops</italic> pollen type likely represents this genus when recorded with high <italic>Rhizophora . Bruguiera</italic> can form concentrated patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0959683613483620">Wightman, 2006</xref>) so the Caution Bay distribution may have been not of uniformly scattered individuals amongst the <italic>Rhizophora</italic>, but isolated groves.</p>
<p>Between c. 2000 and 1300–1000 cal. yr BP <italic>Avicennia</italic> is only a minor mangrove coinhabitor. Modern-day distribution is restricted by a degree of shade intolerance which would have affected an ability to initially coexist with <italic>Rhizophora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959683613483620">Duke, 1991</xref>). However, <italic>Avicennia</italic> is a genus demonstrating wide physiological tolerance to higher salinity, intertidal position and temperature and will outcompete <italic>Rhizophora</italic> when conditions shift inland beyond the lower-tidal window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959683613483620">Duke, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0959683613483620">Wightman 2006</xref>). At Caution Bay this shift approaches 1000 cal. yr BP. It is at this time that <italic>Rhizophora</italic> retreats seaward to establish its present-day distribution. The decline in <italic>Rhizophora</italic> values to 25% of the pollen sum in core 3 zone 1 confirms its onsite absence. Simultaneously <italic>Avicennia</italic> expands to establish and dominate a landward upper tidal zone. Given the biology of <italic>Avicennia</italic> pollen production and dispersal, values up to 32% are significant endorsement of dominant presence. <italic>Ceriops</italic> is also a competitive mangrove taxon toward the landward margins of tidal water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683613483620">Paijmans, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0959683613483620">Wightman, 2006</xref>). <italic>Ceriops</italic> does not become an important canopy tree at Caution Bay, but may form a consistent fringing shrub to <italic>Avicennia</italic> woodland. Site succession away from <italic>Rhizophora</italic> includes development of an open mud-flat expanse, which after 1000 cal. yr BP is the zone bordering the terrestrial limit. Chenopodiaceae pollen suggests salt marsh communities occupy patches on an otherwise unvegetated mudflat.

From sites in southern West Papua, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683613483620">Ellison (2005)</xref> indicates that high Holocene relative sea level was maintained at an estimated 0.67 mm/yr over the last 4000 year period. For a majority of the mid to late Holocene, a large proportion of the Caution Bay littoral zone sat well below increased sea levels and associated high-tide reach (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683613483620">Ellison, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683613483620">Grindrod, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683613483620">1988</xref>). Sediment accumulation was such that the sediment accommodation space remained unfilled at this time, the situation changing 2000–1700 cal. yr BP and thereafter. Comparatively it is difficult to calculate Caution Bay sediment accumulation rates given date intermixing and subsequent use of age ‘population’ trends. The sea level calculation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683613483620">Ellison (2008)</xref>, being from a large deltaic environment, precludes direct application of the 0.67 mm/yr figure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683613483620">Ellison’s (2008)</xref> research reveals a transgressive Holocene mangrove sequence where discussions incorporate not only relative sea level rise as a factor in mangrove change but a degree of subsidence across the deltaic setting. Caution Bay is not interpreted as equally geomorphologically active.</p>
<p>A regressive Holocene succession of mangrove occurs at Caution Bay. For tidal-dominated systems, and during conditions of Holocene sea level stillstand, replacement of outer mangroves by more landward zones occurs not as a result of shoreline regression, but as a result of vertical sediment infilling, with implication in waterlogging and salinity. In the absence of large sediment supplies mangroves behave within a simple zonation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0959683613483620">Woodroffe, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>A small, slow sediment supply would explain the thin core depths, and a late c. 2000 cal. yr BP extensive mangrove (<italic>Rhizophora</italic>) presence coincidental with a fall (and stabilization) in sea level conditions. Small initial sediment supplies would have affected Caution Bay’s ability to override the c. 7000–2000 cal. yr BP highstand and infill the sediment accommodation space to facilitate plant growth through this period. It also suggests the catchment hinter-to-lowland surfaces and watercourses draining into the Bay were not suppliers of major sediment volume at this time. Seaward, and post 2000 cal. yr BP, south-coast PNG sediment transport may have incorporated embayment deposition, but in a pattern initially preserving widespread <italic>Rhizophora</italic> growth in equilibrium with water height. Subsequent shifts in sea level and/or tidal redistribution of sediment reworked deposits such that the embayment was raised to incorporate upper (inner) tidal zones favoring <italic>Avicennia</italic>. Any significant movement of sediment from offshore may also have been enough to form a natural levee or ridge. With any tidal barricading effect waterlogging and salinisation would ensue (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0959683613483620">Woodroffe, 1995</xref>). This concept draws upon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959683613483620">Pain and Swadling (1980)</xref>, who observe not only sediment accumulation on the seaward side of the current Vaihua Inlet mangroves, but suggest that the sandspits at this site developed as sandbars associated with mangroves during high sea level. These were then abandoned as sea level fell and mangroves advanced seaward. Inland-sourced sedimentation must also be acknowledged, pending further investigation. Preliminary stratigraphic assessments from excavations across Caution Bay are signaling changes in sedimentation on the lowland plains coincident with the vegetation changes seen in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683613483620">McNiven et al. (2012)</xref> also outline a number of hypotheses regarding upslope erosion and concomitant downslope sedimentation). Either way, the surface at core 3 reached and then exceeded the level of mean high-tide water. With less frequent tidal inundation (flushing), periodic desiccation (evaporative) and increases in soil salinity occurred landward, influencing mangrove composition and, more extremely, prompting tree dieback and salt marsh–unvegetated mudflat establishment. For mangroves, marked interspecific differences occur in both the range of salinity tolerances and the salinity in which growth is maximal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683613483620">Blasco et al., 1996</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0959683613483620">Wightman, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959683613483620">Paijmans and Rollet (1977)</xref> confirm the case of salinity as a major factor affecting differential distribution of mangrove species at Galley Reach, 30 km west of Caution Bay.

<title>A mosaic of coastal plain vegetation through the late Holocene</title>
<p>Combined with extra-local mangrove values, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683613483620">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683613483620">4</xref> incorporate local, regional and long-distance terrestrial pollen. Pollen compositions suggest the existence of a late-Holocene terrestrial mosaic, including dune herbaceous, dune woodland and mixed coastal scrub or thicket communities in closest proximity to the mangrove-mudflat zone. In turn, sclerophyll woodland comprise the immediate background. Of the terrestrial taxa recorded, many occur within more than one vegetation community across the catchment area of today. Taxa are notably shared between the coastal thicket and (semi)deciduous hill-forest, including <italic>Terminalia, Ficus, Celtis</italic>, Fabaceae, <italic>Trema, Kelinhovia</italic> and <italic>Bombax</italic> (noting also a greater propensity toward shared emergent or canopy tree taxa). Based on pollen transport behaviors (see for example the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683613483620">Grindrod (1985)</xref> model for components in the transfer of pollen across a Queensland chenier plain), the pollen delivered to cores 3–1 appears to be from the immediate dune and low-lying plain rather than derived from hinterland sources in any great (interpretable) quantity (isolated occurrences of <italic>Ilex, Nothofagus</italic>, Araucariaceae, <italic>Podocarpus</italic> and <italic>Phyllocladus</italic> are not included in discussion as these are montane forest taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683613483620">Paijmans, 1976</xref>), their pollen having originated outside the Caution Bay catchment). Because floristically the littoral thicket and lowland hill-forests are related, trends in the latter may be inferred from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683613483620">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683613483620">4</xref>. It follows that where thickets and forests trend toward expansion and taxa extend beyond these typical habitats, surrounding vegetation may also shift toward a mixed woodland rather than strict eucalypt canopy composition.</p>
<p>Through the c. 2000 year record the mangrove then mudflat vegetation was backed by the above-mentioned littoral dune and plains. From the base of core 3 a coastal thicket is present and at Caution Bay mixed evergreen and deciduous taxa cover the coastal dune ridge. In definition, ‘scrub’ comprises vegetation dominated by shrubs and/or low stunted trees, with a concentrated presence of herbaceous climbers. A ‘thicket’ differs through the presence of an open tree canopy above the scrub layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683613483620">Heyligers, 1965</xref>). Initially, trees such as <italic>Celtis</italic> and <italic>Bombax</italic> are dominant over Proteaceae, Boraginaceae, <italic>Melastoma</italic> and <italic>Crotalaria</italic>. The period c. 2000–1740 cal. yr BP also demonstrates greater diversity, and the presence of taxa such as <italic>Ficus, Euodia</italic> and <italic>Kelinhovia</italic> indicate a more moist ecosystem than that after 1740 cal. yr BP. The dune system through this earlier time period would also have been quite stable.</p>
<p>From the landward dune boundary thicket would grade gradually with available environmental moisture, interchanging with poorly drained depressions (characterizing the alluvial plains zone). Lower-lying swale-like depressions are occupied by <italic>Pandanus</italic>, swamp grasses and sedges, ferns and the aquatic herb <italic>Nymphaea</italic>/<italic>Nymphoides</italic>. Here, the <italic>Pandanus</italic> and <italic>Nymphaea</italic>/<italic>Nymphoides</italic> signal intermittent waterlogging (fresh) on the plains, their more frequent early occurrence in core 3 (zone 1) corresponding with indicators of moist beach thicket c. 2000–1740 cal. yr BP. Only <italic>Pandanus</italic> increases in distribution after 1000 yr BP, potentially expanding to occupy more cross-mosaic communities. <italic>Pandanus</italic> is also an indicator of disturbance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959683613483620">Prebble et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Beginning 1740 cal. yr BP the coastal thicket experienced a decline in tree cover and canopy diversity, signaling a community transition toward coastal scrub. Canopy tree species such as <italic>Celtis, Kleinhovia</italic> and potential Fabaceae species decrease and the increased occurrence of Fabaceae and <italic>Desmodium</italic> (with spot presence of <italic>Scaevola</italic>) represent first-stage initiation of scrub expansion. In the past 1000 years the coastal ridge hosts a more prominent lower layer of shrubs such as <italic>Hibiscus</italic> and Solanaceae as well as ferns and the climber <italic>Flagellaria</italic>. Coastal woodland also appears to become more prominent beginning 1300 cal. yr BP. This woodland is initially dominated by <italic>Barringtonia</italic> followed by <italic>Casuarina</italic>. Palm types and <italic>Terminalia</italic> are incorporated; Arecaceae is increasingly common after 1000 cal. yr BP. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683613483620">Paijmans (1976)</xref> describes ‘<italic>Barringtonia</italic> formations’ as featuring wide-crowned tree habit with a low closed cover of <italic>Acanthus</italic>, ferns, grasses and herbs. <italic>Casuarinas</italic> similarly form an open canopy and are also a secondary forest indicator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959683613483620">Prebble et al., 2010</xref>). Myrtaceae pollen values are small, and form a less consistent component of the sclerophyll woodland than Poaceae throughout the entire record period.</p>

<p>Microcharcoal concentrations are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683613483620">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683613483620">4</xref>.

However, the closed nature of mangrove canopies questions the extent to which charcoal particles from regional catchment fires have been able to penetrate into the trunk space and accumulate into fully representative records. Additional evidence was therefore sought. Microcharcoal remains were examined from the archaeological site Bogi 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683613483620">Figure 5</xref>), considered to potentially provide more accurate reflections of regional burning owing to its position above the mudflat and on the coastal foredune. In exploration of this potential, the upper 24 archaeological excavation units (XU) were examined.</p>

<p>All charcoal records fluctuate. High, increasing charcoal concentrations were recorded at Bogi 1 between XU6 and 1, corresponding to the past c. 1500 years. Secondary peaks occur across XU9-8, again corresponding to 1500 cal. yr BP, and at XU14 (c. 2050 cal. yr BP). The highest (and least variable) charcoal concentrations through pollen core 3 occur within zone 2 (c. 1740–1300 cal. yr BP) culminating in a peak closer to c. 1740 cal. yr BP. Through pollen core 1 an isolated lower spike in charcoal has been recorded at c. 1500 cal. yr BP. Charcoal concentrations then decline before a series of higher values occur between 750 and 300 cal. yr BP. Interestingly, all three charcoal records correlate, reinforcing increased catchment burning through approximately 2000–1400 cal. yr BP.</p>
<p>‘Variable’ is a term commonly used to describe the late-Holocene climate of Greater Australia and adjacent Pacific rim. Regional climate demonstrates an overall mid- to late-Holocene drying trend, upon which variable episodes are superimposed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959683613483620">Lees (1992</xref>; north mainland Australia) details this drying trend as being interrupted by periods of increased precipitation, occurring from 3500 and 2800 yr BP, again between 2100 and 1600 yr BP and at several stages in the last 1000 years. Palaeoclimate trends from Port Moresby and the Central Province also incorporate periodically wetter conditions (e.g. c. 2500 yr BP, increasing further through 1700–1200 yr BP and predominantly from 1000 to 700 yr BP at Waigani Lake; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959683613483620">Osborne et al. (1993)</xref> suggesting increases in available moisture equally likely through decreased evaporation and temperature as increased precipitation). Lake Wanum (northern lowlands Markham Valley, Morobe Province) reveals increases in late-Holocene lake levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959683613483620">Prebble et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959683613483620">Rowe (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959683613483620">2007)</xref> demonstrates island swamp water initiation in Torres Strait c. 2500 and again after 1000 yr BP. Drier climatic episodes are potentially associated with persistent large-scale sinking, dry southeasterly trade flows over the Greater Australian tropics inhibiting the onset of the Asian-Australian monsoon. These are similar to atmospheric flows associated with modern-day El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Prominent ENSO activity after c. 5000 cal. yr BP has been suggested from the western Pacific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959683613483620">Haberle et al., 2001</xref>) as well as northern mainland Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683613483620">Haberle, 2005</xref>). Mid- to late-Holocene climatic implications following the flooding of the Sahul and Sunda shelves, and opening of the Indonesian ‘throughflow’ (Pacific to Indian Oceans, and consequential ‘high-energy-window’), is also to be considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0959683613483620">Schulmeister and Lees, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>With numerous authors indicating late-Holocene wet–dry phasing, variability in landscape fire and some soil movement would be expected. Higher precipitation and coinciding highest charcoal records at Caution Bay may represent a local fire regime decoupled from climatic dictation and maintained through anthropogenic action irrespective of the moist conditions. It may represent a perceived anthropogenic need for greater control of increased plant biomass facilitated by moister climate phases. A Caution Bay shift c. 1740–1300 cal. yr BP between coastal thicket and scrub and a greater representation of coastal woodland-grassland is consistent with recurrent drier (and/or variable) conditions as well as fire impact. Increased secondary forest and disturbance indicators are conceivably also driven by greater rainfall variability, burning and/or eroded sediments.</p>

<title>Palaeoecological-archaeological dialogue</title>
<p>Recent archaeological results from Caution Bay demonstrate pottery-using peoples (Lapita) settled the region 2900 cal. yr BP with pre-ceramic occupation extending further, to at least 5000 cal. yr BP along the coast and 6000 cal. yr BP on adjacent lowlands. Implications of the first known occurrence of Lapita peoples on the New Guinea mainland are discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959683613483620">David et al. (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959683613483620">McNiven et al. (2011)</xref>. The region’s palaeoecology, as discussed in this paper, has implications for further understanding the human occupation of Caution Bay. Particular attention is drawn to the parallel timing of mangrove development, final major midden concentrations at site Bogi 1 (post-Lapita dated to 2000–2150 cal. yr BP and with minimal foredune development thereafter), and evidence of Caution Bay as having hosted a dynamic, non-transient Lapita community occupying (interacting) with shoreline to inland locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683613483620">David et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959683613483620">McNiven et al., 2011</xref>). Increased burning and vegetation shifts at Caution Bay after c. 2000 cal. yr BP further parallel evidence from the West New Britain and Western Highlands Provinces, correlated with archaeological indicators for changes toward systematic plant management and reduced settlement mobility that suggest widespread and increasing dependence on plant food production(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959683613483620">Denham and Haberle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959683613483620">Lentfer et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>It is worth considering that a widespread, established <italic>Rhizophora</italic> forest dating to c. 2000 cal. yr BP would effectively barricade shoreline access. <italic>Rhizophora</italic>’<italic>s</italic> multibranched tree with arched-root habit would hinder easy human and notably watercraft movement and/or usher land access by way of penetrative watercourse channels. Late-Holocene changes in sea level, potentially tidal direction and/or strength, may also harbour consequences not only for intertidal ecologies, but near-coast human sea-travel patterns and predictability. As a near-monoculture environment, the <italic>Rhizophora</italic> forest would host less human-use resources than found in communities of more diverse composition and structure, including the post 1300–1000 cal. yr BP tidal zonation. Further, the manner in which mangrove communities secure sediments excludes the intertidal zone as an offshore source of sediments capable of contributing meaningfully to foredune development post 2000 cal. yr BP. A significant cultural trend for Caution Bay generally is the disappearance of most settlements in the study area around 2000 cal. yr BP (after some 900 years of Lapita followed by post-Lapita villages). After 2000 cal. yr BP, occasional settlements come and go in the study area (especially around 1700 cal. yr BP) and by 1200 years ago there is evidence of occupation of the Boera district immediately to the southeast. Notably, Boera is not fringed by mangroves and it is suggested that the shifting village locations were influenced by the development of dense mangroves fronting the Bogi 1 shoreline and much of Caution Bay.</p>
<p>Retrieved ceramics of excavated horizons dated from c. 2900–2600 cal. yr BP in Caution Bay comprise the Lapita material cultural ‘signature’ (they are as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683613483620">Galipaud (2006)</xref> describes the ‘best witnesses’ to the Lapita tradition). From a palaeoenvironmental perspective however, much discussion and debate surrounds so-called associated signature trends. Taking the western Pacific in example, patterns in island transformation are evident. Relatively little initial impact is recorded. Changes in sediment distribution and vegetation composition then develop as Lapita population densities increase. Landscape transformations include loss of arboreal taxa and noticeably shifted sediments from the hills to coast (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683613483620">Anderson (2002)</xref> citing numerous cases. See also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0959683613483620">Sand (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0959683613483620">Stevenson (1999)</xref> for New Caledonia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683613483620">Anderson and Clarke (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683613483620">Enright and Gosden (1992)</xref> for Fiji). Extensive plant loss and an erosional influx of sediment onto the littoral plains zone is not evident at Caution Bay based on the data generated in this study. In explanatory difference, the Lapita peoples were not the first occupiers of Caution Bay, and likely entered into a landscape already modified by humans. Any subsequent ‘associated signature’ changes imposed by Lapita simply may have had less of a shock landscape value, or were more effectively absorbed by the greater New Guinean (non-isolate island) land-mass. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683613483620">McNiven et al. (2012)</xref> highlight that because of required interaction with existing social and environmental landscapes, regional south PNG Lapita settlement was a more complexly negotiated process comparative to other parts of the western Pacific, questioning overtly simple transplant methodology and value. In looking forward, therefore, further inland evidence is required where additional direct palaeoenvironmental description can combine with archaeological deduction. The focus will need to be on environmental change local to Caution Bay per se, on the movement and likely source of accumulating sediments, and to further pursue palynological disturbance indicators and decreases in vegetation cover. Such focus will then extend the understanding of climatic fluctuations, and provide a more specific framework for comparative study against Quaternary highland PNG change. Focus toward long-term distinction and distribution between coastal lowland and hill-forest types (dry evergreen forest, deciduous forest), the floristics and structure of mixed woodland (grassed to wooded), fire occurrence as well as a better understanding of the formation and influential role of littoral zone sandy ridges and foredunes is also suggested.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The Caution Bay cores 1 and 3 sequence illustrates a late-Holocene mangrove–mudflat transition leading from the lower intertidal environment through <italic>Rhizophora, Rhizophora-Bruguiera, Avicennia, Avicennia-Ceriops</italic>, and <italic>Chenopodiaceae-Cyperaceae</italic> dominated communities including the present bare supratidal mudflat. The dating noise potentially produced by tidal or floodwater sediment redistribution and by bioturbation appears to be minimal relative to the palynological signal. There is no evidence that the littoral succession suffered interruption and it is proposed that the timing and mangrove pattern is largely a function of low sediment loading, sedimentary redistribution and salinisation, all upon sea level decline c. 2000 cal. yr BP. Caution Bay demonstrates that for the south coast (including Gulf of Papua) site-alternate environmental settings possess individual palaeorelationships, both in terms of substrate characteristics and patterns of sedimentation as control measures on mangrove vegetation, and in the manner in which these alter as the land–sea relationship has adjusted during the Holocene.</p>
<p>Simultaneously for PNG, this paper provides new and expansive inland, southern lowland palaeoecological investigation (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683613483620">McNiven et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959683613483620">Osborne et al., 1993</xref>). Late-Holocene coastal alluvial and dune thickets were replaced by scrub formations and woodlands as regional climate incorporated a number of variable wet–dry phases. Beyond the immediate coastal zone, however, inland results are tentative. Changes across the Caution Bay catchment have been inferred from those at the coast, and from this stage in the data the entire landscape may be continuously responding and shifting. Further work is required, where patterns (or strategies) in burning and an archaeological collaboration will play a big part in determining spatial and temporal variability. For the archaeology a key to this future analysis will be an ability to separate and extend in understanding local and Lapita-colonist environmental interaction and influence.</p>
