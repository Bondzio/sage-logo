<sec id="sec1-0021998312459779" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) are driven by ordinary engines such as gasoline engine, thus, its flight time is limited by the capacity of the fuel tank which contains gasoline. In order to increase UAV flight time, use of energy-harvesting unit from environment is desirable. Among many energy-harvesting schemes, solar cells seem to be most logical as a UAV flies in the sky where solar energy is abundant, particularly at higher altitudes. Even in cloudy weather, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have some advantages over Si-based solar cells or other more expensive but higher performance semiconductor based solar cells, i.e., at a lower cost, DSSC work better than Si-solar cells in cloudy conditions. However, the integration of solar cells to airborne structures has not been well studied. The NRL group headed by Thomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312459779">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312459779">2</xref>] has studied the feasibility of using solar cells in small UAVs, and concluded that in order to power a UAV by solar cells only, one needs to use the solar cells of higher power conversion efficiency (PCE). PCE value of typical DSSC is 6–10%, but use of such DSSCs in a UAV or micro-air vehicle (MAV), seems to be still justifiable to increase flight time as well as powering additional sensors and actuators mounted in such a UAV and MAV. Then, an ideal UAV propulsion system would be driven by the electric motor connected to propeller, which is powered by the solar energy harvesting system mounted on the UAV structures including wings. For such solar energy harvesting systems, low-cost DSSCs are better suited.</p>
<p>The first successful DSSC design was made by the Osaka University group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312459779">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312459779">4</xref>] who used porous ZnO with rose Bengal dye dipped in the electrolyte solution of KI-I2. This DSSC exhibited the power conversion efficiency of 1.5% and quantum yield of 15% and open voltage of 0.38 V. The above design has two unique features, use of porous semiconductor, ZnO and electrolyte of KI-I2. The former contributed to the effective adsorbance of dye on the porous surface of ZnO and the latter makes the DSSC electrochemically stable. They also studied the photocurrent dependence on several parameters, concentration of dye in solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312459779">4</xref>] and pH of the solution and use of other metal oxides such as TiO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312459779">5</xref>]). The above pioneered DSSC design was much improved by O’Regan and Grätzel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312459779">6</xref>] who used nanostructured TiO<sub>2</sub> and a new dye based on rutenium complex where nanostructured TiO<sub>2</sub> layer of 10 µm thickness (the average size of single particles is 12 nm) was used. The DSSC exhibited the open circuit voltage of 0.78 V and short circuit current of 1.3 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. This DSSC with size 5 mm<sup>2</sup> showed the power conversions efficiency (PCE) of 7.9% under AM1.5 sun light condition and 12% PCE under diffuse light condition. The fill factor of the DSSC under low intensity sun light condition (5 W/m<sup>2</sup>) is 0.7. This is higher than that of conventional silicon based photovoltaic, which is less than 0.5. This means that use of DSSC in dim light conditions (morning and late afternoon sun lights, cloudy days and inside building) is more advantageous than the conventional silicon based solar cells. They performed limited durability test on the DSSC, 2 months under visible lights (l &gt; 400 nm), resulting in only 10% reduction in the photocurrent.</p>
<p>Since the above pioneering works, many research groups are working on DSSC with aim of improving higher PCE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312459779">7</xref>], and larger sized DSSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312459779">8</xref>], flexible DSSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312459779">9</xref>] and using dye which can absorb light of longer wavelengths including near IR waves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998312459779">10</xref>]. One can refer to a recent review paper on DSSC development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312459779">11</xref>]. The basic principle of DSSC is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312459779">Figure 1</xref> where (a) shows the nanostructure design and (b) the electron flow. Once the dye absorbs sun light, it is excited and there is an increase in its energy level higher than that of TiO<sub>2</sub>, thus converting photons to electrons. These are passed to TiO<sub>2,</sub> then to the working electrode, and further on to the electric current circulating the electric wire, reaching the counter electrode, i.e., the electrons come to the counter electrode, pass through iodine which is now reduced, and thus, holes are emitted from the dye to complete the redox cycle.

<p>In order to design a DSSC system to be integrated in the wing structures of a UAV, a MAV or a manned air vehicle, several requirements need to be satisfied, and they are: (i) the integrated DSSC needs to be durable for a longer time under usage environment, such as under dynamic bending loading condition, (ii) the electrolyte must perform well even in lower temperatures, which are required for flying at higher altitudes. This article is aimed at designing such airborne integrated DSSC systems by using thin glass substrate (0.3 mm thick) and also lower-temperature resistant electrolyte (up to −50°C).</p></sec>

<p>Iodine, 4-tert butyl-pyridine (TBP), tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI), poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (P(VDF-HFP)), 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN), acetonitrile, tert-butyl alcohol, ethanol and chenodeoxycholic acid (Cheno) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Methyl-3-n-propyl-imidazolium iodide (MPImI) was purchased from TCI America. Transparent conducting oxide glass substrates (Fluorine doped SnO<sub>2</sub> layer with sheet resistance of 3.5 ohm/sq, NEG, Japan) were washed under ultra-sonication for 10 min with neutral detergent, DI water, ethanol, respectively, followed by UVO cleaning (Jelight Company, Inc) for 10 min before use. Commercial TiO<sub>2</sub> (Ti-Nanoxide T and D, Solaronix SA, Switzerland) was used for the preparation of the nanocrystalline films. Pt catalyst (T/SP, Solaronix SA, Switzerland) was used for the preparation of the counter electrode.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec5-0021998312459779"><title>Preparation of dye-adsorbed TiO<sub>2</sub> films</title>
<p>The doctor blade method was used to fabricate TiO<sub>2</sub> films on FTO glass (thickness of 0.3 mm, Nippon Electric Glass company). The electrode coated with the TiO<sub>2</sub> paste (Ti-Nanoxide T and D, Solaronix SA) was shortly dried in air at 100°C, followed by sintering at 500°C for 30 min. A TiO<sub>2</sub> film of 12 µm thickness was used as the working electrode on which dye is mounted. After sintering, it cooled down to 70°C. The TiO<sub>2</sub> electrode was immersed in the solution (acetonitrile:tert-butyl alcohol = 1:1) with 0.5 mM cis-dithio-cyanate-N,N’-bis-(4-carboxylate-4-tetrabutylammonium carboxylate-2,2′-bipyridine) ruthenium(II) (N719) and kept at room temperature for 12 h. The dye-coated electrodes were rinsed quickly with ethanol.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0021998312459779"><title>Fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells</title>
<p>The electrochemical cell used for photovoltaic measurements consisted of a dye-adsorbed TiO<sub>2</sub> electrode, a Pt-coated counter electrode, a spacer, and an organic electrolyte. The FTO glass was drilled to make two tiny holes. Pt catalyst (Pt-Catalyst T/SP, Solaronix SA) was deposited on the FTO glass by using the doctor blade method and treated at 400°C for 30 min. The two electrodes were sandwiched with the spacer. The 25 µm thick hot-melt film (Surlyn, Solaronix) was used as a spacer. It was heated at 120°C for 2 min. The electrolyte was introduced into the cell by using a pipette. Two holes were sealed with UV adhesive (31X-101B, ThreeBond) and a thin glass.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0021998312459779"><title>Photovoltaic characterization</title>
<p>The photoelectrochemical performance of the solar cell was measured using OTENTO-SUN II (Bunkoh-Keiki Co., Ltd., Japan). A 500-W Xe lamp served as the light source in combination with a band-pass filter (400-800 nm) to remove ultraviolet and infrared radiation and to give 100 mW cm<sup>−2</sup> (the equivalent of one sun at AM 1.5) at the surface of the test cell. The incident light intensity was calibrated by a standard Si solar cell (BS-520, Bunkoh-Keiki Co., Ltd., Japan) and solar tester (SCR-200, Bunkoh-Keiki Co., Ltd., Japan). UV-vis. absorption spectra were recorded with a JASCO model V-570 spectrophotometer.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0021998312459779"><title>Integration and bending tests</title>
<p>Integration of a DSSC of size (5 mm × 5 mm) into a polymeric composite panel (woven composite panel of length 142 mm, width 29.3 mm and thickness 1.52 mm) is made by bonding only the end area of the PET film to the composite panel, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312459779">Figure 2(b)</xref>. As a comparison, we also made another integration of bonding directly DSSC to the composite panel, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312459779">Figure 2(a)</xref>. The polymer adhesive used for the above bonding is 3 M Scotch Weld AF-163, curing condition 120 min at 80°C.

<p>The bending test for the integrated DSSC to composite panel was performed by placing the composite panel under four-point bending jig as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312459779">Figure 3</xref>. In this figure, the DSSC is mounted at the bottom of the composite beam, four-point load span is 48 mm and the support span is 100 mm.

<p>The composite panel used for the bending test is woven composite and its dimensions are length of 110 mm, width of 29.3 mm and thickness of 1.52 mm, and its longitudinal Young’s modulus is 18.5 GPa.</p>
<p>We performed two sets of bending tests: (i) static bending test (both under tension and compression) to measure the failure bending strain at which the adhesive site is broken, or debonding of the working and counter electrodes of the DSSC and (ii) cyclic bending test to measure residual PCE of the DSSC under zero to tensile bending strain condition with cyclic frequency of 2 Hz.

<sec id="sec10-0021998312459779"><title>N719 dye based DSSC</title>
<p>Iodine based electrolytes can be optimized in terms of efficiency and stability. Better stability can be obtained by modifying the TiO<sub>2</sub>-dye interface and reducing the vapor pressure of the electrolyte’s solvent. The latter is especially important for outdoor applications where cyclic temperature changes require very robust sealing. Low-viscous solvents, liquid electrolytes may result in leakage of the cell. To avoid any leakage of the electrolyte, we use solidified (or gel) electrolytes which can be processed by polymerization of a precursor solution containing the monomer/oligomer and the iodide/iodine redox couple. The TiO<sub>2</sub>-network is completely filled with the solid state electrolyte in the negligible vapor pressure. We optimized gel electrolytes for N719 dye based DSSC and investigated their stability. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312459779">Figure 4</xref> shows the I-V curves of DSSC based on gel electrolyte C and N719 dye.

<p>A summary of the static bending tests applied to DSSC mounted on composite panel under bonding condition 1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312459779">Figure 2(a)</xref>) and condition 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312459779">Figure 2(b)</xref>) is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998312459779">Table 2</xref> where the failure strains under tensile and compressive bending stress loading are measured.

The most common failure is observed in terms of detachment of the working or counter electrode of DSSC, thus, stop functioning of the energy harvesting, i.e., dropping of PCE value.

<p>It is clear from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998312459779">Table 2</xref> that the bonding condition 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312459779">Figure 2(b)</xref>) exhibits higher tolerance against bending due to its higher values of the failure bending strain of over 0.15%.</p>
<p>The results of cyclic bending tests of the integrated DSSC to composite panel with bonding condition 2 are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312459779">Figure 6</xref>.
<fig id="fig6-0021998312459779" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSC integrated to composite panel subjected to bending strains (under zero and tensile) up to over 40,000 cycles with cyclic frequency 2 Hz where four different bending loading are used, radius of curvature (<italic>R</italic>) = 50 cm (bending strain = 0.03%), 25 cm (0.06%), 20 cm (0.08%) and 15 cm (0.1%).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998312459779-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It follows from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312459779">Figure 6</xref> that the DSSC integration based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312459779">Figure 2(b)</xref> is durable design, where the DSSC is mounted on the composite panel under mechanical touch with the covering PET film which is bonded directly to the composite panel. This is reasonable in bonding condition 2 as the bending stress at the surface of the composite plate is not transferred to the DSSC, as the interface between them is just mechanical touch. Whereas, for the DSSC, integrated directly to the composite, it exhibited the debonding of the working and counter electrodes of the DSSC, leading to rapid decrease in the PCE value. Therefore, further study remains to be carried out on strengthening the bonding of the working and counter electrodes of the DSSC by using stronger adhesive bonding while satisfying the electrochemistry requirements of the DSSC cell structure.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec12-0021998312459779" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Optimum integration scheme of DSSC into a composite panel is studied with the finding that the integration of DSSC directly on the composite by adhesive bonding is not durable while the integration of DSSC to the composite panel via covered PET film is much more durable under cyclic bending loading. Such integrated DSSC into airborne structural surfaces with the proposed scheme discussed in this paper is expected to increase flight time of a UAV/MAV. In addition, the UAV/MAV may need to fly even in dim light conditions, i.e. early morning and late afternoon hours, for which the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs is known to exceed that of the Si-based solar cells.</p></sec>
