<abstract>
<p>The authors investigated the effects of perspective taking on opinions about reparations for victims of historical harm. In two studies, they showed that when non-Indigenous Australians took an Indigenous Australian perspective, this increased perceived entitlement to, and decreased anger toward, monetary compensation. Moreover, perceived entitlement mediated the relationship between anger about monetary compensation and perspective taking. Study 2 demonstrated the mutual influence of emotions and perceived entitlement. In particular, self-image shame rather than group-based guilt or anger predicted support for reparation when an Indigenous Australian perspective was adopted. The results suggest that taking the perspective of people who have experienced harm from one’s own group can bolster a commitment to positive social change in relation to a pressing social issue.</p>

<p>In the years between 1910 and 1970, approximately 100,000 Indigenous Australians were forcibly removed from their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167212450322">Barkan, 2000</xref>) and placed in non-Indigenous institutions and homes. These Indigenous Australians are often called the <italic>Stolen Generations</italic>. The forced removals were conducted under government policies ostensibly to improve living conditions for these children. In April 1997, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission (HREOC) published a report titled “Bringing Them Home.” The report revealed poignant stories told by Indigenous Australians about the lack of food, clothes, and education in the institutions, and physical and sexual abuse in both the institutions and the foster homes.</p>
<p>Ongoing emotional problems such as unresolved grief and mental health problems have affected generations of Indigenous people. The intergenerational effects can be seen in parenting difficulties, substance abuse problems, domestic violence, and higher rates of criminal convictions in comparison to the wider Australian population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167212450322">HREOC, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The HREOC report included recommendations for an official apology by the Australian government and for rehabilitation and compensation. In February 2008, the apology was finally delivered, but the Australian government refused to pay compensation to the victims and instead proposed a national socioeconomic initiative to reduce Indigenous disadvantage that was called <italic>Closing the Gap</italic> (we refer to this form of program generally as <italic>socioeconomic support</italic>). This policy appears to have support in the wider community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0146167212450322">Pholi, Black, &amp; Richards, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The Australian Government’s reluctance to support reparations for the Stolen Generations may stem from a lack of empathy by non-Indigenous Australians with Indigenous Australians. This lack of empathy is reflected in a number of ways. Despite objective disadvantage, many non-Indigenous Australians believe that Indigenous Australians receive economic advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167212450322">Pedersen, Dudgeon, Watt, &amp; Griffiths, 2006</xref>). For example, it is believed that “Indigenous people get free houses, cars, and undeserved special treatment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167212450322">Reconciliation, 2009</xref>). National Surveys suggest that between half and three quarters of respondents show prejudicial attitudes and beliefs against Indigenous Australians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167212450322">Dudgeon, Wright, Paradies, Garney, &amp; Walker, 2010</xref>). Such beliefs have been found to evoke both prejudice against Indigenous Australians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167212450322">Pedersen et al., 2006</xref>) and anger toward them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167212450322">Leach, Iyer, &amp; Pedersen, 2006</xref>). However, beliefs that Indigenous Australians are receiving preferential treatment may also challenge non-Indigenous Australians’ endorsement of the equity principle of distributive justice that resources should be allocated in proportion to people’s contributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167212450322">Bobocel, Son Hing, Holmvall, &amp; Zanna, 2002</xref>). Perceived violation of justice principles may then give rise to opposition to monetary compensation for the Stolen Generations. Thus, resistance to compensation may stem from prejudice but also from justice-based considerations.</p>
<p>In either case, resistance to monetary compensation may foster attitudes that lead non-Indigenous Australians to distance themselves from the Stolen Generations’ grief. Attitudes that serve the detachment function allow advantaged group members (non-Indigenous Australians) to ignore the suffering of an out-group (Indigenous Australians) and to minimize “a sense of personal responsibility for . . . the harsh treatment of the out-group” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167212450322">Snyder &amp; Miene, 1994</xref>, p. 48).</p>
<p>If these attitudes do stem, at least in part, from unwillingness to consider the viewpoint of Indigenous Australians, then we would expect these effects to be reduced when we encourage non-Indigenous Australians to take the perspective of Indigenous Australians. To properly ascertain what is just and fair, and to distinguish between what conduct is right and wrong in any situation, there is often a requirement to acknowledge and understand the interests and desires of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167212450322">Batson, Chang, Orr, &amp; Rowland, 2002</xref>) by taking the perspective of the other party. Such perspective taking has been found to yield positive effects in social situations such as increased helping behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167212450322">Batson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167212450322">Batson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167212450322">Dovidio, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167212450322">Staub, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>There is also evidence of the positive effects of perspective taking in socially sensitive situations where negative judgments by one group of another might hamper positive intergroup relationships. Perspective taking has been found to (a) reduce negative stereotypes about African Americans and elderly people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167212450322">Galinsky, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167212450322">Galinsky &amp; Moskowitz, 2000</xref>), (b) reduce prejudice toward Asian Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167212450322">Shih, Wang, Trahan Bucher, &amp; Stotzer, 2009</xref>) and African Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212450322">Vescio, Sechrist, &amp; Paolucci, 2003</xref>), and (c) reduce stigma about addicted people, people who have contracted AIDS, and homeless people (Batson, Chang, Orr, &amp; Rowland, 1992).</p>
<p>Perspective taking is a psychological technique that is intended to put the self in the situation of the other person so that the perceiver considers the other person’s viewpoint (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167212450322">Galinsky &amp; Moskowitz, 2000</xref>). The positive effect of taking the perspective of another person aligns with social identity theory. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167212450322">Tajfel and Turner (1986)</xref> argued that people tend to have positive self-conceptions that apply more generally to their in-groups, and this idea was expanded and refined in the self-categorization theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0146167212450322">Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, &amp; Wetherell, 1987</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0146167212450322">E. R. Smith and Henry (1996)</xref> found positive support for the self-categorization theory by showing that an in-group could come to be seen to be part of the self. They showed that in-group members were treated in much the same way as the personal self in a reaction time task, and this was attributed to the perceived interchangeability between the person and these other in-group members. Extending this idea, if it is true that other in-group members can be considered to be interchangeable with the personal self, then is it also possible that out-group members can come to be treated like in-group members? If this does occur, then perspective taking provides a plausible mechanism for it. This idea is clearly expressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167212450322">Galinsky (2002)</xref>:
<disp-quote>
<p>Just as the positive evaluation of the self extends to the in-group, the increased self–other overlap following perspective taking could lead to more positive evaluations of an out-group member, which, in turn, might then generalize to the group as a whole. (p. 98)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, taking the perspective of an out-group member increases self–other overlap, enabling the perceiver to visualize the other person’s point of view and experiences, thereby changing their view toward the person. The focus in the present research is on whether taking the perspective of an Indigenous Australian can contribute to a positive commitment to support concrete action to repair past harm.</p>
<sec id="section1-0146167212450322">
<title>Study 1</title>
<p>Study 1 investigates the effect of perspective taking on support for financial compensation and socioeconomic programs to reduce Indigenous Australians’ disadvantage. Many non-Indigenous Australians appear to support the socioeconomic programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0146167212450322">Pholi et al., 2009</xref>), presumably because they believe the current situation is unacceptable, but many are opposed to compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167212450322">Newspoll, 2008</xref>). As noted earlier, resistance to compensation may be due to genuine justice-based considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167212450322">Bobocel et al., 2002</xref>), or to prejudicial attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167212450322">Pedersen et al., 2006</xref>), or to both processes. In either case, it is likely that Indigenous Australians’ demands for monetary compensation will evoke anger in non-Indigenous Australians. We expected that, when non-Indigenous Australian participants took the perspective of an Indigenous Australian, this would reduce experiences of anger about the wish for compensation (Hypothesis 1). If so, the question arises then as to which processes underlie the effect of perspective taking.</p>
<sec id="section2-0146167212450322">
<title>Entitlement and Deservingness</title>
<p>The present research examined a novel mediator for the effect of perspective taking on support for monetary compensation. This predictor involves entitlement to monetary compensation. Both national (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167212450322">HREOC, 1997</xref>) and international (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0146167212450322">United Nations, 2009</xref>) organizations recommended compensation for the Stolen Generations. The concept of entitlement is related to a fair treatment that is based on (quasi-)legal prescriptions and social norms in Western societies (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167212450322">Feather, 2002</xref>). Thus, entitlement and justice are strongly related. This relationship was highlighted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167212450322">Bourdieu (1965)</xref> who stated that when people’s perceived entitlement to material resources is not met, they feel unjustly treated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167212450322">Furby (1986)</xref> went further to argue that asking what people are entitled to is asking what it means to be a person.</p>
<p>The concept of entitlement is closely related to that of deservingness, and some theorists use them interchangeably, whereas others distinguish between them. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167212450322">Feather (2002)</xref> defined <italic>deservingness</italic> as judgments about outcomes that are related to a person’s behavior. In the present research, we use the terms interchangeably because we did not expect that participants would distinguish between the two concepts.</p>
<p>A number of researchers have argued that judgments of deservingness depend on the evaluation or appraisal of an outcome. If so, perceived deservingness can be understood in terms of appraisal theory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167212450322">Feather &amp; McKee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167212450322">Mikula, 1986</xref>). In general, appraisals are considered as evaluations of a situation in terms of benefit of harm that generate certain emotions and related action tendencies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167212450322">Frijda, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146167212450322">Roseman &amp; Smith, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167212450322">C. A. Smith &amp; Ellsworth, 1985</xref>). When a person’s perceived entitlement is denied, or a person receives an undeserved negative outcome, negative affective reactions will occur. For example, emotional responses to perceived injustice are anger and disappointment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167212450322">Ellsworth &amp; Smith, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167212450322">Feather &amp; McKee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167212450322">Mikula, Scherer, &amp; Athenstaedt, 1998</xref>). We expected that taking the perspective of an Indigenous Australian would increase judgments of entitlement to compensation (Hypothesis 2). Moreover, consistent with previous research on deservingness as a predictor of emotions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167212450322">Feather, 2002</xref>), we anticipated that entitlement to compensation would mediate the relationship between perspective taking and anger about monetary compensation. That is, perspective taking would reduce anger to the extent that it increased perceived entitlement (Hypothesis 3).</p>

<sec id="section3-0146167212450322">
<title>Pilot Study</title>
<p>It is important to ensure that the effects of perspective taking can be distinguished from demand characteristics. The problem is that participants who are asked to take the perspective of an Indigenous Australian might “know” that the purpose of the instruction is to increase their willingness to support the forms of reparation. If effective, such experimental demands should take the form of more generally positive reactions to Indigenous Australians for non-Indigenous Australians who were asked to take an Indigenous Australian perspective.</p>
<p>Previous research has suggested that the effects of perspective taking did not result from demand characteristics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167212450322">Batson et al. (1997</xref>, Study 1) found that the manipulation of perspective taking had no direct effect on the improvement of attitudes toward people who had contracted AIDS; rather, self-reported empathy was found to mediate this relationship. Batson and colleagues concluded, therefore, that the effect of perspective taking was not due to experimental demand. Moreover, the results of their third study showed the opposite pattern to that expected for an experimental demand effect. Immediately following the manipulation of perspective-taking attitudes toward convicted murders did not improve, but these attitudes became more positive 2 weeks later. Experimental demands should be strongest in the immediate presence of the experimenter.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167212450322">Galinsky and Moskowitz (2000)</xref> also argued that the effects of perspective taking are not due to demand characteristics. One of their arguments is based on the research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167212450322">Davis, Conklin, Smith, and Luce (1996)</xref> who found that participants, who took the perspective of a target, attributed more self-related positive traits to this target than self-related negative traits. Galinsky and Moskowitz argued that the aim of perspective taking is to increase self–other overlap. If participants had understood this and complied with an experimental demand, then they should have also attributed self-related negative traits to the target to increase the self–other overlap.</p>
<p>The previous research seems clear on this point, but we conducted a pilot study to further differentiate perspective taking and demand characteristics in this context. The design of the pilot study consisted of two between-subjects factors, perspective taking (Indigenous Australian or own) and form of reparation (monetary compensation or socioeconomic program). Participants were 89 non-Indigenous students at an Australian university, and they were presented with the following information:
<disp-quote>
<p>On the 13th February 2008, Kevin Rudd moved a motion to apologise on behalf of the governments responsible for the policies that resulted in the Stolen Generations. He delivered an emotionally charged speech. He used the word “Sorry” three times.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the socioeconomic program condition, participants also read the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>Kevin Rudd addressed the issues which face Indigenous communities in the present and vowed to make amends for these differences between Indigenous communities and broader Australian communities by implementing programs, which will address housing, education, health and employment opportunities, and prevention of alcohol abuse and sexual abuse in Indigenous Communities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0146167212450322">1</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the monetary compensation condition, participants also read the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>Kevin Rudd had spoken earlier about the government having no plans to provide monetary compensation to victims of the Stolen Generation. However, monetary compensation is the wish of many Indigenous Australians and is believed to be their legal right.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants then rated their anger about Indigenous Australians’ entitlement to, and their support for, the type of reparation according to the condition they were assigned to. A two-way between-subjects ANOVA revealed significant main effects of form of reparation on entitlement, <italic>F</italic>(1, 83) = 5.33, <italic>p</italic> = .021, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .06, and support, <italic>F</italic>(1, 83) = 9.10, <italic>p</italic> = .003, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .10. Entitlement to and support for the socioeconomic program were stronger than for monetary compensation. The main effects of perspective taking were not significant (<italic>p</italic>s &gt; .275) nor were the interactions between perspective taking and form of reparation (<italic>p</italic>s &gt; .643). The overall positive attitude toward the socioeconomic program is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0146167212450322">Pholi et al.’s (2009)</xref> notion that the wider community supports the program. Importantly, the absence of any effect of perspective taking indicates that taking the perspective of an Indigenous Australian did not successfully induce experimental demands to respond to Indigenous Australians more positively. In the main studies, we combined the information about the two types of information presented above (rather than providing them separately in two conditions) because we hoped that this would facilitate comparisons between the forms of reparation with regard to perceived entitlement and anger.</p>
<sec id="section4-0146167212450322">
<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-0146167212450322">
<title>Participants and design</title>
<p>Participants were non-Indigenous students (<italic>n</italic> = 47) at an Australian university. Participation was voluntary, and informed consent was obtained. In this sample, 79% were female and 21% were male. Their ages ranged from 19 to 67 (<italic>M</italic> = 26.57, <italic>SD</italic> = 10.51). All participants were Australian citizens and had lived most of their lives in Australia. They were randomly assigned to one of two levels of perspective taking: Indigenous Australian or own perspective. There was also a repeated measure with two levels: compensation and socioeconomic support, yielding a 2 × 2 design.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0146167212450322">
<title>Stimulus materials and procedure</title>
<p>At the beginning of the experimental session, perspective taking was manipulated. As in the pilot study, participants were asked to answer the questions either from their own point of view or by taking the perspective of an Indigenous Australian. In the latter condition, they received the following instructions (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167212450322">Galinsky &amp; Moskowitz, 2000</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p>You can take the perspective of an Indigenous Australian by imagining that you belong to an Indigenous Australian community. Thus, you are reading the text through their eyes, looking at the world through their eyes and walking through the world in their shoes.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the own perspective-taking condition, it was stated, “You are asked to read the text from your own point of view and to form your own opinion.” Next, all participants were presented with the same information about the apology and both forms of reparation as used in the pilot study, but we deleted the sentence “However, monetary compensation is the wish of many Indigenous Australians and is believed to be their legal right.” Instead of that broad sentence, we provided opinions of Indigenous people who expressed positive views about the apology, but some reinforced the desire for compensation. All participants read the following information:
<disp-quote>
<p>Mr Ellis, a member of the Stolen Generation, said “I admire Kevin Rudd for doing what he’s doing. It shows now, someone cares” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0146167212450322">Smiles &amp; Austin, 2008</xref>). Marcia Langton, a leading Indigenous scholar, was pleased with the sentiment of the apology: “its impossible to feel any cynicism [about an apology] if you can understand how much it means to people who have lived through these events.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167212450322">Schubert, Smiles, Cooke, &amp; Sharp, 2008</xref>)</p>
<p>But some Indigenous leaders expressed more negative opinions. For example, Pat Dodson claims that monetary compensation will be the next step and said that “Any group of people who have been treated badly under laws made legitimately by the Crown deserve to pursue compensation judicially, legally or politically, and they deserve our support.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167212450322">Schubert &amp; Zwartz, 2008</xref>)</p>
<p>Equally, Les Malezer—the Spokesman for the National Aboriginal Alliance—has supported the apology but believes compensation is necessary for it to be considered sincere. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0146167212450322">Smiles &amp; Austin, 2008</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0146167212450322">2</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>After reading this, participants were asked to complete a questionnaire. The dependent variables were measured on 9-point scales ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 9 (<italic>very much</italic>). The items were as follows: To what extent (a) “do you feel anger in reaction to the government’s programs,” (b) “do you feel anger in reaction to Indigenous Australians’ wish for monetary compensation,” (c) “are Indigenous Australians entitled to the government’s programs,” and (d) “are the Stolen Generations entitled to monetary compensation.”</p>

Participants who took an Indigenous Australian perspective reported less anger, <italic>F</italic>(1, 45) = 14.52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .24, toward monetary compensation (<italic>M</italic> = 3.04), than participants who responded from their own perspective (<italic>M</italic> = 5.29). Reported anger toward socioeconomic support did not significantly differ between the perspective conditions, <italic>F</italic>(1, 45) = 0.65, <italic>p</italic> = .422. There were no other significant effects for this variable. Thus Hypothesis 1 was supported: Taking an Indigenous Australian perspective reduced anger about monetary compensation for the Stolen Generations.</p>

<p>In line with Hypothesis 2, the significant main effects of perspective taking, <italic>F</italic>(1, 45) = 9.28, <italic>p</italic> = .004, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .17, and the within-subjects factor, <italic>F</italic>(1, 45) = 77.83, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .63, on entitlement were qualified by their significant interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 45) = 16.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .27 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0146167212450322">Figure 2</xref>). Participants’ opinions about the Stolen Generations’ entitlement to monetary compensation were significantly stronger, <italic>F</italic>(1, 45) = 15.29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .25, when taking an Indigenous Australian perspective (<italic>M</italic> = 6.57) than when taking their own perspective (<italic>M</italic> = 4.29). The findings demonstrate that taking an Indigenous Australian perspective can increase support for a positive change in entitlement to compensation for victims who have experienced harm. There was no effect of perspective taking on entitlement to socioeconomic support, <italic>F</italic>(1, 45) = 0.52, <italic>p</italic> = .475, and there were no other significant results. It is worth noting here though that the mean level of perceived entitlement was close to the scale maximum in both perspective conditions; hence, the base level of support in the own perspective condition may have been even higher.</p>

<title>Mediation analysis</title>
<p>Hypothesis 3 that entitlement to compensation would mediate the relationship between perspective taking and anger about monetary compensation was tested by regression. The first regression analysis showed that perspective taking was a significant predictor of anger about compensation, β = −.49, indicating that taking an Indigenous Australian perspective leads to less anger about compensation. The second regression analysis demonstrated that perspective taking was a significant predictor of entitlement to compensation, β = .50, showing that taking an Indigenous Australian perspective was related to more entitlement to compensation. The third regression analysis with both entitlement and perspective taking showed that entitlement (β = −.51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) predicted negatively anger about compensation, whereas perspective taking was no longer a significant predictor of anger (β = −.23, <italic>p</italic> = .078). We then conducted bootstrapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167212450322">Hayes, 2008</xref>) to establish whether the indirect effect of the perspective-taking manipulation on anger about compensation was due to increased entitlement to compensation. The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the indirect effect lay between 0.50 and 2.25, and did not include zero, <italic>p</italic> = .005.</p>
<p>Theoretically, this is an important finding because it shows a novel psychological variable that can underlie the effect of perspective taking; focusing on entitlement enhances support for compensation for victims of harm. This finding is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167212450322">Furby’s (1986)</xref> argument that entitlement is fundamental to the way that people are perceived as people. The finding has practical implications in that it suggests that a focus on entitlement (whether generated by perspective taking or other means) may serve to promote positive responses toward disadvantaged groups in general.</p>
<p>Study 1 supported the hypothesized links between perspective taking, entitlement, and anger about monetary compensation. In Study 2, we extended the focus to investigate other potential emotions that may influence both perceptions of entitlement to monetary compensation and supportive actions to repair the harm done to Indigenous Australians.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0146167212450322">
<title>Study 2</title>
<p>The study was similar to Study 1 in that non-Indigenous participants were asked to take either the perspective of an Indigenous Australian or their own perspective. The purpose of this study was twofold. First, we wanted to replicate the design of Study 1. As in Study 1, we expected that when non-Indigenous Australians took an Indigenous Australian perspective, they would be less angry about compensation (Hypothesis 1) and they would perceive Indigenous Australians to be more entitled to compensation (Hypothesis 2). Also, entitlement to compensation would mediate the relationship between perspective taking and anger about monetary compensation (Hypothesis 3). The second purpose of Study 2 was to examine (group-based) emotions that may be responsible for perceived entitlement to monetary compensation and supportive action tendencies to repair the harm done to Indigenous Australians.</p>
<p>Study 1 showed that following perspective taking, increased perceived entitlement to compensation was linked to reduced anger about compensation. This is consistent with previous research on deservingness showing that this variable predicts emotions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167212450322">Feather, 2002</xref>). However, we ask here whether the reverse causal direction can hold. Is it possible, for example, that anger about harm done to victims may enhance perceptions of entitlement to compensation? That is, experiencing strong emotions about historical harm could fuel judgments that victims of harm are entitled to compensation. In other words, we believe that entitlement and emotions influence each other mutually. This idea raises two interesting questions. First, which emotions could be presumed to enhance perceived entitlement? Second, are these proposed emotions also responsible for supportive action tendencies to repair the harm done to Indigenous Australians?</p>
<sec id="section11-0146167212450322">
<title>Group-Based Emotions</title>
<p>The intergroup emotions theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0146167212450322">E. R. Smith, 1993</xref>) states that to experience emotions on behalf of the in-group, one’s social identity has to be salient. Perspective taking draws attention to one’s social identity. If people successfully take the perspective of an out-group, they will include the self in the out-group. As a consequence, what was an out-group would become a psychological in-group, and emotions will be experienced on behalf of this group.</p>
<p>It is important to note though that group-based emotions can serve multiple psychological functions. For example, group-based guilt can be considered to be a self-focused emotion that generates a willingness to compensate the disadvantaged group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167212450322">Leach, Iyer, &amp; Pedersen, 2007</xref>) without striving explicitly for social change to achieve social equality (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167212450322">Thomas, McGarty, &amp; Mavor, 2009</xref>). Actual social equality is more likely to be pursued where there is genuine solidarity or common cause between the advantaged and disadvantaged groups (rather than paternalism; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167212450322">Nadler, 2002</xref>). Such solidarity can be perceived to be impossible, for example, when the disadvantaged group feels inferior due to their treatment by the advantaged group. In the words of a very prominent Indigenous Australian leader, Indigenous Australians have felt inferior “since the early days of Australia’s colonization and continuing in recent commentary around the Northern Territory intervention” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167212450322">Dodson, 2008</xref>). Long-term perceptions of inferiority can lead to political cynicism or apathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167212450322">Shelby, 2011</xref>). We therefore believe that in situations in which political solidarity is not (yet) established, as is the case between Indigenous and (many) non-Indigenous Australians, focusing on methods that promote harmony between groups can be useful. That is, advantaged group members’ attempts to achieve harmony can be perceived by the disadvantaged group as a signal that they are willing to improve the disadvantaged situation and to restore justice.</p>
<p>As indicated above, we anticipated that group-based anger directed at the in-group might affect entitlement to monetary compensation and personal support for reparation. We argue that taking the perspective of an out-group member who (has) suffered from wrongdoings perpetrated by the in-group may lead to anger at the in-group because out-group perspective taking should lead to a focus on the harmful actions of the in-group. A corresponding effect was not anticipated when taking the perspective of the in-group because, as mentioned previously, many non-Indigenous Australians are opposed to compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167212450322">Newspoll, 2008</xref>) and many show prejudicial attitudes and beliefs against Indigenous Australians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167212450322">Dudgeon et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, we do not expect that taking an in-group perspective would lead to anger at the in-group in this study. Moreover, other research has shown that anger at the in-group is possible even without being instructed to take an out-group perspective. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167212450322">Kessler and Hollbach (2005)</xref> showed that East German participants became angry with their in-group when they were asked to recall similar situations from the past. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167212450322">Iyer, Schmader, and Lickel (2007)</xref> found that threats to the image of the in-group due to their wrongdoing to an out-group increased anger at the in-group. Furthermore, research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167212450322">Leach et al. (2006)</xref> demonstrated that awareness of in-group privilege in relation to out-groups resulted in in-group anger. It is therefore anticipated that when taking an Indigenous Australian perspective, group-based anger about the harm done to Indigenous Australians would influence entitlement to monetary compensation and supportive actions. More specifically, we expected that when taking an Indigenous Australian perspective, high levels of group-based anger would predict positively entitlement to monetary compensation (Hypothesis 4a) and personal support for reparation (Hypothesis 4b).</p>
<p>Another emotion that may influence entitlement to monetary compensation and personal support for reparation is group-based guilt. There is empirical evidence that perspective taking can influence group-based guilt and supportive action tendencies. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167212450322">Mallett, Huntsinger, Sinclair, and Swim (2008)</xref> found that the effect of perspective taking on collective actions that supported a disadvantaged group was partly mediated by group-based guilt. Also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0146167212450322">Zebel, Doosje, and Spears (2009)</xref> found that when Dutch participants took an out-group perspective, those participants who weakly identified with the in-group reported more group-based guilt about historical harm done by the in-group and more support for reparation than high identifiers.</p>
<p>Our arguments about group-based guilt follow those for group-based anger. We anticipated that, when taking an Indigenous Australian perspective, high levels of guilt would predict positively entitlement to monetary compensation (Hypothesis 5a) and personal support for reparation (Hypothesis 5b).</p>

<sec id="section12-0146167212450322">
<title>Self-Image Shame</title>
<p>Shame and guilt on both the individual and group level differ in their phenomenology in that shame concerns the entire self (“bad self”) whereas guilt involves one’s behavior (“bad thing done”; this follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167212450322">Lewis, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167212450322">Tangney &amp; Dearing, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167212450322">Tangney and Dearing (2002)</xref> explained how shame and guilt differ in their motivational responses such that shame motivates a person to hide or disappear from the situation, whereas guilt motivates to repair the harm done. However, recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167212450322">Gausel and Leach (2011)</xref> distinguished between two types of self-image shame that involves one’s identity (as opposed to social-image shame). When one’s entire (global) self-image is harmed, this self-defect cannot be changed, and this leads to hiding or avoidance. However, when the self-defect is specific, it has the potential to be repaired by exhibiting prosocial behavior that improves one’s self-evaluation and the relationship with the people who are affected by one’s self-defect. Related to this distinction between global and specific self-image shame, we distinguished between group-based shame about bad things the in-group has done and personal shame about <italic>belonging</italic> in this group. The former reflects global self-image shame that cannot be changed, whereas the latter focuses on self-image shame that can be repaired. One way to improve one’s self-evaluation is to distance oneself from the in-group. However, this would not improve the disadvantaged situation of Indigenous Australians. We therefore anticipated that when taking an Indigenous Australian perspective, high levels of shame about being a non-Indigenous Australian would positively predict entitlement to monetary compensation (Hypothesis 6a) and personal support for reparation (Hypothesis 6b).</p>

<title>Participants and design</title>
<p>The participants were non-Indigenous students (<italic>n</italic> = 41) at an Australian university. Participation was voluntary, and informed consent was obtained. In this sample, 88% were female and 12% were male. Their ages ranged from 20 to 49 (<italic>M</italic> = 24.00, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.87). All participants were Australian citizens and had lived most of their lives in Australia. They were randomly assigned to one of two levels of perspective taking: Indigenous Australian perspective or their own perspective. There was also a repeated measure with two levels: compensation and socioeconomic support yielding a 2 × 2 design.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0146167212450322">
<title>Stimulus materials and procedure</title>
<p>The stimulus materials and procedure were identical to Study 1 with respect to the questions about entitlement and anger for each form of reparation. However, unlike Study 1, participants indicated their (group-based) guilt and their anger “about the negative things Australians did to Indigenous Australians,” and also their (self-image) “shame to be an Australian,” and personal support for reparation (“to what extent do you personally want to support efforts to make up for repairing the damage done to Indigenous Australians”). All dependent variables were measured on 9-point scales ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 9 (<italic>very much</italic>).</p>

<title>Main analyses</title>
<p>Similar to Study 1, ANOVAs were performed on participants’ ratings of anger and entitlement with perspective taking as a between-subjects factor and the two forms of reparation as a within-subjects factor. The (marginal) main effects of perspective taking, <italic>F</italic>(1, 39) = 2.97, <italic>p</italic> = .093, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .07, and the within-subjects factor form of reparation, <italic>F</italic>(1, 39) = 10.13, <italic>p</italic> = .003, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .21, on anger were qualified by the interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 39) = 8.56, <italic>p</italic> = .006, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .18 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0146167212450322">Figure 3</xref>).

Reported anger toward socioeconomic support did not significantly differ between the perspective conditions, <italic>F</italic>(1, 39) = 0.68, <italic>p</italic> = .414. There were no other significant effects. These results are similar to the findings in relation to Hypothesis 1 in Study 1.</p>

<title>Mediation analysis</title>
<p>As in Study 1, the analyses suggested that entitlement to compensation mediated the relationship between perspective taking and anger about monetary compensation. Perspective taking was a significant predictor of anger about compensation, β = −.40, <italic>p</italic> = .010, such that taking an Indigenous Australian perspective was related to less anger about compensation. Perspective taking was also a significant predictor of entitlement to compensation, β = .46, <italic>p</italic> = .002, showing that taking an Indigenous Australian perspective was associated with more entitlement. The regression analysis with both entitlement and perspective taking demonstrated that entitlement (β = −.69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) predicted negatively anger about compensation, but perspective taking was no longer a significant predictor of anger (β = −.08, <italic>ns</italic>). Bootstrapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167212450322">Hayes, 2008</xref>) confirmed that the indirect effect of perspective taking on anger about compensation was due to increased entitlement to compensation. The 95% CI = [0.70, 2.76] for the size of the indirect effect did not include zero, and the effect size differed significantly from zero at <italic>p</italic> = .004. We did not conduct a corresponding mediation analysis for socioeconomic support because none of the three relevant correlations were significant.</p>

<p>We looked first at entitlement to monetary compensation. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0146167212450322">Table 2</xref> shows significant interactions between perspective taking and both group-based anger at the in-group and guilt, and shame to be an Australian.</p>

The relationship was not significant for weak group-based anger at the in-group, low group-based guilt, and low shame. These results supported Hypotheses 4a to 6a, respectively, and demonstrate that emotions can influence appraisals of entitlement. This is a novel finding in addition to research that has shown that the appraisal of entitlement gives rise to emotions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167212450322">Feather &amp; McKee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167212450322">Mikula, 1986</xref>) that is also consistent with the results of our third Hypothesis involving the mediating effect of entitlement.</p>

<p>For Hypotheses 4b to 6b, personal support for reparation was the criterion. The interaction between perspective taking and anger at the in-group was not significant, but the interaction was significant for group-based guilt (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0146167212450322">Table 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0146167212450322">Figure 8</xref> reveals that perspective taking marginally significantly predicted the effect of high guilt on support for reparation such that taking an Indigenous Australian perspective tended to be associated with more support, whereas this relationship was not significant for low group-based guilt. The interaction between perspective taking and self-image shame on personal support for reparation was significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0146167212450322">Table 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0146167212450322">Figure 9</xref> shows that perspective taking significantly predicted the effect of high shame on support; taking an Indigenous Australian perspective was associated with more support.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0146167212450322">3</xref></sup> Furthermore, this relationship was marginally significant when self-image shame was low; taking a non-Indigenous Australian perspective tended to be associated with more personal support. This finding is difficult to explain, but we can be sure that it was not due to entitlement to compensation because there was no significant relationship between low shame and entitlement. Taken together, findings from Hypotheses 4b to 6b suggest that, when taking an out-group perspective, self-image shame (i.e., about being a member of the perpetrating group), more so than group-based guilt, bolsters commitment to positive actions.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>The main purpose of this research was to investigate whether taking the perspective of an Indigenous Australian would influence responses involving support for monetary compensation. Relative to taking one’s own perspective, it was that entitlement to monetary compensation increased and anger toward compensation decreased when the perspective of an Indigenous Australian was taken. Moreover, a novel contribution of the present research is that the effect of perspective taking on anger about compensation was mediated by entitlement to compensation. That is, taking the perspective of an Indigenous Australian contributes to accepting and supporting Indigenous Australians’ wish for financial compensation for the Stolen Generations. More generally, when members of the advantaged group take the perspective of the disadvantaged, they become proponents of reducing disadvantage because they see it as a fundamental right of the disadvantaged group. Thus, the present research contributes to the literature on perspective taking by showing that entitlement is a novel mechanism underlying the effects of perspective taking.</p>
<p>A possible limitation of the present research involves the distinction between the two forms of reparation. That is, the reparations differ on two dimensions: the content (socioeconomic support and monetary compensation) and the recipient of reparation (Indigenous Australians and Stolen Generations). It could be argued that the different reactions might result from the recipients of reparations rather than the type of reparation itself. Although we cannot definitely rule out this alternative explanation, it does not seem plausible. All participants indicated that Indigenous Australians are entitled to socioeconomic support. However, because the Stolen Generations <italic>are</italic> Indigenous Australians, it seems highly unlikely that the observed findings are due to stronger negative opinions about the Stolen Generations than other Indigenous Australians.</p>
<p>The overall support for the Closing the Gap program implies that the manipulation of perspective taking was unnecessary to obtain support for the program and that most participants were already in favor of the government program. This explanation fits with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0146167212450322">Pholi et al.’s (2009)</xref> notion that the objectives of the Closing the Gap program were welcomed in the wider community. If this explanation is valid, it demonstrates the boundary conditions of perspective taking. That is, the effects of perspective taking occur only when one feels challenged to consider the point of view of the other but not when one has already done this. The related question is whether these effects could have been obtained through perspective taking without the accompanying text about the apology and opinions expressed by Indigenous people. We think it would be unlikely to obtain the observed findings in that case because, as mentioned earlier, many non-Indigenous Australians are opposed to monetary compensation. Moreover, they would have very limited exposure through the mainstream media to the actual aspirations and objectives of Indigenous Australians in relation to these matters. Furthermore, Indigenous Australians comprise about 3% of the Australian population and are more likely to live in remote or regional areas. Most non-Indigenous Australians in urban contexts have no day-to-day interactions with Indigenous Australians. Even a statement that monetary compensation is a fundamental right for Indigenous Australians, as was provided in the pilot study, was not sufficient to produce differential support for monetary compensation. However, providing opinions that include different degrees of satisfaction with the apology appeared to be effective when an Indigenous Australian perspective was adopted, presumably because the mixed information was perceived to be objectively balanced and was sufficient to provide a grounding for perspective taking. This does raise the issue as to whether there is a minimum level of information about the viewpoints of another group before perspective taking can take hold, and this is an interesting avenue for further research.</p>
<p>The theoretical contribution of the second study is twofold. First, we observed that different emotions give rise to support for monetary compensation when an Indigenous Australian perspective is adopted. To the extent that group-based guilt, anger at the in-group, and self-image shame increased, so did perceived entitlement to monetary compensation. This is a novel finding and extends research on entitlement that has demonstrated that entitlement is a predictor of emotions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167212450322">Feather, 2002</xref>). Consistent with this view, we also found that entitlement to monetary compensation predicted negatively anger about compensation. However, the second study showed that emotions could also predict positively entitlement to monetary compensation. In other words, emotions and entitlement influence each other mutually. The practical importance of this finding is that combining perspective taking, entitlement, and emotions can facilitate supportive opinions toward disadvantaged groups in general. However, such supportive opinions do not always translate into supportive action tendencies as is discussed below.</p>
<p>The other theoretical contribution of the second study is that it provides support for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167212450322">Gausel and Leach’s (2011)</xref> model of shame. Consistent with their model, we found that, when an Indigenous perspective was adopted, high self-image shame predicted personal support for reparation. One may argue that self-image shame is a self-focused emotion because it is not directed at achieving change in the circumstances of the other party (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167212450322">Thomas et al., 2009</xref>). However, self-image shame was the only emotion that facilitated prosocial behavior that might serve as a platform for social change in the future. The finding that group-based guilt was weakly related, and anger was unrelated, to personal support for reparation may be indicative of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167212450322">Batson (2011)</xref> called “moral hypocrisy”; that is, appearing moral but simultaneously avoiding the costs (such as personal support for reparation) of being moral. According to Batson, moral emotions follow from violations of personal valued moral standard.Therefore self-image shame can be perceived as a genuine moral emotion in response to a personal felt violation of a moral principle. That is, denial of entitlement to compensation by the advantaged group can elicit self-image shame in members of this group, and to restore justice, they become proponents of personal support for reparation. In addition, when the disadvantaged become aware of the advantaged group’s willingness to restore justice, this may contribute to a sense of political solidarity that is a basis for social change toward social equality.</p>

<p>The reason for choosing these excerpts was that they were representative of the anger expressed in the Indigenous communities about the refusal to pay compensation.
