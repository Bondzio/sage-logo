<abstract>
<p>Although most studies reveal a relationship between the teacher’s pet phenomenon with classroom conflict, it does not necessarily cause classroom conflict. This study confirms the model fit for teacher authority, the existence of the teacher’s pet phenomenon and its relationship to classroom conflict and students’ self-adjustment, as well as testing the different viewpoints of three pet-student groups. Participants in the study comprised 407 5th through 8th grade students from 12 schools in Taiwan. The findings indicate that the estimated model fits the observed data; teacher authority directly affects the teacher’s pet phenomenon and indirectly affects classroom conflict and students’ self-adjustment. Non-pet students, popular-pet students, and unpopular pet students have different viewpoints of the variables. Three sub-models reveal different path effects; the inclusion of popular-pet students does not lead to classroom conflict. Implications for theory, practice, and research are discussed.</p>

<p>Classroom management has always been a serious issue both for novice and experienced teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143034311421270">Arends, 2004</xref>). The more frustration and conflict that teachers face while handling student affairs and problems, the more likely they are to experience overwhelming pressure and feel uncomfortable in classroom management, implementation of ‘rules’ and their teaching procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034311421270">Kyriacou, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034311421270">Ritter &amp; Hancock, 2007</xref>). Classroom management problems are the main source of work pressure faced by teachers, no matter how different the working environment or salary in different countries.</p>
<p>The main focus of recent studies in classroom management has been on how to manage classrooms well, and the relationship between classroom management and teaching effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143034311421270">Manning &amp; Bucher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034311421270">Marzno, Pickering, &amp; Pollock, 2004</xref>). However, teachers are likely to show their preferences toward students intentionally or unintentionally in the process of dealing with and punishing students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143034311421270">Brown &amp; Dobbins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143034311421270">Tirri &amp; Puolimatka, 2000</xref>). Teachers may show certain preferences towards some students just as they show affection towards their pets— ‘the teacher’s pet phenomenon’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034311421270">Babad, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311421270">Tal &amp; Babad, 1990</xref>). Tal and Babad estimated that the teacher’s pet phenomenon can be found in over 80% of classrooms, with the least helpful classroom climate existing in exclusive-pet classrooms (where there is only one pet student). Teachers often treat academically-strong and polite students better than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143034311421270">Babad, 1996</xref>); yet, students are sensitive to thisdifferential treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143034311421270">Tirri &amp; Puolimatka, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034311421270">Babad (1995)</xref> found that if students notice the teacher’s discriminating behaviors, it not only leads to jealousy and anger but also shows the highest negative correlation for students’ evaluation of their teacher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034311421270">Babad &amp; Dinah, 2003</xref>). While this phenomenon is commonly seen in most classrooms, the teacher’s pet phenomenon probably is a cause of classroom conflicts and impairs classroom morale. Currently there is insufficient evidentiary support from empirical studies of this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Teacher’s authority is a variable that has received much attention in classroom management research. Many students and parents recognize that teachers should be endowed with disciplinary authority; however, it is frequently controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143034311421270">Yariv, 2009</xref>). Upholding appropriate authority can facilitate a teacher’s leadership and maintain classroom order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143034311421270">Baker, Clark, Crowl, &amp; Carlson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034311421270">Martin &amp; Baldwin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143034311421270">Tirri &amp; Puolimatka, 2000</xref>). However, pressure from administrative work and teaching can increase the possibility of the misuse of a teacher’s authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034311421270">Kyriacou, 2001</xref>). Once teachers misuse their authority or show inconsistency in disciplinary attitude, students tend to notice that some students are especially favored by teachers, and this can lead other students to ignore or resist the teacher’s leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034311421270">Gregory &amp; Ripski, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143034311421270">Pace &amp; Hemmings, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311421270">Tal and Babad (1990)</xref> found that in an elementary school in Israel, teachers who showed preferences towards certain students exercised more authority than teachers without such preferences, and class morale was poorer. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143034311421270">Tirri and Puolimatka (2000)</xref> explain that the most common moral dilemmas that teachers and students identify are related to teacher behavior. Teachers view themselves as figures of authority and experts who can solve complex issues quickly; yet, teachers usually have an inadequate concept of teacher authority, and fail to exercise their authority consistently based on explicit rules. Teachers who exercise authority arbitrarily may downplay the expression of student opinion, exercise differential treatment of students, and cause student perception of unfair teacher discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143034311421270">Chambers, Henson, &amp; Sienty, 2001</xref>). This study hypothesizes that some expressions of teacher authority may not only be harmful to classroom climate but also may lead to the teacher’s pet phenomenon in classrooms.</p>
<p>Teachers who exercise unfair discipline and who show preferences for their petstudents can cause classroom conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143034311421270">Somersalo, Solantaus, &amp; Almquist, 2002</xref>). Others have also shown that classroom conflict can negatively affect student self-esteem, interests, motivation and adjustment to school, and increase the probability of bullying in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034311421270">Craig, Pepler, &amp; Atlas, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143034311421270">Russell and Russell (1996)</xref> have found that such a negative classroom climate can cause students to experience depression and cause student emotional and behavioral problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143034311421270">Somersalo et al., 2002</xref>). However, peer support and positive classroom morale can help students adapt to school life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143034311421270">Elias &amp; Haynes, 2008</xref>). The current study further hypothesizes that the teacher’s pet phenomenon may lead to classroom conflict, which itself can cause a negative effect on student self-adjustment in class.</p>
<p>Recent studies have not paid sufficient attention to the psychological adjustment and the perceptions of non-pet students in the classroom. By caring more for pet students, teachers neglect the feelings of non-pet students; this may be a potential causative factor for conflict between pet students and non-pet students. Moreover, do all teacher’s pet students inevitably cause classroom conflict? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034311421270">Babad (1995)</xref> indicated that if teacher’s pet students were popular in class, classroom climate would not be negatively impacted. Popular pet-students may, in fact, be helpful in eliminating non-pet student jealousy, hatred, or even negative views. Pet students may not be an absolute factor causing classroom conflict; it probably depends on whether or not the teacher’s pet students are themselves popular. Therefore, this study further divides students into three groups: Non-pet students, popular-pet students, and unpopular-pet students and hypothesizes that popular-pet students and unpopular-pet students hold similar perceptions toward teacher authority, the teacher’s pet phenomenon, and self-adjustment.</p>
<p>Studies incorporating the classification of teacher’s pet classrooms remain unclear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311421270">Tal and Babad (1990)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034311421270">Babad (1995)</xref> categorized teacher classrooms into three types according to how many pet students the teacher has: Non-pet classrooms, exclusive-pet classrooms (there is only one pet student), and non-exclusive-pet classrooms (more than one pet student). The results of their studies showed that the exclusive-pet classroom was the most detrimental to classroom morale. Since these studies were analysed in terms of classrooms as units, they tend to ignore the psychological feelings between pet students and non-pet students. Another problem is that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311421270">Tal and Babad (1990)</xref> applied the trichotomy (i.e. non-pet classroom, exclusive-pet classroom, and non-exclusive-pet classroom) to classify teacher’s pet classrooms; however, it is difficult to distinguish whether teacher’s pet students are themajority or the minority of a class in non-exclusive-pet classroom. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311421270">Tal and Babad (1990)</xref> found that a classroom with teacher’s pets in the majority might not necessarily result in a harmful classroom climate; however, if in the minority, it is likely to induce classroom conflict because it is easier for non-pet students to identify the unfairness. The current study continues the research completed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034311421270">Babad (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143034311421270">1996</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311421270">Tal and Babad (1990)</xref> but investigates classrooms based on the number of teacher’s pet students. Further, our study investigates the degree to which students perceive the teacher’s pet phenomenon in the classroom. This study can improve on the limitation of classifying by the number of teacher’s pet students, and measure the extent to which the teacher’s pet phenomenon actually exists in a pet classroom.</p>
<p>The dual purposes of this study are: (1) investigate the relationships between teacher’s authority and the teacher’s pet phenomenon, classroom conflict, and student’s self-adjustment using path analysis; and (2) examine the differences among non-pet students, popular-pet students, and unpopular-pet students’ perceptions on teacher’s authority, the teacher’s pet phenomenon, and classroom conflict by multi-group structural equation modeling.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0143034311421270" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>The sample for this study was selected through stratified sampling from the northern, middle, and southern parts of Taiwan. The sampling included 24 5th through 8th grade classrooms, and 407 elementary and junior high school students. Students reported on the number of teacher’s pet students in each class, nominated one or more of their classmates as pet students; and their classes were categorized according to the trichotomy (non-pet student classroom, exclusive teacher’s pet classroom and non-exclusive teacher’s pet classroom). Then, the non-pet student classrooms were subtracted leaving the exclusive- and the non-exclusive teacher’s pet classroom for further analysis. The valid sample included 407 students consisting of 135 5th graders (33.2%), 107 6th graders (26.3%), 88 7th graders (21.6%), and 77 8th graders (18.9%). There were 206 male students (50.6%) and 201 female students (49.4%) in the sample.</p>

<p>Participants completed these four instruments in Chinese in a classroom setting. The social relationships of teacher’s pet students were calculated and categorized into popular-pet students and unpopular-pet students according to the social quantitative techniques of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143034311421270">Coie and Dodge (1988)</xref> (students not belonging to popular/unpopular groups were considered as ‘other-pet’ groups). This study applied Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to determine a suitable model. Students were classified into popular-pet student group, unpopular-pet student group, and non-pet student group. One-way ANOVA was employed to examine the differences among these three groups, and multi-group structural equation modeling was employed to test the invariance of the three sub-group models. Maximum Likelihood was the method of estimation used for model estimation.</p>

<p>A path model was constructed to test the fit of the estimated model, and we examined the hypothesized direct and indirect paths (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143034311421270">Figure 1</xref>). For the standard of overall model fit, the estimated model shows the χ<sup>2</sup> value is 0.14 (&#128;<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05); the estimate model can approximately fit the theoretical model. The model fit of GFI and AGFI in the estimated model are 1.00 and 0.99, respectively, which is much higher than the standard of 0.90 and approximates 1.00. RMSEA is 0, suggesting that there is almost no difference between the theoretical model and estimated model. Overall, the estimated model of the research has no negative error variance, with all estimate parameters reaching 0.05 significant levels. In addition, the overall correlation between estimated parameters is not too high, strongly indicating that the model does not follow the standard of preliminary fit criteria. For the internal structure model fit, allthe estimated parameters reached 0.001 significant levels. The average squared multiple correlation of observed variables is almost 0.50, revealing the internal validity of this model. These data combine to show that this estimated model has acceptable model fit.

<p>The standardized path coefficients for the estimated model are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143034311421270">Table1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143034311421270">Figure 1</xref>. First, the results show that teacher’s authority had direct positive impact on the teacher’s pet phenomenon and classroom conflict (γ<sub>11</sub> = 0.53, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 and γ<sub>21</sub> = 0.64, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Second, the teacher’s pet phenomenon in the classroom also had direct impact on classroom conflict and student’s self-adjustment (β<sub>21</sub> = 0.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and β<sub>31</sub> = -0.53, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The more the teacher’s pet phenomenon existed in classrooms, the higher the classroom conflict and thepoorer the student self-adjustment. Classroom conflict also had a direct negative impact on student’s self-adjustment (β<sub>32</sub> = -0.42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, the teacher’s pet phenomenon and classroom conflict seemed to mediate a part of theimpact from teacher’s authority on student’s self-adjustment (γ<sub>11</sub> × β<sub>31</sub> = −0.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and γ<sub>21</sub> × β<sub>32</sub> = -0.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Either a perception of high teacher-authority or the existence of the teacher’s pet phenomenon in the classroom increased classroom conflict—which in turn was reflected in poorer student self-adjustment in the classroom.

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311421270">Tal and Babad (1990)</xref> indicated that the authoritative teacher tends to adopt routine regulation management, with a lack of student participation and discussion, and his/her classroom tends to have the teacher’s pet phenomenon and a negative classroom climate. The expectation theory explains that the teacher’s special attention paid toward students may lead to self-satisfaction and student’s outstanding performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143034311421270">Jussim &amp; Eccles, 1992</xref>). However, in the process of attaining such achievements, the more the teacher is rigid and authoritative, the more the non-pet students will be aware of it and become dissatisfied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143034311421270">Riley &amp; Ungerleider, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143034311421270">Tirri &amp; Puolimatka, 2000</xref>). Teacher’s authoritative behaviors often emphasized the teacher’s reward/coercive power and lead to inconsistent management behaviors. However, if the teacher cannot deal with student issues fairly it causes detrimental impact to student learning motivation, and to students’ self-adjustment in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143034311421270">Levin &amp; Nolan, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>This study examined the group differences in the variable means; one-way ANOVA compared the differences among the unpopular pet student group, popular-pet student group, and non-pet student group (see means in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0143034311421270">Table 2</xref>). The <italic>F</italic>-test shows statistical difference in teacher’s authority (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2,379)</sub> = 11.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), theteacher’s pet phenomenon (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2,379)</sub> = 132.404, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), classroom conflict (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2,379)</sub> = 10.842, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and self-adjustment (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2,379)</sub> = 16.781, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) among the three groups. Furthermore, the post-hoc Bonferroni test was applied to confirm the group difference in pairs. For the unpopular-pet student group and popular-pet student group, the post-hoc test shows no statistical difference in teacher’s authority, the teacher’s pet phenomenon, and self-adjustment. However, it does show statistical difference in classroom conflict, and reveals that the unpopular-pet student group experienced higher classroom conflict than the popular-pet student group (22.50 and 17.19). Although this shows that both groups of unpopular-pet students and popular-pet students belong to the total group of pet students, their popularity status mediates a difference in the degree of classroom conflict.

<p>For the non-pet student group and unpopular-pet student group, the post-hoc test shows statistical differences in teacher’s authority, the teacher’s pet phenomenon, classroom conflict, and self-adjustment. The non-pet student group reports a higher level of teacher authority and the teacher’s pet phenomenon, but a lower level of classroom conflict and self-adjustment. Inversely, the unpopular-pet student group reports a higher level of classroom conflict, and self-adjustment. For both the non-pet student group and popular-pet student group, the post-hoc test shows statistical differences in teacher authority, the teacher’s pet phenomenon, and self-adjustment, but not classroom conflict. The non-pet student group reports a higher level of teacher authority and the teacher’s pet phenomenon, a lower level of self-adjustment, but an equal level of classroom conflict with the popular-pet student group. This means that even traditional pet-students more easily cause classroom conflict with non-pet students or teachers, but if these pet-students are popular among their peers, it reduces the likelihood of conflict in the classroom.</p>
<p>Interestingly, pet students did not have a strong perception of the teacher’s pet phenomenon. Both unpopular-pet students and popular-pet students benefited by being in the teacher’s pet phenomenon classroom. By comparison to non-pet students, they did not perceive a teacher-authority imbalance, nor were they alert to the teacher’s pet phenomenon; they had better self-adjustment. These data indicate that non-pet students and pet students have different psychological feelings about the phenomenon. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143034311421270">Tal and Babad’s research into classroom conflict (1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311421270">1990</xref>) had previously found that non-pet students were very aware of the existence of pet students. Non-pet students not only kept their distance from pet students and viewed them differently, but also experienced a tense classroom atmosphere (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034311421270">Babad, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143034311421270">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034311421270">Babad &amp; Dinah, 2003</xref>). These viewpoints were partially supported by this study; this study further supports that if pet students are popular with other students they do not cause classroom conflict (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143034311421270">Li &amp; Zhang, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This study even found that the popular-pet student average of class conflict is marginally lower than non-pet students (17.19 and 18.02 respectively). This suggests that if pet students are not popular with other students, the teacher’s pet phenomenon is definitely a potential factor leading to classroom conflict. This is concordant with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143034311421270">Tal &amp; Babad, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311421270">1990</xref>). Moreover, if teacher’s pet students are popular with other students, classroom conflict can be reduced; this relationship was seldom explored by previous studies.</p>
<p>To compare the group differences in the path coefficient, multi-group structural equation modeling was implemented to estimate parameters and test hypotheses for the three groups simultaneously. The χ<sup>2</sup> test showed statistical difference in the three unconstrained models (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>(12)</sub> = 40.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). This presented pattern differences among the three sub-group models. On the invariance evaluation of structural parameters, results show the differences concerning structural weights (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>(20)</sub> = 177.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and structural covariance (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>(21)</sub> = 179.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). This shows different path parameters of the three sub-group models (see parameters in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0143034311421270">Table 3</xref>).

<p>All reported paths were found to be significant for non-pet student group, butonly partly significant for the popular-pet student group and unpopular-pet student group. Moreover, the strength of path parameters was different. In the non-pet student group model, the relationships among the four observed variables are the most similar to the estimated model constructed in this study. Obviously, theestimated model is better fitted to non-pet students. In the unpopular-pet student group model, the teacher’s pet phenomenon not only causes more intensive class conflict, but causes them greater self-maladjustment and pressure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0143034311421270">Figure 2</xref>). Itreveals that teachers should reduce the teacher’s pet phenomenon in the classroom with unpopular-pet students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143034311421270">Simon, 1998</xref>). Most interestingly, in the mode of path relationships of popular-pet students, the teacher’s pet phenomenon does not causeclassroom conflict nor cause them psychological self-maladjustment. If the pet students are popular with their peers, the negative effects of the teacher’s pet phenomenon on classroom conflict or psychological adjustment are not found. It is helpful for educators and counselors to further understand the substance of the teacher’s pet phenomenon and its effect on classroom conflict and student self-adjustment.

<sec id="sec10-0143034311421270"><title>Implications</title>
<p>This study aimed at describing classrooms with the teacher’s pet phenomenon andconstructing a path model comprising of teacher authority, the teacher’s pet phenomenon, classroom conflict, and student self-adjustment. Subjects were furtherclassified into the popular-pet student group, unpopular-pet student group, and non-pet student group. First, one-way ANOVA was employed to examine the differences of variables among these three groups. Then, simultaneous analysis of themultiple groups was employed to test the invariance of each two-group model. The results indicate that teacher authority can increase the teacher’s pet phenomenon and classroom conflict. We found that the teacher’s pet phenomenon indirectly increases classroom conflict and student maladjustment. <italic>F</italic>-tests (ANOVA) show that non-pet students are more sensitive to teacher authority and the teacher’s pet phenomenon, but are less sensitive to classroom conflict and self-adjustment. Popular-pet students and unpopular-pet students perceive higher psychological self-adjustment; however, unpopular-pet students tend to cause classroom conflict more than popular-pets.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the psychological adjustment for non-pet students whoare neglected by the teacher is not good. In the popular-pet student group model, theteacher’s pet phenomenon does not lead to class conflict nor negatively affect these students’ self-adjustment. The typically-identified negative effect of the teacher’s pet phenomenon on classroom climate or on students’ psychological adjustment was not found in the current study. Conversely, this study suggests that teacher and school authority promotes teacher self-adjustment, and adjusts the physical and mental discomforts stemming from teaching pressure. In the current situation of a lack of disciplinary penalty power, and the rise in student self-awareness, teachers should continue to enhance their skills in classroom and emotional management and help students recognize the true meaning of teacher discipline while eliminating inappropriate authoritarian behaviors. Moreover, teachers should frequently reflect and ponder on their unhelpful verbal and nonverbal behaviors. Asian teachers, particularly, should encourage students to express opinions and change the traditional (oriental) culture where the teacher is the main authority figure in the classroom. On the other hand, unpopular-pet students tend to cause the most class conflict, and non-pet students have the poorest psychological self-adjustment. Both features will affect the ability of these students in their learning adjustment in theclassroom. Therefore, the teacher should listen to these students’ opinions more frequently, modestly accept different opinions and voices of different groups in theclassrooms in order to reduce the degree of the teacher’s pet phenomenon, and reconcile the estrangement between these pet and non-pet students in a role of a friendly mediator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143034311421270">Ziv, 1979</xref>). From a professional-competence viewpoint, teachers should probe the causes of student psychological maladjustment and make fair and just judgments in classroom management, as well as in the process of giving praise and exerting penalties. This will not only cause students to learn underlying democratic concepts of fairness and justice, but it can also eliminate possible teacher-student conflicts resulting from teacher authority or disciplinary differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034311421270">Craiget al., 2000</xref>). Finally, teachers should pay attention to the reaction of non-pet students and their emotional feelings in class, and actively converse with students who seldom talk in class in order to reduce misunderstandings between teacher and students, and increase trust in one another.</p>
<p>In addition to verifying these issues, further research can explore the effects of the teacher’s pet phenomenon on student participation in classroom affairs, teacher-student relationships, and student performance at school. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143034311421270">Dreikurs, Pepper, and Grunwald (1998)</xref> point out that some teachers will pay more attention to troublesome students. It has not been verified whether this kind of teacher’s pet phenomenon will cause class conflict or not. Some teachers will adopt pet students with low social status or special disability. This kind of adoption of pet students may attract praise from other students and may not cause resentment of non-pet students, nor necessarily cause conflicts in the classroom. Further research should examine whetherthe teacher’s pet phenomenon can have positive effects on class morale and student self-adjustment when minority students are pet students. Further research should further validate the research values of the teacher’s pet phenomenon in practice.</p>
<p>The limitation of this study is that it only investigated students’ viewpoints through self-reports—instead of teachers’ viewpoints. That is, the results of this study only represent students’ viewpoints. Different perceptions may exist between teachers and students toward the teacher’s pet phenomenon. Also, this study was conducted in two phases of sampling of classrooms with the teacher’s pet phenomenon, so the results are not representative of the differences within classrooms without the teacher’s pet phenomenon. Finally, student participants were all from urban schools, limiting the application to students from other settings.</p>
