<abstract>
<p>Information policies, the guidelines and standards for the macro information management of a nation, play an important role in the course of informationization in China. Owing to the absence of an authoritative framework of Chinese information policies, this research generated a comprehensive, three-level classification of information policy domains, based on policy data collected from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Chinalawinfo.com">Chinalawinfo.com</ext-link>, owned by the Legal Information Centre of Peking University. We constructed the first level with general domains derived from the theory of information’s life cycle. The second- and third-level domains were then determined according to the results of our clustering analysis, and their keywords were enriched and standardized using the Chinese Classification and Subject Headings System. The significance of this research is not only that it has identified blind spots existing in information policy making and research, but also that the new Chinese information policy domain framework will help regulate informationization in China.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Information policies are the guidelines that governments set up for information activities and organizations. Many countries in the world have established domestic information policies, and this area of policy has therefore drawn considerable attention from researchers. Information policies deal with the production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of information products; they are very important to the development planning, organization and management of the information industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0165551511428920">1</xref>]. Information policies play an indispensable role in the overall national control of industrial growth, and in regulating the information industry.</p>
<p>Since the <italic>Guidelines for Scientific and Technical Intelligence Activities</italic>, which was the first important policy document approved by the State Council in 1958, China has enacted several information policies. During the past two decades, in particular, the pace of informationization in China has increased, thanks to the rapid popularization of the internet, and advances in the information service industry. Development strategies for Chinese informationization took shape in the 1990s. A special institution to lead informationization was founded in 1993. The ‘Ninth Five-Year’ plan started to put the informationization blueprint into effect, and released a series of instructional documents concerning the construction, exploitation and use of information resources. The National Informationization Leading Group passed the <italic>Advice on Reinforcing the Exploitation and Usage of Information Resources</italic> on 27 October 2004, and the <italic>National Informationization Developmental Strategies (2006–2020)</italic> on 3 November 2005. These documents represented very important progress in researching and establishing information policy in China, and resulted in a preliminary information policy framework that covered such domains as information resources, information services, the internet, e-commerce and e-government.</p>
<p>In spite of these remarkable achievements, Chinese information policies still have obvious deficiencies. First, they have not been enacted under scientific planning, and thus there is a lack of a clear framework. The creation of information policies usually lags behind the actual needs, rather than foresee them. Second, different government departments have established similar or related policies. Their contents often overlap, and have the same gaps or blind spots. Third, many inconsistencies exist among local policies, and between them and national policies. And fourth, China’s current national information policies answer mainly for China-specific informational and economic environments, and are unable to reflect comprehensively the general requirements of the worldwide market economy. The international compatibility of the policies needs to be enhanced.</p>
<p>In China as a whole, national and local information policies currently fail to constitute a reasonable system. Based on abundant Chinese information policy data, we defined and described various policy domains by referring to the Chinese Classification and Subject Headings System. Our clustering analysis has engendered a Chinese information policy domain framework, which previously was absent. This framework will serve as a reference for facilitating and standardizing informationization in China. It can provide foresight when creating information policies, and reveal the gaps and blind spots in the process of policy establishment and research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0165551511428920">
<title>2. Related works</title>
<p>The contents of information policies are very rich, since they deal with actors, activities, elements and many other aspects. Researchers have been attempting to construct information policy frameworks that can describe the connections and interaction between the different components, in order to provide guidance for the creation of information policies. Representative research studies fall into the following four major categories.</p>
<p>The first category focuses on the problems to be solved by information policies and their tangible constituents. Taking various research perspectives, Burger identified five frameworks for studying information policy issues: the objective framework; the political element framework; the simplified framework; the problem framework; and the policy actor framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165551511428920">2</xref>]. He later, based on these frameworks, distinguished nine classes of information policy elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0165551511428920">3</xref>]. The major contribution of Burger’s frameworks is that they offer a useful tool for designing and researching information policies. However, he did not explicitly define the scope or structure of information policies. In an exploratory study that divided Chinese information policies into two domains – economy and law – Chen et al. built a framework by taking into account the actors, objectives, issues, contents, and forms of the policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165551511428920">4</xref>]. Each of these domains includes a number of elements, changeable with the information environments.</p>
<p>Hill enumerated 23 elements of an information policy system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0165551511428920">5</xref>]. Although finely divided, these elements overlap with each other to a certain extent, lacking association and organization. A classification of information policy elements into seven aspects was provided by Hernon and Relyea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165551511428920">6</xref>], but with a focus on government information.</p>
<p>In the classification of information policy problems by Calvin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0165551511428920">7</xref>], he indicated that there were three basic information-related values: the rights of accessing information and of possessing it, and privacy. These were the foundations for classifying the problems arising in the process of information policy establishment: (1) the problems in fulfilling, enacting or defining a specific right; (2) the conflicts between a specific right and its contradicting social interests; and (3) the contradictions that exist among the three basic values. Also revealed by Calvin was the essence of information policies – the products of balancing and compromising the conflicting interests. His classification of the problems challenging information policies, generated at the macro level, is valuable for subsequent research.</p>
<p>The next category of information policy research was intended to establish a hierarchical framework for the policies. Considering that none of the above frameworks could reflect the relationships between information policies, some researchers created ranking-based hierarchical frameworks. There were different methods of ranking, such as ranking according to importance, to the range of applicable objects, or to the status of actors, but they all aimed to suggest the relationship of subordinate policies to the superior ones, and their significance. Not believing in a cover-all information policy framework, Rowlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0165551511428920">8</xref>] emphasized the framework’s flexibility, its dynamics, and its ability to be responsive to changing environment. He thus proposed a hierarchical information policy framework in the broader context of public policies, which includes: fundamental policies, applicable to the whole of society, and impacting on the information-related departments directly or indirectly; horizontal policies, applicable to all the information-related departments, with a direct impact on these departments; and vertical policies, applicable to a specific, information-related department, and addressing specific practical domains. This framework is based on the applicability range of information policies, and within it policies at a lower level are dependent upon those at a higher level. Despite excellent dynamics, Rowlands’s framework was not very well constructed, because overlaps of policy content could be found at each level, which is therefore not propitious for understanding information policies and their structure.</p>
<p>The hierarchical framework of Kristiansson and Rajberg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165551511428920">9</xref>] was composed of two aspects, the actors and factors of information policies. The actors were ranked according to their range, and the factors according to their importance, with high-level factors such as society, economics, culture and technology affecting low-level ones, such as organization, administration and education. Similar to Rowlands’s framework, this one was aimed at disclosing the hierarchical relationships between different information policy elements from certain angles, rather than engendering a cover-all framework.</p>
<p>The third research category is characteristic of the integrated matrix framework. A structured method for analysing information policy frameworks was proposed by Karni [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165551511428920">10</xref>], called Karni’s information policy matrix. According to Karni, the analysis of an information policy framework should be conducted as follows: (1) determine the objectives of information policies and evaluation criteria; (2) create an information policy matrix; (3) specify the possible actions and schemes; and (4) select the best scheme. Karni’s matrix model offers a clear picture of information policy framework analysis.</p>
<p>At the International Seminar on Chinese Information Policies and Strategies towards the 21th Century in 1993, Moore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0165551511428920">11</xref>] presented a two-dimensional matrix model on the basis of Karni’s method. It consisted of three levels – industrial, organizational and social – and five elements – information technologies, information industry, information management, human resources, and laws and regulations. Widely recognized as the fundamental framework for designing and evaluating information policies, Moore’s matrix aimed to cover various domains of current information policies, bearing great theoretical instructional significance. It helped Zha [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0165551511428920">12</xref>] develop an information law framework that reflected the needs of informationization. The three levels of this framework have different foci. The industrial level considers the development of information-related departments in the context of the national economic system; the organizational level considers the influences of information as a resource on organizations in increasing their productivity, efficiency and competitiveness; and the social level considers the reasonable requirements of individuals and organizations for access to information about politics, economics, cultures, especially public information, as well as society’s responsibilities for providing such information. The column of Zha’s matrix contains no fixed elements. It instead determines the essential domains that should be regulated by information laws according to the need to address a variety of economic relationships and living relationships in the course of informationization.</p>
<p>There are also matrix-style frameworks built from the perspective of information’s life cycle. Huang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0165551511428920">13</xref>] divided activities concerning the production, processing, diffusion and use of information in contemporary society into three levels: the social information infrastructure, information resources, and information diffusion and services. Each of these levels includes a number of specific second- or third-level elements, resulting in a Chinese information policy framework. As defined by Luo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0165551511428920">14</xref>], information policies are ‘the laws, regulations, and schemes related to the creation, storage, processing, diffusion, and usage of information’. He further constructed a two-level information policy framework by classifying laws regulations, and schemes into the different phases of information’s life cycle.</p>
<p>From the angle of information policy problems, Rowlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0165551511428920">8</xref>] provided a theoretical framework similar to Calvin’s. It contains two pairs of opposite attributes of information: public product and trade product; and free access and constricted circulation. These were placed separately in the four quadrants divided by the two axes, with each quadrant embodying the attribute’s corresponding policy elements.</p>
<p>The intersecting structure of information policies was the interest of the fourth category of research. It differed from the above matrix-style frameworks by aiming to reflect how various aspects of information policies intersect and interact with one other. The core of an information policy framework, as Mansell and Wehn stated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0165551511428920">15</xref>], should be the information and communication technology (ICT) strategy, which overlaps with policies in four particular domains – technology, industry, telecommunications, and media. According to this framework, the constitution and enactment of ICT policies should be integrated so that all the related government departments, interest groups affected by ICT policies, and interest groups affecting ICT policies could establish strong collaborative relationships.</p>
<p>By and large, the aforementioned research studies addressed the structure of information policies mainly at the macro level, rather than provide a relevant framework, and this reduces their practicability and operability. This study, instead, created a hierarchical framework by statistically analysing existing information policy data. Specifically, we chose <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Chinalawinfo.com">Chinalawinfo.com</ext-link> as the data source, and used selected primary and secondary keywords to retrieve information policies and laws from its database, deleting repeating records and irrelevant records. Information’s life cycle played a major role in determining the first-level information policy domains, which were then divided into second-level domains in terms of relevance. Finally, we improved the second- and third-level domains in accordance with the semantic network structure of the <italic>Chinese Classification and Thesaurus System</italic>, as well as co-word clustering. The resulting information policy framework was completed with the descriptions about the contents of each domain. Subsequent sections of this paper are arranged according to these main phases.</p>

<title>3. Data preparation</title>
<p>The comprehensiveness and reliability of data are vital to creating a reasonable framework, so in the data preparation phase of this study we attached great importance to the choice of data source choosing, to data acquisition, and to data cleaning.</p>
<sec id="section4-0165551511428920">
<title>3.1. Choosing the data source</title>
<p>There are several websites on the internet that provide services related to Chinese laws and regulations, such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Chinalawinfo.com">Chinalawinfo.com</ext-link>, produced by the Legal Information Centre of Peking University (http://www.Chinalawinfo.com/), China Laws (http://www.lawbase.com.cn/), and the Chinese National Laws and Regulations Database. These were candidate data sources for our research, but they all have both advantages and disadvantages. Since acquiring data from a single source helps increase the efficiency of data collection, we finally chose Chinalawinfo.com, for the reasons below.</p>
<p>First, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Chinalawinfo.com">Chinalawinfo.com</ext-link> contains more than 700,000 records, with the earliest ones traced back to 1949, when the country was founded. These records include most national laws, administrative regulations, departmental regulations and judicial interpretation, as well as certain important local laws and regulations, government rules, supreme court cases, juridical documents, awards, international treaties, contract samples, writs, legal tutorials, legal papers, and definitions of legal articles. Because in China information policies are promulgated mainly in the forms of national laws, administrative regulations, departmental regulations, and local laws and regulations, Chinalawinfo.com should have gathered most Chinese information policies. It was sufficient for this research, since we used the database mainly to obtain national information policies. Second, this website has been importing records via authoritative channels, such as the legal documents offered by the National People’s Congress, the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council, and the Supreme People’s Court, or records recognized by the Legislation Law of the People’s Republic of China. And third, the records in Chinalawinfo.com follow a standard format that, as well as including the text, also indicates the institution and date of promulgation, level of force, category, and other attributes. We can take advantage of this to create the relational database more efficiently. Chinalawinfo.com also has mature search facilities, which enables us to retrieve needed information quickly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0165551511428920">
<title>3.2. Acquiring the data</title>
<p>Information is essential in all aspects of our social and economic life. Chinese information policies address different problems in different areas. Such variety is a challenge to our data acquisition, since it makes it difficult to select appropriate search keywords. We therefore made a table of primary and secondary keywords (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0165551511428920">Table 1</xref>) according to the keyword table of the Chinese National Laws and Regulations Database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165551511428920">16</xref>], and then used these keywords to search for information policies in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Chinalawinfo.com">Chinalawinfo.com</ext-link>. Java programs were employed to search the website, access data from the web pages, and import the data into our database, automatically. The number of search results totalled to 32,653.</p>

<title>3.3. Cleaning the data</title>
<p>The data, once acquired, was not yet ready for analysis, because it contained duplicate records and irrelevant records. The problem of duplication can be attributed to the fact that many laws and regulations target two or more information domains, and thus some of them overlap. For example, the Regulations on the Administration of Business Locations of Internet Access Services, promulgated by the State Economic and Trade Commission on 29 September 2002, were retrieved more than once, as they relate to the information industry, information networks, and other domains. For information policies that appeared more than once in the database, we kept only the first records. Specifically, each policy was identified by its URL within <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Chinalawinfo.com">Chinalawinfo.com</ext-link>, and the duplicate URLs were deleted using SQL queries.</p>
<p>We also examined the relevance of the search results, and found irrelevant records that should not be regarded as information policies. Because of the large number of records in the database, it was not efficient to eliminate them manually; automatic filtering was needed. In determining whether a record was or was not related to an information policy, we used the frequencies and positions (in the title or in the text) of the 10 primary keywords in the record as criteria. The formula for calculating the relevance <italic>M</italic> of a record is</p>

</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>where <italic>i</italic> denotes the weight of a keyword when it appears in the record title, <italic>j</italic> is the weight of a keyword when it appears in the record text, and <italic>n</italic> is the frequency of the keywords that have ever appeared. The hypothesis here is that keywords appearing in the title reflect a record’s central content more accurately than those in the text, and therefore should be given more weight. After experiments and comparisons we set the values of <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> as 4 and 1. If the <italic>M</italic> value of a record is less than 5, then the record is irrelevant, and needs to be deleted.</p>
<p>The automatic filtering process helped us remove 15,413 irrelevant records from the database. Their irrelevance was confirmed by subsequent human re-examination, suggesting that our automatic filtering rule was effective. The 14,274 records left in the database were also re-examined, and 2259 of them were found to be irrelevant. This means that the automatic filtering achieved 93% accuracy. Overall, the data-cleaning step resulted in 12,015 individual records or information policies.</p>

<title>4. Analysis and results</title>
<sec id="section8-0165551511428920">
<title>4.1. Domain classification methods</title>
<p>The broad range of information policies allowed us to construct a framework from multiple angles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165551511428920">17</xref>]. A common problem of previous research efforts in classifying information policy domains was the lack of comprehensiveness. We therefore aimed to produce a framework that presented all the domains addressed by Chinese information policies in a hierarchical structure, which was made possible by the abundance of our policy data. Our domain classification was achieved through a combination of three methods.</p>
<list id="list1-0165551511428920" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Referencing existing information policy frameworks</italic>. Most existing frameworks have two levels. The first level usually divides information policies into a small number of general classes according to a particular foundation. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0165551511428920">Table 2</xref> aggregates all the foundations ever seen, and their scope. Different foundations correspond to different classifications, but these overlap with each other to some degree. Also, it is impossible for a single foundation to provide a comprehensive classification of information policy domains. Taking these considerations into account, in this research we generated a three-level framework instead. The first level – the macro level, with the largest granularity – brings in the major domains. Overlaps in the descriptions of domains should be minimized or avoided. The major domains at the first level are further divided at the second level, which has a smaller granularity and is smaller. Each second-level domain belongs to one first-level domain exclusively, and is specified with more keywords. These keywords reside at the third level, which has the smallest granularity.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Referencing the classification and subject thesaurus system</italic>. The Chinese Classification and Thesaurus System details the possible relationships between two terms, including ‘Yong’ (Y), ‘Dai’ (D), ‘Shu’ (S), ‘Fen’ (F), and ‘Can’ (C). Specifically, Y stands for the non-subject terms pointing to a subject term, D the subject terms pointing to a non-subject term, and C related subject terms of a subject term. Z refers to a top term. Both Y and D mean that two terms are equivalent, but differ in term standardization. Whereas C reveals the relatedness of terms, F and Z explain terms in a hierarchy. With the help of the Chinese Classification and Subject Headings System, we can introduce more relevant descriptive keywords, and standardize the usage of terms; and the system is useful in shaping the hierarchical structure of the information policy framework.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Referencing data clustering results</italic>. Although the growth of information policies in China is not comparable to that in developed countries, after some decades China has accumulated a considerable quantity of policies that deal with a variety of industries. It is therefore feasible to extract the implicit clusters and relationships from the information policy data and apply them to domain classification. This research developed second-level domains on the basis of clustering results.</p>

<title>4.2. Domain framework development</title>
<sec id="section10-0165551511428920">
<title>4.2.1. Constructing the first level</title>
<p>The domains at the first level were determined on the basis of our previous research and the theory of the information resource life cycle. We selected the candidate domains from multiple angles, then removed overlaps, and decided on the final domains, which demonstrate broad coverage, similar granularity, and minimum overlaps with other domains.</p>
<list id="list2-0165551511428920" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Classifying domains according to the information life cycle</italic>. The life cycle of information generally includes information production, acquisition, development, management, and use. The production stage considers information resources (both the resources and the information activities involving them) and information talents (the personnel producing information and providing information services). The development stage focuses on information technologies and information networks, whereas the use stage focuses on the information industry, information markets and information literacy. The management stage includes intellectual property rights, information standards, and information safeguarding. The storage stage relates to such things as information archiving, information maintenance and information security.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Classifying domains according to the subject</italic>. Information-related subjects include information resources (i.e. information itself), information institutions (e.g. government departments, business institutions, and individuals), and information society (i.e. the environment that the information belongs to).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Classifying domains according to the macro information structure</italic>. The structure divides into the fundamental social information structure level (e.g. information infrastructures and information networks), the information resource level (including information technologies, talents, and investment), and the information diffusion and service level (including information circulation, use, provision, markets, and competition).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Classifying domains according to the standardization of information</italic>. This includes information standards, information security, information liberty, and information disclosure.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>After comparing the above approaches to domain classification, we found that the life cycle approach worked the best, because the main contents of information policies were covered, and the resulting domains have close granularity and little overlap. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0165551511428920">Table 1</xref> displays the first-level domains determined largely with this approach, but supplemented by others.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0165551511428920">
<title>4.2.2. Constructing the second and third levels</title>
<p>The second-level domains were determined by the following steps.</p>
<list id="list3-0165551511428920" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Develop the second-level domains preliminarily according to the ranges of the first-level domains that they belong to. For example, information resources, specifically referring to the sources of information, should include such subordinate domains as government information, business information, archival information and libraries. Intellectual property rights include copyrights, patents and trademarks. Information technologies include computer technologies, communications technologies, microelectronics technologies, and sensor technologies. Information networks comprise mainly communications networks, the internet, and cable TV networks.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Search for the subordinate domains of each first-level domain in the classification and subject headings system, and use them to complement and revise the second-level domains determined in the previous step. When examining the terms related to ‘intellectual property rights’ in the form of F, for instance, we found that ‘database protection’ and ‘integrated circuit protection’, which were the newly emerging domains with the development of technologies, also fell into this domain, and needed to be added to the second level.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Count the frequencies of the domain descriptive keywords from the 12,015 information policies in our dataset, and perform a co-word analysis of them. The result of clustering the keywords with SPSS 13.0 can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0165551511428920">Figure 1</xref>. We enriched the second-level domains with some of these clusters. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0165551511428920">Figure 1</xref>, the domain-descriptive keywords cluster into six major sections in a bottom-up process. Each of these sections presents a specific concept, which provides preparation for the classification of information policy domains. Take ‘information industry’, for example. It might include ‘communications industry’, ‘broadcasting and TV industry’, ‘publishing industry’, ‘electronics manufacturing industry’, ‘advertising industry’, and other subsections. ‘Gaming industry’ is a highly specific domain. Although steps 1 and 2 failed to take it into account, the clustering analysis led us to the discovery that a few information policies have addressed it; so ‘gaming industry’ was merged into ‘information industry’.</p>

<p>The keywords at the third level provide accurate descriptions for their superordinate domains. The sources of the descriptive keywords include:</p>
<list id="list4-0165551511428920" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Classifying the keywords in the first- and second-level domains, and downgrading some secondary keywords to the third level. For example, the reprocessing of existing keywords inserted ‘government affairs disclosure’ into the second-level domain ‘government information’.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Counting the frequencies of the keywords in the policy content database, and upgrading high-frequency keywords to the appropriate domains at the first or second level after filtering and categorizing. This engenders a clearer picture of the ranges of the major domains, and at the same time facilitates further indexing of our information policy database.</p>

<p>Enriching the keywords of the third-level domains in virtue of the Y, D and C relations in the Chinese Classification and Thesaurus System. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0165551511428920">Figure 2</xref> is a semantic relation graph centring around the entry term ‘e-commerce’. The surrounding terms are related to ‘e-commerce’ in different ways, but they all can be used as additional descriptive keywords of the third-level domain to which ‘e-commerce’ belongs.</p>

<p>With all three levels completed, the information policy framework (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0165551511428920">Table 3</xref>) finally took shape. Such a comprehensive framework, from different perspectives, covers various domains addressed by information policies. These domains, whose contents are described, constitute a hierarchical structure. Our research not only has generated a systematic classification of Chinese information policies, but also provides guidance for the establishment of information policies in the future.</p>

<title>5. Discussion</title>
<sec id="section13-0165551511428920">
<title>5.1. Discussion about the data</title>
<p>The information policy data used in this study originated mainly from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Chinainfolaw.com">Chinainfolaw.com</ext-link>, which contains rich and comprehensive data, especially national laws, regulations and policies. Although it satisfied our needs in building the Chinese information policy framework, dependence on a single data source could lead to limitations. For example, this database might not be sufficient for retrieving information policies established by local governments, since only the most important ones have been included. We also referenced China Laws and the Chinese National Laws and Regulations Database during the research, but there were other local websites about laws and regulations that we did not use. If conflicts or inconsistencies existed between the information policies established by the national government and those established by provincial, civic or regional governments, we might not be adequately aware of them. This paper lacks an in-depth analysis of such problems, but we can compare our framework with current national information policies in future research in order to reveal any gaps or blind spots. Also, comparing it with local information policies will help us detect conflicts or inconsistencies, which will be valuable to central and local governments in their information policy enactment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0165551511428920">
<title>5.2. Discussion of methods</title>
<p>The primary methods employed by this research study included the life cycle of information, data clustering and co-word analysis, and thesaurus semantic network structure analysis. Given the limitation of space, this paper has not provided detailed descriptions of the network, clustering, and co-word analyses; it has concentrating on the analysis results only.</p>
<p>Our data source is a comprehensive database containing laws, regulations and policies in various domains. We selected 11 primary keywords and their corresponding secondary keywords so that they could be used to retrieve relevant information policy records from the database. After removing repeating records and optimizing with a threshold, 12,015 strongly relevant records were obtained. We used the information life cycle to determine the first-level domains of the information policy framework, and then determined the second-level and third-level domains based on relevance. Complemented by and corrected with the semantic network structure of the <italic>Chinese Classification and Thesaurus</italic>, data clustering, and co-word analysis, our three-level Chinese information policy framework came into being. Nevertheless, how to divide different primary keywords into different stages of a life cycle was questionable and subjective. For instance, we thought that information resources and talent should belong to the information production stage, in that information talent is the producer of information, and information resources are the resulting products. But, equally, we could say that information talent also applies to the management and use stages, for being the manager and user of information. Another example is information security, which seemed appropriate in both the management and the storage stages. Sometimes, even the storage of information is part of the management stage. Such uncertainties in the first-level domain division had no impact on the overall structure of the information policy framework, but they influenced the placing of second-level and third-level domains within the structure; and they were difficult to avoid completely. For the purpose of eliminating the uncertainties aroused by the subjective division, we plan to conduct the clustering analysis according to the different stages of a life cycle in the future.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0165551511428920">
<title>5.3. Significance of the information policy framework</title>
<p>In order to guarantee the integrity of the information policy framework, this research considered every step in the course of social informationization when classifying information policy domains. This model has been widely recognized as the fundamental design and evaluation framework for information policies. Our information policy framework not only contains all the essential components of Moore’s model, but also has a clear hierarchy and contents, demonstrating great comprehensiveness and full coverage, as well as operability in respect of the enactment of specific information policies.</p>
<p>The framework draws explicit boundaries between information policy domains, and provides clear definitions of their attributes. It will play a significant role in managing and standardizing information activities. First, the domain granularities and relations shown in this framework can be referred to in promulgating national information policies, to avoid repetition. Second, the framework can help minimize the conflict between information policies in the same domain but established by different departments or districts. Third, the establishment of macro policies involving multiple domains may take into account the overlaps between them, to help the whole information industry run appropriately. Finally, classifying information policies according to industry enables policymakers to identify and solve the weaknesses and gaps in the policymaking processes.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that, as needs change, our framework is extensible and correctable. Because of the interplay of the information policy framework and policymaking, the former will respond to the development and changes of the latter. To be more specific, the framework is useful in standardizing policymaking, but is subject to improvement under new circumstances. One of our objectives in future research is to increase the dynamics of the framework so that new contents can be added at any time. We are particularly interested in investigating how to increase the compatibility of Chinese information policies with the progress of global informationization.</p>

<sec id="section16-0165551511428920" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>6. Conclusions</title>
<p>Information policies form and grow with the popularization of information, and regulate information activities in the different stages of the information’s life cycle: production, development, management, use and storage. Information activities have become common in various social domains. They involve various forms of information and multiple subjects in society, which impede the establishment of information policies to a certain extent. Traditional laws and regulations are built upon a rigid hierarchical system, and, similarly, an effective information policy framework is indispensable in establishing comprehensive and consistent policies. At the same time, the framework should be able to enrich and improve by itself, based on the informationization course of society. Out of these considerations, our research explored the construction of a system for information policies and laws, and developed a hierarchical national information policy framework with three levels, so as to facilitate information policymaking as well as regulate information activities.</p>
<p>Although the information policy domain framework provided by the paper is constructed based on the current database of laws and regulations, it is clustered according to the keywords of relevant laws and regulations in the databases. The framework covers new policies issued by governments, for all these keywords are flexible, by extending the semantic network structure of the <italic>Chinese Classification and Thesaurus</italic>. However, no framework is permanent. Accordingly, we may make adjustments of and supplements to the framework according to Rowlands’ framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0165551511428920">8</xref>] and Moore’s matrix framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0165551511428920">11</xref>]; the former has sound dynamics and the latter possesses ideal coverage. Thereby we could maintain the flexibility and dynamic nature of the framework, and classify new government policies into relevant categories or areas.</p>
