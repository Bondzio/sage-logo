<p>An often-used attitudinal classification focuses on the differences between <italic>Explorers, Pioneers</italic> and <italic>Settlers.</italic> ‘Explorers’ go where no one has gone before. ‘Pioneers’ follow, exploring in greater detail what has already been discovered, beginning to use what is available but with much still to discover. ‘Settlers’, deriving confidence from the pioneers that the land is safe, install the systems and structures that make communities work. <italic>Changing Spaces of Education: New Perspectives on the Nature of Learning</italic> is a collection of chapters that mainly originated as papers presented as part of a seminar series funded by the UK’s Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in 2008 and 2009. It is a book for Explorers and, possibly, Pioneers. Settlers will have to wait a while yet.</p>
<p>The title of the book focuses on two main ideas, ‘spaces’ and ‘learning’, but an exploration of the widening conceptual use of ‘spaces’ is the more common theme throughout. In the book’s introduction from the editors, a section entitled ‘Theoretical underpinnings’ deals almost exclusively with the ways in which the concept of ‘space’ is now being used. To add complexity, the editors point out that, throughout the book, ‘the concept of "space" is used in a variety of different ways and, often, its theoretical underpinnings are implicit’ (p. 4). Each chapter, in acknowledging and celebrating the new conceptual diversity of ‘space’, takes a somewhat different view of that concept.</p>
<p>The approach to <italic>learning</italic> is no less diverse. Different chapters focus on how ideas of space impact on policies about learning; how different ideas of space define the need for different kinds of learning; how adult learning is affected by conceptions of space, and so on. None of the chapters focuses on how different conceptual ideas of space impact on how learning happens – or whether it happens. The theoretical underpinnings of ‘learning’, about which the book’s title suggests that there might be new perspectives, are often taken for granted: ‘The discourse of learning has been much represented, debated, discussed and critiqued over the past fifteen years’ (Edwards, Chapter 11, ‘(Im)mobilities and (dis)locating practices in cyber-education’) is about as much as we get in acknowledging the equally complex theoretical underpinnings about learning. This is a shame, as it is not always clear how ‘new’ the new perspectives on learning actually are. It is also interesting that the chapters of the book that deal more directly with student learning are those that use some of the developing ideas of ‘space’ less frequently.</p>
<p>The reader should not, therefore, expect a coherent ride as they read the book. Multiple interpretations of the term ‘space’ flow freely through four different themes, which are themselves spaces: the movement of students across national borders in pursuit of an education; the spaces within which education policy is formed; the actual spaces in which people learn; and the recent growth in e-learning. At the same time, ideas of why learning is important in the 21st century, what learning matters as a result of its different purposes, how learning happens and whether it happens successfully or not, are dealt with differently by different authors. As with all ‘Explorers’, almost everything in this book is a variable and almost every chapter contains a variation of the phrase ‘More research is needed’ which lets the reader know – and there is nothing wrong in this – that this is in the main a book of ideas to be explored rather than an investigation of approaches to be followed or tested.</p>
<p>Given the above, and accepting that this is not a book that is going to guide the reader swiftly towards current best practice, each chapter raises worthwhile issues for readers with different interests and concerns. From my own perspective Molly Warrington, writing about new policy spaces and the unattainable pursuit of equity, shows how policy decisions struggle to make an impact when ‘it is difficult for young people to leave [challenging but] dominant aspects of their lives behind when they enter the school gates’ (p. 106). This clash of the conceptual spaces in which policy is made, and the actual spaces in which students live their real lives and the impact this can have on student learning, is an important one.</p>
<p>In a chapter on ‘School building redesign’, John Horton and Peter Kraftl point out that the rhetoric of school building improvements and the involvement of students in its processes in England, Australia and Portugal – usually couched in the language of transformation not only for schools but for nations – usually end up in disappointment for most participants: ‘There was a sense that they – or the process – had failed to meet expectations, which left some interviewees feeling disenchanted, resentful or disinclined to undertake future participatory projects’ (p. 128). Examples like this show where future research might take us in respect of the link between changing spaces and new perspectives on the nature of learning. A decision taken in the policymaking space to improve the physical space in which students learn by involving them in the process requires exactly a new perspective on the nature of learning so that students can make the kinds of contribution that the rhetoric suggested was possible. However, as the chapter reports, instead of re-designing the student learning experience so that they had the knowledge, skills and developing understandings to participate properly, what happened was that ill-equipped students participated through means that were ‘generally small-scale (often engaging no more than a dozen pupils), discrete and short-lived (typically lasting for the duration of one lesson or school council session, or else taking the form of a half-day activity’) (p. 119).</p>
<p>The chapter entitled ‘New places of work, new spaces of learning’ by Alan Felstead and Nick Jewson focuses, more than most of the book, on the explicit relationship between different ideas of space and the need for new perspectives about the ‘what’ learning that could inform curriculum developers at national and local levels. They report how hot-desking, home working, working on the move as a consequence of developing IT and working in other less conventional spaces has implications for the development of new skills and aptitudes of working, new skills of management, new social and emotional skills and an increased focus on the capacity for self-motivation and independence.</p>
<p>In the chapter ‘(Im)mobilities and (dis)locating practices in cyber-education’, Richard Edwards explores some of the tensions experienced by educators between a desire to facilitate mobility and yet to retain particular disciplinary ‘moorings’. This echoed issues in some of my own recent work with colleagues in developing a new curriculum for students aged 11-14. There is considerable agreement that students of this age mediate their learning successfully when they are given opportunities to develop meaning across and between the otherwise differentiated experiences of secondary schools. Notwithstanding that, through the curriculum development trailing process we continually received feedback that teachers were (understandably) reluctant to let go of the subject disciplines and timetabling that made the creation of meaning and coherence so hard for the students. Research into the impact of this reluctance on the learning of students (and particularly those students for whom school is not their natural space in any sense) is urgently needed.</p>
<p>There is a relationship between these ideas of Edwards and those of Gunter Hefler and Jorg Mzarkowitsch who, in their chapter ‘Bridging institutional divides’, use the ideas of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1475240912463999">Maurice et al. (1986)</xref> in distinguishing between the impact of the choices institutions make between ‘organisational space (the behavior of comparable employer organisations’) and ‘skill space (the particular interplay of educational provision and learning opportunities’) (p. 164). They point out that ‘The dominance of either skill space or organizational space is crucial for any workplace learning’, an idea that is helpful in working through how to provide the right conceptual and concrete spaces in which children and students of different ages (as well as adults) can best learn and develop knowledge, skills and understanding.</p>
<p>I would certainly recommend this book for policymakers, curriculum developers and the different designers of the concrete and abstract spaces in which learning takes place. It may not be coherent, but it is thought-provoking and it sets out the ground well for the next level of research to take place. From my perspective, I hope that the research will take us in the direction of practice and bring us to a clearer idea of how interpretations of space impact on different but successful learning for children, students and adults of all ages.</p>
