<sec id="sec1-1469540512456939"><title>S. Miles (2010) <italic>Spaces for Consumption. Pleasure and Placelessness in the Post-Industrial City</italic> London: SAGE. 209 pp. £22.99. ISBN 9 781 412 946 667</title>
<p>Steven Miles’s <italic>Spaces for Consumption</italic> concentrates on contemporary urban cities, specifically a concern for how and why urban contexts are produced for consumption and the social and spatial effects of this. The choice of the title ‘spaces <italic>for</italic> (rather than of) consumption’ reflects a deliberate framing of these spaces and places. Miles focuses on the ways in which landscapes are ideologically created for consumption rather than emphasizing their role as material spaces in which consumption occurs. Underpinned by capitalist imperatives, Miles sees the city as a place in which utopian dreams and desires are promised but not delivered. Spaces for consumption are spaces in which the realization of the pleasurable and exciting is simultaneously circumscribed by the very cultural and economic processes that created such desires. Keen to refute notions of duped and passive consumers, Miles’s key argument is that consumers are not victims of consumer society; rather they are very much complicit in its construction and ideological reproduction.</p>
<p>Accordingly spaces for consumption provide sites for the production of individual identity but are also spaces for the production of place identity as city entrepreneurs redefine urban spaces in the context of urban competition in a globalizing world. Issues of place and personal identity are a common theme in the book and represented through a number of paradoxes and tensions. One such tension is the struggle for individuals to maintain distinctive identities and yet be part of a group, a struggle that is also reflected in the material and symbolic (re)production of the city. Urban spaces consequently represent the relationship between self and society, and exist at the intersection of society and structure, public and private life. Another tension evident throughout the book is the relationship between freedom and control. While these aspects may be exhibited in consumers’ experiences of choice, self-gratification and creativity, Miles argues the manifestation of these experiences through the medium of the market undermines the realization of freedoms and possibilities for agency. Consequently, a recurrent theme in the book is the notion that spaces of consumption naturalize capitalist consumerism as a way of life, but fall short of delivering the promised community and connectedness that might characterize meaningful urban life.</p>
<p>The illusory nature of public life in spaces for consumption is discussed at length in the second chapter of the book, which focuses on ‘The Individualised City’. Miles suggest our citizenship is increasingly defined by our actions as consumers, with spaces for consumption changing how the individual relates to society, reflecting a shift from a communal to an individualized and privatized society. Discussing airports, he demonstrates how travellers in spaces designed for pleasurable waiting are obliged to fulfill their role as consumers. Case studies are also used to good effect in the remaining chapters of the book, extending and developing key conceptual ideas that have been constructed from a comprehensive survey of existing literature on each topic.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 reflects on how and why the post-industrial city has emerged as a focal point for the dreams of the individual. Here Miles uses the case of Glasgow to reflect on place-making as a spatial effect of globalization, noting how rhetoric takes precedence over reality, a rhetoric reflected in the images of the elite and the values of potential investors, visitors and tourists, noting how such visions may involve both spatial and social inclusion and take little account of the realities of existing social relations and inequities. The reinvention of the city is also taken up in Chapter 4 where a study of cultural quarters and museums demonstrates how the built environment is revalorized around cultural consumption through the marketing of cultural products as cultural experiences. Chapter 5 draws on architecture and iconic buildings in Shanghai, and the Guggenheim Bilbao to show how the architecture of consumption forms the ‘propaganda of the post-industrial’ in reflecting a shift from a producer-based urbanism to a consumer-based one. Chapters 6 and, 7 and 8 focus on the framing of spectacular spaces for consumption, that is, shopping malls, mega city events and theme parks respectively. In each of these chapters Miles questions the extent to which consumers can be part of the production of these places when belonging, sociality and civic pride are subsumed within the construction of capitalistic visions and structures of consumption. Miles’s concern about the significance of spaces for consumption resides not so much in their materiality, but the ways in which they reflect economic value of the cultural and the cultural value of the economic transforming the nature of public space and creating particular forms of inclusion and exclusion.</p>
<p>Though there has been extensive research around the topics that form the basis of this book – shopping malls, museums, mega-events, spectacular urban landscapes, iconic buildings, and theme parks – a strength of the book is the way in which these spaces are connected. Through every chapter, Miles seeks to challenge taken for granted understandings of the functioning of these spaces by encouraging the reader to consider the paradoxes and complexities of living in world configured by consumption. He invites us to consider why such spaces are embraced and deplored by consumers, how superficiality and genuine meaning, authenticity and inauthenticity are (re)produced through spaces of consumption, and to reflect on the kinds of social and spatial inequalities that result from visions of consumption that may not be lived by urban residents. In reflecting on the relationship between civil society and the individual the reader is asked to consider what it means to be citizen of a consumer society and to ask whether alternative visions can really challenge the dominance of the market where spaces for consumption may reflect social power without social responsibility.</p>
<p>The book will be an invaluable resource for students and researchers alike. As a teaching tool students might also be encouraged to reflect on the existence of spaces for consumption outside of the well-researched and more prominent spectacular spaces characteristic of large post-industrial cities that form the focus of this monograph. The book also lends itself to a discussion of re- rather than de-territorialization and to the ways in which local expressions of identity, citizenship and place might have an impact in a globalizing world. Notwithstanding this, Spaces for Consumption is a thought provoking volume which speaks to the relationship between consumers and consumption in contemporary urban spaces.</p>
