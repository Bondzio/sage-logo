<abstract>
<p>Estimation of the effect of a binary exposure on an outcome in the presence of confounding is often carried out <italic>via</italic> outcome regression modelling. An alternative approach is to use propensity score methodology. The propensity score is the conditional probability of receiving the exposure given the observed covariates and can be used, under the assumption of no unmeasured confounders, to estimate the causal effect of the exposure. In this article, we provide a non-technical and intuitive discussion of propensity score methodology, motivating the use of the propensity score approach by analogy with randomised studies, and describe the four main ways in which this methodology can be implemented. We carefully describe the population parameters being estimated — an issue that is frequently overlooked in the medical literature. We illustrate these four methods using data from a study investigating the association between maternal choice to provide breast milk and the infant's subsequent neurodevelopment. We outline useful extensions of propensity score methodology and discuss directions for future research. Propensity score methods remain controversial and there is no consensus as to when, if ever, they should be used in place of traditional outcome regression models. We therefore end with a discussion of the relative advantages and disadvantages of each.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0962280210394483"><title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>Non-experimental studies are often conducted to investigate the effect of a binary exposure on an outcome. In the absence of random allocation of exposure, however, systematic differences between exposed and unexposed subjects create the problem of confounding. In 1983, Rosenbaum and Rubin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0962280210394483">1</xref></sup> published a seminal article introducing the propensity score in which they demonstrated that, under certain assumptions, this score can be used to unbiasedly estimate the (causal) effect of an exposure in the presence of confounding. The gradual acceptance and use of the propensity score approach has culminated in what has recently been described as ‘overwhelming and sometimes naïve enthusiasm’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0962280210394483">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although several articles detail the methodology of the propensity score approach (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0962280210394483">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0962280210394483">4</xref></sup>) or provide example analyses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0962280210394483">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0962280210394483">6</xref></sup> few provide the reader with an intuitive understanding of the general approach and the links between the various ways in which it can be implemented. In this article, we provide a non-technical and intuitive discussion of these issues, paying particular attention to the definition of the estimand – the population parameter being estimated. This latter issue has received great attention in the econometrics literature in regard to propensity score methods, but has been comparatively neglected in the medical literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0962280210394483">7</xref></sup> We comment on the current usage of the propensity score, outline useful extensions of propensity score methodology and discuss directions for future research.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-0962280210394483">Section 2</xref>, we discuss three definitions of the causal effect of an exposure and in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec6-0962280210394483">Section 3</xref>, we describe how the propensity score can be used to estimate these causal effects. In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec15-0962280210394483">Section 4</xref>, we discuss estimation of the propensity score itself and in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec21-0962280210394483">Section 5</xref>, we summarise important extensions of this approach. In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec25-0962280210394483">Section 6</xref>, we demonstrate the propensity score methods using data from a study investigating the association between maternal choice to provide breast milk and the infant's subsequent neurodevelopment. Despite widespread use, propensity score methods remain controversial, due to frequent misuse and over-confidence in the ability of these methods to remove bias.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0962280210394483">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0962280210394483">8</xref></sup> We therefore conclude, in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec31-0962280210394483">Section 7</xref>, with a discussion of some of the advantages and disadvantages of the propensity score approach in comparison with traditional outcome regression models.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0962280210394483"><title>2 Causal effects</title>
<p>We begin by considering a simple, but common, scenario in which a cohort study has been undertaken in order to investigate the effect of a (non-randomised) binary exposure Z (1 = exposed, 0 = unexposed) on a continuous outcome Y, with information additionally collected on potential confounding variables <italic>X</italic> = (<italic>X</italic><sub>1</sub>, … , <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>).</p>
<sec id="sec3-0962280210394483"><title>2.1 A motivating example</title>
<p>Several observational studies have suggested that provision of maternal breast milk improves the infant's subsequent neurodevelopment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0962280210394483">9</xref></sup> Randomisation of breastfeeding is not feasible but confounding by parental education and socio-economic status (SES) is highly likely in the absence of randomisation. In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec25-0962280210394483">Section 6</xref>, we investigate this question using a real dataset. For the purposes of illustration, we first introduce a simplified version of the dataset.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0962280210394483">Figure 1</xref> shows a dataset containing 20 children. The binary exposure is breastfeeding and the outcome is IQ at 7.5 years of age. The scale on which IQ is assumed to be measured is based on the abbreviated, Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children (revised Anglicised version: WISC-R UK).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0962280210394483">10</xref></sup> We assume, at present, that the only confounder of the association between breastfeeding and IQ is SES status (of the mother) which we have dichotomised into low and high.
<fig id="fig1-0962280210394483" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>A hypothetical observational dataset (<italic>n</italic> = 20), where each figure represents a child from a low SES (black) or high SES (grey) household, with outcomes (IQ at 7.5 years) written below the figures.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0962280210394483-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>To allow calculation of the population (true) values of the causal estimands, suppose that breastfeeding causally increases IQ at age 7.5 by 5 points in children from low SES families, but by 10 points in children from high SES families. Suppose further that 40% of women in the population are classified as high SES. And finally, suppose that 50% of low SES women choose to breastfeed their children, compared with 75% of high SES women, resulting in a total of 60% of women in the population breastfeeding their children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0962280210394483"><title>2.2 The causal effect of the exposure</title>
<p>In order to consider issues of cause and effect, we turn to the potential outcomes (or counterfactual) framework.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0962280210394483">11</xref></sup> Each individual has two <italic>potential</italic> outcomes: the outcome that would occur if that individual was exposed, <italic>Y</italic><sub>1</sub>, and the outcome that would occur if that individual was not exposed, <italic>Y</italic><sub>0</sub>. We observe <italic>Y</italic> = <italic>ZY</italic><sub>1</sub> + (1 − <italic>Z</italic>)<italic>Y</italic><sub>0</sub>. The intuitively defined causal effect for an individual, <italic>Y</italic><sub>1</sub> − <italic>Y</italic><sub>0</sub>, can never be observed since only one of <italic>Y</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>Y</italic><sub>0</sub> occurs (the other is <italic>counterfactual</italic>). When interest lies in a group of individuals, we might define the causal effect as the mean of the individual causal effects. This mean can be estimated by using outcomes of other individuals to estimate the unobserved counterfactual outcomes. Since the individual causal effects may not all be equal, defining the group of individuals for whom we wish to estimate the mean causal effect of the exposure becomes important. Setting this issue within the standard framework of an infinite population from which our sample was randomly drawn, there are two popular choices for the group of interest: the whole population and the sub-population of those who are actually exposed. We call the resulting causal effects, respectively, the Average Causal Effect of the exposure (<italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>All</italic></sub>) and the Average Causal Effect of the exposure on the Exposed (<italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>Exp</italic></sub>). These are sometimes called the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) and Average Treatment effect on the Treated (ATT).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0962280210394483">12</xref></sup> A third estimand that might be of interest, but is rarely discussed, concerns the sub-population of those who are actually unexposed, (<italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>Un</italic></sub>). Other causal effects could be constructed but we will restrict our attention to the three mentioned.</p>
<p>The <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>All</italic></sub> is the mean of the individual causal effects in the whole population, <italic>E</italic> [<italic>Y</italic><sub>1</sub> − <italic>Y</italic><sub>0</sub>], or, equivalently, the difference between two hypothetical mean outcomes in the population: the mean outcome if everyone were exposed <italic>E</italic> [<italic>Y</italic><sub>1</sub>] and the mean outcome if no-one were exposed <italic>E</italic> [<italic>Y</italic><sub>0</sub>]. The <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>Exp</italic></sub> restricts attention to the sub-group of the population who are in fact exposed, and is the mean of the individual causal effects in this sub-population, <italic>E</italic> [<italic>Y</italic><sub>1</sub> − <italic>Y</italic><sub>0</sub>|<italic>Z</italic> = 1] or, equivalently, the difference between the mean outcome of all exposed people in the population <italic>E</italic> [<italic>Y</italic><sub>1</sub>|<italic>Z</italic> = 1] and the mean outcome of these <italic>same</italic> people had they not been exposed <italic>E</italic> [<italic>Y</italic><sub>0</sub>|<italic>Z</italic> = 1]. Analogously, the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>Un</italic></sub> restricts attention to the sub-group of the population who are in fact not exposed, <italic>E</italic> [<italic>Y</italic><sub>1</sub> − <italic>Y</italic><sub>0</sub>|<italic>Z</italic> = 0].</p>
<p>For the simplified breastfeeding example (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-0962280210394483">Section 2.1</xref>), the causal effect of breastfeeding on IQ at age 7.5 is 5 units for each low SES child and 10 for each high SES child. Since the population comprises 60% low SES children, the mean of the individual causal effects in this population is
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0962280210394483"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0962280210394483-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>In the sub-population of the children who were breastfed, 50% are low SES, so the mean causal effect in this sub-population is
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-0962280210394483"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0962280210394483-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>In the sub-population of the children who were not breastfed, 75% are low SES, so the mean causal effect in this sub-population is
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-0962280210394483"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0962280210394483-eq3.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The effect of breastfeeding is larger – more beneficial – amongst those who are more likely to be breastfed (high SES children). Therefore, the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>Exp</italic></sub> is larger than the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>All</italic></sub> which in turn is larger than the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>Un</italic></sub>.</p>
<p>Whether the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>All</italic></sub>, the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>Exp</italic></sub> or the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>Un</italic></sub> should be estimated depends on the study question. For example, many primary (elementary) schools provide children with access to school computers to develop their computer literacy skills. This practice is more likely to occur in schools located in wealthier areas but children living in such areas are more likely to have home computers. Thus, the effect of school computers may be smallest for children currently receiving them. The three causal effects will therefore differ. A policy-maker assessing the cost-effectiveness of a proposed population-wide provision of free computers to schools may be interested in the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>All</italic></sub>. A policy-maker specifically charged with increasing computer literacy amongst deprived children would be more interested in the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>Un</italic></sub>. To address the question of whether the computers are currently having any effect, however, the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>Exp</italic></sub> would be the causal effect of interest.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0962280210394483"><title>2.3 Assumptions</title>
<p>We make the following assumptions: The first, most vital, assumption is that the exposure <italic>Z</italic> must temporally precede its putative effect <italic>Y</italic>. The second assumption – sometimes called positivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0962280210394483">13</xref></sup> – is that, since the causal effect of the exposure for someone who could never (or would always) be exposed is undefined, each subject must have the potential to be exposed, and to be unexposed. For the breastfeeding example, this might be violated by babies born to HIV +ve mothers, since the latter are often advised not to breastfeed. The third assumption is often called the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0962280210394483">14</xref></sup> It states that the two potential outcomes for an individual are unaffected by any other individual's exposure status. This assumption is required for most individually randomised trials and observational studies. An example violation is given by Little and Rubin: Suppose you and I are in the same room and we both have a headache. If you do not take aspirin my headache will remain whether or not I take aspirin since your whining will counteract the alleviating effect of my aspirin!<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0962280210394483">15</xref></sup> We further assume that the data {<italic>Y</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>Y</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>Z</italic>, <italic>X</italic>} were sampled independently from the population, in which case SUTVA follows automatically. The final assumption is often called the SITA assumption – Strongly Ignorable Treatment Assignment (given the observed covariates).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0962280210394483">1</xref></sup> It states that the exposure and the potential outcomes are conditionally independent, given the observed covariates. In other words, there are no unobserved confounders. When exposure is not randomly allocated, it is impossible to be certain that this assumption has been satisfied. In the simplified breastfeeding example, the SITA assumption may be violated because the unmeasured gestational age of the child is likely to confound the association between breastfeeding and IQ. The assumed structure of the data and the SITA assumption are shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0962280210394483">Figure 2</xref>.
<fig id="fig2-0962280210394483" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Structure of the data. Observed variables are depicted as squares and unobserved (potential outcomes) as circles. The SITA assumption is satisfied by the absence of arrows directly connecting exposure <italic>Z</italic> to the potential outcomes <italic>Y</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>Y</italic><sub>1</sub>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0962280210394483-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>

<sec id="sec6-0962280210394483"><title>3 Using the propensity score to estimate causal effects</title>
<sec id="sec7-0962280210394483"><title>3.1 Covariate balance in a randomised trial</title>
<p>For each participant of a simple two-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT), the probability of being exposed is 50%. As this probability is the same for each participant, the group who actually receives the exposure can be viewed as a random sample from the whole set of trial participants, leading us to expect that the exposed and unexposed arms will be comparable in terms of all characteristics other than exposure. Any pair of participants, one exposed and the other unexposed, will have different characteristics (one may be male and the other female, for example) but all characteristics will be balanced between the two trial arms <italic>on average</italic>, those both observed and unobserved. Provided that the SUTVA assumption holds, this balance ensures that the mean counterfactual outcome of the participants in one arm of the trial can be estimated by the mean outcome in the other arm, i.e. the difference between the mean outcomes in the exposed and unexposed arms is an unbiased estimate of <italic>E</italic> [<italic>Y</italic><sub>1</sub>] − <italic>E</italic> [<italic>Y</italic><sub>0</sub>]. Note that the randomisation artificially forces the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>Exp</italic></sub> and <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>Un</italic></sub> to coincide with the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>All</italic></sub>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0962280210394483"><title>3.2 Balancing covariates using the propensity score</title>
<p>The propensity score is defined as the conditional probability of being exposed given the observed covariates, <italic>e</italic>(<italic>X</italic>) = ℙ(<italic>Z</italic> = 1 | <italic>X</italic>). Each subject is assumed to have the possibility of being either exposed or unexposed (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5-0962280210394483">Section 2.3</xref>) so 0 &lt; <italic>e</italic>(<italic>X</italic>) &lt; 1. The propensity score is typically unknown but can be estimated from the data. We defer discussion of its estimation until <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec15-0962280210394483">Section 4</xref>.</p>
<p>In an observational study, the covariates are unlikely to be balanced between the exposed and unexposed groups. Rosenbaum and Rubin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0962280210394483">1</xref></sup> however, demonstrated that observed covariates are balanced at each value of the propensity score. This is because, at any particular value of the propensity score, each subject with that propensity score has the same probability of being exposed (conditional on the observed covariates). Therefore, if the SITA assumption holds, we can essentially view those who are in fact exposed as a random sample of all subjects with that propensity score. Analogously to the RCT, any pair of subjects with the same propensity score, one exposed and the other unexposed, will have different characteristics. On average, however, all (observed) characteristics will be balanced between the two exposure groups. Provided that the SUTVA assumption holds, in addition to SITA, this balance ensures that <italic>in the sub-sample of subjects with a particular value of the propensity score</italic>, <italic>p</italic>, the mean counterfactual outcome of the subjects in one exposure group can be estimated by the mean observed outcome in the other exposure group, i.e. the difference between the mean outcomes in the exposed and unexposed groups is an unbiased estimate of <italic>E</italic> [<italic>Y</italic><sub>1</sub> − <italic>Y</italic><sub>0</sub>| <italic>e</italic>(<italic>X</italic>) = <italic>p</italic> ].</p>
<p>Thus, under the strong assumption that all confounders have been observed, the propensity score can be used to re-create a pseudo-randomised situation (at each value of the propensity score), allowing unbiased estimation of the exposure effect within strata of the propensity score.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0962280210394483"><title>3.3 Four propensity score methods</title>
<p>We describe four ways in which this general approach can be applied, once the propensity score has been estimated (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec15-0962280210394483">Section 4</xref>), using the simplified breastfeeding example. Since there is a single binary confounder, the propensity score can be estimated by the proportion of children who were breastfed in the low and high SES groups, i.e. <inline-formula id="ilm1-0962280210394483"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math1-0962280210394483"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>12</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for low SES children, and <inline-formula id="ilm2-0962280210394483"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math2-0962280210394483"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>34</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for high SES children.</p>
<sec id="sec10-0962280210394483"><title>3.3.1 Stratification on the propensity score</title>
<p>Following the argument above, we might: (i) create strata within which all subjects have the same value of the estimated propensity score, (ii) within each stratum estimate the exposure effect by the difference in mean outcome between exposed and unexposed groups and (iii) calculate a weighted average of the within-strata estimates of the effect of the exposure, with the weight for a stratum equal to the fraction of the sample within that stratum. This process estimates the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>All</italic></sub>. By changing the weights in step (iii), other causal effects can be estimated. The <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>Exp</italic></sub> is estimated by weighting strata by the fraction of the exposed subjects who are in each stratum, and the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>Un</italic></sub> is estimated by weighting strata by the fraction of the unexposed subjects who are in each stratum.</p>

<p>A popular alternative is to: (i) for each exposed subject, select a single unexposed subject who has the same value of the estimated propensity score, (ii) estimate the within-pair effect of the exposure by taking the difference in the two outcomes and (iii) calculate the average within-pair estimate of the effect of the exposure.

<sec id="sec12-0962280210394483"><title>3.3.3 Weighting by the inverse of the propensity score</title>
<p>The idea of this approach, when used to estimate the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>All</italic></sub>, is to create two ‘potential’ samples (sometimes called a pseudo-population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0962280210394483">13</xref></sup>) that are intended to represent the samples we would have observed if: (i) everyone had been exposed and (ii) no-one had been exposed. We demonstrate the construction of these for the simplified breastfeeding example. Since each low SES child has a propensity score of <inline-formula id="ilm5-0962280210394483"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math5-0962280210394483"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>12</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, i.e. a 1-in-2 chance of being breastfed, we expect that for each low SES child who is breastfed there is another low SES child who is not. Although we cannot know the (counterfactual) outcome that would have occurred if this unexposed child had been breastfed, we can estimate it by the outcome of the child who <italic>was</italic> breastfed. To do this, we transform each breastfed low SES child into two children, assigning the ‘replica’ the outcome of the original child.</p>
<p>High SES children have a propensity score of <inline-formula id="ilm6-0962280210394483"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math6-0962280210394483"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>34</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, i.e. a 3-in-4 change of being breastfed. Therefore, for each group of three breastfed high SES children, we expect there to be a single high SES child who was not breastfed. Thus, for each three breastfed high SES children, we create a single replica, assigning the replica the mean observed outcome of the three original children. Similarly, for each low SES child who was not breastfed, we create a single replica, and for each high SES child who was not breastfed we create three replicas (a 1-in-4 chance of not being breastfed means that for each child not breastfed, we expect there to be three who were). This process leads to the situation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0962280210394483">Figure 3</xref>(c). The estimated <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>All</italic></sub> is simply the difference in mean outcome between the two potential samples. This estimates the effect of breastfeeding on IQ at age 7.5 as

</p>
<p>Equivalently, a weighted linear regression model of outcome on exposure can be fitted, where the weight for each exposed subject is 1/<italic>e</italic>(<italic>X</italic>) and the weight for each unexposed subject is 1/(1 − <italic>e</italic>(<italic>X</italic>)).</p>
<p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0962280210394483">Figure 3</xref>(c), it is clear that the two potential samples created by the weighting each mirror exactly the covariate distribution of the original dataset (in this case, the distribution of SES). To estimate the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>Exp</italic></sub>, we need weights that will create two potential samples each of which exactly mirror the covariate distribution of the exposed subjects in the original dataset (i.e. 40% high SES). Weighting exposed subjects by 1 means that the potential exposed sample is identical to the exposed subset of the sample, and weighting the unexposed subjects by <italic>e</italic>(<italic>X</italic>)/(1 − <italic>e</italic>(<italic>X</italic>)) produces a potential unexposed sample that takes the same covariate distribution as the exposed subset of the original dataset.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0962280210394483">6</xref></sup> Similarly, to estimate the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>Un</italic></sub>, the unexposed subjects are weighted by 1 and the exposed by (1 − <italic>e</italic>(<italic>X</italic>))/<italic>e</italic>(<italic>X</italic>).</p>
<p>If the sample contains an exposed (or unexposed) individual with a very low (or high) propensity score, that individual would be replicated many times in the process above so that random error in that individual's outcome would greatly influence the estimate of exposure effect.

By splitting the population into low and high SES, as in the breastfeeding example, calculating a sub-population odds ratio within each SES group and combining the two in a weighted average, we arrive at a different population quantity – a conditional odds ratio – even if the two sub-population odds ratios are equal. This will typically be further from 1 than the marginal odds ratio. Since there are many characteristics that we could stratify (condition) on, there are many different population conditional odds ratios. This non-collapsibility property leads to the little appreciated fact that adding a covariate to a logistic regression model changes the population quantity being estimated – to a different conditional odds ratio.</p>
<p>A multivariable logistic regression model estimates an odds ratio conditional on all covariates in the model. Covariate-adjustment and stratification on the propensity score each estimate a conditional odds ratio, conditional only on the propensity score. By conditioning only on a single variable, the conditional odds ratio from these propensity score methods may be closer to the marginal odds ratio than that from a fully adjusted logistic regression model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0962280210394483">41</xref></sup> Matching on the propensity score (in its most popular form, estimating the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>Exp</italic></sub>) restricts attention to the exposed sub-population and thus does not estimate the marginal odds ratio in the whole population. Conversely, inverse-weighting by the propensity score does estimate the marginal odds ratio.

<p>Variance estimation and confidence interval (CI) calculation for propensity score analyses is an area that has been relatively neglected. Although estimation of the propensity score is widely held to reduce the variance of the estimate of exposure effect this is rarely taken into account in the formation of 95% CIs. This omission may lead to conservative CIs and hypothesis tests. Theoretical variance formulæ, correcting for the estimation of the propensity score, have been derived for the inverse-weighting method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0962280210394483">17</xref></sup> and stratification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0962280210394483">46</xref></sup> but these corrections are not routinely implemented in statistical software.

<p>In this section, we use data from two parallel trials of infant feeding to investigate the question introduced earlier: does provision of maternal breast milk improve subsequent neurodevelopment of the infant?

<sec id="sec27-0962280210394483"><title>6.2 Methods</title>
<p>926 babies born at &lt;37 weeks gestation, who were under 1850 g at birth and admitted to one of five centres in the United Kingdom were enrolled into two separate randomised trials. In each trial, the mother chose whether or not to provide expressed breast milk for the infant. The randomised trial diet (Trial 1: term formula vs pre-term formula; Trial 2: banked donor milk vs pre-term formula) was given until either discharge from the neonatal unit or achieving a weight of 2000 g. For mothers who chose to provide breast milk, the trial diet was supplementary and given according to the mother’s success in providing her milk. More details of the trials can be found elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0962280210394483">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0962280210394483">51</xref></sup> Breast milk was delivered via tubes, removing effects due solely to the process of breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Children were assessed at approximately 7.5 years of age. IQ was measured as described previously (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-0962280210394483">Section 2.1</xref>). Social class (SES) was coded using the Registrar General's classification based on occupation of the income-providing parent, or the father's where both parents were in paid employment. Mother's education was coded as: 1 = no educational attainments, 2 = up to four passes for the certificate of secondary education (CSE), 3 = any ‘O’ levels or more than four CSEs, 4 = any ‘A’ levels, and 5 = degree or higher professional qualifications. Information was collected about family structure and marital status (parents living together versus single mother). Details of the pregnancy, labour, delivery and the neonatal period were recorded.</p>
<sec id="sec28-0962280210394483"><title>6.2.1 Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The propensity score – the conditional probability of choosing to provide breast milk – was estimated using a logistic regression model, where the outcome was choice to provide breast milk (yes/no). It included the following covariates: marital status, social class, maternal educational level and age infant gender, birthweight, gestational age, and birth order in the family. All covariates except gender and marital status were entered into the model as (centred) continuous variables, after initial models indicated approximately linear trends. Non-linearities of all continuous variables were investigated, as were interactions of all covariates with the two binary covariates. Histograms, kernel density plots and box-plots were used to graph the estimated propensity score. To assess balance, the percentage standardised difference for each covariate – the mean difference of the covariate between exposure groups, divided by a pooled estimate of the standard deviation (SD), and multiplied by 100 – was calculated for the whole dataset, within the matched sample, and for the potential samples. For the stratified estimator, the within-strata differences were weighted according to the fraction of the sample in each strata before dividing by the pooled SD.</p>
<p>The three causal effects of the choice to provide breast milk on IQ – the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>All</italic></sub>, the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>Exp</italic></sub> and the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>Un</italic></sub> – were estimated using the four methods described. For the stratification, 18 strata were used, obtained by collapsing the top three categories of 20 equal-sized strata to ensure adequate cell frequencies. Three matched samples, one for each causal effect, were each created by matching pairs (one exposed and one unexposed) such that each pair of estimated propensity scores were no further than 0.05 apart. In each case, matching was performed with replacement. Three sets of potential samples were created as previously described for the inverse weighting method. Finally, a linear regression model for IQ on the estimated propensity score and exposure, with and without an exposure by propensity score interaction, was fitted. From the model including the interaction, the three causal effects were estimated by evaluating the exposure effect at three propensity score values: the sample mean, the mean amongst the exposed subset of the sample, and the mean amongst the unexposed subset of the sample. These will correctly estimate the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>All</italic></sub>, the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>Exp</italic></sub> and the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>Un</italic></sub>, respectively, if the relationship between IQ and the propensity score is approximately linear within each exposure group. For the purposes of comparison, a traditional linear regression model for IQ was fitted including variables on the basis of whether or not their inclusion changed the estimated association between choice to breastfeed and IQ by more than 10%. All measured covariates were considered as possible confounders. Non-linearities and interactions were assessed. For all estimates, bootstrap bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) CIs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0962280210394483">52</xref></sup> calculated from 5000 replications, are presented. The propensity score was re-estimated for each bootstrap sample, to allow for the estimation of the propensity score within the BCa CIs.</p>

<sec id="sec29-0962280210394483"><title>6.3 Results</title>
<p>In total, demographic and follow-up IQ data were obtained for 487 children. Of these, the mothers of 340 (69.8%) had chosen to provide breast milk and 147 (30.2%) had not. Mean follow-up age (range) was 7.6 (7.3, 8.2) years amongst children in the maternal breast milk group, and 7.6 (7.4, 8.0) years amongst those in the no maternal breast milk group. Demographic characteristics of the children included in the analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0962280210394483">Table 1</xref>, where SES, maternal educational level and birth order are shown as binary variables for simplicity. There are some suggestions of imbalance across the two exposure groups, most noticeably of SES, maternal educational level and birth order. The estimated propensity score model indicated that factors influencing the choice to provide breast milk were: maternal education, maternal age, SES, marital status and birth order. Non-linearity of the relationship between mother's education and the choice to provide breast milk was apparent. Imposing the common support condition dropped 10 children all of whom had received maternal breast milk and had mothers from the highest class of maternal education who were living with a partner.

<p>All three causal effects might be of interest in this example, but the <italic>ACE</italic><sub><italic>Un</italic></sub> may be the most relevant for informing interventions promoting breastfeeding. In this example, there was some suggestion of a non-linear relationship between propensity score and outcome so the covariate-adjusted method without including an exposure-propensity score interaction is likely to produce biased conclusions. Similarly, the outcome regression model ignoring the suggestion of non-linearity in the exposure effect may produce misleading estimates. The inverse weighting method weighted one subject disproportionately to the rest of the sample and estimates were sensitive to this subject's inclusion. The estimates produced by the covariate-adjusted method rely on the relationship between outcome and propensity score being linear within each exposure group. The similarity between these estimates and those from the other methods suggests that this assumption holds at least approximately.</p>
<p>In this example, all methods lead to fairly similar conclusions, including the fully adjusted regression model, all suggesting a possible positive association between choice to provide maternal breast milk and subsequent IQ. However, it is important to bear in mind the likelihood of unmeasured confounding.</p>

Since only one outcome–exposure association is examined, the analysis and reporting of results is likely to be more focused than from an outcome modelling approach.</p>
<p>It has recently been stated that propensity score methods treat ‘bias as paramount and variance as secondary’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0962280210394483">2</xref></sup> This is based on the observation that the variance of the exposure effect estimated from a propensity score analysis (with an estimated propensity score) will be larger than that from a correctly specified outcome regression model. This has been demonstrated for both the conditional variance (i.e. the variance whilst holding the <italic>X</italic>s fixed)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0962280210394483">2</xref></sup> and the marginal variance (viewing the <italic>X</italic>s as random variables).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0962280210394483">53</xref></sup> Whichever variance is of interest, it is clear that purely on the basis of efficiency, outcome regression will always be preferable. However, if the outcome regression model is incorrectly specified, the exposure effect estimate will be biased. Propensity score methods are often seen as more robust to model misspecification than outcome regression models. Matching and stratification on the propensity score do, indeed, appear to be more robust to the mis-modelling of non-linearities than outcome regression models,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0962280210394483">24</xref></sup> although it is not clear that this property is shared by the other propensity score methods.</p>
<p>An advantage of the propensity score approach is that a key assumption – the balance of covariates – can be easily checked, which provides a certain robustness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0962280210394483">54</xref></sup> Since the propensity score is a means to an end (balance), incorrect modelling does not matter as long as balance is achieved. However, the criteria for declaring covariate balance have not, as yet, been properly defined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0962280210394483">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The randomisation argument for the propensity score approach can be highly persuasive, perhaps too persuasive since there is a tendency to overlook the strong underlying assumption of no unobserved confounders. Balance of observed covariates does not guarantee balance of unobserved covariates. Omitting a confounder from the propensity score model produces biases similar to those produced by omitting a confounder from an outcome regression model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0962280210394483">24</xref></sup> Interactions, similarly, if omitted, can produce bias.</p>
<p>The balancing aspect of propensity scores is, furthermore, a large-sample property. In the absence of unmeasured confounding, propensity scores can be likened to a RCT at each value of the propensity score. Thus, a large sample is needed at each value of the propensity score to achieve balance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0962280210394483">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>A common criticism of outcome regression models concerns insufficient overlap of the multivariate covariate distributions in the exposed and unexposed groups. In this situation, there may be exposed subjects who are intrinsically non-comparable with anyone in the unexposed group. Outcome regression responds to this problem with extrapolation, which may be inappropriate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0962280210394483">22</xref></sup> A histogram of the estimated propensity score in the exposed and unexposed groups would immediately draw attention to the problem and may lead to the valid conclusion that for those subjects it is not possible to estimate the exposure effect and to discard them from the analysis.</p>
<p>When the within-strata causal exposure effects differ, it has been suggested that propensity score stratification is inappropriate since these within-strata effects are meaningless.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0962280210394483">2</xref></sup> However, whilst outcome regression offers the possibility of investigating interaction terms, these are not easily presented or interpreted. Arguably, it would be preferable in both cases to identify subgroups in which the exposure effect is constant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec33-0962280210394483"><title>7.2 Conclusion</title>
<p>In some situations – studying a rare outcome or a rare exposure – there may be clear advantages to modelling the propensity score in preference to the outcome or <italic>vice versa</italic>. At the other extreme, the two approaches sometimes coincide. For example, when all covariates are discrete, stratification on the propensity score produces exactly the same estimate as linear regression, if both the outcome model and the propensity score model contain all possible interaction terms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0962280210394483">2</xref></sup> More generally, there are likely to be advantages to both traditional outcome regression modelling and propensity score methods in most situations, although in practice these two approaches have been found to produce similar conclusions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0962280210394483">55</xref></sup> Combinations of the two approaches have been advocated by many including covariate-adjustment within propensity score strata or matched samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0962280210394483">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0962280210394483">56</xref></sup> and doubly robust inverse-weighting methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0962280210394483">17</xref></sup> The latter are robust to misspecification of either the outcome regression model or the propensity score model.</p>
<p>In the light of our discussions above, we feel that that the key questions for future research with regard to propensity score methods are: improving the estimation of CIs for the propensity score, investigating the use of propensity score methods in generalised and other non-linear models, and establishing a consensus about ‘best practice’ in the use of propensity scores, particularly with regard to assessing balance. A further area that has been little explored is how best to handle missing data in propensity score analyses, although recent studies have begun to address this.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0962280210394483">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0962280210394483">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this article, we have given an intuitive review of the propensity score, addressing potential misunderstandings about the methods based on the propensity score, and in particular their use for estimating the average causal effect, the average causal effect on the exposed and the average causal effect on the unexposed. In practice, calculation and graphical exploration of the propensity score in the exposed and unexposed groups is an invaluable diagnostic tool, whether or not it is formally used in the estimation. Finally, it is important to keep a sense of perspective. In many analyses, biases due to unobserved confounding in observational studies are larger than possible differences between the propensity score methods and traditional outcome regression models.</p>
