<abstract>
<p>Masculine honor has been found to explain the relationship between insults and aggression in the USA. However, detailed accounts of Mediterranean honor cultures suggest that family honor may be more important in explaining cross-cultural differences in aggression. Two studies revealed that people from Turkish honor culture intended to aggress more after being insulted than Dutch people from a nonhonor culture (Study 1), and that this effect was driven by differences in family honor rather than differences in masculine honor (Study 2). We posit that family honor may be a key factor in explaining insult-related aggression in Mediterranean honor cultures.</p>

<p>Insults to honor should be retaliated against quickly and with force. This rule seems to be at the core of what is traditionally called honor culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368430212467475">Henry, 2009</xref>). The central question is of course what exactly constitutes an insult to one’s honor. The hallmark work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368430212467475">Nisbett and Cohen (1996)</xref> showed that masculine honor (i.e., toughness, strength, protecting one’s reputation) plays an essential role in explaining aggressive reactions in the south of the USA. Men from the south were more likely to become more angry, physically aroused, and aggressive when insulted than did men from the north (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368430212467475">Cohen, Bowdle, Nisbett, &amp; Schwarz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368430212467475">Nisbett &amp; Cohen, 1996</xref>). Apart from the USA, the Mediterranean area is also characterized by honor cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368430212467475">Abu-Lughod, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430212467475">Rodriguez Mosquera, Manstead, &amp; Fischer, 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430212467475">2002b</xref>). The fact that masculine honor underlies aggressive behavior in the USA has been taken almost by default as characteristic for honor cultures in other parts of the world. We argue that another aspect of honor, family honor, might be key in predicting insult-related aggression in Mediterranean honor cultures. In this article we reveal that cultural differences in aggressive reactions towards insults between a nonhonor culture and a Mediterranean honor culture—Turkish culture—are not explained by cultural differences in masculine honor but rather by cultural differences in family honor.</p>
<p>“Honor is the value of a person in his own eyes, but also in the eyes of his society” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430212467475">Pitt-Rivers, 1965</xref>, p. 21). Honor codes have been subdivided into four different types of honor concerns; family honor, masculine honor, feminine honor, and social interdependence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430212467475">Rodriguez Mosquera et al., 2002b</xref>). In the present paper we will focus only on family honor and masculine honor. Family honor refers to a concern for the reputation of one’s family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430212467475">Rodriguez Mosquera et al., 2002b</xref>), whereas masculine honor refers to a concern for being able to live up to the standards set for males (e.g., being tough, able to take care of one’s family, produce offspring; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368430212467475">Rodriguez Mosquera, Manstead, &amp; Fischer, 2000</xref>). Honor is not a sentiment in itself, but is closely linked to emotions, such as anger, shame, and pride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1368430212467475">Stewart, 1994</xref>). Having honor is usually associated with pride, whereas losing one’s honor or dishonor is usually associated with shame and anger. It has been shown that the adherence to honor norms can affect emotional reactions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430212467475">Rodriguez Mosquera, Fischer, Manstead, &amp; Zaalberg, 2008</xref>). For instance, people with a strong concern for honor react with more anger after being insulted than people with a weak concern for honor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368430212467475">IJzerman, van Dijk, &amp; Galucci, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies on Turkish honor culture are scarce, focusing mainly on honor killings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430212467475">Navai, 2009</xref>), ethnographic reports (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1368430212467475">Meeker, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368430212467475">Starr, 1978</xref>) or sociological analyses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430212467475">Sev’er, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1368430212467475">UNPF, 2007</xref>). Statistics on violence, though, are clear; showing that Turkey ranks in the top three of countries with the highest homicide rates and violent crimes in the European Union and its aspiring members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430212467475">Eurostat, 2010</xref>). Thus, Turks deal with relatively high rates of physical violence in everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430212467475">Deveci, Acik, &amp; Ayar, 2008</xref>). Western European countries that have Turkish minority groups (such as the Netherlands) struggle with honor-related violence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430212467475">Bakker, 2005</xref>). Although these findings suggest that an honor culture may be prevalent in Turkish communities, very little is known on the relationship between insults and aggression. It has been shown that insults in high honor groups (Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch) motivated verbal disapproval after the experience of shame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430212467475">Rodriguez Mosquera et al., 2008</xref>). However, no link between insults, aggression, and the specific type of honor that potentially mediated these effects was investigated.</p>
<p>There are three reasons that lead us to expect that, in Turkish honor culture, family honor is more important in explaining the relationship between insults and aggression than masculine honor. First, the Turkish language has two terms for honor. <italic>Şeref</italic> (Sharaf in Arabic; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1368430212467475">Stewart, 1994</xref>) is the term for honor associated with (mostly male) esteem, prestige, dignity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368430212467475">Gezik, 2002</xref>), personal honor, courage, bravery, loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368430212467475">Ermers, 2007</xref>), both social and financial status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1368430212467475">Simsek, 2002</xref>), and the ability to support one’s family. <italic>Namus</italic>, also known as sexual honor, is associated with family honor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368430212467475">Gezik, 2002</xref>), public decency, and chastity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1368430212467475">Simsek, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Namus</italic> is a type of honor that reflects on the whole family. If the <italic>namus</italic> or purity of one female family member is threatened, which can be an actual threat but could also be rumors, the honor of the entire family is at stake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368430212467475">Arslan &amp; IJsselmuiden, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1368430212467475">van Eck, 2003</xref>). The protection of <italic>namus</italic> by both women and men is very important because it is impossible to fully restore the <italic>namus</italic> of a family once it is lost. Potential solutions to loss of <italic>namus</italic> include marrying the person who violated the <italic>namus</italic> or for the woman to commit suicide. Even if such measures are taken, the family will be known as <italic>namussuz</italic>: lacking <italic>namus</italic>. It is the responsibility of male family members to protect and restore the <italic>namus</italic> of the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1368430212467475">van Eck, 2003</xref>). So, in the Turkish language there seems to be no direct emphasis on masculine honor, but a very strong emphasis on family honor.</p>
<p>Second, studies in Spain have shown that Mediterranean honor and nonhonor cultures differ in the extent to which they are concerned about family honor but not in the extent to which they are concerned about masculine honor (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430212467475">Rodriguez Mosquera et al., 2002b</xref>). Rooted in ethnographical studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430212467475">Pitt-Rivers, 1954</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430212467475">1965</xref>), these studies focused on differences in values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1368430212467475">Fischer, Manstead, &amp; Rodriguez Mosquera, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368430212467475">Rodriguez Mosquera et al., 2000</xref>), honor concerns, and emotional processes between the honor culture of Spain and a nonhonor culture (i.e., Dutch culture; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430212467475">Rodriguez Mosquera et al., 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430212467475">2002b</xref>). All studies showed that concerns for family honor might be just as important as or even more import than concerns for masculine honor in Mediterranean honor cultures. In particular, family honor mediated the effect between nationality and the experience of shame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430212467475">Rodriguez Mosquera et al., 2002b</xref>). The central unit of social organization is the family, and one’s personal honor is intertwined with the honor of one’s family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430212467475">Moxnes, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430212467475">Rodriguez Mosquera et al., 2002b</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, the extent to which people value masculine honor has been found to hardly vary across cultures. In fact, masculine honor seems to be a pan-cultural idea, not a culture-specific one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1368430212467475">Rodriguez Mosquera, 2011</xref>). This means that cross-cultural differences in reactions to insults cannot be explained by differences in endorsement of masculine honor. As a case in point, Dutch men who value honor highly also act more hostile when insulted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368430212467475">IJzerman et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these three reasons led us to expect that differential reactions to insults in Turkish honor culture—as compared to Dutch nonhonor culture—would be explained by family concerns not by masculine concerns.</p>
<sec id="section1-1368430212467475">
<title>Study 1</title>
<p>This study first established that in Turkish culture people intend to react more aggressively to insults than people from Dutch culture. Therefore, we presented Dutch and Turkish-Dutch with a situation in which someone was insulted and were asked whether they would act aggressively. Because the Turkish-Dutch group is a bicultural group, we included an additional factor in our design. We primed Turkish-Dutch participants with either a Dutch or Turkish context, in order to see whether manipulating the cultural context would also influence the tendency to act aggressively after an insult. In the paradigm of cultural frame switching this technique is used to make one of two cultural frameworks in biculturals more salient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368430212467475">Hong, Morris, Chiu, &amp; Benet-Martinez, 2000</xref>). In effect, when primed with a Turkish context, it can be expected that Turkish-Dutch will act more “Turkish,” when primed with a Dutch context they will act more “Dutch.” We therefore expected Turkish-Dutch primed with a Turkish context to intend to react more aggressively towards the insult than would Dutch and Turkish-Dutch primed with a Dutch context.</p>
<sec id="section2-1368430212467475">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Eighty-six high school students (<italic>M<sub>age</sub></italic> = 13.58, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.44; ♀ = 41) participated voluntarily. Data were collected on three high schools in the Rotterdam area. Consent for the study was obtained from the schools. Adolescents participated during regular school classes. The experiment had three conditions: Dutch primed with a Dutch context (<italic>n</italic> = 25; ♀ = 8), Turkish-Dutch primed with a Dutch context (<italic>n</italic> = 30; ♀ = 17), and Turkish-Dutch primed with a Turkish context (<italic>n</italic> = 31; ♀ = 16).</p>
<p>We first presented participants with a short film clip in which someone was insulted. In the clip we manipulated the cultural context (i.e., cultural prime). Turkish-Dutch saw either Dutch actors speaking in Dutch or Turkish-Dutch actors speaking in Turkish. Dutch saw only the Dutch version. Both versions of the scenario portrayed a young man/woman walking alone on a street (participants were instructed to take the position of the young man/woman; gender of the insulted person was matched with the gender of the participant). Subsequently, another young man bumped into him/her (the insulter), and would say: “Hey Casper/Karin/Ali/Fatma, what are you saying about my girlfriend? Who do you think you are? You will hear from me.” The insulted person reacted in a startled fashion, like (s)he did not know what was going on. Being falsely accused of something can be interpreted as an insult to one’s honor in Turkish culture. Next, participants were instructed to think about how they would react to this. Turkish-Dutch participants were given a Dutch questionnaire in the Dutch prime condition and a Turkish questionnaire in the Turkish prime condition. The questionnaire was translated using a committee approach (the committee was composed of three bilingual experts and the first author). Subsequently, participants indicated to what extent they would want to hit, swear at, or punish the person in the film clip (on 11-point scales; 0 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 10 = <italic>completely</italic>). We computed a composite aggression score from these three items (α = .83).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1368430212467475">
<title>Results</title>
<p>An ANOVA with condition and gender as independent variables and the composite aggression measure as dependent variable revealed a main effect of condition, <italic>F</italic>(2, 85) = 3.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .08. Post hoc Tukey tests indicated that Turkish-Dutch participants primed with a Turkish context (<italic>M</italic> = 5.81, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.90) wanted to react more aggressively than Dutch participants (<italic>M</italic> = 3.79, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.61; <italic>p</italic> = .036). Turkish-Dutch participants primed with a Dutch context scored in between and did not differ significantly from either condition (<italic>M</italic> = 4.57, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.33; <italic>p</italic> = .251 and <italic>p</italic> = .598). Gender did not have a main effect on aggression <italic>F</italic>(1, 85) = 0.02, <italic>p</italic> = .902, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .00, nor an interaction effect with condition on aggression, <italic>F</italic>(2, 85) = 0.22, <italic>p</italic> = .802, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .01.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1368430212467475">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The first study shows that people from a Turkish honor culture want to display more aggression after insults than people from a nonhonor culture. So, in line with findings from the south of the USA, people from the Turkish honor culture are also more likely to aggress after being insulted. Turkish-Dutch placed in a Dutch context showed intermediate levels of aggression. This suggests that the cultural context is important in predicting behavior. It can be assumed that the immediate (cultural) context provides people with norms on how to act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1368430212467475">Yamagishi, Hashimoto, &amp; Schug, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>We did not find any gender differences. Females and males were just as likely to aggress after an insult. This finding could be driven by the fact that we asked participants to what extent they <italic>would want</italic> to aggress instead of <italic>would</italic> aggress, but may also indicate that in predicting aggression after an insult, gender-specific honor codes are not that important, but that mainly the concern for family honor is predictive of aggression.</p>
<p>Because we did not include any measures for honor concerns we cannot conclude that being part of an honor culture or not produces the differences between these groups. Therefore, we included measures for honor concerns in Study 2, in order to ensure that this specific cultural difference is the cause of the effect. In addition, we included a Turkish reference group living in Turkey.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1368430212467475">
<title>Study 2</title>
<p>The main aim of this study was to look at the role of masculine and family honor in the relationship between insults and subsequent aggression in three groups: Dutch, Turkish-Dutch, and Turks. We gave each participant two insult scenarios and asked them how likely it would be that they would aggress. We measured people’s concern for both masculine and family honor. We closely followed the design by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1368430212467475">Vandello, Cohen, and Ransom (2008)</xref>, who studied the link between insults and aggression, and investigated whether norms for aggression existed due to pluralistic ignorance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1368430212467475">Vandello and Cohen (2004)</xref> demonstrated that norms of aggression in the south of the USA perpetuate due to pluralistic ignorance. This means that men falsely believe other men to think that physical aggression is the appropriate response to insults. In order to conform to this “norm” of violence, men might thus act aggressively, even though they do not value it themselves. Due to this misperception, norms for honor-related violence still exist in the south of the USA, whereas the direct functionality of violence has disappeared. We included Vandello and Cohen’s measure for pluralistic ignorance to investigate whether norms of violence in Turkish honor culture perpetuate due to pluralistic ignorance.</p>
<sec id="section6-1368430212467475">
<title>Method</title>
<p>To most closely replicate the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1368430212467475">Vandello et al. (2008)</xref> we only included male participants. Nineteen Dutch, 20 Turkish-Dutch, and 27 Turkish males (<italic>M<sub>age</sub></italic> = 22.38, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.48) participated voluntarily. All samples were community samples. The Dutch data were collected in the south of the Netherlands (Tilburg and Eindhoven), the Turkish data were collected in the west of Turkey (Balikesir province, districts Edremit and Akçay). Dutch and Turkish-Dutch received a Dutch version of the questionnaire. Turks received a Turkish version that was translated using a committee approach (three bilingual experts and the first author). Participants were asked to respond to two scenarios. The first scenario stated that Niels (Mehmet in Turkish-Dutch and Turkish conditions) went to the cinema and another man cut in front of him in line. Niels responded to this and the man insulted him. Niels then hit the other man. The second stated that Kevin (Murat) was eating fries and drinking coke and a guy spilt the coke all over him and did not apologize, subsequently Kevin hit the guy. Both scenarios were based on Study 1 by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1368430212467475">Vandello et al. (2008</xref>; the first scenario is described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1368430212467475">Vandello &amp; Cohen, 2004</xref>, p. 288). After reading each scenario, participants indicated the likelihood that they would also hit the other man (from 0 to 100; aggression measure). In order to assess pluralistic ignorance they also indicated the likelihood that a typical Dutch (Turkish-Dutch or Turkish) male would have also hit the other man (from 0 to 100; measure for peer aggression). Finally, participants responded to items that measured the concern for honor, based on a selection of items developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430212467475">Rodriguez Mosquera et al. (2002b)</xref>. We only used those items that were related to family honor (“If I damage my family’s reputation,” “If my family has a bad reputation,” “If I let others insult my family”; <italic>n</italic> = 3; α = .82) and masculine honor (“If I don’t defend myself when others insult me,” “If I do not have authority over my family,” “If I cannot maintain my family,” “If I am incapable of having children,” “If I’m known as someone who has no authority over my family,” “If I am known as someone who cannot support my family,” “If everybody knows that I am sterile”; <italic>n</italic> = 7; α = .73). Participants were asked to indicate to what extent they would feel uncomfortable with what was stated in the item (<italic>1</italic> = <italic>not uncomfortable at all, 7</italic> = <italic>very uncomfortable</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1368430212467475">1</xref></sup>.

<p>We conducted mediation analyses to investigate whether family honor could explain the relationship between cultural group and aggression. Masculine honor could not function as mediator because masculine honor did not differ between cultural groups. Two dummies were created to represent the three cultural groups; the Dutch group was used as the reference group. We employed a bootstrapping procedure for multicategorical agents with 1,000 bootstrap resamples and 95% confidence intervals (CI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430212467475">Hayes &amp; Preacher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1368430212467475">Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2004</xref>). The analyses revealed that family honor mediated the relationship between cultural group and aggression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1368430212467475">Figure 1</xref>). The indirect effect of family honor was significant for the Turkish group (the CI did not contain 0), indicating that for Turks higher concerns for family honor predicted more aggression after an insult. The Turkish-Dutch group displayed a similar pattern; albeit not significant. To be complete, we also included the mediation analysis for masculine honor. The indirect effect of masculine honor, as could be expected, was not significant<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1368430212467475">3</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Turks reacted more aggressively to insults than did Dutch participants. This cultural difference covaried with the concern for family honor. Turks had higher concerns for family honor, and stated that they would react more aggressively to the insults. Even though masculine honor did predict aggression, it did so for all groups, and thus cannot explain cultural differences in levels of aggression.</p>
<p>As could be expected from a bicultural group, the Turkish-Dutch participants did not differ from Dutch and Turks on both honor measures. For masculine honor there were no differences at all, for family honor Turkish-Dutch scored in between the Dutch and Turks. This finding might indicate that this sample was truly bicultural, endorsing both Dutch and Turkish norms. The question arises of whether we can call this group a culture of honor or even a culture high in honor, as has been done in many studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430212467475">Bakker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368430212467475">Ermers, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430212467475">Rodriguez Mosquera et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430212467475">Shafa, Harinck, Ellemers, &amp; Beersma, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1368430212467475">van Eck, 2003</xref>). In addition, in both our studies Dutch did not differ from Turkish-Dutch primed with a Dutch context (Study 1) and Turkish-Dutch (Study 2) in terms of aggression. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430212467475">Rodriguez Mosquera et al. (2008)</xref> also found no differences between Dutch and Turkish/Moroccan-Dutch on verbal attack after an insult. However, Study 1 showed that Turkish-Dutch primed with a Turkish context, act more like a Turkish sample. So what are the differences in honor and aggression between Dutch and Turkish-Dutch? Maybe, there is not so much a quantitative difference between these groups in the concern for honor, but are concerns for family honor more likely to underlie intentions to aggress, as can be seen from the mediation model.</p>
<p>No cultural differences were found in the discrepancy for own and peer aggression, indicating that pluralistic ignorance might not be an explanation for aggression norms in the Turkish honor culture. This suggests that in Turkish honor culture norms for aggression are still endorsed by its members and not the result of a misperception.</p>

<sec id="section9-1368430212467475">
<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>We found that members of the Turkish honor culture are more likely to aggress after being insulted than are members of a nonhonor culture. The data show that these specific honor and nonhonor cultures differ in the extent to which they endorse family honor, but that they did not differ in the extent to which men endorse masculine honor. Family honor explained the qualitative difference between groups in terms of aggression. It seems that masculine honor indeed leads to more aggression, but that this effect is uniform across groups, and thus cannot explain differences in aggression between groups. This underscores the importance of family honor when studying Mediterranean honor cultures. In sum, both masculine and family honor predict aggression, but only family honor explains cultural differences in aggression.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to two observations. First, we found no gender differences on aggression in Study 1. As mentioned before, the absence of gender differences might be due to the fact that the wording of the aggression measure suggested intended behavior instead of actual behavior. If interpreted as such, it might be the case that both women and men would want to aggress, but that actual aggression is displayed more by men than women. Although counterintuitive, gender differences in aggression under provocation conditions are small or even absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368430212467475">Bettencourt &amp; Miller, 1996</xref>). This finding might indicate that aggression in honor cultures need not be related to gender-specific honor codes or gender-specific insults. The relationship between type of insult and type of honor might not be a one-on-one relationship. As we saw in Study 2, cultural differences in aggression between groups after a threat to male honor, could not be explained by the concern for masculine honor. Furthermore, different types of honor concerns can be highly correlated (see Study 2), and sometimes different types of honor cannot even be distinguished statistically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368430212467475">IJzerman et al., 2007</xref>). Whether the relationship between insult and aggression is explained by a specific type of honor, may be highly dependent on the type of insult and the specific situation. These suggestions however require further study.</p>
<p>Second, please note that we measured intentions for aggression instead of actual aggressive behavior. However, the measurement of self-reported aggression is common (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1368430212467475">Tangney, Wagner, Fletscher, &amp; Gramzow, 1992</xref>), and correlates with findings of actual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368430212467475">Cohen et al., 1996</xref>). One could also argue that we measure norms for aggression instead of intentions to aggress. What people report might actually be influenced by what they think they should report. However, inferring that people only report what they think they should report or are consciously aware of this influence on their report could be erroneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368430212467475">Nisbett &amp; Wilson, 1977</xref>).</p>
<p>The present data imply that any type of insult towards Turks could be interpreted as a threat to one’s family. This would mean that if the family is insulted in a more direct manner, Turks could react even more aggressively. Turkish culture is more interdependent than Dutch culture, which could imply that any type of insult in Turkey is an insult to one’s interdependent self, encompassing both the self and relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430212467475">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>), whereas in the Netherlands, it is an insult to the self only. It could be argued that the differences we find between masculine and family honor are due purely to differences in conceptions of the self.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1368430212467475">5</xref></sup> However, even though family honor could be seen as a form of interdependence, it is a more concrete operationalization of a broad theoretical construct and may thus add predictive value. How family honor and the interdependent self are related requires further study.</p>
<p>We would like to emphasize that none of our findings invalidate what has been shown in the south of the USA. Masculine honor is also predictive of aggression among Dutch and Turkish participants. Our results do indicate that we cannot assume that one honor culture is just like any other honor culture; different psychological mechanisms might be at work. In addition, the codes and norms, that cultures have for the retention and loss of honor differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1368430212467475">Stewart, 1994</xref>), perhaps both between honor cultures, and between honor- and nonhonor cultures.</p>
<p>Turkish-Dutch endorse Turkish culture at home, and Dutch or Turkish culture in public, which makes them an acculturating group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430212467475">Arends-Tóth &amp; van de Vijver, 2007</xref>). Acculturation in a nonhonor culture seems to change the extent to which people adhere to honor concerns and the extent to which they are likely to aggress after being insulted. Although this is an interesting finding, we think this is only one side of the coin for minorities with an honor culture living in a nonhonor culture. Apart from acculturation processes, these minorities run into social situations that are very different from those in honor cultures. For instance, they could be insulted by or in front of ingroup and outgroup members. Being insulted by Dutch might mean something else than being insulted by other Turkish-Dutch; likewise, being insulted in front of Dutch or Turkish-Dutch might require different measures in order to defend one’s honor. These uniquely bicultural aspects of insults might produce different behavioral outcomes, which are important to study because there are large Mediterranean minority groups living in Western countries (e.g., the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and Sweden). Furthermore, people from an honor culture living in a nonhonor culture deal with more than just coming from another cultural background. Turkish-Dutch also have to deal with the fact that they have a minority status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1368430212467475">van Osch &amp; Breugelmans, 2012</xref>). It has been shown that low-status positions could potentially cause honor-related violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368430212467475">Henry, 2009</xref>), which then might prove to have an additive effect. Based on our findings, we believe this is not the case, because Turkish-Dutch did not respond more aggressively than Turks did. Of course, we cannot say whether our samples actively think of themselves as a low-status group, therefore subsequent research is needed.</p>
<p>The concern for family honor explained cross-cultural differences in the relationship between insults and aggression for Turks and Dutch. Masculine honor also predicted aggression, but did so in all cultural groups. Thus, in order to understand cultural differences in aggression a focus on family honor is needed.</p>

<p>We decided to exclude two items of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430212467475">Rodriguez Mosquera et al.’s (2002b)</xref> 9-item scale for masculine honor. Extensive probing by the fourth author who collected the data in Turkey showed that male Turkish respondents were extremely uncomfortable answering questions about “Not yet having had a sexual relationship” and “Having the reputation of being someone without sexual experience.” The questions in themselves could be insulting, if asked by a woman to a man. That is also the reason for why we excluded the item “One’s sister or mother having the reputation of having diverse sexual relations” from the scale for family honor. We performed a factor analysis with all 10 items for masculine and family honor. The factor analysis indicated four factors with an Eigenvalue over 1. The first factor explained 35% of the variance, the second 17%, the third 12%, and the fourth 10%. The scree plot suggested a cut-off after two factors. The pattern matrix revealed that five items of the masculine honor scale loaded on the first factor (between .422 and .895), one of the masculine honor items (“If everybody know that I am sterile”) had a small loading on both factors, the other (“If I am known as someone who cannot support my family”) loaded on the second factor. Exclusion of the two items from the masculine honor scale however reduced the reliability of the scale considerably. Therefore, we decided not to exclude them from the scale. Removing these items from analyses did not alter the outcome of the study in any way. All three family honor items had high negative loadings (between −.817 and −.851) on the second factor.</p>
