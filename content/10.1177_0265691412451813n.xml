<p>Hitherto the more general studies of developments in the Catholic Church from the 1960s have focused on the Second Vatican Council and the theme of <italic>aggiornamento</italic> (renewal, modernization). The present work encapsulates these topics in a study of how a church which was historically centred in Europe and whose leadership had a restricted European mind-set, gradually confronted the realities pertaining to its increasingly world-wide membership. The author has an impressive record of publications on religion, both Christian and Islamic, in Africa. His new work, evidently written from a fairly radical Catholic perspective, is polemical but also scholarly, at least after the first chapter. The latter, on ‘The Legacy of Anti-modernism’ is a piece of sparkling journalism full of illuminating and often pugnacious aphorisms. The arguments of the section on innovatory theological developments before the Council and of the two chapters on the Council itself, which are essential to the book’s argument, are broadly similar to those in John W. O’Malley’s <italic>What Happened at Vatican II? </italic>(2008). What does distinguish Linden’s account of the Council is his emphasis on the Eurocentric mentality of European bishops and on the relatively limited attention given by the assembly to the particular problems of non-European Churches, together with issues of economic justice. The real strength of the book lies in its omnivorous coverage of Catholicism world-wide. Its implicit conclusion seems to be that the pronouncements of Vatican II indeed contained the seeds of more open-minded approaches to the Christian mission in the non-European world and of an engagement with the burning issues of economic justice, but that these seeds were slow to germinate. The notorious <italic>revanche </italic>of the Curial bureaucrats against a council which had escaped their control was one braking factor. On the other hand, the growing extremism of some radical Catholic movements provoked a partial retreat into conservative positions on the part of the hierarchy. The pronouncements of the Council, of successive popes, and of episcopal conferences in various regions emphasized that the Church’s mission was first and foremost to the poor, but did so with caution. Issues of economic justice, which generated the emergence of ‘liberation theology’, indeed, divided Catholic communities in Latin America. The attitude to be taken towards oppressive regimes, often led by <italic>soi-disant</italic> Catholics, and again towards often violent liberation movements, with which many lower clergy and Sisters might well sympathize, were further problematic issues. Linden presents the official emphasis on ‘human rights’ as a minimalist programme which could unite a wide spectrum of Catholic opinion and on which the Church authorities were ultimately led to take stands of principle against increasingly brutal regimes. A recurrent theme is on the role of enterprising unenclosed Sisters in developing the Church’s mission to the poor and oppressed (not least trafficked women and other migrants) and in promoting, through the international networks of female religious orders, wider Catholic understanding of the relevant problems. The position of women in the Church has not corresponded to their vital contribution to its life. The most fascinating chapter relates to ‘inculturation’, that is the adaptation of Catholic practices to native customs and <italic>mores</italic> outside Europe, more particularly in Africa, India and China. Notable cases in point have been ancestor cults in both Africa and China; the 1744 papal condemnation of the Jesuit policy of permitting the celebration of Confucian rites to Chinese Christians and native Malabarese practices to south Indian ones has now been effectively reversed. However, there have been colourful hybrids of Catholic and non-Christian rites which the Church authorities simply could not countenance, while polygamy, towards which African clergy could be sympathetic, has been a painful issue. The Vatican’s maintenance, even in former mission territories, of the principle of clerical celibacy (a heritage of the Latin Church which has not applied to other historic churches in communion with Rome), has caused serious problems; male celibacy runs counter to the ethos of many African societies. The requests of African and Asian bishops for a more flexible approach to the local cultures of their flocks have encountered only limited receptivity on the part of a succession of Popes. For all their reiteration of Vatican II’s watchword of ‘dialogue’ with those outside the Catholic Church and for all their professions of respect for local traditions, the central organs of the Church have shown a striking inability to see the practices of European Catholicism in terms of historical relativity; this has been particularly evident with Benedict XVI.</p>
<p>Among French and Italian Catholic <italic>avant-garde</italic> intellectuals since World War II, there has been a move to reject the identity of Christianity with ‘christendom’ (French <italic>chrétienté</italic>), that is the historic European professing society embodying an alliance between Church and State. Linden’s rich book, with its extra-European perspective, provides a complementary vision.</p>
