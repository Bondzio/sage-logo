<abstract>
<p>Despite recent legislation and regulations to protect homeowners’ rights in the process of urbanization, forced eviction remains one of the most prevalent causes of violence in contemporary China. This article examines the capacity of residents of Chinese cities to protect their property rights using new media to produce alternative discourses on law in the urbanization process. Fieldwork conducted in Beijing from 2007 to 2008, a period during which the national capital underwent massive development schemes for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, shows that homeowners create virtual precedents, backed not by the authority of the court, but by that of the media. Evictees of so-called <italic>dingzihu</italic> (nail-houses) facing <italic>chaiqian</italic> (demolition and relocation) develop arguments based on the 2007 case of Wu Ping, the first new media superstar in (post-)socialist China. The article, following post-structuralist formulations, develops a theory of ‘legal surrealism’ characteristic of the position of law in reform-era China. Whereas social media is equated with revolution elsewhere, in China, the lesson of the role of new media in effecting social change may be one of limitation. While digital mass communication technologies may assist individual ‘victories’, challenges to eviction face both intrinsic and extrinsic obstacles for collective action.</p>

<p>On 9 September 2011, the Supreme People’s Court of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) issued the ‘Urgent Notice on Firmly Guarding Against the Triggering of Vicious Incidents by Land Expropriation and Forced Housing Demolition and Relocation’ (最高人民法院关于坚决防止土地征收，房屋拆迁强制执行引发恶性事件的紧急通知, hereinafter Urgent Notice).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0920203X11436164">1</xref></sup> Within hours of its promulgation on the official website of the Supreme Court, the Urgent Notice was taken down.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0920203X11436164">2</xref></sup> Within the time of its posting however, state news portals had already reported the Urgent Notice. Its sudden disappearance generated a maelstrom of discussion by netizens (网民, 网友)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0920203X11436164">3</xref></sup> on bulletin board systems (BBSs) and micro-blogs. Why had the Urgent Notice, an official judicial document, disappeared or in the language of netizens been ‘harmonized’ (和谐了)?</p>
<p>The Urgent Notice identifies forced evictions as one of the major causes for social violence in China and provides for eight measures calling for courts at all levels to increase their supervision of the administration of land expropriation and <italic>chaiqian</italic> (拆迁), that is, demolition and relocation. In giving official recognition to the severity of <italic>chaiqian</italic>, the Urgent Notice is nothing new, nor is its call for redoubled attention to the various laws, administrative measures, and judicial notices pertaining to the protection of personal property rights. However, the language of the Urgent Notice is striking for its vividness. The Urgent Notice begins:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In recent years, in certain places, land expropriation and forced housing demolition and relocation have triggered vicious incidents time and time again. Some people against whom [forced demolition and relocation] was carried out, incinerated themselves, jumped off buildings to kill themselves, or adopted similarly barbarous measures as resistance. Others ignited gas pipes, splashed oil, and threw rocks among other tactics to thwart enforcement. Others assembled a crowd, besieged, and lashed out at the enforcement personnel, causing mass disturbances. Some security cadres and police of courts inappropriately used weapons resulting in deaths.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Possible explanations for the retraction of the Urgent Notice are its extraordinary candour and concerns about how the public would interpret and reuse the text for reasons other than intended. In an attempt to seal Pandora’s box, the Urgent Notice – initially intended to increase transparency – was censured. The deletion of the Urgent Notice signals that it is not so much the problems attendant to the administration of expropriation that are at issue (state media, the central government, and homeowners all acknowledge them), but, rather, control over their representation that matters.</p>
<p>The ubiquity of language, discourse, and text or ‘the letter’, in China’s legal development, and property rights disputes, in particular, invite a semiotic perspective of law as a ‘system of signs’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0920203X11436164">4</xref></sup> Legal semiotics is most commonly associated with the works of Charles Sanders Peirce, influential in American legal realism. Legal semiotics emphasizes law as composed of communicative signs whose interpretation (via jurisprudence, cases, legal writing, and so on) is inherently one of meaning formation. Ferdinand de Saussure’s structuralism, as premised upon the arbitrariness between the signifier and the signified, has also shaped legal realism and critical legal studies that examine the processes by which ideology is naturalized through law.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0920203X11436164">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The basic premise of this article is that property rights disputes in urbanizing China illuminate the widening gap between law as a signifier and the signifieds of property security and enforceable rights. I examine adversarial signifying practices with respect to ‘rule of law’ (法治) between the party-state and homeowners. Specifically, I document meaning-making practices among poor urban residents, in developing alternative legal consciousness,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0920203X11436164">6</xref></sup> at the intersection between property rights protection and the emergence of ‘new media’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0920203X11436164">7</xref></sup> The protection of property rights has emerged in reform China as not just a criterion of the middle class,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0920203X11436164">8</xref></sup> but also as a lightning rod of class consciousness among the urban poor. Strategies for maintaining rights in the face of development include recourse to formal legal channels, as well as extra-judicial means such as letters and visits, petitions, protest, demonstration, and civil disobedience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0920203X11436164">9</xref></sup> Additionally, residents resort to cyberprotest by documenting their eviction and struggles with local housing authorities and developers, resulting in online discourse about the legal process.</p>
<p>The experiences of those facing <italic>chaiqian</italic>, called <italic>chaiqianhu</italic> (拆迁户) and especially the holdout <italic>dingzihu</italic> (nail-houses 钉子户),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0920203X11436164">10</xref></sup> reveal adaptive thinking about the legal system that is viewed, by some, as morally bankrupt. Based upon fieldwork conducted in Beijing from 2007 to 2008, a period during which the capital underwent massive development schemes for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, the experimental thesis put forth here is that homeowners use new media to create virtual precedents, backed not by the authority of the court, but by that of the media. Alongside offline signs at protest sites, such online sign-making appropriates Party discourse to confront officials with the emptiness of their own signs. <italic>Dingzihu</italic> develop arguments based on the 2007 case of Wu Ping, the first new media superstar in (post-)socialist China. By juxtaposing property rights protection and new media, I argue, following post-structuralist formulations, that alternative legal knowledge production practices suggest that the position of law in China is one of legal surrealism.</p>
<p>Before proceeding to the argument, caveats and assumptions require elaboration. One, the article proceeds by describing several ethnographically informed case studies. While they cannot claim to represent all evictees, the cases merit attention for their representation of <italic>dingzihu</italic>. At the outset, I acknowledge that this discussion pertains to a certain set of claimants (those most marginalized by the law) whose dispute is of a specific nature (challenges to eviction orders as especially nettlesome to municipal governments) using a particular type of data (case studies) with all accompanying limitations. Two, as for the efficacy of new media to expose local corruption between housing authorities and developers being greater than that of legal recourse, the argument assumes that local officials may more likely rectify malfeasance for fear of the consequences of exposure by the former as the latter is more subject to Party intervention. Three and related, new media is less prone to manipulation as the citizen is a producer, although officials also produce new media.</p>
<sec id="section1-0920203X11436164">
<title>The praxis of Chinese law</title>
<p>An understanding of the operation of the Chinese legal system has been elusive to foreign observers. The earliest influential treatments of modern Chinese law assumed a systems perspective in assessing the criteria of legal modernization by looking at legal institutions via an implicitly comparativist perspective. The main debate was over the nature of an illiberal rule of law.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0920203X11436164">11</xref></sup> In past years, the study of Chinese law has shifted the perspective to that of law and society. The question is not whether China has rule of law, but what does law mean to its claimants? These scholars have inverted state-centric paradigms to consider the operation of law from the demand side.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0920203X11436164">12</xref></sup> In <italic>Engaging the Law in China</italic>, for example, the authors ask how those members of Chinese society at the margin develop rights consciousness and what strategies they use to advance those interests. The edited volume stands for the proposition that ‘rights talk’ derives its legitimacy and efficacy from official institutions and that the law matters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0920203X11436164">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recently, scholars have invoked constructivist theories to comprehend the relationship between law and power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0920203X11436164">14</xref></sup> These studies point to the idea that aspects of lived reality are themselves a construct of state programmes and that law plays a role in designing the social life of the citizen, as legal subject, as well as the organs of the state as law-giver. While the use of constructivist theory holds much promise for the analysis of rule of law in China and specifically for an interrogation of the role of ‘popularizing the law’ (<italic>pufa</italic> 普法), the party-state’s discourse on legal consciousness, such theories have been criticized as anti-humanistic and casting the legal subject as an affect of civilizing projects. There is little space for possibilities of alternative legal consciousness or counter-<italic>pufa</italic>. Social critic Jean Baudrillard’s notion of simulacra as copies (of images, signs, etc.) without originals has similarly been interpreted as the triumph of surface over depth or the negation of agency.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0920203X11436164">15</xref></sup> Baudrillard observes the simulacrum overtaking ‘reality’, that is, the party-state’s construction of such. The image as simulacrum ‘masks the absence of a profound reality; it has no relation to any reality whatever. It is its own pure simulacrum.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0920203X11436164">16</xref></sup> The production of simulacra is most often the privilege of the powerful (e.g. advertisers, governments). The underprivileged may also make simulacra as a technique of resistance, yet in doing so, they may only be reifying meaningless signs, that is, only adding to the chain of signifiers with no ‘way out’.</p>
<p>Legal surrealism<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0920203X11436164">17</xref></sup> is defined as a process comprised of the following: (1) a yawning gap between law’s promise and social reality; (2) the production of discourse on law to fill that gap; and (3) most vitally, as (1) increases and (2) with it, the relationship between discourse and practice becomes one of radical discontinuity such that ‘law talk’ is severed from law’s operation. In semiotic terms, the signifier detaches from the signified, to the point where signifier supersedes signified, creating new signs and inverting relationships between law-producer and law-consumer. Baudrillard summarizes this third step as the ‘precession of simulacra’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0920203X11436164">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Official discourse on the law is inherently an order of signs and as such becomes first-order simulacra. Whereas the intended goal of the party-state is to communicate to the people the importance of the rule of law through such signs, law talk is hindered from effectuating law by myriad factors. Scholars have identified these causes as the absence of judicial independence, discoordination between central and local governments, poor implementation, and a want of a tradition of private rights, and so on. While these obstacles impede the rule of law, more often than not, the majority view assumes that the laws are written well but only lack enforcement. In other words, the assumption is that <italic>law is doing what it says it is doing</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0920203X11436164">19</xref></sup> However, in urbanizing China, because property law encodes pro-development policy, such law talk mystifies the violence that perpetuates state authority especially in the context of land grabs.</p>
<p>In the case of China, while the state propaganda apparatus produces orthodox legal consciousness or <italic>pufa</italic> that masks public law’s monopoly on violence, the omnipresence of cyberspace suggests that practices that produce a counter-<italic>pufa</italic> may deconstruct state orthodoxy. Netizens selectively adopt the party-state’s first-order simulacra, thus producing second-order simulacra, grounded in popular views of morality. Homeowners’ use of official, hyperreal discourse on virtual rights through new media<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0920203X11436164">20</xref></sup> is expressed as simulation overriding reality. Despite China’s Internet surveillance regime, popular blogging has the capacity to leapfrog official discussions on conflict.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0920203X11436164">21</xref></sup> According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, of 77 major news events in 2009, netizens broke 23 stories, many of which involved official corruption that were not initially covered in traditional media.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0920203X11436164">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>A vignette helps demonstrate legal surrealism, in snapshot view. At a news-stand in a train station in northwest China, I thought I had found one of the government’s mouthpieces for <italic>pufa</italic>. The weekly newspaper <italic>Eye on the Law</italic> (法制新观察) enjoys wide circulation in China. Underneath the masthead, the newspaper reads in bold: ‘Collecting the essence of the legal system, popularizing legal knowledge, broadcasting the spirit of the legal garden.’ Thinking the newspaper was a publication of the company that produces the news programme of the same name, which teaches law through televised investigations, I opened to an article entitled ‘Climax: One must depend on self-mastery’. The newspaper’s contents reveal stories of evil mistresses and vindictive wives, as well as personal ads and photos of barely clad women. The stories, recounted in vivid detail, are often couched in terms of marriage law and end with vague assertions of justice. The newspaper company uses the official rhetoric of the party-state, emptied of much of its signification, for commercial profit through smut. Legal surrealism is not relegated to capitalist enterprise (nor to traditional media), and finds a fuller manifestation in the form of new media in property rights defence.</p>
<p>My commitments to legal surrealism derive from my own experience with the real estate industry in Beijing. From 2007 to 2008, I divided my time between working in the Beijing office of a real estate law firm and visiting with homeowners facing <italic>chaiqian</italic> in areas of central Beijing undergoing development projects for the Olympics. The practice of real estate law in a law firm, providing services to multinational investment entities, is night and day from low-income residents’ conflicts with real estate developers and the municipal government. While the data gathered for this article comes from my time spent with homeowners, my knowledge of Chinese real estate law is also influenced by my work in the law firm. My schizophrenic approach marks a return to the common origins of ethnography and surrealism, the realm of ‘unexpected juxtapositions’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0920203X11436164">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>To study alternative legal discourse in homeowners’ defence of their property rights, I developed a two-pronged approach to capture both online and offline behaviour.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0920203X11436164">24</xref></sup> I began by conducting open-ended interviews with homeowners.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0920203X11436164">25</xref></sup> These conversations were supplemented by interviews with bloggers and former judges in Beijing who adjudicated <italic>chaiqian</italic> cases. During site visits to homes, I would usually spend time in the homes or, if the homes were under surveillance, we would meet in nearby locations. I also participated in blogging communities that discussed <italic>chaiqian</italic>. Thus, I tacked back and forth between online and offline activities. The view that emerged is that a protest site can also be a site of knowledge production. I read this process as a type of precedent-building not unlike how case law is invoked in social movements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0920203X11436164">26</xref></sup> Rights-claiming through new media, however, encounters impediments. Unlike elsewhere where social media is equated with revolution, the lesson of new media in social change in China may be one of limitation. That is, while alternative discourse production can support individual ‘victories’, the very nature of the disputes may frustrate collective action.</p>

<title>Virtual rights and real-life violence in Olympic Beijing</title>
<p>Unlike the 1950s, when vast tracts of land were claimed by the state for the purpose of communization, in the reform period, property is expropriated for development by operation of law. Instances of land expropriation (征收) or ‘takings’ have become increasingly common to fulfil the party-state’s efforts to construct the new urban China. The 2004 Constitution provides for the power of eminent domain: the state may ‘for the needs of the public interest, expropriate or requisition land, and pay compensation in accordance with the law’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0920203X11436164">27</xref></sup> Homeowners are entitled to compensation amounts based on their use rights and ownership of fixtures on the land. In Beijing, development commonly begins when the state requisitions collectively owned land and converts land previously classified for agricultural use into construction use. According to the 2001 Regulations on Administration of Urban Housing Demolition and Removal (hereafter <italic>Chaiqian</italic> Regulations), the dismantling parties had to apply for a Certificate of Approval of Demolition and Relocation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0920203X11436164">28</xref></sup> Government authorities issued announcements of demolition,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0920203X11436164">29</xref></sup> existing fixtures were demolished, and dismantling parties and homeowners<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0920203X11436164">30</xref></sup> executed agreements that provided the terms of compensation and resettlement.</p>
<p>In the event a dispute arises out of the procedure of <italic>chaiqian</italic>, parties could initiate actions through administrative channels and, subsequently, through the courts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0920203X11436164">Figure 1</xref>). If homeowners refused to move after they had entered into agreements with dismantling parties, the dismantling parties could file for arbitration (phase 2). If such ruling was unsatisfactory, the dismantling parties could bring a lawsuit at district-level courts (phase 5). During the pendency of arbitration, the dismantling parties could apply for courts’ advance enforcement (先予执行) of the agreements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0920203X11436164">31</xref></sup> This procedure has been subject to manipulation as a kind of fast track that avoids due process of law. It has allowed dismantling parties to demolish homes even before an arbitrator gets to hear the case and removes the basis for appeal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0920203X11436164">32</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>If the parties fail to reach an agreement on compensation and resettlement, the municipal government will render rulings upon application of the parties. If the parties find the rulings to be unsatisfactory, they may resort to the courts. If the homeowners do not move out before the end of the period as provided in the rulings, they may be subject to forced demolition (强制拆迁) (phase 6). Under this procedure, the relevant department of the people’s government forcibly removes the homeowners or the administrative department of demolition and relocation applies to the people’s court to enforce the ruling.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0920203X11436164">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>In terms of measuring compensation, Art. 23 of the <italic>Chaiqian</italic> Regulations allowed for two types of compensation: monetary compensation and exchange of titles of buildings. Monetary compensation, the more commonly disputed option, is appraised on the basis of factors such as location, use of land, and floor area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0920203X11436164">34</xref></sup> A 2003 circular by the MOC<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0920203X11436164">35</xref></sup> further specifies that the appraisal of urban houses to be demolished is based upon the real estate market price of the house.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0920203X11436164">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reform of the real estate industry continues to lag due to two interrelated sources: corruption in the industry and a lack of regulatory oversight. The real estate industry is marked by ‘government-business collusion’ (官商勾结). The transfer of land use rights by grant is the wellspring of much of the corruption in the industry with hefty gains to be made by municipal governments, corrupt officials, and developers. The most common practice is for land bureaus to sell land use rights to developers via free or below-market transfer agreements and then receive kickbacks from profits generated from the land.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0920203X11436164">37</xref></sup> On 13 July 2006, Beijing Deputy Mayor Liu Zhihua, responsible for the urban construction planning and management of state-owned land specifically used for sporting venues, was arrested under charges of corruption and a decadent lifestyle and was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0920203X11436164">38</xref></sup> Likewise, the head of Haidian District, Zhou Liangluo, was arrested in April 2007, on multiple charges of illegal real estate deals and received the same sentence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0920203X11436164">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is the presence of rampant corruption and collusion between local government and real estate developers which widens the gap between law as code and law in action. In assessing the Constitution’s takings clause, the definition of ‘public interest’ (公共利益) and the measurement of compensation are loopholes. While there is a general understanding that ‘public interest’ refers to matters of health, sanitation, and security that benefit the public, private commercial development is increasingly regarded as synonymous with public interest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0920203X11436164">40</xref></sup> A former judge of Chongwen District People’s Court complained that public interest is not often the subject of litigation because, under the <italic>Chaiqian</italic> Regulations, there is a legal presumption for public interest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0920203X11436164">41</xref></sup></p>

<title>Wu Ping and the making of a new media superstar</title>
<p>In early 2007, the blogosphere was electrified by the case of Wu Ping in Chongqing who became the first nationally renowned <italic>dingzihu</italic> under the <italic>nom de guerre</italic> ‘toughest nail-house in history’ (历史最牛钉子户). Although not the first <italic>dingzihu</italic>, Wu Ping’s case was sensational for the reason that her celebrity grew in tandem with that of her blogger double. In the years leading up to the Olympics, the party-state mobilized multiform propaganda instruments including banners, billboards, advertisements, TV, cartoons, and the Internet to create ‘modern’ urban ethics and legal consciousness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0920203X11436164">42</xref></sup> Yet, within this harmony ideology, bloggers and <italic>dingzihu</italic> forged discursive links between official rhetoric, legislative debates at the national level, and stories of eviction at the local level.</p>
<p>The facts of Wu Ping’s case are well known.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0920203X11436164">43</xref></sup> Wu Ping and her husband Yang Wu were locked in a three-year standoff with the government of Jiulongpo District in Chongqing City as well as real estate development companies over the fate of their property in the course of an old and dilapidated housing renewal (危房改造) (hereafter <italic>weigai</italic>) project. The property at the centre of the controversy was the couple’s two-storey building. The disagreement was over the amount of compensation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0920203X11436164">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>The parties tried several means of resolving the dispute including negotiation, then mediation, and finally, the developers’ petitioning to the district real estate bureau which resulted in an administrative ruling, upheld by the district court in 2007, requiring Wu Ping to move within three days.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0920203X11436164">45</xref></sup> During this period, Wu Ping stood outside the gates erected around her building, brandishing a copy of the Constitution, with a growing crowd of onlookers. In her comments, she analogized her case to the contentious passing of the Property Law, on 16 March 2007 (but not effective until 1 October 2007) and the protection of private property rights. She threatened to sue the developers. Yang Wu, on 21 March, climbed over the barriers surrounding his building, raised a PRC flag, and draped a scroll over the side of the building, quoting the Constitution: ‘The citizens’ legal private property rights must not be violated!’ (公民的合法私有财产不受侵犯).</p>
<p>It was at this point in the stalemate when, on 28 March 2007, an unemployed vegetable seller and blogger from Hunan Province, named Zhou Shuguang (blogger name Zola), travelled to Chongqing to report on a <italic>dingzihu</italic> story circulating in the blogosphere. Zola began interviewing residents, taking photographs, and writing commentary. Many of Zola’s pictures were the most circulated among blogsites, and because of his initiative, he has been acclaimed as ‘citizen journalist’ (公民记者).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0920203X11436164">46</xref></sup> It was only after Zola’s reporting that traditional media, such as <italic>Southern Metropolis Daily</italic> (南方都市报), picked up the story. In March, Chinese news portals were saturated with Wu Ping coverage. The image of the <italic>dingzihu</italic> came to symbolize rights protection in urbanizing China (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0920203X11436164">Figure 2</xref>). Zola’s reportage on Wu Ping demonstrates the new media’s vanguard role in the production of knowledge on dispute and law.</p>

<p>Further, the blogosphere discourse had a determinative effect on the outcome of Wu Ping’s case. In a kind of feedback loop between state media, <italic>dingzihu</italic>, and the blogosphere, Wu Ping manipulated larger debates stemming from the Property Law and her arguments were given voice first in the blogosphere and then the mainstream news portals. Wu Ping’s stance on <italic>chaiqian</italic> violating her private property rights gained resonance when imbued with the legitimacy of these larger debates. Thus, Wu Ping became a ‘protest entrepreneur’ by shaping the frame of justice,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0920203X11436164">47</xref></sup> that is, judicial institutions receded into the background as new media became the venue for her claim. The blogosphere reified these arguments forcing the media’s spotlight on Wu Ping. Through this accumulative pressure, on 2 April 2007, an agreement was reached. For Zola, fame has shown its double edge. Whereas his name recognition in the blogosphere is unprecedented, authorities have since restricted both his online and offline activities.</p>

<title>Razing homes and building precedents</title>
<p>In the lead-up to the Olympics, Beijing was a city of cranes. The party-state sought to erect a modern mega-metropolis for China’s world showcase. Rents skyrocketed as the capital experienced a kind of real estate mania.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0920203X11436164">48</xref></sup> The government pledged US$14 billion to build sports complexes and refurbish the Beijing infrastructure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0920203X11436164">49</xref></sup> In addition to land that was cleared for these specifically nominated Olympic projects, luxury apartments and high-end hotels were built, many of which lay half-completed after the Games.</p>
<p>The government demolished whole neighbourhoods, some of which were 700 years old, to build ‘New Beijing, Great Olympics’ (新北京，新奥运). This process began before the preparation for the Olympics. From 1990 to 2003, alleyways (<italic>hutong</italic> 胡同) were destroyed under a municipal redevelopment plan or <italic>weigai</italic>, during which over 500,000 residents were evicted, mostly the urban poor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0920203X11436164">50</xref></sup> Under the aegis of the Olympics, countless development projects were started in the city affecting not just <italic>hutong</italic> residents but also those living in low-income housing built in the 1960s. Many residents, including those in <italic>hutong</italic> and all renters, do not have use rights. Exemplary of the transitional nature of China’s property regime, in some instances, the work unit still holds use rights and evictees felt no property claim to their subsidized housing and were content to move. In other cases, particularly those of mixed-use property, homeowners possessed use rights and fought to defend them. Initially, the city offered residents the option of trading their home for a high-rise apartment unit on Beijing’s periphery, often past the fifth ring road, 15 kilometres from downtown. When the city government encountered resistance to relocation, it offered cash settlements although compensation was a chronic problem. The symbol of <italic>chai</italic> (destroy) painted in white on buildings planned for demolition was the key symbol of the city’s transformation, the grapheme of modernity via destruction<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0920203X11436164">51</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0920203X11436164">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Urban residents, facing heightened pressure to relocate under hectic development schemes, acquired both legal knowledge and mobilization tactics from the case of Wu Ping. Homeowners sought redress both online and offline after encountering only frustration in the legal system. Homeowners utilized a variety of media forms – home videos, blogging, SMS texting – to build public opinion. Most of the homeowners discussed their case, both online and offline, in terms of property rights based on a notion of justice that transcended that of the official legal system. The following cases exemplify patterns illustrating varying approaches to mobilizing new media while defending property rights.</p>
<sec id="section5-0920203X11436164">
<title>The ‘rule of law’ approach: The case of Wang Shiguang</title>
<p>I met Wang Shiguang online on a discussion board before I met him in person. His comments demonstrated a technical knowledge of <italic>chaiqian</italic> and a devotion to property rights protection. I sought a meeting. ‘Not everyone can afford to be as visible as Wu Ping’, said the man frenetically text-messaging two cellphones simultaneously, one in each palm, the first time we met. He explained that he uses different cellphones to communicate with different people and to avoid monitoring. Wang Shiguang lived in the area of southwestern Beijing called Dazhalan. Born in 1958, Wang Shiguang spent his life on Meishi Street. He opened his own restaurant in 1991 on Meishi Street on property his father had purchased in 1954. In a pattern repeated throughout Beijing, during the Cultural Revolution, the building was taken over by the Ministry of Housing and was given back at the end of the Cultural Revolution. However, Wang received only the Certificate for Real Estate Ownership and not the Certificate for State Land Use Rights, which provides the legal basis for compensation. Further, he was returned only 64 m<sup>2</sup> and not the full 97 m<sup>2</sup>. Although Wang repeatedly petitioned relevant municipal departments, he was denied the Certificate for State Land Use Rights.</p>
<p>On 7 December 2004, notices went up for the demolition of Meishi Street to widen the street and <italic>chaiqian</italic> began. Wang studied the laws, went to bookstores, and talked to friends. Wang opposed the destruction of his property on grounds that (1) the estimate of the size of his property was insufficient; (2) the amount of compensation offered by the developer was likewise inadequate; and (3) his property should have been valued as of the date of demolition, but the appraisal was made based on the 2001 market value which ignores the dramatic increase over the ensuing years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0920203X11436164">52</xref></sup> Wang Shiguang was offered a cash settlement – a ‘bribe’ in his words – of RMB 1,500,000 that he rejected claiming that market value of his building, according to Circular No. 234, was RMB 3,600,000.</p>
<p>On 13 May 2005, the developers applied for and received an administrative ruling to remove Wang, based on the 68.8 m<sup>2</sup> figure. Wang applied for administrative reconsideration and lost. At this point, Wang resorted to extra-legal measures while pursuing his claim in official channels. As to the former, Wang hung a couplet on his gate posts that read: ‘The National Bureau of Land Resources is unreasonable in the issue of demolition and relocation. The court has stepped aside on the issue of demolition and relocation.’ He later draped his building in red banners on which he had written provisions of the <italic>Chaiqian</italic> Regulations. He further wrote articles of relevant laws on his walls. His building became a kind of literalized legal obstacle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0920203X11436164">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Along with the crowd that formed daily before his restaurant, reporters showed up but they could not report on the demonstration because the government had stipulated that such controversies could not be covered. In September 2005, Wang’s story was picked up by a media non-profit organization with whose help he started to video life in the state of exception. The organization, further, began writing about Wang’s case in its BBS that discusses legal questions arising from cases of residents.</p>
<p>As to recourse to formal channels, he filed a suit against the district-level construction commission in Xuanwu District Court on 10 October 2005. Wang lost and his property was razed on 14 March 2006, via forced demolition. Wang then appealed first to the intermediate and then the Supreme People’s Court of Beijing which upheld the lower court’s decision. Wang filed a total of 13 suits comprised of different claims against multiple parties.</p>
<p>Homeless and without a means of income, Wang stepped up his Internet campaign. In recounting his experience, only when he described his extra-legal efforts would his posture change from one signalling deflation to one of activism. In January 2007, he began blogging about his case. He opened multiple blogs after the first was shut down. He posted the official documents used in his case including adjudicative rulings, court decisions, and text of statutes and regulations. His readership consisted of other <italic>chaiqianhu</italic>, bloggers,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0920203X11436164">53</xref></sup> reporters, and even the district government. Importantly, he provided commentary at each stage of his campaign, documenting advice he accrued from talking with officials, residents, and bloggers. His goal in blogging is what he calls rights protection (维权), by telling of his experience, sharing legal resources, and talking strategy, but as a ‘little expert’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0920203X11436164">54</xref></sup> he would not cross a certain line. He would neither meet with other residents facing <italic>chaiqian</italic> nor correspond directly with them. In a typical blog entry, Wang writes:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>8 November 2007. I went to the police station outside the Beijing City Public Security Bureau Western District Branch Office to handle the material for petitioning. I was then charged with the crime of ‘throwing a public place into disorder’ (扰乱公共场所秩序), according to Beijing Public Security Bureau administrative punishment decision no. 5 (2007).</p>
<p>2 December 2007. I went to Xuanwu District reconsideration organ to submit an administrative reconsideration. During the time of reconsideration, a Dazhalan policeman [name deleted] and others used computer software to forge the evidence.</p>
<p>9 January 2008. I wrote a letter and submitted it to the Xuanwu District reconsideration organ leader in which I pointed out that on 8 November 2007, at 9:00 p.m., I signed a written pledge at the Dazhalan police station which should prove the events of that day. But I don’t know why the Dazhalan police station, in the process of submitting the evidence, failed to show that written pledge.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By the spring of 2007, Wang observed more netizens responding to his Internet presence, following the tidal wave of attention generated by Wu Ping’s case. The outcome of his case was that he was awarded relocation of 97 m<sup>2</sup> on Meishi Street, and after the Olympics, a new restaurant, a Certificate of State Land Use Rights, and reparations. Nonetheless, no formal recognition of this outcome was made by the court system as the courts, according to Wang Shiguang, were afraid of setting a precedent. As to the reason for his success, Wang believes it was not through law that he won, but because of his insistence on law and its institutions and his use of the rhetoric of those who promote rule of law.</p>

<title>The ‘rule of man’ approach: The case of Xu Rui</title>
<p>Bicycling down a major avenue in Beijing’s Xicheng District, I saw a roadside stall festooned with PRC flags, images of CCP leadership, and a banner admonishing, ‘We certainly must harmonize!’ (我们一定要和谐). Neighbours were well acquainted with the <italic>dingzihu</italic> and I soon met Xu Rui. Every time I met Xu Rui it was in a different location in her neighbourhood: first in the rear of small, smoky dumpling restaurant, next in a cramped alcohol and tobacco store that constantly showed Korean soap operas, and later in a spicy soup restaurant. She had long-standing relationships with members of her neighbourhood; it formed a network that she drew upon for support in challenging her eviction order. She tended to view her contest through human relationships, whether with her neighbours, the developers, PRC leaders, or even myself. It was through human relationships she understood force, loyalty, corruption, and law. Even before she knew I was American, Xu Rui began wearing a small US presidential pin on her lapel during our meetings, given to her by a reporter from the United States, as her case had attracted the attention of foreign reporters. She consumed new media accounts of Wu Ping, using computers owned by her neighbours. She spoke of Wu Ping as an older sister (大姐) and concluded that international media attention had enabled Wu Ping to defend her property. While much of her energy was directed at attracting international coverage, after acquiring such attention, in meetings she was stone-faced as she was constantly reminded of surveillance by the police cars and vans parked outside her property 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>Her home and store were in the Dianmen area. While her home faced the main avenue, the neighbourhood to which she belonged began along a side street approximately 100 metres south of her property. During an urban renewal project, of 30 homes in the affected area, she held out for more compensation. Fourteen people lived in her home. Under a co-ownership agreement, she and her three brothers and their families all lived together. The redevelopment project commenced in May 2005, and was to be completed two years later. Categorized as a <italic>weigai</italic> project, the programme included a restoration of Ming-era walls. The dispute began with a series of no less than 30 negotiations that failed to arrive at a figure for compensation. The housing administration of Xicheng District presented Xu with a take-it-or-leave-it offer to relocate to a nearby property along with compensation of RMB 1,600, but she refused. On 5 June 2008, she was given notice to move out. When she stood firm, the housing administration sought an administrative ruling which was awarded to them on 11 June. She said she sought administrative reconsideration, but felt <italic>chaiqian</italic> was imminent since, according to the Beijing Measures, Art. 16, the developers could forcibly remove her through forced demolition at any time. Still, after the administrative ruling was upheld in administrative reconsideration, she sued on 18 June, but only as a third party, which under the Civil Procedure Law, Art. 56, has fewer rights. The neighbourhood committee had already sued the management office in charge of the project, thus foreclosing her claim. Her claims were the following: (1) the size of the area to be compensated should be 200 m<sup>2</sup>, the original floor area of her building of which the appraisers only included the storefront (37.10 m<sup>2</sup>); (2) the amount of compensation should be based on the current market price (RMB 100,000) not the appraisal price of RMB 8,540, based on the appraisal conducted 31 May 2005;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0920203X11436164">55</xref></sup> and (3) the appraiser selected by the developer is not a neutral party but both have former officials who worked together under the same district government.</p>
<p>Xu utilized several strategies, both offline and online, to advance her claims when her experience with the courts were frustrated. She began by studying the law. She later obtained the assistance of a former Beijing Bureau of Land Administration official who, although not trained as a lawyer, assists <italic>chaiqianhu</italic>. She sent petitions to the municipal and central government leaders. She also conducted research on blogs and networked with foreign reporters. A directive in the months leading up to the Olympic Games prohibiting Chinese journalists from reporting on <italic>dingzihu</italic> only increased activity in the blogosphere. As part of her campaign, she further covered her storefront with patriotic images and banners that caught the eye of passers-by, including my own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0920203X11436164">Figure 5</xref>). In private, she repeated a statement popularized on blogsites, ‘In illegal and savage forced relocation, demolition is the flag of the Chinese Communist Party; relocation is the foundation of the PRC’ (违法野蛮强迁，拆，拆的是中国共产党的党旗；迁，迁的是共和国大厦的基石).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0920203X11436164">56</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>Less than a month before the opening ceremony of the Olympics, Xu began a text message campaign to alert her network of imminent demolition. Onlookers gathered despite the fact that Xu’s residence had been under surveillance for over a month. Nine days later, at 3 a.m., her home was destroyed under an order by the Xicheng District Court for forced <italic>chaiqian</italic>.</p>
<p>The blogosphere’s response to Xu’s case was mixed. Many netizens supported Xu and even posted the phone number of the demolition company. But overall, bloggers demonstrated more cynicism than in earlier <italic>dingzihu</italic> cases. Netizens criticized Xu for demanding more money when her brothers had already accepted compensation packages and then moved in with her to increase the household population to demand more compensation. By neither benefiting from on-site reportage by a citizen journalist in the case of Wu Ping nor directly establishing her own presence in cyberspace as did Wang Shiguang, Xu failed to register her claim with the blogosphere as domain of public morality.</p>

<title>Talking back to the law</title>
<p>In this section, I attempt to make sense of the two cases and the approaches they present in light of their experiences with formal and informal mechanisms. The two cases illustrate divergent attempts to model behaviour on that of Wu Ping and, in turn, create precedents for other homeowners. This process of case-building, lodged in the dispute resolution forum of new media, takes place outside the juridico-complex but is never fully divorced from it. Instead, the homeowners’ invocation of property rights borrows from official discourse and the precedent of Wu Ping.</p>
<p>The attraction of a figure such as Wu Ping to homeowners facing eviction is that she was able to break the party-state’s monopoly on the interpretation of the law and its drawing the line between legitimate and illegitimate violence. She was able to do this by building arguments of private property protection based less on the letter of the law and more on popular, official, and academic discourse on the Property Law. These hyperreal arguments were disseminated through her collaboration with Zola and other citizen journalists, netizens, and traditional media. In the end, the outcome of the ‘precedent’ she established is difficult to repeat as she benefited from voluminous media discussion about the passing of national legislation that was 12 years in the making.</p>
<p>The two Beijing <italic>chaiqian</italic> cases illustrate direct, yet divergent, lines as compared to Wu Ping’s case. Both Wang Shiguang and Xu Rui and other homeowners I visited in the months leading up to the Olympics, encountering roadblocks in formal procedures, borrowed the party-state’s language about substantive rights (first-order simulacra) and further developed their own discourse (second-order simulacra) through new media and offline proclamations (e.g. banners, signs, posters, and flags). Although both initially sought relief through administrative and judicial measures, because of the close alignment of local government and developer interests and the absence of oversight, Wang and Xu, following Wu Ping, developed their cases through new media.</p>
<p>However, as any good jurists would, Wang and Xu distinguished their cases. There are several ways in which they differ from Wu Ping. Wang Shiguang recognized the merits and shortcomings of Wu Ping’s approach. Wang saw that Wu Ping’s case was singular because her suit was with the developers directly, as opposed to the municipal government, and the passage of the Property Law was unrepeatable. As a consequence, Wang’s initial strategy proceeded along different lines from the Chongqing case. Unlike Wu Ping, he repeatedly sought relief through the district-level courts but it was less a faith in the formal system than a belief that legal, dogged persistence would attract attention to his case. Over the period of his stand-off, however, he came, much like Wu Ping, to resort to informal means including more traditional protest activities as well as cyberprotest in the new media. For the former, he inscribed his home in the letter of law. In doing so, he was using his property to hold a mirror – without the cracks – up to the lawmakers. In terms of the latter, following Wu Ping, Wang sought out selective alliances with media outlets and created his own blog to educate himself and others facing <italic>chaiqian</italic>. Thus, blogging, SMS texting, and other communication technologies allowed him to not only build his own case but also popularize his experience to others.</p>
<p>As opposed to Wang Shiguang’s persistent pragmatism, Xu Rui took a more idealized and personalized view of Wu Ping. Yet this idealization of prominent figures, including leaders of the party-state and the US president, was also central to her strategy. As opposed to Wang’s strategy of metonymizing the rule of law, Xu decorated her building with images of Party leaders in a plea to the ‘rule of man’ which has a longer history in China than law. As such, she was circumventing the formal legal system to appeal directly to those in power, a move predicated upon a logic of double admission (people’s and officials’) of the system’s flaws. Procedurally, supplication to rulers is a well-established tradition in China and has taken such forms as the letters and visits and petitioning systems. However, where the two cases draw the sharpest contrast is in Xu Rui’s failure to attain a presence on the Internet cognizable by netizens, that is, she failed to become a ‘producer’. Although the outcomes of the cases differed, these cases illustrate a broader pattern towards great citizen-based action based on publicly held, virtually produced morals.</p>
<p>It may no longer be that extra-legal channels gain legitimacy in the shadow of the law, but, rather, the law that exists in the umbra of the simulacrum. The course of a <italic>dingzihu</italic> challenge goes through an arc of formal to informal channels. Thus, in accordance with prevailing theories in the law and society literature, homeowners ground their claims in ‘rightful resistance’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0920203X11436164">57</xref></sup> or ‘authenticating strategies’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0920203X11436164">58</xref></sup> but their experience is often one of ‘informed disenchantment’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0920203X11436164">59</xref></sup> The question posed by <italic>dingzihu</italic> is ‘what then?’ O’Brien and Li’s theory includes the notion of ‘boundary-spanning claims’ which blur the distinction between transgressive and contained protest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0920203X11436164">60</xref></sup> While evictees’ actions demonstrate some degree of simultaneity in lodging claims in official and unofficial fora, the course of a homeowner’s protest may gain more traction online than through courts. Thus, ‘rightful resistance’ does not go far enough, as evidenced by housing disputes. This view still privileges the state (i.e., sovereign) as a law producer instead of recognizing the productive capacity of netizens to ‘make law’. While homeowners invoke the rhetoric and commitments of the party-state to curb excess power, in resorting to new media forms, they shuffle off authorized channels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0920203X11436164">61</xref></sup> In certain disputes, law talk has come to mean more than law. Under legal surrealism, distinctions between unlawful violence and legitimized force are erased not just by the activity of netizens but by the malfeasance of the party-state and its agents. The <italic>chaiqian</italic> procedure itself is riddled with unlawful violence orchestrated by developers, demolition companies, and their thugs.</p>
<p>For instance, in the Dongshuaifu <italic>hutong</italic> near Wangfujing Street of Beijing, 500 households were removed for constructing additions to the nearby Xiehe Hospital. Over a period of several weeks, I visited one resident, Lao Bian, who was offered a sum that was 11.9 per cent of the market value for compensation for his home. He had lost his arm building railroads around Beijing and lamented, ‘I didn’t get compensation for my arm. And I haven’t gotten the right amount for my home. This is the heart of Beijing, this is the political, cultural, historical heart. All my friends are here. My memories are here. How do they give compensation for that?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0920203X11436164">62</xref></sup> He spent nearly a year in his house with the ceiling caved in, due to the demolition around him, and without electricity or water. Nearby, another resident alleged that her house was attacked by men hired by the demolition company who threw bricks through her window injuring her 80-year-old grandmother. These men also shot a bullet through the window of a third resident’s family restaurant. While the overall tactic of residents at Dongshuaifu was to hold out as long as possible for more compensation, a former judge who heard many <italic>chaiqian</italic> cases reported that one man in Chongwen District of Beijing was so distressed that he resorted to self-immolation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0920203X11436164">63</xref></sup> Self-immolation is the last resort of some <italic>dingzihu</italic>, but several cases have gained instant notoriety nationwide through the Internet. One of the most disturbing cases occurred on 10 September 2010, when three people in Yihuang County of Fuzhou City, Jiangxi Province burned themselves on their roof to protest the forced demolition of their home, when their electricity was shut off. First reported on by bloggers, the local authorities initially ruled that the fire was an accident, and that the <italic>chaiqian</italic> was legal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0920203X11436164">64</xref></sup> After public outcry, subsequently, the Party secretary and governor were removed. Intimidation, harassment, bodily injury, and denial of utilities delegitimize the distinctions the party-state is trying to construct between lawful and unlawful violence.</p>
<p>Despite the charisma of many <italic>dingzihu</italic>, it is helpful to step back from their subjective accounts to assess the degree to which they were legally wronged as opposed to their getting the law wrong. Many homeowners I encountered held so strongly to a ‘folk’ belief in the law that this clouded their reading of the law. For example, Wang Shiguang’s property was destroyed in (what officials framed as) a road-widening project, which was not technically expropriation, thus he was not offered the option of relocation and was initially given a cash settlement, although Wang argued otherwise. Conversely, others had a devoutly formalistic view of law, taking the law at its word, and a devotion to documents. Hua Xinmin, a woman who has fought the Beijing government for two decades to get compensation for the Cultural Revolution-era taking of her family’s estate or ‘administered rented house’ (经租房), in the Dongcheng District, is a well-known case among Beijing <italic>chaiqianhu</italic>. She argues that her possession of her family estate’s 1951 landownership certificate entitles her to inheritance of the property.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0920203X11436164">65</xref></sup> Unfortunately, the government rarely honours these documents, instead viewing them as legal fiction. Elsewhere, however, <italic>dingzihu</italic> highlight the fissure between requirements of law and their lived experience. Below market compensation, as in the cases of Xu Rui and Lao Bing, is the most poignant violation of law.</p>
<p>In response to the prevalence of violent encounters following <italic>chaiqian</italic>, the government has responded both by holding individual officials accountable and by introducing more laws. The 2001 <italic>Chaiqian</italic> Regulations ran afoul of the Property Law, but were not updated until January 2011, when the State Council promulgated the Regulations for Expropriation and Compensation for Houses on State-owned Land (国有土地上房屋征收与补偿条例, hereinafter Expropriation Regulations). Drafting of the Expropriation Regulations began in 2007, but was stalled by local governments whose main source of revenue in the reform era has been land sales.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0920203X11436164">66</xref></sup> The Expropriation Regulations sought to reallocate power between local governments and local Party units which had heretofore clashed over <italic>chaiqian</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0920203X11436164">67</xref></sup> Thus, the drafting of the Expropriation Regulations generated unprecedented debate, and the result was one of compromise. The Expropriation Regulations impose greater constraints on the administrative action of expropriation, including defining public interest, standardizing the expropriation process, guaranteeing due process, and requiring that compensation be according to market value. While the Expropriation Regulations mark an advancement of this area of legal reform, the issues left unaddressed are: the regulations apply only to state-owned (i.e. urban) land and not collectively owned (i.e. rural or suburban) land that is often subject to takings, and forced <italic>chaiqian</italic> remains lawful.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0920203X11436164">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most homeowners facing eviction, however, take a dim view of new regulations, and continue to rely on an assortment of protest techniques, of which law may be one. Nonetheless, virtual precedents produced by non-lawyer members of society, such as homeowners, encounter several difficulties in terms of providing a basis for social movements. I will mention three such obstacles. The first is the atomizing procedure of demolition and relocation and the nature of such claimants as owners of nail-houses. The caricature of the nail-house, as seen in newspaper cartoons and Internet images, is of a dilapidated shack atop a spike of earth in the middle of an urban crater. Often, the development process is resisted by one or two physically isolated holdouts. Even where there are a handful of homeowners resisting eviction, such as at the Dongshuaifu <italic>hutong</italic>, the <italic>chaiqian</italic> procedure, in both its unlawful violence and legal aspects, works to keep them apart and suppress collective action. For example, homeowners at Dongshuaifu said that the developer would visit each house individually using an analogy of a cake with a finite amount of compensation so if one homeowner helps neighbours get more, then she gets less. Further, no homeowner I talked to, including a woman who had been a commercial lawyer for seven years and was being evicted, considered a class action suit (集团诉讼) likely for some of the reasons Xu Rui encountered. Lastly, collective action is further impeded by the homeowners’ own interests. Their goal is to maximize their compensation package, rather than to build and share knowledge to the benefit of others.</p>
<p>A second perceived obstacle is the ‘digital divide’ which, according to conventional understanding, prevents the disadvantaged from gaining access to information communication technologies. While new media users demonstrate certain demographic disproportions,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0920203X11436164">69</xref></sup> China boasts a penetration rate of the Internet of 28.9 per cent, a percentage higher than the world average.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0920203X11436164">70</xref></sup> In 2008, 26 per cent of Internet users had a monthly salary of less than RMB 500, and in 2009, 10 per cent had no income at all.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0920203X11436164">71</xref></sup> Low-income homeowners have a number of ways to access new media. These include using cheap Internet cafes, having younger friends or relatives blog and post, and even printing out blogs and posting them on propaganda boards.</p>
<p>Related, a third obstacle is reliance on Internet technology itself. Google’s exit from the Chinese Internet market in March 2010 signals that China’s Internet evolution is following a trajectory different from that advocated by many Western experts who equate the Internet with ‘cheap speech’ and which thus brings about a fundamental shift between markets and freedom, leading teleologically to democracy. While the absence of Google has a limited impact on netizens building virtual precedents as the material is primarily domestic, Google’s departure may be the first of many such incidents which, collectively, will cast a shadow over the possibility of populist legal reform.</p>

<title>The end of the sign</title>
<p>In reform-era China, both cyberspace and real property are undergoing a transition from commons to privatization via the tropes of closure, harmony, and modernity. At the same time, netizens, bloggers, citizen journalists, and <italic>dingzihu</italic> are generating networks of support and alternative knowledge production. New media are not the sole pressure external to the legal system that is shaping how the Chinese think and talk about law. However, its effectiveness derives from its combining technology, rhetoric on law, and a capacity to redefine the legal subject by modelling itself on Internet precedents. The picture of a legal system that is estranged from many of its citizens and which continues to generate claims at odds with the experience of evictees, in the case of property disputes, suggests the surreal.</p>
<p>Homeowners as netizens appropriate the signs of ‘rule of law’, re-signed as fairness and justice rather than pro-market development. These new signs are used to frame stories about the ends of law. An exchange of signs with the state ensues and the form it takes is not just documents, registries, and memos, but their digitized doppelgängers – blogs, tweets, and photos – as well as evocative offline images, banners, and scrolls. When this exchange does not produce a homeowner’s desired outcome, one of three things happens. One, they increase their production of signs on- and offline, and a critical mass of discourse, if consonant with public opinion, can generate the quantity of attention needed to affect a case. Two, signifying leads only to ever-multiplying simulacra and homeowners eject themselves from the endless chain of signification, accept compensation, and abandon the property. Third, the <italic>dingzihu</italic> stops challenging power by symbolic confrontation and exits the cycle of exchange by committing suicide.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0920203X11436164">72</xref></sup> Property ownership becomes so closely linked to personhood that the homeowner inaugurates death to avoid the precedent destruction of the home.</p>

<p>New media, or social media, include electronic bulletin boards, blogs, text messaging, video, twitter or micro-blogging, and mobile telephony. New media are different from traditional media in that the former are digital and operate, to a greater extent than the latter, through networks, allowing greater participation.
