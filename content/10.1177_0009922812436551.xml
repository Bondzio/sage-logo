<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the past 2 decades, methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) infections have undergone an epidemiologic shift from that of primarily hospital acquired (HA) to community acquired (CA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812436551">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812436551">2</xref></sup> Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) infections occur in otherwise healthy individuals and are susceptible to numerous antibiotics to which HA strains are routinely resistant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812436551">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812436551">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Data on the epidemiology of MRSA in children is limited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812436551">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812436551"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812436551">7</xref></sup> particularly comparing the strains associated with HA-MRSA and CA-MRSA infections. CA-MRSA can be distinguished from HA-MRSA by molecular typing, antibiotic resistance profiles, sites of infection, or affected patients. The UCLA Healthcare Clinical Microbiology Laboratory receives pediatric specimens from inpatients at the Mattel Children’s Hospital and Santa Monica UCLA Medical Center and Orthopedic Hospital, as well as from patients seen by community physicians and physician groups affiliated with the UCLA Healthcare System. We aimed to investigate the epidemiology of MRSA causing skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in the pediatric population by retrospectively examining a large sample of <italic>S aureus</italic> isolates from our institution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0009922812436551" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This retrospective study examined computerized microbiology laboratory records for all SSTIs that yielded <italic>S aureus</italic> from patients aged 0 to 18 years, between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2010 using an institutional review board approved protocol. For the purposes of this study, SSTIs were defined as those with a specimen source labeled as skin, abscess, and wound. Data on the total number of culture requests for these specimen types were not available, and so the number of cultures from these specimen types with any bacterial growth was used as a surrogate for calculating the total number of wound specimens cultured. Data analysis was performed using WHONET 5.5 (World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland). <italic>S aureus</italic> isolated from the same patient within a 30-day period were excluded as replicates. Available data from the database included age, sex, date of culture, source of culture, and antibiotic minimum inhibitory concentrations. CA-MRSA were defined as those isolated from a specimen collected in the emergency department or an outpatient clinic/ community physician office. Isolates from specimens collected from hospital inpatients were considered HA.</p>
<p>Isolates were identified by the microbiology laboratory as <italic>S aureus</italic> using standard methods. Both oxacillin and cefoxitin were used to detect methicillin resistance; susceptibility to these agents and other antimicrobials was performed using broth microdilution following the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. A minimum inhibitory concentration value of 4 µg/mL or greater for oxacillin, and 8 µg/mL or greater for cefoxitin, was interpreted as resistance. When discordant results were obtained, a commercial latex agglutination test, which detects the altered penicillin-binding protein 2a (Oxoid Inc, Ogdensburg, NY) was performed.</p>
<p>Two by two contingency tables were used to calculate the odds ratio, χ<sup>2</sup> tests of association, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Linear regression was used to gauge trends in the proportion of <italic>S aureus</italic> in SST cultures and the proportion of MRSA among <italic>S aureus</italic> by calendar year. All calculations were performed using Microsoft Excel. A <italic>P</italic> value of less than .05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.</p>
</sec>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Between 2001 and 2010, the Microbiology Laboratory reported 3372 positive SST cultures in pediatric patients. <italic>S aureus</italic> was isolated from 1119 (33.2%) of these specimens. When evaluated against the denominator of total number of positive cultures, we observed increased isolation of <italic>S aureus</italic> over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812436551">Figure 1A</xref>), with an average increase of 3.3% per year (95% CI = 3.1-3.5, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = .92). In each year of the study, the majority of positive SST cultures that contained <italic>S aureus</italic> were among outpatients (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001, χ<sup>2</sup> test, data not shown). Overall, outpatients were more than 7 times more likely to have <italic>S aureus</italic> in their positive SST cultures than were inpatients (odds ratio = 7.12, 95% CI = 5.92-8.56, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001, χ<sup>2</sup> test; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812436551">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>In total, 449 (40.1%) of all pediatric <italic>S aureus</italic> SST cultures were MRSA. The percentage of MRSA among <italic>S aureus</italic> in SST cultures peaked in 2005 at 49% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812436551">Figure 1B</xref>). After 2005, an average decrease of 3.4% per year was observed in the proportion of <italic>S aureus</italic> that were MRSA (95% CI = 3.0% to 3.9%, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = .85, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001, χ<sup>2</sup> test). This decreasing trend in MRSA was also noted among outpatient SST specimens, where MRSA rates among <italic>S aureus</italic> peaked between 2004 and 2007, at an average of 47.8% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812436551">Figure 1C</xref>), and decreased to an average of 38.8% between 2008 and 2010. In contrast, the proportion of MRSA among <italic>S aureus</italic> from inpatient SST cultures varied independently of time (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = .2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812436551">Figure 1C</xref>). In each year of the study, with the exceptions of 2002 and 2003, a greater proportion of outpatient cultures yielded MRSA than did inpatient cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812436551">Figure 1C</xref>). Overall, outpatients were significantly more likely than inpatients to have MRSA isolated from a culture-positive SST specimen (odds ratio = 4.3, 95% CI = 3.3-5.6, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001, χ<sup>2</sup> test; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812436551">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>More SST specimens with bacterial growth were noted among outpatients over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812436551">Figure 1D</xref>), with an average of 22 additional positive cultures per year among outpatients (95% CI = 21.1-24.9%, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = .73). In contrast, a decrease in the number of inpatient cultures was noted over this time period (<italic>m</italic> = −10.4, 95% CI = 9.3-11.6, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = .80; <italic>P</italic> = .01, χ<sup>2</sup> test).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> infections remain one of the most common and virulent bacterial diseases acquired in the community.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812436551">8</xref></sup> Antibiotic resistance has long been a problem with <italic>S aureus</italic>, with MRSA emerging in hospitals shortly after the introduction of methicillin, almost half a century ago.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812436551">5</xref></sup> The recent rise in CA-MRSA strains has seemed inexorable whereas the incidence of HA-MRSA has fluctuated in recent years. This difference may relate to heightened infection control practices in hospitals across the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812436551">6</xref></sup> The data presented herein demonstrate that although <italic>S aureus</italic> remains a very common pathogen in SSTIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812436551">Figure 1A</xref>), a 3.4% annual overall decline in methicillin resistance among <italic>S aureus</italic> isolated from pediatric SSTs was noted between 2006 and 2010 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812436551">Figure 1B</xref>). It would appear that the driving force of this change is a decrease in outpatient MRSA, which decreased by 2.0% per year, whereas no trend in MRSA over time could be identified among inpatients (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = .2). One reason for this phenomenon could be heightened awareness of MRSA infections in the community in recent years. Following the emergence of CA-MRSA and increased awareness to its presence, there has been a strong push toward decreased use of the semisynthetic penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins as the drugs of choice for SSTIs in the community,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812436551">5</xref></sup> accompanied by a corresponding increased use of clindamycin and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812436551">3</xref></sup> These changes may have relieved selective pressure for CA-MRSA, and allowed methicillin-susceptible strains to regain a foothold as causes of community acquired skin and skin-structure infections. This increased awareness of <italic>S aureus</italic> SST infections among community clinicians may be indicated by our data that demonstrate a significant increase in the total number of outpatient SST cultures with bacterial growth, whereas a stark decrease in SST cultures was noted among inpatients over this same time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812436551">Figure 1D</xref>). Regardless of this difference, pediatric outpatients were still found to be 7 times more likely to have <italic>S aureus</italic> and more than 3 times more likely to have MRSA isolated from SST specimens than were inpatients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812436551">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Limitations of our study include the use of patient location to define HA and CA strains. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions for CA-MRSA include isolation within 72 hours of hospitalization from a patient with no history of hospitalization, surgery, dialysis, or residence in a long-term care facility within 1 year of the MRSA culture date and no known prior positive culture for MRSA. Although our criteria meet the 72-hour requirement, we did not confirm whether patients had prior health care associations. A second limitation of this study is the use of total number of SST cultures with bacterial growth as a surrogate for the total number of cultures performed. Both limitations may bias our data toward an overrepresentation of total percentage of community MRSA in SST and total percentage of cultures with MRSA, respectively. However, the key finding of this study, that is the decline in MRSA since 2007, remains in spite of these assumptions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812436551">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>The epidemiology of community MRSA is very heterogeneous, in that geographical differences exist in both the predominant clones and overall frequency of isolation. Since SSTIs are the most common clinical syndrome for all CA-MRSA, this study serves as a sentinel for all community pediatric MRSA infections. As we are limited to report our isolated observation, it becomes clear that a prospective antibiotic resistance surveillance system is highly desirable to track changes in the epidemiology of SA in real time. Accurate surveillance is crucial to the recognition of emerging resistance trends and to guide empirical antibiotic selection.</p>
