<abstract>
<p>The effect of negative pressure therapy (NPT; The ABThera™ Open Abdomen Negative Pressure Therapy System, KCI USA, Inc., San Antonio, TX) on the integrity of small intestinal anastomoses was evaluated using in situ burst strength testing in a domestic pig model. In each of 3 swine, 8 anastomoses were created, 4 using sutures and 4 using staples. After 24 hours of continuous NPT, each anastomosis was subjected to burst strength testing in situ. Mean ratios of burst strength of sutured anastomoses to baseline intraluminal pressure were 9.0 to 10.9. Stapled anastomoses had significantly lower burst strength than sutured anastomoses, but mean values were still at least 4.6 times greater than baseline. No differences were seen between anastomoses that were located in close proximity with treatment and those remotely placed or when measured with negative pressure on or off at burst assessment. NPT had no acute adverse effect on intestinal anastomoses in swine.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Penetrating abdominal trauma remains a very grave problem in the United States. The strategy followed in many penetrating trauma cases is often a staged approach involving laparotomy, or damage control surgery, that focuses on the most critical acute concerns, including hemorrhage and intestinal perforation, which have the highest likelihood of mortality. Subsequent treatment is confounded because of the inability to close the abdomen definitively as a result of massive visceral edema.</p>
<p>Temporary abdominal closures (TACs) using negative pressure (NP) have been increasingly used for the treatment of the open abdomen (OA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350611418254">1</xref></sup> Recent applications of the NP therapy (NPT) TAC for clinical conditions has shown tremendous promise in decreasing morbidity and/or mortality, as demonstrated in trauma patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611418254">2</xref></sup> and in a swine model of sepsis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350611418254">3</xref></sup> However, the impact of NPT on the integrity of bowel anastomoses has not been evaluated.</p>
<p>Burst strength testing is a method commonly used to measure the integrity of intestinal anastomoses. Failure of gastrointestinal (GI) healing can be measured by determining the maximum intraluminal pressure (ILP) achievable when inflating the anastomosed intestinal segment to disruption. This method has been used to evaluate both handsewn suturing and stapling techniques on intestinal anastomoses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611418254">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611418254"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611418254"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350611418254"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350611418254"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350611418254">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Gastrointestinal anastomoses are weakest during the first 2 to 3 days of the wound healing process, where bursting pressure can be 50% of normal in small bowel anastomoses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611418254">4</xref></sup> Thus, in this preclinical study, intestinal anastomoses closed with either sutures or staples were exposed continuously to the NPT TAC for 24 hours at −125 mm Hg and then burst strength was tested in situ, with and without NP actively applied at the time of burst strength assessment. These burst strengths were compared with a baseline intestinal ILP.</p>

<title>Surgical Procedure</title>
<p>Three healthy domestic female swine (<italic>Sus scrofa</italic>; Genetiporc, Inc., Alexandria, MN) weighing 25 to 35 kg were sedated with ketamine (15-25 mg/kg, intramuscular [IM]), atropine (0.03-0.05 mg/kg, IM), and xylazine (2-3 mg/kg, IM), intubated, and maintained under anesthesia with ketamine (7.2 mg/kg/h) plus pentobarbital (6 mg/kg/h mg/mL) diluted in saline. Buprenorphine (0.03-0.05 mg/kg, IM) was administered for analgesia every 6 to 10 hours throughout the procedure. Animals were kept warm throughout the experiment using blankets and/or warming units as necessary and were positioned in dorsal recumbency. Animals were monitored for electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, body temperature, heart rate, respiration rate, blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, and mean), and tidal volume. Arterial or venous blood samples were obtained to evaluate blood gas and electrolyte parameters.</p>
<p>A midline laparotomy was performed, the bladder exteriorized, and a Foley catheter inserted into the bladder for urine drainage. A purse string suture was placed around the exit site and the bladder returned to the peritoneum. A catheter was placed through the stomach wall for gas decompression and a purse string suture placed around the catheter insertion site to secure the catheter.</p>
<p>Isolated sections of small intestine from each swine (n = 3) were transected in 8 locations (approximately 10 cm apart) and reanastomosed using either a simple continuous suture technique with 4-0 Prolene (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ; n = 4) or staples (n = 4) using Tyco Healthcare GIA and TA series directional stapling technology, respectively (United States Surgical, Norwalk, CT). Intestinal tissue with 4 anastomotic sites (2 sutured and 2 stapled) were placed back into the abdomen below the surface (designated “remote”) whereas the other 4 sites (2 sutured and 2 stapled) remained close to the surface (designated “direct contact”) being in direct contact with the visceral protective layer (VPL) of the NPT dressing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350611418254">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Treatment</title>
<p>Negative pressure therapy (ABThera<sup>TM</sup> Open Abdomen Negative Pressure Therapy System, KCI USA, Inc., San Antonio, TX) was applied to the open abdomen (n = 3 swine). The “direct contact” anastomotic sites were anchored with sutures in direct contact with the overlying dressing, after which NP was applied continuously at −125 mm Hg (refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350611418254">Table 1</xref>). Two additional swine received no anastomoses or NP treatment and were used to determine baseline intestinal ILPs. Bupivicaine (40-80 mg, IM, distributed in 1-2 mL wheals along the incision) was given during abdominal closure. The incisions were closed in layers with appropriate suture and the skin closed with staples. Animals were maintained under general anesthesia for 24 hours, after which the abdomen was reopened and the dressing was removed to conduct burst strength testing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1553350611418254">
<title>Burst Strength Evaluation In Situ</title>
<p>Burst strength was used as a surrogate marker to measure intestinal anastomotic integrity. After 24 hours of NP treatment to the abdomen, each intestinal anastomotic site was isolated and ligated proximally and distally using 2 square knots of umbilical tape in preparation for burst strength testing. A catheter was then inserted into the proximal end of the isolated segment, secured with surgical suture to create a watertight seal, and allowed to exit the abdominal cavity. New dressing was then applied without NP. Half of the stapled and half of the sutured anastomotic sites in each location (remote and direct contact) had NP applied (−125 mm Hg; refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350611418254">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Each intestinal segment (a total of 24 individual segments) was tested separately. A syringe was attached to one section of a glass Y-connector, and a pressure transducer (Millar Instruments Inc., Houston, TX) was threaded into the other segment of the Y-connector. Prior to the start of saline infusion, all of the air was removed from the intestinal segment and the catheter then prefilled with saline. A solution containing 1 part saline and 1 part contrast medium (ISOVUE Multipack-370; Bracco Diagnostics, Inc., Princeton, NJ) was infused manually in a stepwise fashion, using increments and recording ILP using an ADI Powerlab System (ADInstruments, Inc., Colorado Springs, CO). The analysis was concluded when either there was at least a 10% drop in recorded ILP or ILP remained relatively unchanged or unresponsive to volume increased over a period of approximately 2 to 5 minutes. A fluoroscope (GE OEC Medical Systems, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) was used to monitor and confirm evidence of leakage or burst during the infusion of the diluted contrast solution. Following burst strength testing, animals were euthanized via overdose of intravenous pentobarbital.</p>
<p>For the measurement of ILP in untreated, nonanastomosed intestine, a midline laparotomy was performed to expose the small intestine for the placement of 2 pressure catheters to monitor the pressure (one segment in contact with the abdominal incision and one segment positioned away from the abdominal incision). Pressure was monitored for approximately 1 hour with the laparotomy open. The NPT dressing with VPL was then applied (NP OFF) to the abdominal incision (with the proximal ileum segment sutured to be in contact with the dressing) and again pressure was monitored for approximately 1 hour. Finally, NP was turned on and pressure was monitored for another hour.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1553350611418254">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>Burst strength values were paired as (sutured, stapled) by each anastomosis, each animal, dressing location and NP on/off. Paired difference data of burst strength between the sutured anastomoses and stapled anastomoses were used for statistical analyses. A paired-difference <italic>t</italic> test or a Wilcoxon signed-rank test was conducted according to the normality of the data using SAS software release 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC), and <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant.</p>
<p>Normality of the distribution of paired difference data was examined by the Shapiro–Wilk test. The sample size for this study was very small (n = 3 paired observations for each comparison and total n = 12 paired observations for all the comparisons). Since 3 observations are too few to test the distribution of data, all paired observations (n = 12) were used for the test of normality of the data.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1553350611418254" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Burst strength appeared to correlate with visual fluoroscopic evidence of leakage at individual anastomotic sites using contrast media and fluoroscopy. No visible fluoroscopic evidence of leakage was apparent at any site at pressures below the burst strength value. The last pressure observed prior to failure was considered to be the burst strength value for each respective test. When NPT was applied continuously for 24 hours at −125 mm Hg to the peritoneum of animals with intestinal anastomoses, individual anastomotic burst strength values ranged between 64 and 202 mm Hg and between 46 and 110 mm Hg for sutured and stapled sites, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1553350611418254">Table 2</xref>), among all bowel segments with or without NPT applied during testing.</p>

<p>Intestinal burst strength values in treated anastomosed animals were compared with a mean conservatively determined baseline ILP obtained from untreated, nonanastomosed animals, calculated as the mean ILP value (3.4) + 3 standard deviations (3.06 × 3 = 9.18) = 12.58, based on n = 60 recorded values in 2 animals over an approximately 3-hour period (data not shown). To assess relative strength of treated anastomotic sites to the baseline ILP, the ratios of burst strength values normalized to baseline ILP are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350611418254">Figure 1</xref> according to location of each anastomotic site, whether burst strength was measured with NP ON or NP OFF, and the type of anastomotic closure. Mean ratios ranged between 10.4 to 10.9 (direct contact) and 9.0 to 9.3 (remote) for sutured sites, and between 4.6 to 6.1 (direct contact) and 5.7 to 6.9 (remote) for stapled sites among all bowel segments regardless of whether NP was applied at the time of testing. Similar ratios were seen for anastomoses with NP OFF versus NP ON. Mean values ranged between 9.0 and 10.4 for sutured anastomoses with NP ON and between 9.3 and 10.9 for NP OFF. For stapled sites, mean values ranged between 6.0 and 6.1 for NP ON and between 4.6 and 5.7 for NP OFF. Even though the sample sizes were relatively small, statistically (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) lower burst strength values were observed for stapled anastomoses compared with sutured anastomoses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350611418254">Figure 1</xref>); however, even the lowest mean ratio observed among stapled groups was still at least 4.6 times greater than the baseline value ILP.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Burst strength and leakage are 2 methods used to measure the integrity of intestinal anastomoses. Although there is general correlation between the 2 techniques, in this study burst strength measurements were more reliable in detecting failure; no visible fluoroscopic leakage could be detected at any site at pressures below the burst strength value. It is known that radiological evaluation of anastomoses is subject to high false-negative rates as well as substantial interobserver variability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350611418254">10</xref></sup> Consequently, we relied solely on in situ burst strength testing for this study. The method used to measure burst strength is not entirely novel, since a similar approach was used by others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350611418254">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350611418254">12</xref></sup> the main difference being that these investigators instilled a colored dye solution whereas we employed a solution containing contrast medium for radiological evaluation. The use of 12.58 mm Hg as the calculated baseline ILP is admittedly conservative. Pandolfino et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350611418254">13</xref></sup> have reported that normal intragastric pressure is less than 7 mm Hg in healthy human patients. Our actual ILP values for untreated, nonanastomosed intestine (n = 60) ranged between 0.0174 and 11.52 mm Hg, with a mean of 3.4 mm Hg, which is within the range reported for rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350611418254">14</xref></sup> The mean ratios of burst strength divided by a conservatively calculated baseline ILP of 12.58 (3.4 + 3 standard deviations) demonstrated that anastomotic sites in direct contact with the VPL of the dressing under NP (a worst case scenario) were not compromised any more than anastomotic sites that were not in direct contact (remote), the latter being the usual clinical practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350611418254">15</xref></sup> These results demonstrate that there is no additional risk when an anastomotic site is in direct contact with VPL of the NPT dressing. In addition, when NP was actively applied during the actual burst strength testing (NP ON), burst strength values were comparable to values when NP was not applied (NP OFF), further suggesting that NPT does not appear to compromise the anastomotic sites.</p>
<p>Thompson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611418254">4</xref></sup> showed that GI healing had the greatest risk of failure during the initial inflammatory “lag phase,” when collagenase activity is greatest. NPT has been previously shown to attenuate peritoneal inflammation as measured by cytokine levels in ascites and blood in a septic porcine model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350611418254">3</xref></sup> In the current study, we addressed the issue of mechanical failure of fresh intestinal anastomosis in a nonseptic porcine model. Baker et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350611418254">16</xref></sup> described mechanical deficiencies in the anastomosis and tissue ischemia as the 2 major sources for leaks at staple lines in GI operations, with the vast majority of leaks being noted within the first 2 days. We focused on the initial 24-hour period to examine the acute effect of NPT on anastomoses sooner after they were made, because of maintaining the animals on a continuous and prolonged application of general anesthesia. When NPT was applied for 24 hours to porcine intestinal anastomoses, mean burst strength values ranged between 113 and 137 mm Hg for sutured anastomotic sites. These values coincide well with results from ex vivo testing using inflation with methylene blue solution of 30 human colon anastomosis segments reported by Schwab et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611418254">5</xref></sup> where a mean burst strength value of 122 mm Hg was reported for hand-sutured anastomoses. These same investigators showed no significant difference in burst strength between hand-sutured and stapled anastomoses (mean = 122 mm Hg), yet they did show that leakage was observed at lower pressures (88 mm Hg for stapled sites and 83 mm Hg for sutured sites). One reason why these investigators may have seen this difference is that they did not wait long enough between pressure increments during the burst testing phase. In our study, we waited to see if there was a subsequent pressure drop prior to adding more fluid volume and hence pressure.</p>
<p>Our results consistently showed significantly lower burst strength values for stapled anastomotic sites (mean ratios ranging between 4.6 and 6.1) compared with sutured sites (mean ratios ranging between 9.0 and 10.9), which is in agreement with the literature for acute, nonreinforced intestinal anastomoses in swine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611418254">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350611418254">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350611418254">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350611418254">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350611418254">18</xref></sup>; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1553350611418254">Table 3</xref>). Differences in burst strengths between stapled and hand sewn anastomoses possibly may be because of the GIA staplers not always being capable of obtaining airtight closure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350611418254">11</xref></sup> which may be related to low tissue stiffness, luminal diameter, and number of staples versus sutures used. Furthermore, staple line leakage and bleeding are not uncommon problems associated with the use of surgical staplers in GI resection and anastomotic operations, and thus buttressing or reinforcement of staple lines has been proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611418254">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611418254">6</xref></sup> and shown to be clinically effective in reducing leakage and bleeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350611418254">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1553350611418254"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1553350611418254">21</xref></sup> Burugapalli et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611418254">6</xref></sup> even noted that the leakage rate of nonbuttressed staple lines was so high that none of the intestinal segments burst at the mesentery (ie, physiological failure could not be attained). It is interesting to note that percentage leakage rates of stapled intestinal anastomoses have been reported to be significantly lower than sutured anastomoses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350611418254">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350611418254"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350611418254">9</xref></sup> Discrepancies in findings may be explained in part by species variation (human vs porcine), anatomy of intestine, difference in burst strength method (ex vivo vs in situ), timing of testing (fresh vs 24 hours later), effect of treatment (none or NPT), relative experience in creating anastomoses, and ease of detecting leakage (colorimetric vs fluoroscopic). However, Brundage et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350611418254">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350611418254">9</xref></sup> have reported significantly higher complications are seen with stapled anastomoses compared with handsewn anastomoses in certain patient groups, including trauma patients.</p>

<p>Using an in situ technique for measurement of intestinal burst strength, burst strength values (ratio to baseline ILP) observed in this study appeared to be at least 4.6 times greater than a conservatively calculated intestinal ILP value seen in swine without anastomoses. The results of this study demonstrated that, at the time immediately after surgery during the initial 24 hours when GI anastomoses are potentially the weakest, NPT does not raise any concern with regard to adverse effects on the patency of either sutured or stapled intestinal anastomoses in swine when applied for the first 24 hours following surgery. The effect of NPT on anastomotic integrity following longer durations of treatment remains to be studied.</p>
