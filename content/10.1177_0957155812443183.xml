<abstract>
<p><italic>La Parisienne</italic> is both myth and icon, projecting a confident, feminine incarnation of Frenchness. The enduring popularity of this figure within France and abroad is evidenced in the numerous (life)style manuals that sell their readers the secrets of balancing femininity with modernity, consumerism with creativity. The ahistorical presentation of <italic>la Parisienne</italic> contrasts with the way in which increasingly political narratives surround the relationship between femininity, consumerism and citizenship in the French public sphere. A discussion of two counter-culture graffiti artists – Miss.Tic, who uses ‘la Parisienne’ as an urban icon to highlight the gendered dynamics of the street and Princess Hijab, whose images confront associations between consumerism and citizenship – highlights how femininity is presented in one as the celebration of contradiction, and in the other as a way of glossing over perceptions of cultural difference.</p>

<body>
<p><italic>La Parisienne</italic> is a myth of femininity and class in Paris whose desirability is continually sustained in films, literature and fashion-related media such as magazines and advertising. Being visible, feminine and fashionable in the city’s public spaces is an important signifier of <italic>la Parisienne</italic>, yet her consumerism is a show of creativity, and much is made of her natural sense of taste and style in handbooks such as <italic>Comment devenir une vraie Parisienne</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957155812443183">Lurcat, 2011</xref>), and, in a number of advertising tie-ins with Galeries Lafayette, model Inès de la Fressange’s <italic>La Parisienne</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957155812443183">2010</xref>). At a time in which there is a growing recognition of <italic>la France plurielle</italic> the continued success of <italic>la Parisienne</italic> as a marker of social superiority in popular culture is perhaps surprising. Yet there is widespread popular investment in her identity, as illustrated by an example from the magazine industry: since 2007 ‘La Parisienne’ has been a widely circulated supplement to the newspaper <italic>Le Parisien</italic>, which distributes 550,155 copies a month, and promises its readers ‘un contrat de lecture qui concretise l’idéal de la Parisienne’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0957155812443183">1</xref></sup> Rather than the magazine entering into a dialogue with the city’s diverse female inhabitants, it asks them to collude in the maintenance of this figure, suggesting that her popularity is not solely due to over-representation but also a sense of self-interest on the part of female Parisian readers. Although the contemporary <italic>Parisienne</italic> bears many similarities to her counterpart of late modernity the difference lies in this sense of open collusion with the myth since, as ‘La Parisienne’ suggests, this figure is now as liberated as she is fashionable: ‘Gavroche en jupons, elle exerce pleinement son droit à la parole!’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957155812443183">‘La Parisienne’ website, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>There are two principal contradictions celebrated in the contemporary <italic>Parisienne</italic> that I will focus on. The first is between the individual and the multiple since, as Rocamora points out in her study of Parisian identity in the fashion press, she is ‘first and foremost a “she” not a “they”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0957155812443183">2006</xref>: 50). The figure must therefore be able to translate the phantasmagoria of the city while adapting to individual differences of age, class and ethnicity. She is not only a French phenomenon, and the identity of <italic>la Parisienne</italic> can extend internationally, as seen in the recent use of British model Kate Moss for the advertising of Yves Saint Laurent’s ‘Parisienne’ fragrance. The perfume, an update of the popular ‘Paris’ brand of the 1980s, was re-launched worldwide in 2009. The campaign used prominent television, magazine and street advertisements, and features Kate Moss in Paris at dawn, wearing a short black dress shot in a rosy pink light.</p>
<p>In keeping with its focus on a global market the Yves Saint Laurent promotional blog opens up the possibility that any woman can represent the values of the city: ‘At the heart of YSL’s DNA is the empowerment of women, and true to this we believe that any woman, anywhere, can adopt the values of being a Parisienne’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0957155812443183">Yves Saint Laurent, 2009</xref>). The identity of <italic>la Parisienne</italic> presented here is exclusive yet malleable enough to be potentially embodied by a global base of consumers with enough purchasing power. The idea that la <italic>Parisienne</italic> identity is transient and can therefore be assumed and adopted is an important dynamic in the marketing of consumer brands, both in their long-term general appeal and in their short-term fashions. However, the crucial element in the creation of her identity, missing in the blog’s global consumer vision, is the city dynamics of looking and being seen in particular city spaces. La <italic>Parisienne</italic> inhabits the ‘right’ places and addresses, an idea reinforced through the French media, in particular women’s magazines such as <italic>Vogue</italic> and <italic>L’Officiel</italic>, which carry address books that render the city ‘a series of sites of luxury consumption, and the city’s diversity [is] reduced to an abundance of designer brands’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0957155812443183">Rocamora, 2006</xref>: 47).</p>
<p>The ability to find such places links <italic>la Parisienne</italic>’s shopping, whether for luxury goods or bohemian chic, to an intimate knowledge of the city. This contrasts with the passivity traditionally associated with women and consumerism. Indeed the creative ‘esprit’ of <italic>la Parisienne</italic> is celebrated across the cinema, fashion and publishing industries and draws on associations of Paris with political rebellion as well as its role as the place of the next fashion trend. As the embodiment of both the city and of idealised, displayed womanhood, <italic>la Parisienne</italic> is able to encompass the roles of consumer and active citizen without contradiction. She is therefore emancipated ‘both spiritually and bodily’ as Rocamora puts it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0957155812443183">2009</xref>: 121). Bazgan’s study of four Parisian actresses identifies this same trait, stating that what they have in common, in on-screen representations and in media discourse, is an ability to assume the role of both object and subject and that it is precisely this juxtaposition that creates desire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957155812443183">2010</xref>: 108).</p>
<p>An online project entitled ‘Femmes en capitale[s]: Les Parisiennes’ attempts to diversify images of <italic>la Parisienne</italic> by photographing a range of women in Paris and justifying their claim to the title of <italic>Parisienne</italic>: ‘Elles sont Parisiennes de naissance ou d’adoption, originaires d’Afrique, du Maghreb, d’Amérique du Sud, d’Asie, ou d’Europe et incarnent le métissage culturel de leur ville’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957155812443183">Jah, 2010</xref>). The women respond to a questionnaire by naming what they believe to be ‘Paris Novateur’, ‘Paris Diversité’, ‘Paris Mode’ and ‘Paris Beauté’ and are photographed in Parisian streets or cafés. The blog provides a list of addresses at the end of each interview in which readers can find the named shops, monuments and places of interest, mirroring the function of lifestyle handbooks. The last question, ‘Et si Paris était une femme?’ is answered the same for each of the participants ‘Moi, forcément …!’ This attempt to marry contemporary identity politics with <italic>la Parisienne</italic> relies on consumerism as a social leveller. However, it does not distinguish between types of consumerism. Many of the commentators give well-known destinations such as Zara, or simply Les Halles, as their venues for ‘Paris Mode’. Yet the discreet good taste of <italic>la Parisienne</italic>, which aims to strike a balance between feminine visibility and overt display, is an ambiguity that relies on cultural inheritance relating to specific subtleties of taste and distinction. When merged with the mass-market consumerism that is more generally part of the everyday, this sense of ‘esprit’ is far less overt – a shift that implies a greater sense of malleability, which can then be manipulated to political ends.</p>
<p>The diversity of the pictures on the ‘Femmes en capitale[s]’ website encompasses gender (with eight male participants), age and ethnicity, and yet does not include any pictures of women wearing hijabs. It recalls a 2003 Ni putes ni soumises (NPNS) exhibition entitled ‘Mariannes d’aujourd’hui: Hommages des femmes des cités a la République’, in which portraits of 14 young women were displayed on large posters in front of the Assemblée Nationale. The participants’ femininity was lauded for its nationalism: ‘souriante et féminine’, they were therefore ‘à l’image des jeunes femmes de ce pays’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957155812443183">Assemblée Nationale, 2003</xref>). As Anna Kemp has argued, one of the most striking aspects of the exhibition was its resemblance to Galeries Lafayette advertising images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957155812443183">2009</xref>: 25). Yet the department store’s images are noted for their playfulness, for example in the 2011 ‘la Parisienne’ image in which Inès de la Fressange wears a beret and holds an accordion. The text to the accompanying ‘La Parisienne’ exhibition in Galeries Lafayette also acknowledges the fiction it draws on while inviting a narcissistic complicity from Parisian shoppers: ‘Symbole d’élégance, icône de beauté, elle est moins un archétype social qu’une fiction sur laquelle projeter nos désirs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957155812443183">Lévy-Frébault, 2011</xref>). This acknowledging of the role of desire and of the ‘performance’ aspect of <italic>La Parisienne</italic> is missing from the ‘Mariannes’ exhibition in which the participants were each dutifully wearing the <italic>bonnet phyrigien</italic> and presented as political symbols.</p>
<p>As is evident in the exhibition, norms of French femininity have shaped political debates around citizenship in order to highlight the dual otherness of the hijab- or niqab-wearing Muslim woman as embodying neither Western feminine ideals nor French citizenship. As Kemp suggests in relation to NPNS, this merges the universalising notions of ‘Republican feminism’ with consumerism in order to promote the adoption of Western/French feminine norms as a route to emancipation and citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957155812443183">Kemp, 2009</xref>: 20). The wearing of make-up, for example, can be a visual symbol of integration – a position endorsed by Fadela Amara, who refers to make-up as ‘peinture de guerre’ in the fight against Islamic patriarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957155812443183">2003</xref>: 57). Femininity is therefore equated to emancipation, with feminist groups such as NPNS regularly harnessing the persuasive power of popular media and consumer advertising to promote their politics, for example by organizing a ‘Toutes en jupe’ day on 25 November 2010, in reference to the Isabelle Adjani film <italic>La Journée de la jupe</italic> (dir. J-P Lilienfield, 2008), in which a skirt-wearing teacher stands up to the violence and ignorance of her ethnic minority pupils. NPNS president Silhem Habchi draws attention to her right to invest in the myth of femininity in contrast to women living in environments where it would a sign of an amoral sexuality:
<disp-quote>
<p>Lorsque je suis en jupe, je remarque, oui, que les hommes me regardent … Lorsque me sœurs, à Vitry ou ailleurs, tentent d’en faire de même, elles se font traiter de putes. Elles bravent l’interdit en arborant trop de liberté et de féminité. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0957155812443183">NPNS, 2010</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The paradoxical place of female identity within French Republican universalism has been brought into debates as preceding current tensions over cultural difference that led to the niqab being outlawed in public space from 11 October 2010. Raissiguier argues that ‘the hegemonic rhetoric of “the Republic” and “universal citizenship” is in fact based on the exclusion of women’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0957155812443183">2010</xref>: 4). Scott likewise suggests that having won legal and constitutional rights on the basis of their particularity, and in doing so contradicted Republican universalism, women are subsequently pressured to demonstrate the essential nature of their difference through ‘the public display (and sexual desirability for men) of women’s bodies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957155812443183">2005</xref>: 121). For Scott, such objectification ‘serves to veil a constitutive contradiction of French republicanism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957155812443183">2005</xref>: 121). From this perspective, the argument can be made that this imperative to conceal the contradiction of gender difference within universalism through an emphasis on visible sexuality can be extended to include immigrant-origin women.</p>
<p>Such an emphasis on femininity is seen as an unchanging and widely accepted part of French identity. In a photographic anthology of Parisian women, actress Charlotte Rampling is quoted as explaining the dynamic between embodiment and society thus: ‘French women have been made beautiful by the French people, they’re very aware of their bodies, the way they move and speak … French society’s made them like that’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957155812443183">Bouquet et al., 2007</xref>: 212). Although this undermines the idea of a natural feminine essence, it paradoxically affirms, and approves of, the myth of a ‘French’ femininity, here localised as Parisian.</p>
<p>Some commentators have argued that a display of Western feminine norms by NPNS followers constitutes a political act: for example, Fayard and Rocheron who state in defence of the organisation that ‘For NPNS, looking fashionable has become a young woman’s right and, moreover, one – not <italic>the –</italic> sign of autonomy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957155812443183">2009</xref>: 5). The question of whether following in the line of the normative constitutes a creative, or indeed political, act can be applied to both the liberated ‘Parisienne’ ideal and to the women discussed by Habchi. Putting aside the individual motivation to conform, the outward effect is to reinforce political ideas of passive, feminine consumer-citizens in terms of both the French feminine status quo and those excluded from it. As Raissiguier states, the figure of the <italic>beurette</italic>, the fashionable and feminine migrant woman, is frequently drawn on to testify to ‘the integrative power of the French Republic’ and thus reinforces associations of femininity with ‘compliant and docile figures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0957155812443183">2010</xref>: 4).</p>
<p>The convergence between consumerism and citizenship in representations of women in the public sphere has been studied by Cronin, who draws on the concept of ‘cultural fundamentalism’ put forward by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0957155812443183">Stolcke (1995)</xref>. This argues that ideas about distinct ‘races’ have been replaced by allusions to incompatible cultural values that assume ‘a set of symmetric counterconcepts, that of the foreigner, the stranger, the alien, as opposed to the national, the citizen’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0957155812443183">1995</xref>: 7). As Cronin states, this leads to a reified concept of what each ‘culture’ is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957155812443183">2000</xref>: 25). In a consumer context, an increasing emphasis on clothing and appearance as providing signifiers of cultural belonging is an effect of both the increased prominence of advertising and the media in society and the dissolving of traditional national borders in multi-ethnic European cities. The result is social pressure to display culture or status through the city’s consumer sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957155812443183">Cronin, 2000</xref>: 24).The consumption and display of goods therefore continues its traditional role as a marker of social status, but takes on a new significance as individuals interact with a marketplace of cultures and sub-cultures. For young women in particular, clothes are external signifiers of cultural and class identity. Aapola et al. argue that one reason there is particular pressure on young women as cultural consumers to embody ‘an unthreatening form of contemporary citizenship’ is that integration is often communicated through traditionally feminine pursuits such as clothing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957155812443183">2005</xref>: 181). In aligning themselves with ‘feminine’ consumer choices, they merge consumer and citizenship discourses. Counteracting this merging of politics and consumerism in the representation of female citizenship therefore involves intervening in the public space of the contemporary city and in the representation of women as consumers.</p>

<title>Femininity and counter-culture</title>
<p>If mainstream representations of <italic>Parisiennes</italic> tend to mislead willing consumers whose identity is aligned with the status of the city, then graffiti art is perhaps the opposite aesthetic form. As a criminal act, it is designed to be an expression of subversion whose potential consequences for the artist add weight to its claim of authenticity. Graffiti art has been common in Paris since the 1980s, with stencils [<italic>pochoirs</italic>] able to produce and reproduce detailed images often juxtaposed with text. As Williams-Gascon has noted, one major theme of graffiti in France is ‘l’appartenance’, which ranges from an implicit questioning of the ownership of the street to overtly racist graffiti asserting one group’s right to the street over another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0957155812443183">2000</xref>: 117). Graffiti art is common in the northern <italic>quartiers</italic> of Paris around Belleville and in the <italic>banlieues</italic> of Seine-Saint-Denis.</p>
<p>Throughout the metro system graffiti highlights the paradoxical laws of public space in which advertising is inescapable whereas individual expression is illegal. Miss.Tic, a female <italic>pochoiriste</italic>, has been working in Belleville since the 1980s and has regularly had her work exhibited.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0957155812443183">2</xref></sup> Like her fellow graffiti artists Blek le Rat and Jef Aerosol, she has since gone on to achieve wide recognition, fuelled by the role of the internet in reproducing graffiti work and connecting it to an online audience. In 2006 an exhibition entitled ‘Parisienne’ at the Galerie Léila Mordoch was published as a book (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957155812443183">Miss.Tic, 2006</xref>). The front cover shows the repeated motif of a <italic>femme fatale</italic> figure in a black dress with long hair and high heels, over a street map of Paris showing the fifth and thirteenth <italic>arrondissements</italic>. My analysis of Miss.Tic’s work will be taken from this book as well as a gallery of images of her work on Parisian streets available online.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0957155812443183">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Miss.Tic regularly invokes the figure of <italic>la Parisienne</italic> as a site of resistance. Her stencils juxtapose the image of a woman with an aphoristic phrase which usually contains wordplay, for example ‘Je n’ai de maternelle que la langue’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957155812443183">2006</xref>: 24). Many of the works invite the presumed male gaze of the street and then add an element of the unexpected that addresses women: for example, the picture of a woman lifting up her skirt, with the slogan ‘les actes gratuits ont-ils un prix?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957155812443183">2006</xref>, 63). Christophe Genin stresses this voyeuristic aspect of her work as a male viewer claiming that it makes visible the sexual dynamics of the street: ‘mon rêve masculin qui veut la femme désirable et désirante, projeté sur les murs de Paris’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957155812443183">Genin, 2008</xref>: 9). The repeated use of sexualised imagery of women – she employs one female figure, a stylised self-portrait – has led some to question the feminist status of her work, yet she asserts that it is a postmodern critique of identity: ‘Les images des femmes que je représente sont issues des magazines féminins, je les détourne. Je développe une certaine image de la femme non pour la promouvoir mais pour la questionner’ (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957155812443183">Genin, 2008</xref> : 9). The work Genin describes is one in which a woman poses in pin-up style in underwear and stockings, mimicking a lingerie advertisement. The slogan is ‘Je serai ta gueuse’ (whore). However, ‘tagueuse’ is also a definition of Miss.Tic as a female graffiti artist, and this play on words reframes the work as a creative act. Miss.Tic therefore reappropriates <italic>Parisienne</italic> identity and plays on the ways it is shaped by the presumed male gaze of the street.</p>
<p>Subverting exploitative images of women and affirming feminine desire is repeated across the works, including an ecstatic figure proclaiming ‘Je joue, oui!’ (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957155812443183">Miss.Tic, 2006</xref>: 23). In this vein the second broad category of works celebrates women, ‘Parisiennes femmes capitales’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957155812443183">2006</xref>: 70) and encourages creative action: ‘Créer c’est résister’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957155812443183">2006</xref>: 40). There is a tension, however, between representation and subversion, the principal question being whether these two categories contradict each other or whether <italic>la Parisienne</italic> can be both an object of the presumed male gaze and a site of resistance. However, it is necessary to emphasise the subversive nature of the works themselves as feminine inscriptions on the street which draw attention to and disrupt the male gaze. Inscribing the walls of the city with female-authored images of desire is a symbolic step in re-addressing the subject–object relationship represented as being at work in the city spaces. The works published in the book have less of a subversive impact due to their being out of their original context. They also invoke the debate which accompanies many graffiti artists who publish their work – whether legitimacy undermines their original aim to subvert the laws which order public space.</p>
<p>The introduction to <italic>Parisienne</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957155812443183">Miss.Tic, 2006</xref>), written by Leila Mordoch, focuses more on praising the virtues of <italic>les Parisiennes</italic> and a dynamic of looking which excludes the masculine, assuming the viewers to be women, identified as always in a state of hurried movement around the city ‘sans qu’elles sachent vraiment pourquoi’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957155812443183">2006</xref>: i). The works of Miss.Tic, however, take them out of this daily routine and connect them to their surroundings: ‘nous emmène très loin du côté de l’humain, nous ramène à l’histoire de la ville qui nous regarde passer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957155812443183">2006</xref>: i). The potential politicisation is hinted at but not made explicit by Mordoch, who describes an encounter between a passing <italic>Parisienne</italic> with a Miss.Tic work as an experience which will ‘ouvre une fenêtre sur la liberté’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957155812443183">2006</xref>: i). The concept of freedom is not described in political or social terms and is a general conflation of <italic>l’éternel féminin</italic> with the personal and historical narratives of the city: ‘Paris se met a chanter la révolution, l’élégance et l’amour au carrefour de tous les possibilités’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957155812443183">2006</xref>: i). This romanticised spontaneity recalls that of the modern <italic>flâneur</italic>, whose view of the city was summarised in the feminine figure of <italic>la passante</italic>, a transitive one-sided encounter which transported the dynamic of the artistic male gaze into the street, merging the transcendental with the everyday city experience. Miss.Tic has arguably repeated this dynamic, as she acknowledges in one work whose slogan is ‘faire le mur, jouer la fille de l’art’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957155812443183">2006</xref>: 75) providing in her <italic>pochoirs</italic> a graffitied <italic>passante</italic> whose presence reflects back to the viewer her place within this dynamic of seer and seen, and yet at the same time elevates her to the status of seer/<italic>flâneuse</italic>.</p>
<p>Mordoch therefore sees Miss.Tic as a celebration of the postmodern city experience yet adheres to a romanticised modern narrative. The impression of the viewer in the encounter Mordoch describes is of a woman in a hurry but without cause beyond that of her identity as <italic>Parisienne.</italic> However, this identity is acknowledged as a complicit performance: ‘nous jouant de tous les protocoles, puisque, c’est bien connu, les Parisiennes sont élégantes, sans même le chercher, nous sommes nées à la mode, à la mode de Paris’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957155812443183">2006</xref>: iii). In that case, if this identity is assumed as an ‘armure étincelante pour conquérir le monde’ (2006: ii), this model of a self-aware <italic>Parisienne</italic> as one which strategically employs this myth both accepts and contests the patriarchal spatiality. Unlike the <italic>passante</italic> this <italic>Parisienne</italic> is aware of her position as object of the gaze, which shifts the dynamic of exploitation. However, ‘la liberté’ which Mordoch draws attention to is arguably only the freedom to become what has already been defined. The performance is therefore both an expression of objectification and a wish to become an embodied subject in line with the dominant cultural discourse.</p>
<p>The book cover, which overlays Miss.Tic’s signature image onto a map of Paris, suggests that embodying femininity allows for greater social space, in the sense of a figure who can traverse and be accepted across the city. The ‘passing’ of <italic>la Parisienne</italic> as a ‘femme libre affirmant son désir’, as the book jacket describes, is therefore less an act of self-definition than the consumption dynamics of capitalism masquerading as liberatory performative politics. Indeed the similarity between the slogan of ‘La Parisienne’ magazine – ‘s’habiller c’est aussi s’émanciper’ – and the maxim of Miss.Tic – ‘l’éthique, c’est l’esthétique du dedans’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957155812443183">2006</xref>: 76) – testifies to the prevalence of this myth of choice. Ultimately the works in the book paradoxically affirm the spontaneity of the city while conforming to stereotypical images of femininity without adequately politicising or contextualising them. In addition to this are the product lines she has collaborated on, which include lingerie and stationery bearing Miss.Tic’s stencils and slogans. The products align themselves with the counter-culture nature of graffiti and yet their popularity is indistinguishable from its signature image of the feminine object, now removed from its context.</p>
<p>While the Miss.Tic’s works are testament to the creation of the feminine object through repetition, the efforts of anti-consumerist feminist groups have sought to interrupt this process through graffiti. Their protests have drawn attention to the prevalence of advertising in the city’s public spaces, particularly the metro. In 2003–4 there was an almost daily defacement of advertising images, when posters were regularly graffitied, resulting in nine people being taken to court and fined by the RATP. Posters of sexist imagery were targets of two principal groups, La Meute contre la publicité sexiste, founded by one member of the feminist media watchdog Chiennes de Garde, and Collectif contre le Publisexisme. They came together under the name ‘NRV’ (<italic>énervées</italic>) and specifically targeted the metro where they were made unwilling viewers of exploitative imagery while going about their everyday lives: ‘Nous souhaitions ainsi faire savoir aux usagers, à la RATP et aux annonceurs que nous ne restions pas sans réagir devant ces publicités humiliantes pour les femmes, que nous subissons à longueur d’année, au rythme de nos déplacements souterrains’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957155812443183">Lamireau, 2004</xref>). The messages of the posters would be disrupted with phrases which remarked on the images or played upon the advertising slogan of the product. Some also added speech bubbles to the model, for example in the Galeries Lafayette campaign a semi-nude Laeitita Casta was given the words ‘Libérez-moi!’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0957155812443183">4</xref></sup> Their target was the exploitative usage of feminine bodies with advertising, and also coincided with ‘l’affaire Sloggi’, which also saw widespread protest initiated by groups such as La Meute against one particular advertising campaign.</p>
<p>The ethnic homogeneity of media representations of women was not an issue addressed by this campaign, given that the aim was to decrease the usage of objectified women in the media rather than to diversify it. However, a guerrilla artist with increasing visibility named Princess Hijab has drawn inspiration from the above groups, and addresses issues of consumerism, feminism and ethnicity through what she refers to as ‘hijabising’: drawing hijabs or full-length niqabs over male and female subjects in adverts on the metro and on the street of Paris. Taking a broad approach to her targets, Princess Hijab has targeted subjects from Kate Moss to Julie Andrews and Cinderella. In doing so she gestures to the connections between consumerism and femininity which have influenced perceptions of Muslim women’s integration, and yet in interviews and her ‘manifesto’ she refuses to label her politics, stating (in English): ‘And don’t forget, she acts upon her own free will. She is not involved in any lobby or movement be it political, religious or to do with advertising. In fact, the Princess is an insomniac-punk. She is the leader of an artistic fight, nothing else’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0957155812443183">Princess Hijab, n.d.</xref>). An example of her work is from a poster for an album entitled <italic>Femme d’Extérieur</italic> by the singer Maya Barsony, advertised by an image in which she is leaping naked into the air. Princess Hijab modified this poster to cover the singer with a black niqab. Like Miss.Tic, Princess Hijab uses humour in her work: the juxtaposition of a carefully drawn niqab on pop-culture images whose appeal relies upon the exposure of the body invokes the ridiculous in both the original and subsequent images. By ‘hijabising’ female subjects she is also covering the lure of advertising while also forcing the viewer to confront a paradox in which veiled women are perceived as abnormally submissive while the use of female nudity in advertising is encountered every day.</p>
<p>In her manifesto she also proclaims that ‘Princess Hijab knows that L’Oréal and Dark &amp; Lovely have been killing her little by little’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0957155812443183">Princess Hijab, n.d.</xref>). These two brands communicate the Westernization of beauty ideals: the latter is a hair cream to straighten Afro-Caribbean hair while L’Oréal Paris was successfully sued in France for discrimination by the organisation SOS Racisme for specifying that ‘les animatrices de vente devaient être “Jeune, femme, 18/22 ans, BBR, taille 40 maximum” … Le sigle BBR = Bleu, Blanc, Rouge est l’expression utilisée par le Front National pour désigner les “Blancs”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0957155812443183">SOS Racisme, n.d.</xref>). Princess Hijab therefore uses consumer imagery to make statements about political exclusion and images of normativity, while mirroring the apolitical nature of the imagery in her refusal of politics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957155812443183">Aburawa (2009)</xref> argues that that contesting exclusions is not a culturally determined issue:
<disp-quote>
<p>in Princess Hijab’s marked-up art, the headscarf is an agent not of covering but of exposure – of the oppressive nature of the advertising industry, of the displacement and disempowerment of women who are repeatedly told that they are not good, skinny, beautiful, sexy, or rich enough.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Princess Hijab maintains a strong yet intermittent online presence with a website and blog whose images and content are often taken down or moved. She uses the internet as an online gallery space, producing moving GIFs whose rapid juxtaposition of atheist and religious symbolism, stills from pop culture, and distorted sound are designed to be a disorientating viewing experience. In one of them, the text, which has been translated from French to English, then back into French by Google translator, reads: ‘don’t trust pictures / your flashy icons are just a petty stranglehold for weak spirits’. She has created a barrage of images and sounds through which it seems impossible to distinguish meaning – an excess of references which bring into focus the normativity of representations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0957155812443183">5</xref></sup> Princess Hijab is clearly inspired by ‘culture- jamming’, a practice advocated by the Canadian organisation Adbusters and discussed by Naomi Klein in <italic>No Logo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443183">2000</xref>). It advocates the modification of advertising in order to interrupt the logic of representation which creates apolitical consumers, who are unaware of the actions of large corporations that add to global inequality. Culture-jamming is particularly pertinent to young women, Anita Harris has argued that adverts which target them often conflate emancipation with consumption, while separating them globally ‘into either mindless consumers or exploited workers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957155812443183">2004</xref>: 169). In a similar vein, Princess Hijab draws attention to the divisions created between young women in France by the homogeneous imagery of an egalitarian consumer culture which the city’s inhabitants encounter daily.</p>
<p>In contrast to Miss.Tic, whose images ultimately lent themselves to the consumer culture she was initially contesting, Princess Hijab hijacks her images from a position already prominent within media discourse – a questioning of the compatibility of Western European and Islamic cultures. Although her motivations are multiple, they bear similarity to religiously motivated protests against advertising in Bury organised by the group Muslims Against Advertising, who reportedly defaced posters by the lingerie company Sloggi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0957155812443183">Woolcock, 2005</xref>). Like Miss.Tic, Princess Hijab’s work lies between representation and subversion, depending on the perspective of the viewer. For some, she could also be perpetuating a myth while contesting such binaries, confirming stereotypes of ‘repressed’ Muslims versus ‘Western’ debauchery. However, she sidesteps charges of cultural relativism by not exclusively covering female models, having also occasionally targeted male subjects, such as the posters for the Dolce &amp; Gabbana campaign featuring the Italian swimming team. The diversity of her ‘hijabised’ subjects suggests that the target of her work is the logic of representation which draws upon global culture and yet when reproduced in a city context creates a line of embodied femininity (or, as in the case above, masculinity) and consumer citizenship which excludes a number of the city’s inhabitants. Although consumerism and citizenship are frequently blurred in an age where social status, and by implication social rights, can be purchased, Princess Hijab explodes the myth embodied by the fashionable <italic>Parisienne</italic> that they are one and the same.</p>
<p>An examination of the two graffiti artists therefore points to the ambiguous role of the city as a site that reinforces myths of liberated ‘Parisienne’ femininity and yet also hosts networks of multiplicity which counteract the homogenised identity of female subjects in the Paris-inspired consumer images which decorate the city’s spaces. <italic>La Parisienne</italic>, as a consumer subject who both belongs to and embodies the city, remains a figure that has been promoted through the publishing and film industries in order to continue representing Paris as a utopian city. Princess Hijab implies connections between myths of femininity and citizenship in her work that mirror global contestations of consumerism, and yet within this specific context rather than subvert the hypocrisy of global corporations she targets the similarities between Republican universalism and femininity in consumer culture.</p>
<p><italic>La Parisienne</italic> continues to invite admiration and objectification, and this identity is epitomised by Miss.Tic’s fantasy figure. I have argued that acknowledging the performance aspect of the identity does not dissolve the boundary between representation and contestation, and yet it is nonetheless presented as able to reconcile contradictions between creativity and passive objectification, individual and multiple. Miss.Tic and Princess Hijab both attempt to appropriate the city’s spaces to draw attention to the boundaries between the phantasmic and the everyday. However, complicity in this process, even within counter-culture such as graffiti, reproduces the iconicity of <italic>la Parisienne</italic>, yet detaches it from context. The consequences of this, as consumer-based ‘Republican feminism’ has revealed, are that celebrations of the myth of <italic>la Parisienne</italic> as embodied, fashionable and creative femininity reinforce perceptions of belonging and exclusion in the city while purporting to reconcile such cultural differences.</p>
