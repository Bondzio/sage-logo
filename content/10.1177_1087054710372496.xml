<p>Members of modern society face a multitude of decisions on a daily basis; thus, intuitively, it may seem that the more choices one has, the better. Indeed, studies have supported that the provision of choice can lead to many psychological benefits, including internal motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054710372496">Botti &amp; Iyengar, 2004</xref>). Recent research, however, has shown that when faced with numerous options, the subsequent satisfaction and motivation of choosers may decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054710372496">Iyengar &amp; Lepper, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054710372496">Schwartz, 2004</xref>). For example, with an increased range of choices comes an increased opportunity for regret; hence, individuals develop decision-making strategies to prevent this experience of regret. One such strategy is known as maximization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054710372496">Schwartz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710372496">Schwartz et al., 2002</xref>). Specifically, Schwartz et al. found that individuals who seek to maximize their outcomes will search for the very best option (“maximizers”), whereas individuals who seek to simply satisfice will evaluate all options before them until one is encountered that exceeds their acceptability threshold or is good enough (“satisficers”). Maximizers have the goal of appraising each option and making the best choice, but this is often impossible, especially with a great range of options. When all of the alternatives cannot be examined, maximizers are forced to give up the search for the best and simply choose. This can cause them to feel the regret that they initially sought to avoid: How are they to know that there is not an alternative that may have been better? However, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710372496">Schwartz et al. (2002)</xref>, if satisficers have met their criteria for choice, increased options may simply be ignored, lessening their propensity to feel regret.</p>
<p>The theory of satisficing versus maximizing grew out of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1087054710372496">Simon’s (1955</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1087054710372496">1956)</xref> reaction to traditional economic theory’s belief in humans as “rational beings.” Simon disagreed that human beings have well-ordered preferences and that one compares options on a single scale of preference/value/utility, choosing so as to maximize one’s preferences/values/utilities. Instead, he argued that the goal of maximization is virtually impossible due to the limitations of human information processing and the complexity of our environment. In choice situations, one actually has the goal of satisficing, rather than maximizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1087054710372496">Simon, 1955</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1087054710372496">1956</xref>). There are, however, individuals who continue to seek the goal of maximization. These people desire the best possible result, tend to be concerned with their position relative to others, have higher levels of what is considered acceptable, and take longer to make decisions. It is likely that maximizing/satisficing falls on a continuum and that people differ in the extent to which they maximize, depending on the domain. For example, it is doubtful that many people search for the best-possible ice tray for their freezers, but a wider majority of people may seek to maximize when shopping for an appliance or a computer.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710372496">Schwartz et al. (2002)</xref> developed the Maximization (MAX)/Regret Scale in an effort to distinguish between individuals who tend to maximize versus satisfice, as well as to determine the extent to which these individuals feel regret. The authors found that individuals with greater maximization tendencies were more likely to experience regret and depression, as well as to be less optimistic, less happy, and less satisfied with life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710372496">Schwartz et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, maximizing was found to be positively correlated with perfectionism and negatively correlated with self-esteem. Maximizing tends to trigger disappointment when it is not possible, and this disappointment leads to self-blame if a wide array of options were available—with that many options, what excuse is there for not selecting the best alternative? Lastly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710372496">Schwartz and colleagues (2002)</xref> found men were more likely to be maximizers than women were (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054710372496">Brande, Heinze, Labudda, &amp; Markowitsch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054710372496">Hsee &amp; Hastie, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087054710372496">Mellers, Schwartz, &amp; Cooke, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710372496">Schwartz et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>More recently, in a study of college students beginning their search for postgraduation jobs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054710372496">Iyengar, Wells, and Schwartz (2006)</xref> found that compared with satisficers, maximizers do better financially in their job search, but feel worse. For example, maximizers earned starting salaries that were 20% higher than those of satisficers but were less satisfied with the outcome of their job search and were more pessimistic, anxious, worried, overwhelmed, and depressed. The authors suggested that because maximizers consider a large number of possibilities in search of the best, they increase their potential for regret with their unrealistically high expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054710372496">Iyengar et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, people who seek to maximize tend to feel anticipatory regret, as well as subsequent regret when their choices are not seen as acceptable. Overall, “even when they get what they want, maximizers may not always want what they get” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054710372496">Iyengar et al., 2006</xref>, p. 149).</p>
<sec id="section1-1087054710372496">
<title>Definition and Description of Regret</title>
<p>The experience of regret has been defined as an emotional and cognitive state of feeling sorry for mistakes, losses, misfortunes, weaknesses, and past decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1087054710372496">Sommer, Peters, Gläscher, &amp; Büchel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1087054710372496">Suurvali, Hodgins, &amp; Cunningham, 2010</xref>). These regrets may be due to actions or inactions, and they may have occurred voluntarily or been out of one’s control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054710372496">Landman, 1993</xref>). Unlike other negative emotions, such as anger, sadness, or grief, regret involves the feeling that the regrettable situation could have been avoided and that one could have avoided it, if one had chosen differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054710372496">Schwartz, 2004</xref>). A number of fields have attempted to study the phenomenon of regret, including philosophy, economics, and psychology. The economists’ theory of regret assumes that the expected utility of an option is dependent on the pain and pleasure associated with the outcomes of that option and that it is necessary to know the outcome of the unchosen option to feel regret (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054710372496">Bell, 1982</xref>). However, psychologists have suggested that regret is essentially a counterfactual emotion, that it arises from the contrast between what has happened and what might have happened; thus, people can feel regret over imagined outcomes as well as those that are known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054710372496">Gilovich &amp; Medvec, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710372496">Hozo, Schell, &amp; Djulbegovic, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Anticipated future regret has been found to influence current decision making and individuals tend to make regret-minimizing choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054710372496">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1087054710372496">Zeelenberg, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054710372496">Janis and Mann (1977)</xref> were among the first to describe a number of conditions in which regret is anticipated and taken into account when making decisions. These conditions include when the most preferred alternative is not necessarily superior to another alternative. In these cases, a bad outcome can easily be interpreted as a sign that the wrong choice was made. Thus, the more difficult a decision is, the more likely it is that individuals will take regret into account when deciding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054710372496">Conner, Sandberg, McMillan, &amp; Higgins, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1087054710372496">Zeelenberg, 1999</xref>). In addition, when the negative consequences that might ensue from the decision could start to occur shortly after the decision is made, regret is likely to affect decision making. The more permanent and important a decision is believed to be, the more likely a person is to anticipate regret. Finally, regret is likely to affect one’s decision making when significant people in one’s life expect one to delay deciding until the alternatives have been evaluated more carefully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054710372496">Janis &amp; Mann, 1977</xref>). Each of these conditions is likely to affect the decision-making behavior of maximizers because, as discussed previously, maximizers are more likely to seek to avoid regret following decisions; however, they are also more likely to experience it.</p>
<p>What is unknown, however, is the degree to which cognitive factors are associated with maximizing and regret. It is plausible, for example, that characteristics such as impulsivity and internal restlessness and other characteristics associated with ADHD are associated with maximizing and regret, and that individuals with ADHD sympotomology are at greater risk for this method of decision making. ADHD is a neurobehavioral disorder estimated to affect 3% to 7% of the school-age population on the basis of criteria provided in <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed., Text Revision; <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) and 4.4% of the adult population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054710372496">Kessler et al., 2006</xref>). Children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD are at increased risk for academic, behavioral, social, and psychological difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1087054710372496">Weyandt, 2007</xref>). Although adolescents with ADHD are at increased risk for dropping out of high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054710372496">Barkley, 2006</xref>), in recent years increased numbers of students with this disorder have been pursing high education. Although, the specific number of college students with ADHD is unknown, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054710372496">DuPaul et al. (2001)</xref> suggest that 4% to 7% of college students report significant symptoms associated with ADHD. Preliminary studies suggest that students with significant ADHD symptoms are at risk for psychological, academic, and social difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054710372496">DuPaul &amp; Weyandt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054710372496">Faigel, 1995</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1087054710372496">Shaw-Zirt, Popali-Lehane, Chaplin, and Bergman (2005)</xref> concluded that college students with ADHD symptoms reported lower levels of adjustment, social skills, and self-esteem in comparison students without ADHD symptoms. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054710372496">Norwalk, Norvilitis, and MacLean (2009)</xref> reported that higher levels of ADHD symptoms were significantly related to lower levels of academic adjustment, study skills, and GPA and career decision-making self-efficacy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1087054710372496">Weyandt et al. (2003)</xref> found that college students with ADHD symptoms reported higher levels of internal restlessness compared to students without the disorder and men were found to report higher levels of internal restlessness than women.</p>
<p>The literature concerning ADHD and decision making is equivocal. For example, children with ADHD have not been found to have specific deficits in decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054710372496">Geurts, van der Oord, &amp; Crone, 2006</xref>); however, they do appear to be sensitive to the rate of frequency of a reward, and, when given a choice in what academic task to perform, children with ADHD show greater task involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054710372496">Luman, Oosterlaan, &amp; Sergeant, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054710372496">Masunami, Okazaki, &amp; Maekawa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1087054710372496">Weyandt, 2006</xref>). Research concerning decision making in adults with ADHD is scant, but preliminary studies have found that adults with ADHD are often impulsive when making decisions and typically select more unfavorable options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054710372496">Malloy-Diniz, Fuentes, Leite, Correa, &amp; Bechara, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, studies suggest that college students who report ADHD symptomology are at greater risk for academic, social, and psychological difficulties, all of which are affected by decision-making strategies. A dearth of information exists, however, concerning specific factors associated with decision making in this population; therefore, research is warranted to investigate whether a relationship exists between ADHD symptomology and a tendency to maximize or satisfice when faced with decisions.</p>
<p>The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between maximizing or satisficing tendencies, symptoms of ADHD, and sensitivity to regret. It was hypothesized that (a) participants who reported more behaviors associated with ADHD and internal restlessness would report more maximizing tendencies, (b) participants reporting greater ADHD symptoms and internal restlessness symptoms would be more likely to report feelings of regret, (c) male participants would report more symptoms of ADHD and internal restlessness than female participants, and (d) male participants would be more likely to report maximization tendencies than female participants.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 275 undergraduate students at a university located in the Pacific Northwest were recruited to participate in this study. Participants were recruited from psychology classes over two academic quarters taught by professors willing to allow access to their classes. Approximately 180 of the participants were from introductory psychology courses and the remainders were from developmental psychology and research methods classes. Clearance was received from the University’s Human Subjects Review Committee before the initiation of the data collection phase of this study. Each student completed a packet of questionnaires during a scheduled experimental session or a regularly scheduled class period and received extra credit for their participation in the study. Demographic information, including age, sex, ethnicity, level of education, marital status, occupation, and diagnosis of ADHD, was collected.</p>
<p>The ages of the participants ranged from 18 to 47 years (<italic>M</italic> = 21.1, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.42). The majority of the participants were traditional college students, with 78.3% of the sample stating that they were aged between 18 and 22 years. Of the total sample, 41.4% of the participants were male and 58.6% were female. Regarding ethnicity, 80.1% of the participants were White, 7.4% were Hispanic, 6.6% described their ethnicity as “Other,” 4.4% were Asian/Pacific Islander, 0.7% were American Indian/Alaska Native, and 0.7% were African American. The majority of the sample (80.7%) described their marital status as single, 8.2% of the participants reported that they were married, 7.1% considered their marital status to be “other,” and 4.1% were divorced. The reported education levels of the participants were as follows: 39.1% freshman, 17.3% sophomore, 22.9% junior, 19.9% senior, and 0.8% postbaccalaureate. Psychology was the reported college major for 22.1% of the participants. The remaining participants (77.9%) stated that their major was something other than psychology. Many of the participants (44.6%) reported that, in addition to attending Central Washington University, they were also employed. Finally, information regarding any past or present diagnoses of ADHD was collected: 94.1% of the participants reported that they had never been diagnosed with ADHD, and 5.9% stated that they had previously been diagnosed as having ADHD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1087054710372496">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Students completed a packet of questionnaires that included a demographic questionnaire and three rating scales: the Adult Rating Scale (ARS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1087054710372496">Weyandt, 1995</xref>), the Internal Restlessness Scale (IRS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1087054710372496">Weyandt et al., 2003</xref>), and the MAX/Regret Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710372496">Schwartz et al., 2002</xref>). Before completeing the rating scales, participants were given a consent form that informed the participants of their right to terminate their involvement at any time. The order of the instruments was counterbalanced in an effort to prevent order effects. Upon completion of the rating scales, participants received a debriefing handout that explained the purpose of the study and included contact information for the University Health and Counseling Center.</p>

<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<sec id="section8-1087054710372496">
<title>Adult Rating Scale</title>
<p>The ARS is a 25-item self-report measure that is derived from the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> criteria for ADHD and evaluates hyperactivity, impulsivity, and attention in adults. The ARS is formatted similarly to scales assessing ADHD in children (e.g., the ADHD Rating Scale; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054710372496">DuPaul, Power, McGoey, Ikeda, &amp; Anastopoulos, 1998</xref>) and uses a 4-point Likert-type scale for each item (<italic>not at all, just a little, pretty much, very much</italic>). Past research has demonstrated the ability of the ARS to distinguish between adults with and without ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1087054710372496">Weyandt, Linterman, &amp; Rice, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1087054710372496">Weyandt, Rice, Linterman, Mitzlaff, &amp; Emert, 1998</xref>). The internal consistency of the ARS has been shown to be .86, whereas the test–retest reliability has been found to be .80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1087054710372496">Weyandt et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1087054710372496">
<title>Internal Restlessness Scale</title>
<p>The IRS is a 24-item self-report instrument intended to evaluate symptoms of internal restlessness. Participants respond to each item on the basis of a 7-point Likert-type scale (<italic>none of the time, some of the time, most of the time, all of the time</italic>). Research has shown the test–retest reliability of the IRS to be .80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1087054710372496">Weyandt et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, factor analysis has indicated that internal restlessness may be multidimensional, consisting of four factors, which include “internal distractibility,” “internal restlessness,” “internal impulsivity,” and “internal disorganization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1087054710372496">Weyandt et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1087054710372496">
<title>MAX/Regret Scale</title>
<p>The MAX is a 13-item self-report scale that evaluates individuals’ inclination to maximize, whereas the Regret Scale is a 5-item self-report measure that assesses individuals’ propensity to feel regret. Participants respond to each item using a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>completely agree</italic> to 7 = <italic>completely disagree</italic>). The MAX includes items assessing both behavioral examples of maximizing (e.g., “Renting videos is really difficult. I’m always struggling to pick the best one”) and more internal manifestations of maximization tendencies, such as having high standards for oneself. The regret scale includes items such as “When I think about how I’m doing in life, I often assess opportunities I have passed up.” Individuals with a mean score of greater than 52 on the MAX are generally considered satisficers, whereas those with scores lower than that are deemed to be maximizers. Mean scores higher than 71.5 suggest an individual who is an extreme satisficer, and mean scores lower than 32.5 indicate someone who is an extreme maximizer. Cronbach’s alpha is .71 for the MAX and .67 for the regret scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710372496">Schwartz et al., 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710372496">Gillham, Ward, and Schwartz (2001)</xref> reported test–retest correlations for the MAX ranging from .73 to .82. On the basis of a previous factor analysis, face validity for the scales was established through the use of advanced undergraduate psychology or economics majors acting as judges. The 11 judges were asked to read each MAX and REGRET item and indicate whether each related to an individual’s inclination to “get the best out of any situation,” “settle for good enough,” or whether the item related to an individual’s sensitivity to “the possibility that he or she might regret a decision once made.” All items were judged consistently with the author’s expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710372496">Schwartz et al., 2002</xref>). In terms of construct validity, the MAX scale was significantly correlated with perfectionism (<italic>r</italic> = .25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The authors also report a significant relationship (<italic>r</italic> = .13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) between MAX and a scale measuring specific consumer behaviors consistent with a maximizing tendency (e.g., “When I am planning to purchase an item of clothing, I like to look at all the stores first to make certain I get the perfect item”; “How many products did you consider before choosing this particular one?”).</p>

<title>Psychometrics of Rating Scales</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1087054710372496">Weyandt et al. (1995)</xref>, participants with ARS scores greater than 1.5 standard deviations above the mean demonstrate significant symptoms of ADHD. Using this criterion, results from the present study revealed that 9.9% of the participants reported significant symptoms of ADHD on the ARS (raw score ≥ 61.78), in contrast to the 7% found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1087054710372496">Weyandt et al. (2003)</xref> and the 8.7% reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087054710372496">Sabol (2005)</xref>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710372496">Schwartz et al. (2002)</xref>, established norms for the MAX scale based on 1,747 participants and as reported in the seminal set of studies conducted after the development of the instrument. For these participants, the range of scores was from 13 to 91 and the mean score was 52. These norms indicate that respondents with mean scores below 52 are generally considered to have more maximizing characteristics, whereas those who have scores above this midpoint are generally thought of as displaying more behaviors and beliefs typical of satisficers. Furthermore, it was found that most people fall into an average range of 42.26 to 61.74. On the basis of the results of this seminal study, participants with scores between 32.6 and 42.25 are considered maximizers and those with scores between 61.75 and 71.4 are satisficers. Scores lower than 32.5 suggest extreme maximizers, and scores above 71.5 indicate extreme satisficers. Using these criteria, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710372496">Schwartz et al. (2002)</xref> found that participants classified as “maximizers” sought significantly more social comparison information than did “satisficers” in a laboratory anagram study, consistent with the author’s definition of the two types of decision makers.</p>
<p>Results from the present study revealed that 60.6% of the participants fell into the average range, 18.8% were maximizers, 13.2% were satisficers, 5.2% were extreme maximizers, and 2.2% were extreme satisficers.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between maximizing or satisficing tendencies, symptoms of ADHD and internal restlessness, and sensitivity to regret. In addition, this study sought to extend past research on these constructs by exploring sex differences in the symptoms of ADHD and internal restlessness, decision-making styles (i.e., maximizing and satisficing tendencies), and the experience of regret. Results suggest strong correlations between ADHD symptomology, internal restlessness, and decision making styles. Also, significant differences in ADHD symptomology, internal restlessness, and decision making styles were found across sex. The remainder of this section will further discuss each correlation and sex difference, study limitations, and proposed areas of future research.</p>
<p>The findings from this study are consistent with previous research that has investigated the use of the ARS in identifying symptoms of ADHD in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1087054710372496">Weyandt et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1087054710372496">1998</xref>), thus providing further support for the use of the ARS in recognizing the symptoms of ADHD in adults.</p>
<p>In addition, research has previously explored the usage of the MAX scale. The mean score in the present study was very similar to that found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710372496">Schwartz et al. (2002)</xref>. Although the participants in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710372496">Schwartz et al. (2002)</xref> study exhibited a slight inclination toward a satisficing decision-making style, a greater percentage of participants in the present study reported more maximizing than satisficing tendencies (24.0% vs. 15.4%). These results are similar to those found in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087054710372496">Sabol (2005)</xref>, in which 24.6% of the participants reported a tendency toward maximization and only 9.5% of participants were considered satisficers. It is possible that the discrepancy between these results and those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710372496">Schwartz et al. (2002)</xref> are because of age differences in the samples. Although all three studies used a number of college students, the majority of the participants in the study performed by Schwartz et al (2002). were nonstudents with a mean age of more than 40 years. Past research has shown that older adults are likely to seek less information when faced with a decision, to perform less exhaustive analyses of the available information, to use more heuristic decision-making strategies, and to avoid making decisions in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1087054710372496">Sanfey &amp; Hastie, 2000</xref>). These characteristics of decision making are much more akin to a satisficing style than one of maximization. Future research should further investigate the effect of age on decision-making styles and the likelihood of utilizing maximization strategies.</p>
<p>In addition, it should be noted that there is no distinct criterion line that separates maximizers from satisficers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710372496">Schwartz et al. (2002)</xref> proposed that there must be some variation in the extent to which people maximize in different situations and domains of choice; no person uses a maximization strategy in every decision he or she is faced with. However, some people seem to be more likely to seek to maximize in a wider variety of situations than other people. A possible suggestion for future research would be to further explore the various thresholds of acceptability that individuals have in different areas. For example, are people generally more likely to maximize when making certain decisions, such as when buying a car or a house, than when making others, such as when selecting a new pair of pants?</p>
<p>The present findings provide additional support for the hypothesis that individuals scoring higher on the ARS, which measures behavioral symptoms of ADHD, also receive high scores on the IRS, which evaluates internal restlessness symptoms, a common characteristic of ADHD.</p>
<p>The current results are consistent with previous research and indicate a significant correlation between maximization and regret (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710372496">Schwartz et al., 2002</xref>). Specifically, increased maximization tendencies are often coupled with an increased propensity to feel regret. As determined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710372496">Schwartz et al. (2002)</xref>, individuals who attempt to maximize when making decisions are also more likely to experience depression and regret, and to be less optimistic, happy, and satisfied with life. It was proposed that individuals might initially become maximizers in an attempt to avoid feeling regret in the future. However, these individuals, who also tend to be perfectionistic, are likely to feel regret when their unrealistically high expectations do not come to fruition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054710372496">Iyengar et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The current study found a significant correlation between the IRS and the regret scale, which suggests that individuals who experience a high amount of internal restlessness also report increased feelings of regret. A possible explanation for this relationship is that individuals who experience internal restlessness, by definition, experience a high level of intrusive thoughts and a constant flow of ideas may manifest itself through continual reconsideration of one’s choices and actions. If people continually rethink their decisions, they are likely to second guess themselves and wish that they had made different choices, thus, they feel regret.</p>
<p>A significant correlation was also found between the IRS and the MAX, indicating that individuals who experience elevated levels of internal restlessness are also more likely to utilize a maximizing decision-making strategy. Similar to the finding that people who are more internally restless are more likely to feel regret, this is understandable. People constantly seeking mental stimulation may determine that considering all of their options when making decisions is a productive way to spend their cognitive energy. Alternatively, individuals who have less internal restlessness, and generally experience a greater sense of mental calmness, are more likely to be satisfied with the first option that meets their threshold of acceptability. These people, who have a tendency to use a satisficing decision-making style, do not have a need for the cognitive stimulation that comes with attempting to maximize.</p>
<p>In addition, the results of the current study suggest a significant relationship between the ARS and the regret scale. Specifically, the significant correlation suggests that individuals who exhibit more behavioral symptoms associated with ADHD are likely to feel more regret. There are a number of possible explanations for this relationship. As individuals who have ADHD are more likely to be impulsive and to engage in risk-taking behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054710372496">Barkley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054710372496">Faigel, Sznajderman, Tishby, Turel, &amp; Pinus, 1995</xref>; Weyandt, 2001), it follows that those individuals who demonstrate symptoms of ADHD may do things without fully considering the consequences, later feeling regret for their actions. Alternatively, individuals with ADHD often have weak organizational skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054710372496">APA, 2000</xref>). This may translate into difficulty prioritizing the criteria that form the basis of decisions. Choices may then be made on the basis of less important factors, and regret may be felt when this realization is made. Individuals regret about a number of different things, including inaction and action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054710372496">Landman, 1993</xref>). Future research should further explore the domains in which people with ADHD are most likely to feel regret.</p>
<p>A significant relationship was also found between the ARS and the MAX, which implies that people who display more symptoms of ADHD are also likely to have more maximization tendencies. Individuals with ADHD and those who are, in general, maximizers, may both have difficulty in making decisions. However, these people may struggle when making decisions for different reasons. Specifically, individuals with ADHD symptomology may find it difficult or impossible to concentrate long enough to make an informed decision. They may find themselves becoming distracted by the other options available before they have made a definitive choice. On the basis of this distraction, individuals with ADHD or ADHD symptomology may be impelled to use a maximizing decision-making style, as they may need to review the alternatives at hand continually. Similarly, those people who simply lean toward maximization also have a difficult time making decisions as they feel the need to appraise the value and utility of each of the existing options carefully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710372496">Schwartz et al., 2002</xref>). The participants in the current study who reported more symptoms of ADHD also reported more maximization tendencies. It should be noted that that the correlation between the IRS and the MAX was significantly higher than the correlation between the ARS and the MAX. This result may be due to the fact that the IRS and MAX both measure factors related to cognition, whereas the ARS is more of a behavioral measure.</p>
<p>The results of this study suggest that men demonstrate significantly more behaviors associated with ADHD than women. This supports much past research that has found that men are more likely than women to have ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054710372496">Barkley, 2006</xref>). However, there was not a significant difference between the amount of internal restlessness that men and women reported. A possible explanation for these findings is that women are more likely to be diagnosed with and experience symptoms of the predominantly inattentive subtype of ADHD, whereas men typically report more of the externalizing symptoms of ADHD, such as impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054710372496">Abikoff et al., 2002</xref>; Weyandt, 2001). The inattentive symptoms of ADHD are measured to a greater degree by the IRS than by the ARS, which may be why men and women reported more similar levels of internal restlessness.</p>
<p>Past research has proposed that men are more likely to seek to maximize their outcomes than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710372496">Schwartz et al., 2002</xref>). The present study’s results support this finding and suggest that men tend to use a maximizing decision-making style more often than women do. These results can be interpreted in the context that men are much more likely to have ADHD and to experience symptoms of ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054710372496">Barkley, 2006</xref>), and those individuals who demonstrate more symptoms of ADHD are also more likely to exhibit maximization tendencies.</p>
<p>It appears that men and women significantly differ on their experience of regret. Specifically, this finding suggests that men report feeling significantly more regret than women do. Little past research has focused on gender differences in the experience of regret in general. However, previous research has investigated the degree to which men and women differ in their feelings of regret about specific decisions and events. For example, in a study investigating the content of the regrets of college students, women reported wishing they had spent more time focusing on their health, spirituality, and leisure activities, whereas men regretted spending too much time watching television (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054710372496">Lata, Nakamoto, &amp; DeGenova, 1997</xref>). In addition, with regard to romantic relationships, men have endorsed more regrets of inaction over action, whereas women have reported equivalent amounts of regrets of both inaction and action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087054710372496">Roese et al., 2006</xref>). Future research should continue to explore sex differences in the general experience of regret as well as variance in the regret felt about specific features of life (e.g., health, love, education, etc.).</p>
<p>Overall, the findings from the present study suggest that it may be helpful to consider the decision making abilities and strategies when treating adults with ADHD and college students with ADHD symptomology. These adults have an increased likelihood to feel compelled to explore all possible options when making decisions, and therefore, are likely to experience feelings of regret when they are unable to do so. Improving and becoming confident in decision-making abilities may help ADHD adults reduce the mental distress resulting from feelings of regret. Furthermore, reducing the cognitive demand associated with time-consuming rigorous decision making may free up much-needed cognitive resources for these individuals.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The current study has several limitations. First, the study was conducted using a relatively small sample of college students that may not be a valid representation of the population as a whole. The variation between some of the results found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710372496">Schwartz et al. (2002)</xref>, who used almost 2,000 participants, and the present study (<italic>N</italic> = 275), may be an indicator of this limitation. Despite this limitation, this study may be important because an increasing number of students are requesting accommodations for ADHD under the Americans with Disabilities Act (Weyandt, 2001). The information gained through this study may assist clinicians, teachers, and other professionals to better understand the decision-making processes of students with ADHD.</p>
<p>A further limitation of this study concerns the accuracy of the participants’ self-report of their symptoms of ADHD and internal restlessness. On the basis of the research conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054710372496">Barkley, Fischer, Smallish, and Fletcher (2002)</xref>, individuals may tend to underreport their current symptoms of ADHD. However, conflicting research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710372496">Murphy and Schachar (2000)</xref> suggested that people may actually rate themselves as having more, or more intense, symptoms than informants such as the participants’ spouses. Regardless of whether participants tend to under- or over-estimate their experience of ADHD symptoms and internal restlessness, the accuracy of self-report rating scales must always be questioned.</p>
<p>Finally, it appears as if the effects of experiencing ADHD are similar to the effects of seeking to maximize when making decisions. A number of studies have found that individuals with ADHD report lower self-esteem and more symptoms of depression than people without ADHD (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054710372496">Faigel, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054710372496">Fischer, Barkley, Smallish, &amp; Fletcher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1087054710372496">Shaw-Zirt et al., 2005</xref>). Likewise, people who tend to maximize when making decisions also report higher levels of depression and lower levels of self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710372496">Schwartz et al., 2002</xref>). It appears as if these poor outcomes are a consequence of the ADHD symptoms and maximization tendencies. However, it is unclear whether these negative effects are solely due to the symptoms of ADHD and maximizing inclinations, or whether they are a manifestation of additional, underlying disorders. Thus, future research should not only focus on the effects of ADHD symptomology and maximization tendencies on measures of well-being but also on how other disorders affect these same measures.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the results from the present study augment past research on the relationships between the symptoms of ADHD, internal restlessness, maximization tendencies, and regret. The findings of the present study suggest that college students who experience considerable symptoms of ADHD report significantly more feelings of internal restlessness. In addition, college students who are likely to seek to maximize when making decisions are also likely to feel greater amounts of regret. Despite the limitations of the present study, the results suggest that those individuals who experience symptoms of ADHD and/or internal restlessness are also likely to use a maximizing decision-making style and to feel elevated levels of regret. In the present study, the current study also explored sex differences in these constructs. In support of previous research, men reported significantly more symptoms of ADHD than women. However, men and women did not significantly differ in their feelings of internal restlessness. In addition, men reported more maximization tendencies and more regret than women did. Additional research using larger samples, different age groups, and different clinical groups is necessary to better understand the relationship between ADHD symptomology, internal restlessness, maximization tendencies, and regret.</p>
