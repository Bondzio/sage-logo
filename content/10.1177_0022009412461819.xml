<abstract>
<p>Australia was an active member of the Colombo Plan for aid to South and Southeast Asia, beginning in 1951 as a loosely organized umbrella of multiple bilateral aid agreements between Commonwealth countries and quickly expanding in geographical reach and membership. Towards the end of the 1950s, as members of this ‘plan’ geared up for a new wave of aid projects, they also attached new importance to information activities associated with aid. In this Australian case study, journalists were thrust to the fore of story-generation relating to Australia’s involvement in the Colombo Plan. These written stories, and also still and moving images, were aimed at both domestic Australian audiences and also overseas audiences. Thus began some of the first important steps in what today is called ‘public diplomacy’, and what, at the time, was a new experiment in foreign policy and reputation-making.</p>

<p>This article is a historical case study of Australian public diplomacy spluttering into life. It draws, in particular, on activities relating to the Colombo Plan for aid to South and Southeast Asia which began in the middle of 1951 and continues, in diminished form, today. From an Australian perspective, the Colombo Plan can be seen as one of the few progressive aspects of official policy towards this part of Asia during the 1950s and 1960s, a period remembered mostly for the persistence of the so-called ‘White Australia’ restrictive immigration policy and for Australia’s membership of defence pacts with the United States and others shielding them from communism and radical nationalism in East and Southeast Asia. Until the White Australia policy was fully dismantled, and until Australian military forces withdrew from Vietnam, both in the early 1970s, Australian governments’ sponsored education and training opportunities for Asian students to come to Australia stood out as a more liberal and pluralistic expression of Australian policy towards a changing Asia. The Colombo Plan grew through these two decades, modestly in terms of student numbers and direct forms of development assistance provided by Australians, and more spectacularly as a well-tended story of multi-partner co-operation and internationalism; and the question of how Australians shaped this burgeoning tale of the Colombo Plan, setting their own contributions in the context of others’ efforts, requires further investigation. The case study I explore here, of a government-endorsed journalists’ tour of South and Southeast Asia in 1958–9, is instructive for what it reveals about a dawning sense of the power of popularly digested stories and images to work in two ways, at home and overseas. The late 1950s saw Colombo Plan members seized of the importance of ‘information’ campaigns and this Australian episode is set in the context of a more generally emerging journalist’s sensibility attaching to the cultural internationalism of aid for Asia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022009412461819">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>As commentators acknowledge, public diplomacy remains a slippery field of study, because it attracts interest from different methodological positions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022009412461819">2</xref></sup> Bruce Gregory’s description of public diplomacy is helpful and illustrative of ‘grey areas’. He suggests that it describes:<disp-quote>
<p>ways and means by which states, associations of states, and nonstate actors <italic>understand</italic> cultures, attitudes, and behaviour; <italic>build and manage</italic> relationships; and <italic>influence</italic> opinions and actions to advance their interests and values. [Public Diplomacy] is used by political actors to understand the consequences of policy choices, set public agendas, influence discourse in civil society, and build consent for strategies that require trade-offs among costs, risks and benefits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022009412461819">3</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Gregory allows for non-state actors in the first part of his explanation and then emphasizes political actors in his second sentence. There remains scope for debate on whether public diplomacy should be confined to government-initiated and government-supported activities, or opened up to include a broader range of non-government actors. I take the narrower view here, focusing on government-led action, but acknowledge that my case study here does not close off this debate.</p>
<p>As a field of research and writing, public diplomacy attracts more communications analysts, practitioners and international relations commentators than historians, but several historical studies, especially of US cultural and information initiatives during the Cold War, suggest how the historical approach might be extended. Indeed, in order to elevate the contribution of historians to this fast-growing field of study beyond that of providers of case-studies that some might find detached from more contemporary debates, there needs to be more research into past acts of public diplomacy. Among those published to date, several concentrating on information activities, including Jessica Gienow-Hecht’s study of American journalism in postwar Germany and Nicholas Cull’s magisterial study of the US Information Agency (USIA), draw on the legacies of vigorous and well-resourced information organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022009412461819">4</xref></sup> Cull’s analysis includes reflections on the Americans’ use of the term ‘public diplomacy’, a concept that helped knit together the various activities of the USIA and was distinguishable from ‘propaganda’, which was what the other side did.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022009412461819">5</xref></sup> He argues that public diplomacy involves five distinct activities, the most important of which is listening (and feeding back information from, and analysis of, foreign publics into the foreign policy-making process), with the others being advocacy, cultural diplomacy, exchange diplomacy and international broadcasting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022009412461819">6</xref></sup> Given the modest scale of Australia’s Colombo Plan activities, it would be unrealistic to find all of these elements equally in play at the end of the 1950s, but Cull’s five elements, taken with Gregory’s definition, provide some suggestive means by which to assess Australia’s early steps in public diplomacy.</p>
<p>For a time, those working on projects under the Colombo Plan, struggled to turn it into an easily-digested good news story. The broad outline of the Plan was settled in November 1950 and the plan was launched on 1 July 1951. In fact, it was less ‘a plan’ than an umbrella under which a series of bilateral aid arrangements unfolded. A Consultative Committee meeting annually examined beneficiaries’ economic and progress reports and made recommendations, upon the basis of which donor countries such as Australia would provide bilateral aid. This might consist of capital equipment or direct or indirect financing of big infrastructural, agricultural, dam-building and other development projects. A separate technical assistance co-operation arm of the plan facilitated technical and educational assistance. Initially a Commonwealth project, arising from the meeting of Commonwealth Ministers of External Affairs in Colombo in January 1950, membership soon included non-Commonwealth countries. The United States joined the list of donor countries at the end of 1951, Indonesia joined as a recipient two years later and membership soon broadened to include much of South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia during the decade, including Japan in 1954. Later, the Colombo Plan would also extend to the Middle East and the Pacific. These were all positive developments, yet they provided challenges for information services. According to Phillip Jones, a British Information Officer in participating Sarawak, the main trouble was ‘the Plan’s lack of glamour, drama and apparent humanity.’ It had, he said, ‘no glass tower on the East River, no flag, no stamp, no [Dag] Hammarskjoeld.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022009412461819">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In fact, by the time of this comment (in 1958) there were considerable efforts to build colour and movement into accounts of Colombo Plan activities – and Jones would not have to wait long for the stamp and flag. The Plan took shape amidst intense interest within recently-independent nations in establishing distinctive credentials in a decolonizing world. As early as one year after its launch the Ceylonese Government held a celebratory exhibition, claiming this to be, like the Festival of Britain one year earlier, ‘a new experiment in putting a mirror in front of ourselves for our own benefit as well as that of the outside world – not in a spirit of competition but co-operation with various participating countries.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022009412461819">8</xref></sup> Australia joined with other members in providing an exhibition that was a mixture of demonstrating resources and products that might form the basis of aid and highlighting some cultural attributes. Thereafter, there were fewer flourishes, but those Australians most closely associated with the Colombo Plan in the early and mid-1950s also embarked on information initiatives associated with it. Australian External Affairs Minister, Richard Casey (1951–9) had a taste for propaganda and public relations. Communications and public relations had been significant aspects of his work as Minister to the United States in Washington prior to American entry in the Second World War (where he had also relished learning about J. Walter Thompson strategies); and then, in Cairo, as UK Minister of State in the Middle East, he had become intrigued by the apparent effectiveness of British espionage and deception campaigns. Those who worked on the Colombo Plan with Casey in Canberra during the 1950s worked with a minister who was constantly on the look out for public relations opportunities. It is also important to note that, by the early 1950s, and in the wake of intensive activity during the Second World War, Australian bureaucracies responsible for information were extending their reach. The first popular version of the Colombo Plan, a booklet entitled <italic>New Hope for Asia</italic> produced in 1951, was sent not only to parliamentary representatives and overseas post and libraries, but also to extensive lists provided by the newly-formed Australian News and Information Bureau<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022009412461819">9</xref></sup> (ANIB) and the Commonwealth Office of Education. Some 20,000 copies went to groups including ‘newspapers and publications of many kinds, educational institutions, leaders in public and civic life, teachers, writers, clergy, legal men, business organizations, public servants, employers’ and employees’ associations, and many others.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022009412461819">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In brief, Casey and his officers organized effectively around publicity initiatives, with varying results. An interdepartmental Overseas Planning Committee formed in 1955 oversaw many of these, emphasizing in its guidelines that Australia should be known as a non-threatening power that was also facing development challenges.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022009412461819">11</xref></sup> There was a Cold War ‘struggle for hearts and minds’ dimension to some of these, especially in the crafting of Radio Australia broadcasts and stories for <italic>Hemisphere</italic>, the new Asian/Australian student magazine that ran from 1956 to 1984, and the provision of radio transmitters and receivers from the mid-1950s through the mid-1960s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022009412461819">12</xref></sup> One of the less successful initiatives was a ‘Cheap Books’ scheme, providing works of Australian literature en masse in Asia. This was to be an Australian twist on a Cold War struggle, too, as the Soviets and Chinese were distributing millions of pocket-sized books throughout South Asia. Almost 10,000 copies of several Australian titles, including Ernest Titterton’s <italic>Atomic Energy</italic> and Casey’s own <italic>Friends and Neighbours</italic> were lined up for distribution; but, excepting a good number sent as gifts, they remained in warehouses, as the Australians could not agree on which books to send.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022009412461819">13</xref></sup> More successful were booklets focusing on the experiences of Asian students in Australia. By the end of 1958 the ANIB had produced three such booklets: <italic>My Life in Australia</italic> (1955); <italic>We Look at Australia</italic> (1956); and <italic>Thai Students in Australia</italic> (1957).</p>
<p>There was an understandable interest in the projection of messages to communities of low literacy in South and Southeast Asia by radio and film, as these technologies became more accessible and portable. One of the most popular features of Australia’s pavilion for the 1952 Colombo Plan Exhibition had been a theatrette continuously screening Australia films.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022009412461819">14</xref></sup> Otherwise, partly for reasons of limited budgets, and partly as a result of education and training needs analyses, the Australians placed particular emphasis on sponsored studentships and traineeships for Asians in Australia – and these then became the subject of much information dissemination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022009412461819">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The role of journalists in general began to attract more attention in the mid-1950s; and Australia’s Colombo Plan budget provided for a team of Indian newspaper editors to tour Australia, the first tour of its kind, in 1957. Australians took their lead from others’ innovations in journalism too, as much as they pioneered. Noting the success of a Kodak exhibition of photographs provided by the UN Information Service in 1957, the Department of External Affairs successfully argued that Australia should do likewise with photographs relating to the Colombo Plan. A display of photos depicting Australian activities under the Colombo Plan was held in Melbourne in November 1957; then, in expanded form, featured at the meeting of the Consultative Committee in Seattle a year later; and a similar exhibition featured at the World Trade Fair, also in Seattle, in April 1959.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022009412461819">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>While the workings of the Colombo Plan minimized permanent central offices and relied heavily on annual meetings to compile reports and set directions, this did not stop the growth of a lively group of career-conscious bureaucrats in Colombo itself whose work was to gather and disseminate information about the aid activities. A small Colombo Plan Information Unit was created in 1953–4, and by 1958 it had merged with the Bureau for Technical Co-operation, that side of the plan focusing on education, training and technical expertise. In gathering stories and photos for use in journals and pamphlets, the Bureau more than made up for the lack of a permanent secretariat.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022009412461819">17</xref></sup> In 1957, the regular meeting of members of the Colombo Plan’s Consultative Committee confirmed something of a new era in information activity. The meeting featured strong consensus that members should do more to disseminate information about the plan through established information media – the press, radio and, where possible, television.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022009412461819">18</xref></sup> This meeting came at the end of the first phase of the plan and so constituted something of a report card on the six-year development plans begun in 1951. Although the outcomes of aid programmes varied considerably, as some nations joined the scheme later than others, there was a strong general desire to renew commitments and embark on second phase aid programmes; and so the Colombo Plan began to undergo transformation from its postwar and post-independence circumstances to something more enduring, based on ongoing partnerships. The renewal and transformation meant renewed and new commitments by donor nations, and next phase economic development and training efforts in recipient members. Delegates at the conference agreed that these activities should be accompanied by bold new measures to carry the good word about the plan’s projects further, both at home and overseas. Information with a capital ‘I’ was crucial to a broader-based acceptance among peoples of both donor and recipient nations, of this transformation of the Colombo Plan from postwar experiment to longer-term partnerships between the so–called ‘old Commonwealth’ nations, Japan and the United States, on the one hand and developing nations of South and Southeast Asia on the other (noting that some countries were both donors and beneficiaries of aid).</p>
<p>One immediate outcome was the mobilisation of a new multi-national group of cultural ambassadors, the National Information Officers of participating countries. The first meeting of National Information Officers was in September 1958, in Singapore and was attended by representatives from 17 Colombo Plan member countries as well as the UN Department of Information, the World Health Organization and the Colombo Plan Bureau. The timing of the conference was important. Members were excited that the first film about the Colombo Plan, footage compiled in India from several sources, was due for release the next month; and it was to be followed by another made in Japan, with more from other members scheduled. Lim Yew Hock, Singapore’s Chief Minister, opened the conference by venturing that a collective noun for information officers was logically a ‘battery’ and that they should be given the title, ‘your intensities’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0022009412461819">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hunter Wade, the young New Zealand-born Director of the Colombo Plan Bureau led the conference with the declaration that although there was much that governments could boast about in relation to the Colombo Plan, information work was about more than this; indeed it was ‘an integral part of the machinery of national development.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0022009412461819">20</xref></sup> He argued that sustained national development would only come about through individual and collective enterprise and this depended on thorough levels of understanding and discussion of the tasks at hand. Indeed, Wade stressed the need to think of information as being at the heart of aid endeavours:<disp-quote>
<p>To the extent the information activity in an under-developed country can help mobilize popular support for a vigorous programme of economic and social development, it is a productive activity of the utmost importance. In the same way, the work of information officers in the more highly developed countries can help to build up public support for a programme of technical assistance and capital aid to the less developed countries. Both of these aspects of information work are of concern to the Colombo Plan which, in its widest sense, consists of the application of a blend of national effort and external aid to the development programmes of the countries of the Colombo Plan area. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0022009412461819">21</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Thereafter, delegates spent three and a half days feeling their way (this being the first meting of its kind) through discussions about information technology and capacity and strategies, according to very different levels of capability among members. Chairman of the conference, Singapore’s George Thomson, paid tribute to the collegiality and energy on display in this pioneering collaboration, marvelling also at delegates’ capacity to reach the end of a full day and then face up to 10 courses of Chinese food.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0022009412461819">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Leader of the Australian delegation and head of the Australian News and Information Bureau, Mel Pratt, stressed how much of his work was directed towards publicizing Colombo Plan achievements and drew heavily on Colombo Plan students for its human interest factor. The results took the form of press reports, films, photographs, radio stories and print booklets and Pratt acknowledged the potential of television in Asia in years to come.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0022009412461819">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, there were limits to what member nations might do by way of increased publicity. Many of those recipients of aid had underdeveloped communications infrastructure and were still training cohorts of journalists able to transmit messages to diverse groups within their populations. Partly for this reason (and partly due to a shortage of newsprint), there was a tendency to invest big hopes in the power of the moving image. Films about the Colombo Plan would be able to transcend problems of literacy and stretch imaginations beyond local preoccupations. Representatives from donor countries such as Australia, Canada and the UK promised more assistance with the production, distribution and showing of films, and their enthusiasm was shared by Indian delegate, M.L. Bhardwaj (also Government Registrar of Newspapers) and Colombo Plan Information Officer, R.K. Chatterjee – but the final recommendations embraced the full range of print, poster, film and radio efforts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0022009412461819">24</xref></sup> Towards the end of the meeting, delegates discussed a proposal from the Singapore delegation for there being declared a Colombo Plan Day (1 July, when the aid programmes began in 1951) for celebration in member countries, as another stage of consciousness-raising. This idea enjoyed a mixed reception, with the Australian Mel Pratt amongst the most enthusiastic. In fact, so enthusiastic was Pratt that he vowed to recommend it to his government whether or not it was taken up by others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0022009412461819">25</xref></sup> The Australians and Canadians, in fact, responded immediately, with postage stamps commemorating the first 10 years of the Colombo Plan and for the next 10 years joined in sporadic and ultimately unsuccessful efforts to sustain the idea of Colombo Plan Day.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0022009412461819">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>As the Singapore conference of Information Officers was winding up, an Australian venture in information and publicity was taking shape. The Australian Department of External Affairs had secured the services of former war correspondent Osmar White and cameraman James Fitzpatrick, to undertake an extended tour of Colombo Plan nations in South and Southeast Asia, for around six months, in order to collect human interest stories for newspaper features. The department had worked hard to secure syndication of stories among almost all of the major dailies in Australia, and to produce booklets dealing with Australia’s activities under the Colombo Plan. The aims of the tour, as set down by External Affairs, envisaged three readerships:
<list id="list1-0022009412461819" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>to prepare a booklet on the lines that it should seek to convince potential Australian critics of the value of the Plan in addition to informing the people in Australia who wanted to know something about it.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to prepare a separate booklet to explain to Asians what the Plan did, and Australia’s activities in the Plan, with plenty of stress on the human side.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0022009412461819">27</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list>It was a grand tour with some elaborate orchestration and also some nervousness in External Affairs about what the strong-willed White might discover and which would then end up in his stories. White and Fitzpatrick started their tour in Pakistan in December 1958 before making their way eastwards through the subcontinent towards Southeast Asia. By the time they completed their final visit, in Indonesia, they had toured all but two of the nations (Brunei and Laos) to which Australia was then providing aid.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0022009412461819">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>The pace of the trip and the vagaries of weather and officialdom in different countries made it gruelling, even for White, who reported from Papua New Guinea during the Second World War. Jim Fitzpatrick wrote to his boss several updates in weary but defiant voice, listing significant filming and photography after being ‘whisked off on another bloody tiring trip some 500 miles to the north [of Bangkok] by jeeps, lorries and little planes.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0022009412461819">29</xref></sup> In addition to working hand-in-hand with White for newspaper features and planned moving picture films, Fitzpatrick kept shooting film for the Colombo Plan Library, another manifestation of the Colombo Plan Bureau’s crusade for information gathering. His meeting, early on the tour, with the determined R.K. Chatterjee, was a likely impetus behind this addition to the mission;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0022009412461819">30</xref></sup> and he seemed to take this suggestion in his stride. In fact, prior to departure, Fitzpatrick had been immersed in still and moving picture work relating to Asian students in Asia. In a later interview, he recalled that publicity surrounding the Colombo Plan and around newly arrived immigrants, one of the other great stories of Australian progress in the 1950s, occupied much of his time in the ANIB. By late 1958, he had completed some 40–50 missions to Australian universities and training institutes to capture images of smiling Asian students.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0022009412461819">31</xref></sup> He, as much as White, readily became an ambassador for cultural internationalism, as he stretched beyond his government’s brief. The pair revelled in their pioneering status, especially in relation to the more challenging aspects of filming without a support crew. They were, in White’s words, ‘the only two-man cinema circus extant’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0022009412461819">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>White’s reports back to Canberra make for compelling reading. In general, he was least sanguine about the impact of the Colombo Plan in South Asia and more encouraged by what he saw in Southeast Asia. From the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo two months into the tour, he wrote of having to restrain his newspaper man’s instinct to ‘scream his head off and be damned to the consequences’ in relation to what he saw in Pakistan and India. There were a number of reasons behind this, not least White’s lack of experience in South Asia, his culture shock at the extent of poverty he saw, his frustration with local officials and the seeming insignificance of small amounts of Australian aid in this bigger picture. After something of a personal struggle, in which he seriously thought about going with instinct and penning savage accounts of waste, neglect and ineffectiveness of aid efforts in Pakistan and India, he adjusted to the novelty of what he was seeing and doing; and, with Casey’s encouragement, adopted a compromise blend of reporting problems while anticipating better results ahead.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0022009412461819">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>The many stories published in Australian newspapers then, met External Affairs’ expectations admirably. While White highlighted problems, including waste through misuse or neglect of Australian machinery, he added that such waste was unavoidable in early stages of projects and that aid administrators had ‘learned a great deal about the tricky business of subsidizing what is really adult education on a vast international scale.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0022009412461819">34</xref></sup> In another article he supported the continued and expanded training of Asian students in Australian universities and colleges, but argued that adults with experience enrolled in postgraduate programmes would return to their respective countries with greater ability to translate their learning to home circumstances.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0022009412461819">35</xref></sup> It is less easy to find evidence of White’s reports making an impact in the countries he and Fitzpatrick toured, with the exception of Pakistan, where the press republished a number of his stories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0022009412461819">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Privately, as a former war correspondent, and someone who readily embraced Cold War polarity as a basis for Australia’s efforts in Asia, White was inclined to slip into half-flippant, rapidly-dating discourses and see the Colombo Plan as ‘the only effective weapon our mob has against the Comms in the Mysterious East’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0022009412461819">37</xref></sup> To be fair to White, Moscow had launched a vigorous propaganda campaign in South Asia and had undoubtedly enjoyed a Sputnik shot of extra publicity momentum after October 1957. And to be fair to Canberra, before White and Fitzpatrick set off on their tour, Australian External Affairs officials had tried to play down the Cold War factor. In a pre-departure briefing, External Affairs officer Colin Moodie had steered conversation away from communism and from the idea of ‘buying goodwill’. Moodie had stressed the value of the Colombo Plan in generating personal relationships between Asians and Australians.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0022009412461819">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Upon return, White’s unpublished analysis of the impact of the Colombo Plan, prepared for External Affairs, was encouraging but sobering. His report listed problems that led to waste of money, machinery or trainers’ time, but was generally upbeat about the effect of the Colombo Plan on Australia’s standing in the region – but at the level of officials and the educated elite rather than more broadly. While the Colombo Plan might counter some of the resentment generated by the ‘white Australia’ policy, it was less likely to do so where another significant grievance arose – such as Australia’s resistance to Indonesian sovereignty in West New Guinea. And, longer term, he wrote, ‘Small Australian gifts to worthy enterprises of institutions do not appear to have much psycho-political effect, or to have much chance of creating such an effect unless their human interest value is exploited by a skilled, long-term programme of publicity and information.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0022009412461819">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>The print output for the tour was directed heavily towards Australians. In addition to the regular news stories that appeared in several dailies, one major booklet resulted (rather than two, as originally anticipated) of some 48 pages, incorporating 81 photographs. <italic>The Seed of Freedom</italic> booklet went to 20,000 state schools and high schools in Australia, as well as a long list of libraries, youth and student groups, trade unions, churches, banks, mayors and parliaments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0022009412461819">40</xref></sup> It was published in 1961, coinciding with the tenth anniversary of the Colombo Plan. Some 50,000 were initially produced for Australia; and a run of 20,000 was tailored for Malaya, Singapore and the Borneo Territories, where English language and British influence in education made for greater effect. Measuring the impact of such distribution is always difficult, but as a consciousness raising exercise within Australia it clearly played an important role – there remains today a generation of Australians, over the age of 50 years, with high awareness of the Colombo Plan bringing sponsored Asian students to Australia; and much less awareness that the growing number of private Asian students was around seven times the number of Colombo Plan students by 1961. By this time, Australia’s Colombo Plan had appropriated the bigger and more complex story of Asian students coming to Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0022009412461819">41</xref></sup> An evaluation undertaken three years later, in 1964 revealed that Australia had by then hosted almost 5500 students and trainees, or 16 per cent of all places offered by donor nations under the Colombo Plan. Around one-fifth of all overseas students hosted by Australia in this period studied with Colombo Plan assistance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0022009412461819">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>In his foreword to <italic>The Seed of Freedom</italic>, Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies wrote of the need to get beneath the blueprints and statistics that dominated reports on the Colombo Plan and to recover the ‘human element.’ White’s text and Fitzpatrick’s photographs did just this. The opening pages of the booklet stressed the havoc wreaked by the Second World War, and, in a nod to the non-aligned movement, the logical emergence of new relationships and the threat of nuclear war. In particular, before moving to the particular needs and projects making up the ‘plan’, White wrote of a ‘new concept of internationalism’ as means of orientation beyond imperialism and Cold War:<disp-quote>
<p>The old internationalism of empire was based on the political and economic subordination of subject peoples. The new ideological internationalism of Communism holds out the promise of economic and social development by abandoning all forms of political freedom and by abolishing the individual’s right of economic choice. The Colombo Plan postulates that an alternative internationalism is possible – the internationalism of mutual aid and co-operation without the sacrifice of freedom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0022009412461819">43</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>The connection between human interest stories and the new internationalism was popular refrain by this time, in both Australian and Colombo Plan meetings. Phillip Jones, already cited, at the 1958 Information Officers meeting couched it in typically journalistic equation, ‘One student, one teacher, is for our present publicity purposes worth a dozen reactors and dams which cannot by any means yet be made to touch the hearts and minds of the people.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0022009412461819">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>As a moment in documentary film-making the White-Fitzpatrick tour was a signal one. Fitzpatrick had been recruited to take still photos that would accompany White’s newspaper articles. It was only an act of bravado that led him to lug along a movie camera, in the hope that he might be able to cajole White into making a two-man team do the work of what normally took eight. Although it is White’s reporting of the trip, and White’s newspaper stories, that dominate the record, Fitzpatrick’s achievement in shooting and sending thousands of hours of film material back was extraordinary. There was no budget for it, but the sheer volume of high quality material demanded attention; and upon return, Fitzpatrick managed to secure funds for both commentary and a musical score by the Sydney Symphonic Orchestra – adding another dimension of cultural exchange that was not anticipated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0022009412461819">45</xref></sup> The resulting 30-minute film, <italic>The Builders</italic>, more than took the place of a second booklet, as it travelled widely and successfully.</p>
<p>Three extracts from <italic>The Builders</italic> were syndicated to the British and Canadian Broadcasting Commissions, the NHK National Network of Japan, and one extract travelled to Switzerland, the Netherlands, France and Mexico. The full film became a television documentary screened throughout North America and Europe, and by March 1960 it had reached 15 European nations. So, a potential audience of 75 million viewers heard the narrator conclude by celebrating the four freedoms as the basis for the region’s future and gesture towards a new pluralism:<disp-quote>
<p>The people of South, and of South-East Asia, are climbing out of the valley. Out of the valley of the past into a future of their own building. A building in which we, their friends and neighbours, are playing a part. This future has its roots and foundations in freedom to worship, each after his own fashion; to give praise and thanks for the gift of life in a world of widening horizons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0022009412461819">46</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Again, Australian schools were the main beneficiaries of renewed emphasis on internal distribution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0022009412461819">47</xref></sup> As the above list of countries suggests, it was easier to use outside Asia, as the attempt to capture stories from many locations meant that officials of any particular member nation were likely to feel that their experiences should have enjoyed greater prominence. But the value of Asian-based journalists being deployed on Colombo Plan stories was not lost on the Australians who trained some 32 journalists from 13 countries between 1958 and 1960.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0022009412461819">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>At a very general level, these activities matched the transition process I have mentioned of the Colombo Plan changing from postwar, post-independence to a slowly emerging series of longer term partnerships between Australia and beneficiary members of the Colombo Plan in South and Southeast Asia. The Australian emphasis on education and training had a logic that was specific to circumstances; but, in a broader realm, it also matched with other international initiatives. A focus on training and technical assistance grew from US President Harry Truman’s Point Four aid initiative of 1949, bringing aid and scientific progress to countries most in need and endured during the 1950s and 1960s before being somewhat overshadowed by the later flurry of educational and intellectual exchange programs in the 1970s, in forms such as the German-Marshall Fund, the Japan Foundation and other new organizations.</p>
<p>What I have tentatively called human-story cultural internationalism was in part a response to the problem of managing geography, cultural difference and potentially soporific macro-economics in a digestible way. Although this form of cultural internationalism responded to the circumstances of the Colombo Plan, it also carried a broader liberal impulse that survived and flourished after the Second World War into optimism about the impact of advances in communications technology – the kind of enthusiasm that relished wider use of the telephone, radio and cinema and that awaited satellites to make simultaneous world-wide television viewing possible. Wendell Willkie’s famous war-time air trip around the world in 49 days, yielding the best-selling book <italic>One World</italic> (1943), had excited readers in its message of distances smashed by air travel and interdependence between different parts of the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0022009412461819">49</xref></sup> Seventeen years later, in their film, <italic>The Builders</italic>, Fitzpatrick and White brought the same sense of excitement to a world becoming smaller through even more advanced communications. The opening voice-over narrative to the film drove this point home:<disp-quote>
<p>These are the people of South and South East Asia. They are Australia’s neighbours – citizens of Singapore – Karachi, or Bombay maybe. They are the population of countless teeming cities all now reached in a single day’s flight from Australia’s shores.</p>
<p>Only a generation ago these were the faraway places. They were the places that lay over the rim of a world that was still big and divided into many parts.</p>
<p>There seemed no link between the destiny of Asian people and the destiny of Australians. Even the pattern of poverty was different between East that was East, and the West that was West. …</p>
<p>But, today the world is smaller – there are no faraway places any more.</p>
<p>These lands, these cities, these people are Australia’s neighbours – and no man can afford to ignore his neighbours, or remain unconcerned by the road they choose to travel – or shut his eyes to their aspirations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0022009412461819">50</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Asia as ‘other’ was still close to the surface here, with its ‘teeming cities’. Similarly, the neighbourliness urged herein lacked empathy, but in the many human cases studies that followed in the rest of the film, Australians were being encouraged to graft on a measure of racial pluralism with the more instrumental view of interdependence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0022009412461819">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>Connecting this case study of pioneering journalists in the late 1950s to current conversations about public diplomacy is arguably more ambitious; but Gregory’s and Cull’s guidelines are at least partly helpful. The Australians’ efforts in the late 1950s and early 1960s to create and transmit messages about their efforts towards assisting Asian development suggest a strong consciousness of the need to <italic>build and manage</italic> relationships and to <italic>influence</italic> opinions, two of the three key actions suggested by Gregory as integral to public diplomacy. That these relationships and the opinions might have been internal ones, in Australia, as well as relationships and opinions in Asia need not detract from Australians’ awareness of the need for convincing narratives built on human interest stories. Gregory’s other action, that of <italic>understanding</italic> cultures, attitudes and behaviour struggled to transcend Cold War lenses and over half a century of restrictive immigration aimed at keeping Asians out of Australia, but the Colombo Plan was a quiet engine of gradual mutual understanding. Its Consultative Committee provided for regular meetings, its Colombo-based bureaucracy helped fuel a new intensity of information activities, and a small but significant cohort of Asian elites forged bonds with Australians through studying and training there.</p>
<p>A similar conclusion can be drawn when considering Cull’s emphasis on listening as the most important dimension to public diplomacy. There are three big differences between Cull’s exploration of the USIA and information activity linked to the Colombo Plan in the late 1950s and early 1960s. One is the difficulty for Australians to address more than an educated elite with English literacy – translation of print materials was expanding but only around 1960 and not in volumes suggesting confidence. The lack of developed information infrastructure in many countries is another key difference. Print material, machinery relating to film, photography, radio, and the power generation on which all of these depended, were at much lower levels than existed, for example, in communist Europe. Among Cull’s other activities, the Australians undertook international broadcasting and considerable exchange diplomacy, in the form of students and trainees coming to Australia and also Australian experts travelling to Asia to assist with projects; and although it remains hard to assess their impact, activities such as photographic and other exhibitions, film-screening and donation of books suggest a nascent cultural diplomacy via the Colombo Plan.</p>
<p>Australians’ persuasive effort directed internally, at the Australian public, marks the White-Fitzpatrick tour as substantially different from Cull’s USIA. In addition to those who knew too little, there was a critical public – or at least critical voices of influence – in Australia in the background to the White and Fitzpatrick tour. Newspaper editors grew anxious about spending on the Colombo Plan in the late 1950s. In particular, one disgruntled Australian, former UN Food and Agricultural Organisation adviser, Reginald Cunningham, was a persistent complainant about waste under the Colombo Plan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0022009412461819">52</xref></sup> Not surprisingly, then, External Affairs saw the White–Fitzpatrick tour as an opportunity ‘to convince potential Australian critics of the value of the Plan in addition to informing the people in Australia who wanted to know something about it.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0022009412461819">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the wake of the tour, at the next meeting of Colombo Plan Information Officers, in 1960, Australians were able to boast <italic>The Seed of Freedom</italic> as a major contribution to the tenth anniversary approaching; list more visits by and training for, Asian journalists, and boast translation of press material and pamphlets into Thai, Malay, Urdu, Tamil, Vietnamese and Chinese languages. The Australians were committed to news around anniversaries; not just the Colombo Plan’s tenth, but the arrival of the 1000th Colombo Plan trainee, the 2000th trainee and other milestones that could be found.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0022009412461819">54</xref></sup> They were, by the early 1960s, very familiar with the notion of the journalists’ ‘hook’ on which to hang a story.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important not to equate the amount of Australia’s information activity in Asia with a sea-change in official attitudes, implying broad embrace of racial pluralism. This shift of mind-set would come more gradually over the next decade, and, taking a cue from White and Fitzpatrick, we might credit the Colombo Plan efforts as ‘Builders’ of bridges between the more liberal internationalists in Australia and the more Cold War realists. But there is a sense of becoming pro-active in Asia (the term ‘follow-up’ was emphasized in External Affairs’ hopes for the impact of the tour)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0022009412461819">55</xref></sup> that warrants exploration of the late 1950s-early 1960s in terms of the multiple levels of agency implicit in the notion of public diplomacy.</p>
