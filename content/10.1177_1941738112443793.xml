<title>TeamMates Reception at CSM Enormous Success</title>
<p>The First-Timer’s Breakfast is a tradition for SPTS at CSM. TeamMates was introduced at CSM 2011 and was so well received that TeamMates at TCC was introduced in December. Over 50 first-timers, students, and young professionals met with SPTS mentors for this event.</p>
<p>Students, those who are new to sports physical therapy, and those who are attending their first CSM are invited to partner with seasoned members who attend Sports Section programming regularly. New members are called “rookies,” and the seasoned members are referred to as “captains.” Rookie and captain TeamMates receive contact information and introductions via e-mail prior to attending CSM to “meet” each other in advance, then have the opportunity to meet face-to-face at the event.</p>
<p>At CSM 2012, an estimated 150 people flooded the single-room reception, requiring the opening of an additional room. Still, there were people chatting in the hallways up to the 8 <sc>am</sc> close time. “It’s obvious from this response that students and young professionals are seeking guidance from and communication with experienced SPTS members,” says Jennifer Miller, SPTS public relations coordinator, “and our members are more than willing to give generously of their time and talents. We’re thrilled at the response and look forward to expanding this program at TCC 2012 and CSM 2013.”</p>
