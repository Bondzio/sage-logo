<abstract>
<p>This study aimed to evaluate whether computed tomography improves the intra- and inter-observer reliability of the Eaton–Glickel classification of trapeziometacarpal joint osteoarthritis. The osteoarthritis of the trapeziometacarpal joint was evaluated with conventional radiographs and computed tomography by two hand surgeons, two registrars and one radiologist in 50 hands of 43 patients (12 male and 31 female) who had a median age of 60 years (46–80). Using plain radiographs, we found a mean intra-observer reliability of 0.54 (0.51–0.74), and the intra-observer reliability was improved to 0.76 (0.64–0.86) using computed tomography. Using plain radiographs, the mean inter-observer reliability was poor at 0.17 (0.04–0.51) and did not improve using computed tomography with a mean inter-observer reliability of 0.22 (0.02–0.38). In particular, the agreement in the distinction between Eaton–Glickel stage III and IV and the evaluation of the degenerative changes in the scaphotrapezio joint was low using computed tomography-scans. The detection of bone cysts on computed tomography was more precise than on plain radiographs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Classification systems are important clinical and research tools for communication and classification. Several different classification systems exist, both for the general skeletal system as well as classification systems for individual joints. In the classification of trapeziometacarpal (TM) osteoarthritis of the first finger, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412443502">Eaton and Littler (1973)</xref> described a classification system that was based on changes in joint space, osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis and subluxation, and this classification was evaluated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412443502">Spaans et al. (2011)</xref>, who found a moderate inter-observer reliability. Later, Eaton and Glickel modified the classification system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412443502">1987</xref>) and added degenerative changes in the scaphotrapezio (ST) joint. Furthermore, subluxation was no longer included in stage II as it was in the Eaton–Littler version and only contributed a minor part of stage III and IV. Since published, the Eaton–Glickel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412443502">Eaton and Glickel, 1987</xref>) classification has been widely used in the classification of trapeziometacarpal (TM) joint osteoarthritis, but the inter and intra-observer reliability have been found to be poor to moderate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193412443502">Kubik and Lubahn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412443502">Dela Rosa et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>TM-joint osteoarthritis may be treated with total joint arthroplasty with good short-term clinical results compared with trapeziectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412443502">Ulrich-Vinther et al., 2008</xref>). Choosing between total joint arthroplasty and trapeziectomy requires an evaluation of the degenerative changes in the ST joint, as degenerative changes may theoretically result in less reduction in pain after surgery if a TM total joint arthroplasty and a degenerated ST joint are combined. Degenerative changes in the ST joint are often poorly visualized on plain radiographs of the TM joint, and computed tomography (CT) may improve visualization and make it easier to choose between total joint arthroplasty and trapeziectomy. In addition, high loosening rates of trapezium implants have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412443502">Alnot and Saint Laurent, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412443502">Wachtl et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412443502">van Capelle et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412443502">Perez-Ubeda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412443502">Hansen and Vainorius, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412443502">Hansen and Snerum, 2008</xref>). Implant failure is most likely caused by several independent factors including poor initial implant fixation. Bone cysts may be poorly visualized on plain radiographs, and undetected large bone cysts may weaken implant fixation if they are not treated with curettage and bone transplantation. Because CT scans of the TM joint have been used only occasionally in our preoperative assessment before choosing between total joint arthroplasty or trapeziectomy, the aim of this study was to investigate a larger group of patients to explore the benefits of CT in the preoperative evaluation of the TM joint and to determine whether CT scans would improve the inter- and intra-observer reliability of the Eaton–Glickel classification.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Fifty hands of 43 patients (12 male and 31 female, with a mean age of 60 years (46–80)) with osteoarthritis of the TM joint were included in the study. All patients had been evaluated for operative treatment with either trapeziectomy or total joint replacement based on conventional radiographs (anterio-posterior (AP) and lateral view) and CT scans (horizontal and vertical scan with 2 mm slices). All radiographs and CT scans were evaluated by two hand surgeons, two registrars and one radiologist. One hand surgeon had a special interest in TM osteoarthritis and was experienced with the Eaton–Glickel classification, whereas the other hand surgeon had neither a special interest in TM-osteoarthritis nor experience with the Eaton–Glickel classification; the registrars and the radiologist had no previous experience with the Eaton–Glickel classification. All observers were provided with the Eaton–Glickel classification as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412443502">Table 1</xref> without instructions, and no consensus was achieved among the observers regarding the interpretation of the classification system. First, the conventional radiographs were classified in a random order according to the Eaton–Glickel classification followed by the CT scans in a new random order. All radiographs and CT scans were also evaluated for the presence of bone cysts in the trapezium with a diameter larger than 2 mm. The procedure was repeated with evaluations by all individual observers after 4-6 weeks.</p>

<p>Statistical analyses were performed using kappa values, and the values for both intra- and inter-observer agreement were calculated, as were the kappa values for both the evaluation of the radiographs and the evaluation of the CT scans for the bone cysts.

<title>Results</title>
<p>Using plain radiographs, we found a mean intra-observer reliability of 0.54 (0.51–0.74), and using CT scans, the intra-observer reliability was improved to 0.76 (0.64–0.86). Both hand surgeons had a very good intra-observer reliability using CT scans with a kappa value of 0.84 and 0.86, whereas the radiologist had a kappa value of 0.76, and the residents had kappa values of 0.64 and 0.71 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753193412443502">Table 2</xref>). However, using plain radiographs, the mean inter-observer reliability was poor at 0.17 (0.04–0.51), which did not improve using CT with a mean interobserver reliability of 0.22 (0.02–0.38). In particular, the agreement in the distinction between Eaton–Glickel stage III and IV and the evaluation of the degenerative changes in the ST joint was low using CT scans. In the second evaluation, one hand surgeon classified 27/50 hands as stage IV, and the other hand surgeon classified only 10/50 hands as stage IV. In the distinction between stage III and IV, the two hand surgeons disagreed in 17/27 hands, indicating a very different interpretation of the narrowing of the ST joint on the CT scans. Comparing bone cyst detection on plain radiographs with the detection of bone cysts on CT scans, we found a poor intra-observer reliability with a mean kappa of 0.18 (0.11–0.30), indicating that bone cysts are difficult to detect on plain radiographs but are easy to detect on CT scans, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412443502">Figure 1</xref>. The hand surgeons found bone cysts larger than 2 mm in 12/50 hands (observer 1) and 9/50 hands (observer 2) on plain radiographs. Using CT scans, the number of trapeziums with bone cysts larger than 2 mm increased to 39/50 (observer 1) and 33/50 (observer 2), and the two hand surgeons disagreed only in 9/50 patients.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The moderate intra-observer reliability of the radiographic evaluation in this study is the same as that found in other studies. Using CT improved the intra-observer reliability from moderate to good, and for both hand surgeons, the kappa value was above 0.80, indicating very good intra-observer reliability. However, the inter-observer reliability was poor when all observers were compared for both plain radiographs and CT scans. This trend has also been described in studies evaluating radiographs of the knee joint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412443502">Mehta et al., 2007</xref>). If the classification system is not simple, the observers form their own interpretation of the classification system, which results in poor inter-observer reliability. Even when there was familiarity with the classification system, the kappa values in other studies have been only poor to moderate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193412443502">Kubik and Lubahn (2002)</xref> tested the intra- and inter-observer reliability of hand surgeons and orthopaedic residents who were familiar with the Eaton–Glickel classification and found only a moderate intra- and inter-observer reliability in hand surgeons and a moderate intra-observer reliability and poor inter-observer reliability in residents. In the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412443502">Dela Rosa et al. (2004)</xref>, only highly experienced hand surgeons evaluated the radiographs and the overall inter-observer reliability was only moderate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412443502">Spaans et al. (2011)</xref> found only a moderate inter-observer reliability of the Eaton–Littler classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412443502">Eaton and Littler, 1973</xref>) using five radiologists who were experienced with hand and wrist imaging and eight hand surgeons as observers. The Eaton–Glickel classification system is not very simple, and in our study, the observers used the classification system without instructions or consensus, and only one observer had used it extensively before the study, which resulted in a very low kappa value for inter-observer reliability. The interpretation of the degenerative changes in the ST joint on CT scans was especially problematic, as this was the main reason why we found a poor inter-observer reliability between the hand surgeons. Furthermore, CT may lead to the over diagnosis of degenerative changes in the ST joint without clinical relevance, and further studies are needed to determine whether discrete joint narrowing of the ST joint, as visualized on CT, influences the clinical results after total joint arthroplasty. Using CT scans, we found that in a large number of patients’ bone cysts that were larger than 2 mm were not visible on plain radiographs. Bone cysts may require curettage and bone grafting during total joint arthroplasty and large bone cysts may require a trapeziectomy instead of total joint arthroplasty. These findings support the use of CT scans for the preoperative evaluation before choosing between total joint arthroplasty and trapeziectomy. However, to date, we have not determined how much the presence of bone cysts increases the risk of implant failure; the present study does not support the routine use of CT scans in all patients during preoperative evaluation. We suggest that future studies should focus on determining the influence of bone cysts on implant failure. To date, we have chosen to use CT scans in the evaluation of patients with Eaton–Glickel stage III degenerative changes on plain radiographs before treatment with total joint arthroplasty.</p>
