<abstract>
<p>Clinical intuition is a common experience among counselors, yet many do not know what to do with intuition when it occurs. This article reviews the role intuition plays in clinical work and presents the research-based Clinical Intuition Exploration Guide to help counselors navigate the decision-making process. The guide consists of self-reflection questions to assist counselors in developing self-awareness, interpreting intuition, making ethical decisions, and evaluating the process of intuition. A case illustration demonstrates how counselors can employ the Clinical Intuition Exploration Guide. Implications for clinical work and supervision are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>A common challenge encountered by many counselors is the experience of having a gut-level feeling about a client and yet not knowing what to do with that experience. Intuition has been described as a unique way of knowing where one comes to some knowledge without evident rational thought or inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480711425469">Carson, 1999</xref>). Others have articulated that it is a “feeling of knowing with certitude on the basis of inadequate information and without conscious awareness of rational thinking” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480711425469">Shirley &amp; Langan-Fox, 1996</xref>, p. 564). The phenomenon of knowing something and yet not knowing how one came to know it repeatedly invites counselors to navigate their personal thoughts and feelings within their professional roles and make the best decisions as to what to do with that information. Unfortunately, counselors often have little formal training in interpreting personal intuition and making appropriate professional decisions.</p>
<p>Clinical intuition brings into account two important aspects of a counselor—the self and the role of the counselor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480711425469">Rober (1999</xref>, p. 214) stated that the self is “the experiencing process of the therapist and reflects the therapist as a human being and a participant in the conversation.” The self includes feelings, thoughts, reactions, and other experiences germane to being human. The role of a counselor identifies the function of the professional as one who facilitates the process of counseling. This role provides specific tasks, responsibilities, and boundaries that the counselor must operate within. One task of a counselor is to facilitate a balance between one’s personal experiences in the counseling relationship and the professional role one plays in that relationship.</p>
<p>Moments of clinical intuition take place within the self of the counselor, yet must be acted upon in the specific role of a counselor. When confronted with perplexing situations at that junction, many counselors often look to consultation with supervisors and colleagues to make ethical decisions. To this point, there has been little guidance as to how to address clinical intuition in that intersection. The guide presented in this article in intended to be used as a tool for use in self-supervision and in providing supervision to others. The guide lays out a self-reflective framework for developing an awareness of intuitive moments, interpreting them, and making decisions as to how to respond in one’s professional role. The role of intuition in clinical work will first be discussed as a foundation for use of the guide.</p>
<sec id="section1-1066480711425469">
<title>The Role of Intuition in Clinical Work</title>
<p>In the last decade, an increasing amount of literature has given credibility to clinical intuition and its role in counseling and psychotherapy. Intuitive discovery has been said to develop best in a therapeutic environment that fosters trust and confidentiality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480711425469">Garcia &amp; Ford, 2001</xref>). Affective attunement and counselor self-awareness have been discussed as important factors facilitating intuition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066480711425469">Bove &amp; Rizzi, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480711425469">Laub (2006)</xref> asserted that intuition can be an important tool in “evaluating a tangled mass of feelings, ideas, and desires” (p. 88) by listening for symbolic communication. Among one sample of psychologists and psychotherapists, clinical intuition was identified as one of the most influential aspects of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480711425469">Lucock, Hall, &amp; Noble, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Intuition encompasses a broad range of ways of knowing in clinical work and can occur in diverse ways for counselors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480711425469">Vaughan (1979)</xref> discussed intuition as a source of knowledge that can present itself at four levels of awareness: physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual. Intuition at the physical level could consist of gut feelings or other bodily sensations. Knowledge received intuitively at the emotional level comes through sensitivity to one’s own and others' feelings. Mental intuition is an ability to make in-the-moment decisions and conclusions based upon insufficient knowledge or without evident rational thought. The spiritual level of intuition transcends other ways of rational knowing and provides a “holistic understanding of actuality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480711425469">Shirley &amp; Langan-Fox, 1996</xref>, p. 567). Recent research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480711425469">Jeffrey &amp; Stone Fish, 2011</xref>) verifies that marriage and family therapists (MFTs) experience intuitive insight in all of these forms.</p>
<p>The impetus and foundation for intuitive moments can be varied, and not all scholars agree on what constitutes intuition. With over 40 definitions of intuition postulated in psychological literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066480711425469">Sprenkle, 2005</xref>), it is evident that “there is no consensus” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480711425469">Shirley &amp; Langan-Fox, 1996</xref>, p. 565) on one hard and fast definition. While this may leave some clinicians wondering if what they experience is, in fact, intuition, it also provides opportunity and permission for clinicians to explore impressions and insights they might not have otherwise. For the purpose of this article, intuition is assumed to be any experience in which one comes to some knowledge without evident rational processes or on the basis of insufficient information.</p>
<p>Although the means through which intuition occurs may be varied, intuition tends to serve two primary purposes. Intuition provides an additional source of information in counseling and acts as a clinical guide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066480711425469">Bove &amp; Rizzi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480711425469">Garcia &amp; Ford, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066480711425469">Rea, 2001</xref>). At a fundamental level, the process of counseling and therapy is one of gathering information and making choices about the most beneficial interventions and treatment options. Attunement to one’s thoughts, feelings, and body can provide an additional level of information about clients. When thought of as a sixth sense, intuition can provide clues about information the client is not expressing, the status of the therapeutic relationship, areas of needed inquiry, and warning signs related to the counseling process.</p>
<p>In discussing the value of intuition in counseling, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480711425469">Eisengart and Faiver (1996)</xref> stated that counselors,<disp-quote>
<p>must try to maintain a therapeutic connection to the client while trying to measure and understand the significance of all the messages, formulate some sort of organizing principle, choose from several plausible alternative interventions, and respond most appropriately. Using intuition can enrich the [counselor’s] repertoire of therapeutic skills and can provide a significant avenue for helping the client. (pp. 47–48)</p>
</disp-quote>Thus, the quick and ready information attained through intuitive awareness can aid counselors in making decisions and guiding sessions to that which is most beneficial to the client.</p>
<p>Speaking specifically of working with relational dynamics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480711425469">Carson (1999)</xref> stated, “Experienced therapists seem to rely heavily on their intuition when seeking to understand problematic relationships and facilitate change in couples and family systems” (p. 4). Among the many ways he noted that intuition can be helpful, he highlighted its beneficial role in “clarifying problems (hypothesis formulation and testing), helping clients identify feelings, reading subtle, nonverbal behaviors and picking up on what is not being communicated by family members” (1999, p. 4). It seems that for marriage and family counselors, intuition may provide a specific benefit in providing a relational understanding in the client–counselor relationship.</p>
<p>Despite the value and benefits seen as arising from intuition, “we may either fail to notice or disregard important intuitive insight” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066480711425469">Rea, 2001</xref>, p. 102), due to the lack of awareness and understanding around intuition. This is often the case because counselors may not have been trained to attend to the gut hunches, sudden ideas, flashes of understanding, and physical sensations through which intuition can present itself. If they do become aware of these things, counselors may not subject those experiences to close reflection as is necessary. The process of facilitating an internal dialogue between the self of the counselor and one’s role is critical for counselors to be able to cognitively reflect on their intuition to make a meaningful analysis of its value and purpose for inclusion in their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066480711425469">Williams &amp; Irving, 1996</xref>). The Clinical Intuition Exploration Guide, as will be discussed below, serves the purpose of facilitating this process for counselors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1066480711425469">
<title>The Clinical Intuition Exploration Guide</title>
<p>The Clinical Intuition Exploration Guide was developed out of research on the intuitive experiences of MFTs. In an effort to learn more about the views and process of clinical intuition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480711425469">Jeffrey and Stone Fish (2011)</xref> conducted a phenomenological qualitative study of eight MFTs. The study involved one-on-one interviews with five male and three female professionals, who were in practice between 8 and 40 years and whose theoretical perspectives were varied. The convenience sample of MFTs, who had by self-report experienced intuition, was predominantly European American, with one person identifying as African American.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is not to report on the findings of this research, but it is mentioned to identify it as a foundational element to the guide. One of the findings from this research was that the process of experiencing intuition is not as random as many believe it to be. Multiple participants reported a process of developing self-awareness, clearing out, or attuning themselves prior to a session, experiencing the intuition, and then having to make decisions about what to do with that information. In reflecting on this process, the author identified concrete steps that people tend to encounter with intuition. Self-exploration questions were then developed to help counselors foster a better understanding of their intuitive side in each step. To test the process of the Clinical Intuition Exploration Guide, the author had supervisees use it to process their own intuitive moments and give feedback about the flow and experience of the exploration. The result was an exploratory guide that not only helped counselors to tease out the details of their own intuitions but also provided guidance in making decisions about the intuition while taking into account ethical factors.</p>
<p>As an exploratory framework, this guide provides questions to help counselors reflect on their experience and identify answers based on their own self-exploration. The fact that the process is less prescriptive and more self-reflection-based is due to the reality that each person’s intuition may take different forms and have different meanings. This tool provides prompting inquiries that move the clinician from a place of self-understanding through the process of taking action and into an evaluative stance to learn from intuitive experiences. The six steps of the guide (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1066480711425469">Appendix A</xref>) are attunement, experience, interpretation, decision making, action, and evaluation. Questions for each step will be presented and discussed below.</p>
<sec id="section3-1066480711425469">
<title>Attunement</title>
<p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>When you look at your life generally right now, how would you describe it?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How did you feel prior to and throughout the session with your client (consider mental, emotional, physical, spiritual, relational processes)?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Was there something that you or your client did that may have fostered the intuitive experience?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480711425469">Goleman (1995)</xref>, an emotional intelligence researcher, wrote that, “attunement to others demands a modicum of calm in oneself” (p. 112). Applying that concept to counseling, we can assume that in order for counselors to be in attunement with the intuition that arises from the therapeutic relationship, there must be a level of inner awareness and calmness. This attunement takes place in two levels. The first level is a general awareness or understanding of the status of one’s life. This understanding might involve an assessment of one’s current stress level, significant personal issues, and current well-being. This general self-of-the-counselor work is important so that one does not mistake personal reactivity based on one’s own issues for intuitive experiences.</p>
<p>The second level of intuitive awareness is a more present-focused, here-and-now attentiveness. It deals with how the counselor is feeling in the moment just prior to, during, or after a session with a client. When counselors are more presently attuned to their thoughts, bodies, and dynamics in the counselor–client relationship, they are more likely to foster and become aware of intuitive moments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480711425469">Epstein, 2003</xref>). Exploratory questions about one’s own attunement can provide insights into factors that invite or repel intuitive experiences.</p>
<p>This multilevel attunement is also multidirected. Part of the skill of developing one’s intuition is honing one’s dyadic awareness. Dyadic awareness is the ability to attend to both levels of personal awareness (i.e., general and present-focused awareness) and be perceptive to cues and information in the counselor–client relationship. Thus, information pertaining to the world within oneself and between the therapist and client are simultaneously processed to open the pathway to intuitive promptings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1066480711425469">
<title>Experience</title>
<p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>How did you experience the intuition (consider mental, emotional, physical, spiritual, and relational processes)?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What triggered your recognition of an intuitive thought or prompting?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What was your immediate reaction to the intuitive experience?</p>
</list-item>
</list>The process of reflecting on intuitive moments involves the counselor becoming personally aware of how she experienced a particular intuition. Although there are some common ways that people encounter intuition (e.g., sensation around the solar plexus area or gut, flashes of understanding, and an unsettled feeling), each person will have their own unique experience. The questions in this step aim to help the counselor think about what form the intuition occurred in, as well as possible precipitating factors of the event or awareness of the event. Finally, initial reactions to the intuition are reflected upon to serve as an initial assessment of what meaning it might have and to move into the process of interpretation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1066480711425469">
<title>Interpretation</title>
<p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>How did your intuition relate to the client situation or to your life?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What meaning does the intuition have for you? What meaning might it have for your client?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How do your values, beliefs, and biases inform this experience?</p>
</list-item>
</list>Interpretation of intuitive experiences is a process of ascribing meaning. In this step, counselors are invited to reflect on how the intuition could relate to their own lives or that of the client. One can make meaning based on rational connection points to the person’s life or make metaphorical associations based on what is known of the client, oneself, or the therapeutic relationship.</p>
<p>In the task of interpretation, the counselor will also encounter the first ethics check in this process. One is asked to reflect on the influence of one’s values, beliefs, and biases concerning the intuition and client, as any or all of these might color the meaning made of the intuition. Assessing the intersection of the self and one’s professional role is a critical step in respecting the client and making ethical choices. When the counselor can draw distinctions about what material is suited to the client versus what might be for personal reflection, she respects both the experience of the intuition and the purpose for which it was intended.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480711425469">Kitchner’s (1984)</xref> ethical decision-making model, he identified two process levels in evaluating difficult situations. The first is the intuitive level in which initial feelings and reactions are attended to and assessed alongside personal beliefs and morals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480711425469">Kitchner, 1986</xref>). The second level is a critical evaluative one in which the situation is analyzed against professional codes and ethical principles (1986). The interpretation step in this guide relates to the primary intuitive level of making sense of the intuition and the counselor’s personal influence on the intuitive experience. In the next step, counselors are invited into a more critical evaluative position in making decisions about what actions to take.</p>
<p>A challenge counselors may face in this step is establishing a connection point to either oneself or the client. This is difficult especially when intuitive moments are powerful yet seem unrelated. In these moments, it is important to recognize that, at minimum, an intuitive moment has occurred so as to honor it, and then thoughtfully proceed to the next step of decision making where further evaluation is pursued.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1066480711425469">
<title>Decision Making</title>
<p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Is the intuitive experience for your knowledge and understanding, or would there be benefit in sharing it with the client?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How would sharing an intuition influence or impact your client? What potential harm or damage could this have to the client or the therapeutic relationship?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How can this experience inform your interventions or direction of therapy?</p>
</list-item>
</list>The step of decision making is a critical one in this process. In deciding on a path to take with the intuition, one could provide an opportunity for self or client discovery, or interject a piece of information that may not resonate with the client. It is therefore crucial to conduct an honest assessment of the meaning and potential effects of sharing the intuition on the clinical relationship. Here, the counselor is asked to reflect on the possible harm or benefit of sharing the intuition and the potential impact on the relationship. This step provides a second ethics check to ensure that, although an intuitive moment may feel pressing to the clinician, the benefit of the client should remain the paramount concern. Professional ethics should be a checking point against which decisions about intuition are balanced.</p>
<p>Depending on the severity or immediacy of the intuition (e.g., a feeling that a client will harm himself when he leaves your office), counselors may need to make quick decisions about a course of action. In instances such as these, the initial intuitive evaluation may serve as a more ready influence in decision making. Nonetheless, with all poignant intuitions, the critical evaluative step, even if engaged in after the situation is resolved can be instructive to working through future intuitive moments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1066480711425469">
<title>Action</title>
<p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>What action, if any, do/did you need to take to honor the intuitive moment?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>If you feel like an intuitive experience needs to be shared, when would the client be most receptive to it?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How would you respond if you share/act on the intuitive material with a client and it is not received well?</p>
</list-item>
</list>Once a tentative meaning has been made of the intuition and the process of decision making explored, one must take the appropriate action concerning the intuitive moment. Honoring intuitive moments, whether they are shared with the client or not, shows that one values the process and invites further intuition. If sharing or acting on an intuition is deemed appropriate, the counselor is asked to reflect on how best that might happen and what could occur if it is not received well.</p>
<p>One action that counselors may find instructive is to recognize an intuitive moment and then, if it is not pressing, hold on to it and wait for further insight or corroborating evidence. This holding is an action in and of itself and both honors the intuition as it happened and respects the client in gathering additional information. Often, seeking further information helps to substantiate the intuition and can open greater opportunities for discussing it in session.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1066480711425469">
<title>Evaluation</title>
<p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>How did your client respond to your actions?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How did your actions influence the therapeutic relationship and process of therapy?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How might you respond differently, if necessary, the next time you have a similar experience?</p>
</list-item>
</list>Although this entire process can be thought of as an evaluative one, the focus of this step is to reflect on the impact of the counselor’s actions in responding to an intuitive moment. In doing this, one has the chance to learn about how best to deal with intuitions by assessing their influence on the counseling relationship, in part due to how the client responded to one’s actions. This is also an opportunity to reflect on the meaning of why an intuition may not have connected with a client.</p>
<p>One of the main advantages to using the Clinical Intuition Exploration Guide is that it provides a flexible structure in which to understand personal experiences. Although the guide is laid out in a step-by-step format, it is assumed that this is more of a circular process than a linear one. For example, throughout this process, one might continually be striving to ascribe appropriate meaning to the unfolding of events while balancing those against one’s personal values. It is also likely that a counselor would be continually monitoring her self-attunement to make best sense of the intuition and other experiences connected to it.</p>
<p>The in-depth process of questioning oneself and reflecting, when first engaged in, may be slow to walk through. But after many experiences of processing and evaluating, the process can become more fluid and quick. What initially might take one 15–20 minutes to reflect on after session with a client may become a very natural process with time and accomplished briefly while in the moment with a client.</p>

<title>Case Illustration</title>
<p>Renee is a 32-year-old woman being supervised in individual supervision. She recently graduated from an MFT program and was working toward licensure. As part of supervision, Renee’s supervisor gave her the Clinical Intuition Exploration Guide and asked her to be open to any intuitive moments that occurred in therapy. She was instructed to journal about her experience using the form as a framework for her reflection. The following is a summary of an intuitive moment that she processed with her supervisor.</p>
<p>Renee was working as a therapist under supervision at an outpatient agency with clients primarily dealing with loss and bereavement issues. The intuitive moment she presented in supervision took place in a session with a woman, Corey, whose father had recently passed away from an unexpected illness. Renee reported having a “sudden intrusive thought” occur about her client. Upon completion of her reflective journaling, she discussed each aspect of the intuition exploration guide with her supervisor.</p>
<sec id="section10-1066480711425469">
<title>Attunement</title>
<p>Renee reported that things in her life outside of her clinical work were somewhat stressful. Her 7-year-old son was having a difficult time in school in part due to Renee working more hours and not being as available as she was when she was in school. Renee felt like she was still learning the ropes in the agency where she worked and “wanted to do everything right.” Renee reported that since she began working more with loss at work she felt more emotionally attuned than normal.</p>
<p>In regard to her present-focused attentiveness to her client, Renee reported liking the client and looking forward to meeting with her. Prior to session Renee was relaxed, yet somewhat anxious to see where the session would take them that day. Throughout the session, she noticed that she shifted her attention between the content of what Corey discussed (the loss of her father), the direction she (Renee) felt the session needed to take, and her own reactions to the client. Renee noted that she felt appreciative that her client was disclosing so much of her emotional experience of loss.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1066480711425469">
<title>Experience</title>
<p>Having worked with Corey for four sessions, Renee felt a strong therapeutic connection established between them. Renee reported that Corey was still wrestling with some disbelief that her father was no longer around and even some anger that he was “taken at a time when she really needed him.” While listening to Corey’s disbelief and anger, Renee had a sudden, intrusive thought occur to her: “Corey is also glad that her father has passed on.” To that point in their work, no clinical material supported this assertion. Renee reported feeling a tightening in her gut when she became aware of the thought, and became somewhat distracted from the session when it occurred.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1066480711425469">
<title>Interpretation</title>
<p>Renee initially struggled to make sense of the intuitive prompting. She and her supervisor explored her thoughts and feelings about the message, and Renee could find no connection between it and the events of her own life. She felt sure the message was about Corey, and felt it had some purpose. Renee and her supervisor brainstormed about possible meanings for the client. They tentatively held on to the idea that, for Corey, there may be other emotions at play in her experience of loss that may be difficult to discuss. They checked this idea against Renee’s values and beliefs around death and loss. She expressed that death for her was a sacred experience, not something to be dreaded. The idea that Corey might feel glad that her father had passed on made sense according to Renee’s beliefs about death but did not feel prompted by those beliefs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1066480711425469">
<title>Decision Making</title>
<p>Trying to make meaning of the intuition Renee experienced subtly transitioned into what she wanted to do with this experience. She felt awkward at the thought of just telling the client what happened. She believed it would be disjunctive to the counseling and potentially the therapeutic relationship. She also, however, did not want to ignore what so clearly had happened to her. Renee eventually decided to hold on to the message and look for supporting evidence and an opportunity to ask about other feelings besides anger and disbelief that Corey was experiencing. One of Corey’s counseling goals was for her to come to terms with her feelings about the loss of her father. The intuition itself, therefore, did not feel unrelated to the purpose of counseling, but Renee was concerned about the manner of addressing it to demonstrate respect for Corey.</p>
<p>A tangential but very valid fear Renee shared was that she was somewhat afraid to act on this intuition. As a new member to the agency, she wanted to appear competent and develop a positive reputation. She was concerned that by acting on this intuition she might be perceived as a “spiritual nut.” Renee and her supervisor discussed this concern as it balanced out against the clarity of the intuitive moment she had and her desire to honor those gut feelings. Eventually, Renee felt that she could both honor the intuition by being open to the information it suggested and do it in a way that felt respectful to the client and did not disparage Renee’s reputation. She realized that she wanted to value those gut messages and could do it in a professional manner.</p>

<sec id="section14-1066480711425469">
<title>Action</title>
<p>The supervisor asked Renee how she thought it might look to let this intuition guide her clinical work. Renee reported that she was going to keep an openness to new information that might indicate other feelings Corey was experiencing around the loss of her father. She also, at some point, wanted to reflect back to Corey any new feelings expressed in session and directly ask if there were other feelings she was having. In doing this, she would not directly be sharing the intuitive event that happened to her but would use it as guiding information. This seemed the most respectful way to present the information that would invite the least amount of resistance or potential negative reaction. The supervisor and Renee agreed to follow up on the actions she took in their next supervision session.</p>

<sec id="section15-1066480711425469">
<title>Evaluation</title>
<p>Renee returned the next week for supervision and reported that she had an opportunity to ask Corey about other feelings she was experiencing. Renee discussed that there were hints of other emotions in session as demonstrated through statements Corey made, such as, “I think he is probably at peace now.” Upon asking about other emotions, Corey reported feeling ashamed to say that she was somewhat glad that her father had passed on. She indicated that she always relied on her Dad, and now that he was gone, it forced her to grow up in ways that she had not before. This led to a conversation about personal growth for Corey that was affirming, and yet respectful of the many things her father had given her.</p>
<p>The supervisor questioned Renee about the general process of attending to her intuition. She stated that a few things were helpful about the process. First, it was affirming to have someone willing to talk about the gut-level information she experienced in therapy. Second, it was helpful to have some guide about how to think through what she had experienced so that she could make an informed choice rather than just react or not act. Third, she believed that by examining this experience of intuition, she would be better able to deal with it when it happens again.</p>

<sec id="section16-1066480711425469">
<title>A Word on the Fallibility of Intuition</title>
<p>It should be noted that while the example of Renee had a positive outcome, not all intuitive moments connect with clients. Intuition, just like theory, assessment, and research, is an imperfect process. Challenges to understanding and using intuition often revolve around timing, context, readiness, and personal centeredness. It is important to recognize that even under the best of circumstances sometimes working through the exploratory process will not seem to yield a clear answer. In these moments, one must balance the potential benefits or drawbacks of honoring and acting on the intuition with the needs of the client and err on the side of safety.</p>

<title>Implications for Counseling and Supervision</title>
<p>Intuition may be a tool especially suited to the work of marriage and family counselors. In the realm of counseling, intuition is a relational process. It is generated and understood from being in relationship with clients. As systemic and relational experts, marriage and family counselors may be best trained and open to working with this relational information. In being able to attend to processes within and between individuals, these counselors may recognize more intuitive moments and thus connect to a relational source of information to better understand their clients or the role of the counselor within the helping relationship. There will inevitably be times when the thoughts, feelings, and impressions of the counselor cannot be immediately connected to the clients' words or actions. This Clinical Intuition Exploration Guide, coupled with training in understanding relationship dynamics, may be helpful in drawing forth significant information for the marriage and family counselor.</p>
<p>One foundational element inherent in the process of exploring intuition is the need for counselors to take time to develop self-awareness. A global self-awareness, including an evaluation of one’s current life situation, as well as an exploration of family-of-origin issues, can better prepare counselors to both foster and be aware of intuitive moments when they occur. An awareness of one’s family of origin also lays the foundation for sound, ethical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066480711425469">Aponte, 1994</xref>). Mindfulness training may be another helpful practice to develop a better present-focused awareness of the self.</p>
<p>Engaging in a critical analysis of intuitive moments for some may feel counterintuitive and contrived; however, when counselors do not think on multiple levels about their personal intuitive moments and check them against their professional role, clients can end up on the receiving end of a discomforting and potentially disruptive experience. The process in this guide underscores the importance of thoughtful decision-making and gives counselors the self-reflective tool to be able to navigate difficult, yet important intuitive situations. As counselors place themselves in a respectful relationship to intuition through thoughtful, critical reflection, they not only will develop a better understanding of intuitive experiences but may foster future ones as well.</p>
<p>Supervisors can play a pivotal role in fostering intuition in counselors. They can model intuitiveness and the process of self-reflection to provide an example of what the use of intuition looks like. Additionally, giving overt permission to attend to gut-level information and explore the intersection of the self and one’s role sends the message to supervisees that intuition is important. Sharing the Clinical Intuition Exploration Guide with supervisees can help educate them about a process of thoughtful, ethical reflection, and decision making. Finally, supervision is a prime context for developing self-awareness in counselors so that they may, “be more aware and responsible for how they personally participate in and conduct their therapy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480711425469">Aponte &amp; Carlsen, 2009</xref>, p. 397).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1066480711425469">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Without a guiding framework for making decisions concerning intuition, counselors are left to wrestle with profoundly meaningful moments, and unfortunately, many of those moments die due to a lack of understanding in how to address them. Although intuition tends to be a quick and ready knowledge, the process of navigating the outcome of intuition tends to come through careful reasoning and reflection. As counselors engage in reflective inner dialogue between the self and one’s professional role, they will be better prepared to act on intuitive moments in an ethical manner. The Clinical Intuition Exploration Guide can be a helpful tool for counselors and supervisors in processing intuitive experiences and making decisions that can be confirming to counselors and respectful to clients.</p>
