<abstract>
<p>This article will discuss how controllable material technology, such as the use of active magnetorheological dampers, improves primary and secondary suspensions of vehicle. Although relatively new to the marketplace, semiactive suspensions in commercial automobiles and off-highway vehicles have been proven through the use of active magnetorheological dampers since 1998. In fact, magnetorheological suspension dampers are found today on the commercial vehicles of an increasing number of automotive original equipment manufacturers and leading off-highway original equipment manufacturers. Magnetorheological fluid dampers are simple in design and have the advantage of no moving parts. The resistive force from a magnetorheological damper is generated as iron particles, suspended in the magnetorheological fluid, pass through a magnetic field controlled by the electrical current passing through an electric coil contained within a moving piston surrounded by the fluid. By adjusting the current to the damper coil in response to feedback from vehicle sensors and a controller, the damping response of the suspension can be optimized and controlled in real time to provide optimal operator comfort. The magnetorheological damper system has a full-scale step response of less than 10 ms. Sophisticated control algorithms adapt to large changes in payload, enabling the vehicle to meet ride metrics without pneumatic load leveling. Other benefits of the magnetorheological damping system include higher speed in North Atlantic Treaty Organization double-lane change tests, reduced risk of rollover, improved accuracy of mounted weapons, and improved vehicle durability and readiness.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Heavy-duty and off-highway vehicles encounter a wide range of road conditions, and operators spend significant time behind the wheel during a day’s work. Consequently, these operators are frequently exposed to shocks and excessive whole body vibrations when their vehicles encounter irregularities (potholes, expansion joints, road debris, etc.). Exposure to whole body vibration can contribute to spinal degeneration and injury and is believed to be one of many factors contributing to the high rate of back injury among occupational drivers. Continuing a trend, which started almost a decade ago, more attention is being focused on the health effects of exposure to frequent shocks or jolts in heavy-duty vehicles.</p>
<p>Shocks are transmitted to the driver when the vehicle encounters unusually harsh terrain, causing the primary suspension and/or the secondary suspension to run out of travel. The suspension hitting its end stop is termed “topping and bottoming.” Frequent topping and bottoming has been reported to contribute to increased levels of operator fatigue. In extreme cases, topping and bottoming can be a safety risk, as these events can cause the driver to temporarily lose control of the vehicle when feet and hands are thrown off the pedals and steering wheel. To reduce topping and bottoming in a conventional passive suspension, the stiffness of the suspension (spring and/or damper) must be increased, reducing overall vibration isolation and increasing whole body vibration to the occupant.</p>
<p>Standards organizations have developed methods for assessing whole body vibration dose, and therefore, it is common today to speak in terms of the vibration dose value (VDV) instead of the weighted root mean squared (RMS) acceleration when the vibration exposure includes numerous shock events. The VDV calculation is more sensitive to shock events than the RMS acceleration and exhibits a stronger correlation to the degree of discomfort reported by human beings in controlled experiments.</p>
<p>In addition, the US Army has developed its own health hazard assessment method to quantify health risks from shock for Army personnel traveling in tactical ground vehicles (tanks, trucks, personnel carriers, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045389X12445630">Aberdeen Test Center, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045389X12445630">ANSI, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, a growing number of seating manufacturers have responded by designing suspended seats with improved vibration isolation characteristics.</p>
<p>Within the category of controllable suspensions, there are two primary types: fully active and semiactive. Fully active suspensions replace shock absorbers and/or springs with actuators, typically hydraulic. Although these suspensions are capable of excellent performance, they consume a significant percentage of the power required for the drive train, unless some type of energy recovery is employed. They also tend to be heavy and costly. Semiactive suspensions typically comprise passive springs and active dampers. An active damper has a real-time adjustable resistance or damping level. Unlike an actuator of a fully active system, an active damper can only resist motion. Active dampers consume an order of magnitude less power than similarly sized semiactive dampers.</p>
<p>Magnetorheological (MR) dampers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045389X12445630">Carlson, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045389X12445630">2009</xref>) are active dampers with the added advantage of a valve with no moving parts. The controllable force is generated as iron particles, suspended in the fluid, pass through a magnetic field, which is controlled by the electrical current through a coil. A cutaway view of a typical MR piston valve is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X12445630">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>In both primary and secondary suspensions, smart suspensions based on MR technology overcome the compromise in design that is inherent with passive solutions and provide the best performance value. MR dampers are found today on the commercial vehicles of an increasing number of automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), including Audi, Acura, Ferrari, GM, Holden, and Honda. Similarly, leading off-highway OEMs such as Caterpillar, John Deere, Case, New Holland, AGCO, SAME, and CLAAS are utilizing MR dampers to provide vibration reduction throughout the vehicle. The performance and reliability of the system have been proven many times over. Leveraging this experience, LORD Corporation is moving this smart fluid technology to military vehicles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1045389X12445630">
<title>Role of the suspension</title>
<p>Vehicle primary suspensions provide three essential functions: mitigate chassis accelerations resulting from movement across nonflat terrain, enhance steering and handling characteristics (including keeping the wheels on the terrain), and limit suspension travel in both up and down directions. In a traditional spring and damper suspension, the choice of damper force–velocity curve requires a compromise between good ride comfort and good handling characteristics. In other words, you can have sports car handling or a luxury sedan ride but not both.</p>
<sec id="section3-1045389X12445630">
<title>Smart seat suspensions seat suspensions</title>
<p>To further minimize the driver’s vibration exposure, suspended seats are installed to isolate the driver from the most common or problematic modes of vehicle vibration. Additionally, some vocations, such as logging and gravel hauling, expose drivers to a wider spectrum of vibration and shock. Finally, most vehicle seats do not have independent height adjustment, requiring drivers to use the air spring to adjust seat height. Adjusting seat height away from mid-ride reduces free travel in one direction and increases the incidence of end-stop collisions.</p>
<p>These problems illustrate the need for seats that simultaneously protect drivers from routine vibration and end-stop collisions, even when the driver adjusts the seat away from mid-ride. The experiment described below demonstrates how semiactive systems can achieve these goals.</p>
<p>Today, most heavy-duty and off-highway driver seats have an air-ride suspension and a passive damper to isolate the driver from vibration. These seats are typically designed to isolate the driver from moderate levels of vibration between 4 and 8 Hz because the human body is most sensitive to vibration in this range. However, the design trade-off to achieve this isolation does not prevent the suspension from bottoming and topping when the vehicle encounters severe road conditions. Although some seat designs employ elastomeric snubbers to absorb some of the impact energy of bottoming and topping, snubbers alone do not provide adequate driver protection from acute or chronic stress injury. Simply stiffening the suspension will mitigate topping and bottoming, but overall ride performance will suffer dramatically. Thus, in passive seat suspension designs, there is always a compromise between vibration and shock isolation.</p>

<title>Commercial applications development</title>
<p>Research at LORD Corporation on semiactive suspensions began in the early 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045389X12445630">Crosby and Karnopp, 1973</xref>). In the mid-1980s, LORD was successful in demonstrating a 14% reduction in driver absorbed power in military tracked vehicles. In the late 1980s, LORD began experimentation with semiactive primary suspensions for high-performance automobiles such as the Corvette. In each instance, superior performance and critical learning were achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045389X12445630">Ivers and Miller, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045389X12445630">1991</xref>).</p>
<p>In 1998, LORD Corporation first commercialized MR damping systems for heavy-duty seating. At that time, the technology consisted of a controllable damper filled with MR fluid, a microprocessor with an integrated sensor arm, a three-position ride mode switch, and a microprocessor. In response to vehicle ride inputs and operator weight, the controllable MR damping system optimizes the ride performance and provides the vehicle operator occupant with a superior ride through all operating envelopes.</p>
<p>To optimize the ride performance of the seat suspension, the control algorithm is designed to provide light damping under low magnitudes of relative deflections. When the suspension encounters relatively large motions, the algorithm detects the rate of change in the seat position suspension and generates an appropriate command current signal for the magnetic coils to increase the damping force to prevent collision with the end stop. The ride response is monitored, and adjustments are made 500 times per second, which result in optimal performance under a broad range of operating conditions.</p>
<p>Today, thousands of MR devices are in service in commercial vehicle seat applications using LORD MR fluid technology to enhance ride and handling. Drivers using these systems have reported fewer end-stop collisions and less fatigue and have greater control over the vehicle during severe shock motions, as their hands and feet are not thrown from the controls.</p>

<title>Testing the technology</title>
<sec id="section6-1045389X12445630">
<title>Seat suspensions</title>
<p>LORD was successful in demonstrating significant vibration attenuation and end-stop impact reduction performance of suspension seats when subjected to transient or shock excitation and at continuous vibration excitation class EM1, amplified by 150% of the amplitude specified in the standard to induce end-stop impacts with the passive system.</p>
<p>Specifically, the LORD MR system absorbed significantly higher input acceleration values before the onset of end-stop impacts was observed and the system reduced the maximum acceleration measured on the seat by 46%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1045389X12445630">
<title>Expanding applications to heavy vehicle primary suspension</title>
<p>Building on the success in commercial seating applications, in 2005, LORD Corporation began developing MR-based semiactive suspensions for military vehicles. MR damping systems have been installed on military vehicles, ranging from ~6000 to ~60,000 lbs, with suspension types including independent coil springs, independent air springs, leaf springs, struts, walking beams, and trailing arms.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X12445630">Figure 2</xref> shows two monotube MR dampers designed for military applications. The damper on the left has an internal in-line gas accumulator; the damper on the right has an external accumulator.</p>

<p>For the light/medium independent suspension test, bumper and cargo weights were added to a vehicle to represent the weight and inertia of an armored light vehicle. After collecting baseline data, the passive shocks were removed and replaced with LORD MR dampers. Position sensors and a controller (containing inertial sensors) were installed and configured for the vehicle. The only other change was to adjust the rear toe to be zero degrees (with all weights installed).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1045389X12445630">Figure 3</xref> shows that the LORD MR system provided a 25% speed increase on small RMS terrain. (The 6-W absorbed power is a standard military metric for suspension performance; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045389X12445630">Aberdeen Test Center, 2005</xref>.) The pitching of the vehicle was dramatically reduced. Also note that at the speed of the highest recorded passive datum, the absorbed power with the MR system is about half.</p>

</fig>
<p>“Rear crew” absorbed power is derived from an accelerometer located on the chassis directly over the center of the rear axle and is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X12445630">Figure 4</xref>. Although not apparent from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1045389X12445630">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X12445630">4</xref>, the rear crew experiences a much rougher ride than the driver. The reason for this difference is the pitching motion of the vehicle and the fact that the driver is closer to the vehicle’s center of gravity.</p>

</fig>
<p>The LORD MR system dramatically reduced fatigue loads into the chassis due to superior control of the pitch problem. Significant improvement in vehicle reliability and durability is expected (and will be quantified in future testing and analysis).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1045389X12445630">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1045389X12445630">6</xref> show the speed increase on large RMS terrain. Again, substantial speed increase was obtained. On 6-in half-round bumps (another standard military test), 2.5 g is never reached for either the stock vehicle or the MR-equipped vehicle. Due to the low ground clearance of the chassis with the added weight, the stock passive shocks were unable to prevent the chassis from bottoming on 8-in half-round bumps. On the other hand, the MR system (with the same clearance to the ground) prevented bottoming. Consequently, the speed increase was nearly 400%.</p>

<p>In another example, the LORD MR system has been installed and tested on a medium-weight tactical vehicle with full cargo. The improvement on this truck was up to 30%. In addition to performance tests with excellent results, the LORD MR system has survived more than 10,000 miles of off-road durability testing. Not only did the system itself survive, but the failure of other components on the vehicle is markedly lower as well.</p>
