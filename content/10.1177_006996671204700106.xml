<p>Even if the evidence for some of its most arresting claims is inconclusive, this is a remarkably interesting book about marriage in ‘Mohini Nagar’, a south Delhi neighbourhood of squatter settlements and re-settlement colonies. Originally migrants from rural areas in other north Indian states, neighbourhood residents are now fully urbanised, predominantly poor (the majority work in the informal economy) and of low caste. Many, however, are Balmikis who have secure and relatively remunerative employment with the Municipal Corporation of Delhi as sweepers (their caste-specific occupation). Though caste identity remains important, not much attention is now paid to the ‘traditional’ rules governing caste interactions—regarding commensality, for example. Though the Balmikis are a partial exception in this and other respects and despite the caste and regional heterogeneity, there is considerable uniformity in kinship and marriage practices.</p>
<p>A broad distinction obtains between the traditional ideal arranged marriage (which is almost invariably caste endogamous) and self-chosen ‘love’ marriages (which are generally not). However, the principal objection to love marriages, it seems, is less that they commonly cross caste boundaries than that in exercising their own agency, the couple usurp parental prerogatives. Unless, that is, the union transgresses the Hindu-Muslim divide or involves a Balmiki and a partner of higher caste. That is predictable enough, but more surprising (and not very satisfactorily explained) is that the most virulent opposition comes from the Balmiki side. Perforce, most love marriages involve elopement, though not the extremes of violence reported from rural areas around Delhi.</p>
<p>While much of the literature focuses on the negotiation of marriage, Grover emphasises its aftermath; and the critical variable in her analysis is a woman’s right of return to her natal household when her marriage is in difficulty. Many shuttle constantly between their natal and conjugal homes, and some spend more time with their parents than husbands. At variance with the long distance alliances and consequent vulnerability of brides that are supposedly characteristic of north India, what encourages this is that most marriages are arranged in <italic>neighbouring bastis</italic> (settlements). Love marriages typically and disreputably take place <italic>within</italic> the <italic>basti</italic>. They thus involve fictive siblings. On account of this geographical contraction, Grover (dubiously) concludes that refuge is a distinctively urban phenomenon. She is on more solid ground when she argues that it strengthens a woman’s bargaining position vis-à-vis her husband and contributes to the fragility of marriage (by providing her with an alternative, or because her husband loses interest in an absent wife or gets exasperated by his in-laws’ meddling). A woman’s rights of refuge are not, however, unlimited. Especially after the death of her parents, however well disposed her brothers might be, their wives are likely to lose patience. Her bargaining position weakens with time. It owes much less to her employment status (which is what others have stressed) than to her right of return. A job does not free her from male dependence or alter the domestic balance of power. More likely, it exacerbates conjugal conflict and violence. Husbands are jealous and suspicious.</p>
<p>The conjugal bond is brittle and when marriages break up, the woman cannot realistically live alone. Without a male protector, she is harassed. But one who has made a love marriage has forfeited her right to refuge. For that reason, Grover argues in an eye-catching reversal of received wisdom that love marriages are more stable than arranged marriages. Wives find it harder to walk out and are consequently more subordinated to their husbands. For reasons already alluded to and pre-eminently on account of the strength of the mother–daughter relationship, it is arranged marriages that are more conflictual and liable to breakdown, and in which the domestic balance of power is counter-intuitively less unequal. Further, much current wisdom holds that the ‘arranged’ versus ‘love’ marriage dichotomy is overdrawn and that the boundaries between them are now often blurred by ‘arranged love marriages’. The couple make their own choice and then persuade their parents to acquiesce in it. In Mohini Nagar, however, the distinction is reasserted when it comes to the unequivocal right to return. ‘Arranged love marriages’ are closer to love marriages in that the woman is deemed to have lost it. The disjuncture between the two types is more profound than their continuity.</p>
<p>Generally, those whose marriages end in divorce, separation or widowhood enter into a secondary union with a new partner. These provide scope for personal choice and often cross caste boundaries. While Kakar has written of the ideal of the <italic>jodi</italic> (the couple) amongst Delhi slum women, Grover’s informants appear more hard-nosed, exploring their options with several men and frequently returning to their original husband. What really counts is a man’s willingness to provide <italic>kharacha-pani</italic> (expenses). Despite the relative freedom of choice, such relationships are no less unequal.</p>
<p>Nor is gender hierarchy significantly challenged by the (NGO-sponsored) Mahila Panchayats discussed in the final substantive chapter. Their members are neighbourhood women who provide arbitration in marital disputes. They are quite effective in securing reconciliation, which is what they set out to do, but they uphold very conservative views on the properness of arranged marriages and on the duties of wives within them.</p>
<p>This is a readable and consistently absorbing book, and most of its arguments seem plausible. Plausible, but not compelling and that’s largely because Grover—like many anthropologists—has apparently forgotten the importance of counting. The claim that love marriages are more stable than arranged marriages is a statistical proposition but apart from a footnote revealing that her analysis of love marriage is based on 12 cases, there is hardly a number in the book. So when Kakar is chided for generalising about conjugal ideals in the slums of Delhi on the basis of a very small sample, one can’t help feeling that the pot is calling the kettle black. Numbers are important and especially when we are often told that the last bastion of caste in the modern world is the persistence of endogamous marriage, it would have been helpful to have some estimate of the proportion of people in Mohini Nagar who live in inter-caste unions. It would also have been good to know more about the social placement of their children. But it’s easy to carp about what’s been left out. What we are offered is quite enough to make this book essential reading for anybody concerned with marital trends in contemporary India.</p>
