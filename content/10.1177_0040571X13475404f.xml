<p>It is some time since the days of C. H. Dodd and J. Jeremias on the parables of Jesus, so we should welcome a fresh examination of the whole subject. We note with gratitude a number of features of Crossan’s new book, which bears all the marks of his customary originality and yet does not make an alarming break with the work of the recent past. The style is attractively fresh and accessible, however, making the book a perhaps deceptively easy read. The truth is that it is both up to date in its method and leads us forward into new possibilities. In Part I we have a survey of the different kinds of parables ascribed to Jesus: centred on riddles; stimulating example to be followed; and various kinds of challenge to be experienced and answered.</p>
<p>The book gives us first a discussion of different types of parables ascribed to Jesus: a sense of the background of each in the writings of Israel, and an analysis of Jesus’ ways of exploiting the various styles of story. In the second half of the book we are enabled to explore the different styles of parable to be found from the pens of the four evangelists: the work of each has its own special features, even when a later writer uses the work of a predecessor as the spring for his own new version. Crossan goes so far as to read Mark as a whole as a kind of parable – a demand for answers to basic questions about the essence of the faith of those addressed. Then the same approach is applied to each of the Gospels, and once more we are encouraged to read the formal parables as embodying the central message of the evangelist’s book. It is not difficult to see this operating in the case of Matthew as he stresses fidelity and the inevitability of judgement as God’s purpose reaches its climax. Luke operates with a historical perspective, as Jesus adumbrates the future spread of his mission both among the people of Israel and then much more widely in the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>It is a perspective that John renounces (or at least does not embrace), except of course that Jesus is a figure of total and cosmic importance though his sphere of operation on earth is so limited. The Gospel of John expands that sphere implicitly to the world as a whole and the role of Jesus is depicted in line with his identity as God’s ‘word’. So the local is made universal. And the mission of Jesus shows the full scope of God’s love.</p>
<p>J. D. Crossan has done us a favour in focusing on the brief parables in the Gospels as offering means to understand the universal significance of Jesus’ work and teaching.</p>
