<p>During the late 2000s in the United States, Tea Party supporters vociferously decried taxes and government as excessive. At the same time, they sought to protect Medicare, Social Security, and other safety net programs that have supported their families through uncertain times. These seemingly incongruent views, underscored by handmade signs of “keep government out of Medicare,” raise the following question: what milieu makes possible the simultaneous lauding of individualism while relying upon collectivism?</p>
<p>One possible explanation for such a disjuncture appears in Dick Houtman, Stef Aupers, and Willem de Koster’s <italic>Paradoxes of Individualization: Social Control and Social Conflict in Contemporary Modernity</italic>. These collected studies examine the contemporary phenomenon of individualization, in which individualism is gaining in importance. With expanding choices in how to work, consume, worship, and interact, people are more able and apt to engage in self-expression.</p>
<p>Although its studies were conducted in the Netherlands, one of the most liberal European countries, the book’s unifying thesis and findings can inform explorations of societies elsewhere. The authors argue that under individualism, individuals expect to be true to themselves in their actions and views, sometimes in opposition to long-standing institutions. This emphasis on the authentic, self-expressive self poses a newer form of social control since social environments legitimize individualism as appropriate and desirable. Although individualism is increasingly taken for granted, how to pursue individualism is still up for contention. As shown by the second half of the book’s chapters, differing conceptions of individualism fuel conflicts, potentially fragmenting society.</p>
<p>The book’s chapters, which can be read selectively if needed, examine how individualism shapes and is shaped by work, consumption, religion and spirituality, and politics. In particular, these chapters delve into how the capitalist mode of production, conceptions of nationhood, and institutions such as religion underpin contemporary society’s celebration of the individual. In addition, technological innovations such as the internet have widened options for self-expression and self-development.</p>
<p>Chapter One introduces individualization as giving meaning and shaping action in contemporary society via an emphasis on individuals. The authors link this concept to the Weberian search for meaning under increasing rationalization, as well as Durkheim’s argument that the growing reliance upon societal cohesion is based upon differences rather than similarities among persons. After briefly noting that the countercultural 1960s’ development and growth of the self have unleashed individualization, the authors use recent literature to show how the workplace, consumer goods, and politics cater to an ideology of individualism by promoting flexibility, authenticity, and individual liberty, respectively. Other chapters describe phenomena such as prosumption, in which individuals collectively create and consume as a realization of their individuality; these may extend or destabilize social control. Chapter Four examines how World of Warcraft players create online selves; their escalating commitment to these fantasy selves in a virtual world enlarges capitalism’s commodification of their labor. Chapter Five studies how online venues bond those stigmatized by the mainstream. In the anonymous safety of discussion boards, rightwing extremists can cultivate an identity that celebrates white power and rejects multiculturalism as the bases for nationhood.</p>
<p>Several chapters explicitly refute other scholars’ claims about the contours and impact of individualism. Debunking the claim that choices paralyze decision-makers, Chapter Two describes how interviewed undergraduates do not consider bountiful consumer choice to be problematic or alienating. Using satisficing strategies, such as soliciting friends’ opinions, they depict choices as meaningful opportunities for self-expression. Similarly, Chapter Three counters arguments that New Age spirituality consists of individual bricolage and is unworthy of study because it is neither commonly shared nor represented in society at large. Using interviews with spiritual trainers of Dutch New Age Centers and those specializing in business and a case study of a Dutch company that has adopted New Age practices, the authors argue that New Age spirituality systematically coheres ideas drawn from multiple religions, socializes individuals, and re-enchants the rationalized workplace.</p>
<p>Other chapters reveal how individualism poses challenges for established institutions and relations. In Chapter Six, website designers for religious organizations confront decisions about whether to allow participants to engage in dialogue and interpretations that might undercut institutions’ centralized authority. The book’s final chapters underscore rifts among citizenry concerning their nation, particularly regarding immigration. Surveys indicate that those with higher cultural capital prefer individual libertarianism whereas those with lower cultural capital favor authoritarianism to restore a homogeneous social order. Similarly, focus group discussions reveal the depth of uneasiness that less educated, longtime Netherlands residents express about immigrants whose Islamic practices include women wearing headscarves and men and women declining to shake hands across sexes. Such chapters can initiate discussion of individualism’s limits in cohering members. In addition, these writings explicate the tensions over the extent to which society and individuals can tolerate views and practices that are different from their own, especially when a society promotes individualism.</p>
<p>The book excels in its examination of individualism in multiple areas and its engagement with multiple literatures. The most revealing studies examine how individual persons and institutions, particularly hierarchical and symbolic ones, contend with the contemporary ethos of individualism. The book would benefit from a concluding chapter that discusses the implications of its chapters’ findings, such as apparent rifts among citizenry or the present or anticipated destabilization of institutions such as organized religion. Moreover, such a conclusion could have proposed a cohesive agenda for future inquiry, rather than relegating these to the end of chapters.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a conclusion could have shown how concurrent lines of inquiry in various subdisciplines help us to understand individualism in increasingly heterogeneous societies seeking to meld multiple interests. In particular, complementary research includes neoinstitutionalist studies of how individuals and institutions adjudicate between the individual and the larger collective, as well as work and occupations studies about how the New Economy has intensified conceptions of careers in individualistic and entrepreneurial rather than collective terms. At times, additional contextual details in the substantive chapters could have helped readers who are less familiar with the Netherlands. For example, when referring to the impact of the 1960s counterculture in Chapter One, more explication and references could help readers understand to what extent these were similar to shifts in their own countries.</p>
<p>Students in specialty courses in culture, consumption, media, technology, religion, political sociology, and deviance may benefit from the chapters’ findings and discussion of the research methodologies used, including interviews, focus groups, survey data, and content analysis. Some may find the book appropriate for introductory courses about the relation between individuals and society or a graduate-level class in theory. The book can also inform discussions comparing other texts about the rationalization of society, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306113491549">George Ritzer’s (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306113491549">2005</xref>) works on McDonaldization.</p>
<p>Overall, readers will find this book’s assortment of studies helpful for understanding individualization in several areas of society. These findings can help unpack curious puzzles elsewhere, such as the afore-mentioned Tea Partiers’ simultaneous disdain and embrace of government, as well as their scapegoating of immigrants, as opposed to business interests, for economic woes. The concept of individualism can unpack simmering tensions in cultural beliefs that conceive of individuals as self-reliant and self-expressive versus embedded in a larger collective.</p>
