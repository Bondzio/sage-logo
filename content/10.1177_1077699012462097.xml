<p>Pauline Kael has been described as the preeminent film critic of the twentieth century. If this is hyperbole, it is right in synch with her style, both personal and on the written page. With the ranks of film critics being decimated, as they frequently are among the first to be cut from the editorial staffs of struggling publications, Brian Kellow’s illuminating biography, <italic>Pauline Kael: A Life in the Dark</italic>, seems almost like a relic of a distant age. It is also an irresistible read.</p>
<p>It was one of those harmonic convergences of luck and timing (and more than a little talent) that brought Kael to <italic>The New Yorker</italic> in 1967, at a time when American movies were crawling out from under the strictures of the Production Code and into a renaissance of filmmaking that lasted until the conglomerates, which now owned the studios, brought in a new and for the most part soulless age to motion pictures.</p>
<p>Although Kael had written for other publications, her career really got rolling with a long takeout on the film <italic>Bonnie and Clyde</italic> running in the Oct. 21, 1967, issue of the magazine. She never looked back. <italic>The New Yorker</italic> might not have been her first choice of publications, but editor William Shawn gave her the one thing she truly craved: space, and lots of it. Shawn’s editorial policy included his non-interference with his writers, and Kael’s reviews ran as long as she cared to make them. And she wrote and wrote and wrote. Kael had a consuming passion for the movies that lasted until she died. In fact, it seems to have been the one consuming passion of her life. Although she had one daughter, Gina James, she never married, and many of her relationships were with homosexual and bisexual men, one of whom was Gina’s father.</p>
<p>A film critic, and one as controversial as Kael proved to be, might seem an outré subject for author Kellow, who is the features editor for <italic>Opera News</italic>, and whose previous books include biographies of Ether Merman, Eileen Farrell, and the acting Bennett family. But his treatment of Kael is even-handed and his writing is fluid and comprehensive. She was, after all, a diva. In his acknowledgements, he cites almost 150 interviews and the bibliography lists over ninety books, including all thirteen of Kael’s own.</p>
<p>The book is organized chronologically, beginning with Kael’s childhood on a Petaluma, California, chicken ranch, where her Polish immigrant Jewish parents figured they could make a life for a growing family. Just before the stock market crash in 1929, her father lost the ranch and the family moved to San Francisco. Her West Coast roots never left her and provoked in her a kind of intellectual defensiveness and a reflexive dislike of the New York publishing establishment, even though her career and influence were solidified at that most East Coast establishment publication, <italic>The New Yorker</italic>.</p>
<p>In her reviews (and in conversation), she could be arrogant, self-serving, mean spirited, and in print as scatological as the proper gentleman editor of <italic>The New Yorker</italic>, William Shawn, would let her be. In fact, her taste for the audacious and trashy and her desire to goad Shawn led to shouting matches between them that lasted for decades. She was a bully, but unlike most bullies, she never backed down. When she found directors she truly admired (Robert Altman, Sam Peckinpah, Paul Mazursky), she would turn them into drinking buddies, often offering advice on scripts and casting, essentially trouncing the accepted boundaries of the critic-filmmaker relationship. But she could as easily turn on them and cut them out of her life either for some perceived personal slight, or the seeming loss of that director’s particular gifts. She had favorite actors: Streisand, Debra Winger, Michelle Pfeiffer, Brando, DeNiro, but was also quick to write exactly what she thought of them when they failed to live up to what she thought their performances should be.</p>
<p>She also had a long-standing feud with the critic Andrew Sarris, the American proponent of the auteur theory, which held that the director is the “author” and the visionary behind every film. Kael felt the theory baseless, as film is by its nature a collaborative process. In fact, in her essay, “Raising Kane,” which ran in two parts in <italic>The New Yorker</italic> on February 20 and 27, 1971, about the making of <italic>Citizen Kane</italic>, she went out of her way to argue that it was screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz who was the force behind the film. Much of her argument was based on research she pretty much ripped out of the hands of an assistant professor of film at UCLA, Howard Suber, to whom she paid a few hundred dollars, promising him credit. He never got it, nor any recognition of his contribution to the piece.</p>
<p>Author Kellow frequently points out seeming contradictions in Kael’s life: she grew up in the rural West but hated Westerns as a genre. After a particularly vicious review of <italic>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</italic> in the fall of 1969, which she called, among other things, “a facetious Western” (it was, in fact, intended to have a great deal of humor), director George Roy Hill fired back at her with a letter that famously began, “Listen, you miserable bitch. …” Kellow reports that she “cackle[d] with glee when she read it to her friends.” She hated the superficiality of most studio-produced movies, but loved 1970’s <italic>Love Story</italic>,” which was probably one of the sappiest movies of the decade.</p>
<p>Kael also hated the idea of film studies courses in American universities, but wasn’t reluctant at all to take the fees offered her for speeches and lectures and honorary degrees. “Teaching a course in film studies,” she said, “goes against the grain of everything I feel about movies, and against the grain of just about everything I believe about how we learn in the arts.”</p>
<p>Kael resented the fact that her job at <italic>The New Yorker</italic> had a rotating six-month on, six-month off schedule, which she shared with fellow critic Penelope Gilliatt. But the break gave Kael time to write long essays that would frequently run during the summer in <italic>The New Yorker</italic>. No matter how hard she lobbied Shawn, he stuck to the six on/six off plan until the fall of 1980, when Gilliatt’s personal problems, mostly due to her prodigious and ill-timed drinking binges, brought her career at the magazine to an end.</p>
<p>In 1979, with Kael grousing about the qualities of the movies she had to sit through, Warren Beatty seduced her into joining his production company in Los Angeles. Critics usually think they can make better movies than the garbage they frequently have to watch, and Kael was no exception. Cynics thought it was Beatty’s way of getting her off the critic’s desk. But her naiveté was astonishing for someone who had been writing about film for so long. She lasted at Paramount about six weeks before studio politics disgorged her and she went back to New York, making every effort to spin her complete failure as a producer. Kellow is particularly adept at explaining the nasty details.</p>
<p>Kael’s legacy, well documented by Kellow, but curiously absent from the index, is that group of young acolytes dubbed “the Paulettes,” most but not all of whom lived in or near New York, where they could bask in her presence, listen to her ideas and opinions, and do their best to write with the style and incisiveness that Kael showed. Some succeeded, others not so much. Some are still writing, others have chosen different paths.</p>
<p>Kellow’s biography offers much for film studies and criticism classes. Kael’s writing is certainly idiosyncratic, and a strong statement for every writer to find his or his own unique voice. As for Pauline Kael, she’s a hard act to follow.</p>
