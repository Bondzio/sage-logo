<p><italic>Background</italic>: To investigate whether the Chinese lacto-vegetarian diet has protective effects on metabolic and cardiovascular disease (CVD). <italic>Methods</italic>: One hundred sixty-nine healthy Chinese lacto-vegetarians and 126 healthy omnivore men aged 21–76 years were enrolled. Anthropometric indexes, lipid profile, insulin sensitivity, pancreatic β cell function, and intima-media thickness (IMT) of carotid arteries were assessed and compared. Cardiovascular risk points and probability of developing CVD in 5–10 years in participants aged 24–55 years were calculated. <italic>Results</italic>: Compared with omnivores, lacto-vegetarians had remarkably lower body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and serum levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, γ-glutamyl transferase, serum creatinine, uric acid, fasting blood glucose, as well as lower total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio. Vegetarians also had higher homeostasis model assessment β cell function and insulin secretion index and thinner carotid IMT than the omnivores did. These results corresponded with lower cardiovascular risk points and probability of developing CVD in 5–10 years in vegetarians 24–55 years old. <italic>Conclusions</italic>: In healthy Chinese men, the lacto-vegetarian diet seems to exert protective effects on blood pressure, lipid profiles, and metabolic parameters and results in significantly lower carotid IMT. Lower CVD risks found in vegetarians also reflect the beneficial effect of the Chinese lacto-vegetarian diet.</p>

<body>
<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) causes 30% of deaths worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533611436173">1</xref></sup> The consumption of a vegetarian diet is thought to reduce the risk of CVD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533611436173">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533611436173">3</xref></sup> However, for vegetarians, especially vegans, several nutrients, including protein, iron, zinc, calcium, vitamins B<sub>12</sub> and A, w-3 fatty acids and iodine, α-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which might exert potent cardioprotective effects, are relatively low in vegetarians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533611436173">4</xref></sup> Although vegetarian diets are generally healthy and are associated with a lower risk of several chronic diseases, different types of vegetarians may not experience the same health benefits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533611436173">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Chinese society, vegetarianism originates from the Buddhist teaching of “no killing” and has been practiced for centuries. The typical Chinese lacto-vegetarian diet is similar to the usual Chinese diets in terms of meal pattern, cooking methods, choice of staple (primarily rice), and fruit and vegetable consumption, but no meat, egg, fish, or poultry is consumed. Importantly, the Chinese lacto-vegetarian diet, including mainly rice, grains, vegetables, fruits, xianggu mushroom, milk, and significant amounts of soybeans and soya products, is different from the typical Western vegetarian diet, which mainly consists of vegetables, fruits, seeds, nuts, dairy products, and eggs. It is believed that consumption of vegetarian diets could result in relatively low cardiovascular risks in the Western world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533611436173">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533611436173">7</xref></sup> However, because of the different dietary compositions, whether the advantages of the Western vegetarian diet extend to the Chinese type is still open to question.</p>
<p>Hence, we aimed to elucidate whether the Chinese lacto-vegetarian diet has protective effects on CVD like the Western vegetarian diet does. The present study emphasized 2 important parameters that reflect CVD risks: the prediction of CVD risk (CVR) in 5–10 years and intima-media thickness (IMT) of carotid arteries. On one hand, the CVR in 5–10 years, calculated by using the points table developed by the Framingham Study, might help clinical prevention and treatment of CVD. In the Framingham Study, the equations of coronary heart disease risks based on standard risk factors were developed for use by clinicians in predicting the development of coronary disease in individuals free of disease. The equations and point score prediction probability algorithm attempt to elucidate the multifactorial etiology of coronary heart disease and produce possible comparisons and interpretations for clinicians and their patients at risk. Risk factor scores and calculations can be discussed with patients and provide a framework for intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533611436173">8</xref></sup> On the other hand, the carotid IMT measured by ultrasound is strongly associated with CVD and its risk factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533611436173">9</xref></sup> and has been widely used in epidemiological and clinical studies for the evaluation of early atherosclerosis. As a result, IMT has been shown to predict CVD and is able to provide a surrogate end point to assess early atherosclerosis in the absence of “hard” clinical outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533611436173">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533611436173">11</xref></sup> In addition, several health factors, including lipid profile, insulin sensitivity, and pancreatic β cell function, were also evaluated for the important roles of glucose/lipid metabolism in the development of CVD, because impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity could subsequently lead to metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, which could greatly account for the morbidity and mortality of CVD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533611436173">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>Participants and Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0884533611436173">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>In this randomized cross-sectional study, all male volunteers older than 20 years were recruited through the social activities of awareness sessions regarding benefits of healthy lifestyles held in the communities and underwent a general health examination at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University. The participants filled out questionnaires regarding past medical history, family history, dietary preferences, and personal data, such as smoking status, alcohol consumption (beer, wine, liquor, combined), education level, and physical exercise status, and signed for their willingness to participate in the study. Healthy participants were divided into 2 groups—lacto-vegetarian and omnivore—according to their dietary patterns. Lacto-vegetarians were defined as having exclusive consumption of a vegetarian diet void of meat, egg, fish, and poultry for at least 5 years. Matched omnivores were only different from the type of food consumption. All individuals who declared themselves to be “smokers” or “occasional smokers” at the interview or to have quit smoking for &lt;6 months prior to the interview were considered smokers. To fulfill the criteria of apparently healthy participants, exclusion criteria were applied for people with any of the following conditions: history of diabetes or fasting blood glucose &gt;126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L); hyperlipidemia (cholesterol level ≥240 mg/dL or triglyceride level ≥200 mg/dL); regular alcohol drinking; any treatment that might affect lipid metabolism; history of cardiovascular diseases; hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥90 mm Hg); intake of antihypertensive medication; serum creatinine (SCr) level ≥125 µmol/L; cerebrovascular disease; chronic gingivitis, rheumatoid arthritis, or other connective tissue disease; fever or other infectious disease within 3 weeks before the start of the study; thyroid disease; and malignancy of any kind.</p>
<p>Participants were subsequently enrolled if they met the inclusion criteria. In total, 169 healthy lacto-vegetarians and 126 healthy omnivore men were enrolled from 500 subjects in the study. All participants provided informed consent to participate in the study. The study protocol was approved by the research committee and the institutional review board of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University.</p>

<sec id="section3-0884533611436173">
<title>Anthropometric Indexes</title>
<p>Participants’ body weight, height, waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), and blood pressure were obtained from the medical examination. Blood pressure was measured twice after 10–15 minutes of rest with a manual mercury manometer. Korotkoff sounds, phases I and V, were used as indicators of SBP and DBP, respectively. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight divided by squared height (kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0884533611436173">
<title>Blood Sample Assays</title>
<p>After fasting for 10–12 hours overnight, participants had blood samples drawn from the antecubital vein. Serum lipids, including triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein A<sub>1</sub> (ApoA<sub>1</sub>), and apolipoprotein B (ApoB); liver function, including total protein (TP), serum albumin level (ALB), globumin (GLB), serum total bilirubin (STB), conjugated bilirubin (CB), uncongugated bilirubin (UB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and γ-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT); and renal function, including serum urea nitrogen, SCr, and uric acid (UA), were assayed by enzymatic methods with an automatic multichannel chemical analyzer (Hitachi 7450, Hitachi Corp, Tokyo, Japan) in the central laboratory of Xiamen First Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was calculated by the Friedewald formula.</p>
<p>Blood samples were first centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes within 30 minutes of collection and then stored at −70°C until assayed. Fasting glucose was determined by the glucose oxidase method using a Monarch Chemistry 2000 Autoanalyzer (Instrumentation Laboratory, Oakbrook Terrace, IL) through standard laboratory techniques. Quality control assessment was performed daily for all determinations. Serum fasting insulin concentrations were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Roche Elecsys Insulin Test, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Insulin sensitivity and β cell function in the participants were established via the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) method, in which fasting serum insulin (FIns, mU/mL) and fasting blood glucose (FBG, mmol/L and mg/dL) are used: HOMA–insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) = FIns × FBG/22.5 and β cell function (HBCI, %) = 20 × FIns/(FBG − 3.5).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533611436173">13</xref></sup> Insulin action index (IAI) = 1/(FBG × FIns), and insulin secretion index (ISI) = FIns/FBG. Low HOMA-IR and/or high IAI indicate high insulin sensitivity, whereas high HBCI and/or ISI indicate strong β cell function.</p>

<sec id="section5-0884533611436173">
<title>Carotid Artery Ultrasound Studies</title>
<p>All participants underwent B-mode ultrasonography of the extracranial carotid arteries with a high-resolution ultrasound duplex scanner (ATL, HDI 5000; Philips Sistemi Medical, Bothell, WA) with a 7- to 10-MHz linear array multifrequency transducer. All examinations were performed by the same ultrasonographer blinded to clinical information. The right and left common carotid arteries (CCA) and internal carotid arteries (including bifurcations) were evaluated with the participants in supine position, with the head turned away from the sonographer and the neck extended with mild rotation. The IMT, defined as the distance between the intimal-luminal interface and the medial-adventitial interface, was measured as follows: briefly, in the posterior approach and with the sound beam set perpendicular to the arterial surface, 1 cm from the bifurcation, 3 longitudinal measurements of IMT were completed, and the mean value of 6 measurements from right (IMT-R) and left (IMT-L) carotid arteries was used. Plaque, detected in longitudinal and transverse planes with anterior, lateral, and posterior approaches, was defined as an echogenic focal structure encroaching the vessel lumen with a distinct area 50% greater than the IMT of neighboring sites. The average absolute difference and standard deviation between measurements for 30 participants who had replicate maximum IMT measurements was 0.02–0.04 mm.</p>

<title>The Risk of Developing CVD</title>
<p>The participants, aged between 24 and 55 (117 lacto-vegetarians and 126 omnivores), were selected from the participants for analyzing the risk of developing CVD (referred to as CVR). The CVR was calculated based on the points table developed by the Framingham Study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533611436173">8</xref></sup> Five parameters were taken into consideration, 4 of which are continuous variables (age, SBP, TC, and HDL-C concentration), and the other is a dichotomous variable defined by the presence of cigarette smoking. All individuals who declared themselves to be “smokers” at the interview or reported to have quit smoking for &lt;6 months prior to the interview were considered smokers. Those who declared themselves as occasional smokers were also considered smokers. According to the scores obtained, the probability of developing CVD in 5–10 years was calculated by using the table developed in the Framingham Study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533611436173">14</xref></sup> CVR was plotted as a function of age, followed by nonlinear regression (curve fit) analysis with power series (equation: CVR = a × Age<sup>b</sup>) in GraphPad Prism 5.0 statistical software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) to calculate the correlation between CVR and age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533611436173">15</xref></sup> The stratification of cardiovascular risk was performed according to the Framingham Study, and low risk level was considered when event risk was &lt;10% in 5–10 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0884533611436173">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS for Windows 13.0 statistical software package (SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, IL). Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The parametric independent samples <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare the differences between 2 groups. A <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The baseline clinical characteristics of participants are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533611436173">Table 1</xref>. No significant differences in age, hip circumference, and waist circumference were found between the 2 groups. However, compared with that of omnivores, BMI, SDP, and DBP were lower in lacto-vegetarians. The results regarding participants’ liver function test and renal function test showed that γ-GT, SCr, and UA were significantly lower but ALP was relatively higher in the lacto-vegetarian group compared with the omnivore group. No significant difference was found in TP, STB, UB, ALT, and AST between the 2 groups (data not shown). Omnivores had significantly higher levels of TG, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, ApoA<sub>1</sub>, and ApoB, as well as a higher TC:HDL-C ratio than lacto-vegetarians, whereas ApoA<sub>1</sub>/ApoB ratios were similar in both groups. Omnivores had significantly lower HBCI and ISI than the lacto-vegetarians, with higher FBG. However, there were no differences in FIns and HOMA-IR between the 2 groups.</p>

<p>The IMT was significantly different between the 2 groups, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0884533611436173">Table 2</xref>. Compared with the omnivores, both IMT-R and IMT-L were thinner in lacto-vegetarians. The probability of developing coronary artery disease in 10 years was calculated for participants aged 24–55 years old (117 lacto-vegetarians and 126 omnivores). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0884533611436173">Figure 1</xref>, the total CVR points were significantly lower among lacto-vegetarians. The probability of developing CVD in 5–10 years was also calculated for these 2 groups, and the risk value was plotted as a function of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0884533611436173">Figure 2</xref>). The probability of developing CVD in 5–10 years for lacto-vegetarians and omnivores was adjusted by regression according to the following equations: CVR = 2.87 × 10<sup>−6</sup> × Age<sup>3.64</sup> and 1.47 × 10<sup>−5</sup> × Age<sup>3.50</sup>, respectively. Significant correlation between CVR and age was present in both groups (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). The results showed that the probability curve starts to present an upward inflection after 25 years in both groups. However, when lacto-vegetarians reach the age 55 years, they still have a very low probability of developing CVD in 10 years (6.1%) and are classified as low risk, whereas omnivores of the same age have a significantly higher probability (17.9%). The mean ± SD of the probability of CVD in 10 years was 1.3% ± 2.0% for vegetarians and 3.8% ± 5.4% for omnivores, respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our data showed that Chinese lacto-vegetarians had lower SBP and DBP and lower serum TC, TG, LDL-C, and UA when compared with omnivores. Blood pressure and lipid profile are generally associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and are considered conventional cardiovascular risk factors. Abundant data suggest that these parameters are favorable in vegetarians, in agreement with our results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533611436173">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533611436173">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533611436173"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533611436173">17</xref></sup> Although lacto-vegetarians had lower HDL-C than did omnivores, they had a lower TC:HDL-C ratio. The TC:HDL-C ratio has been suggested as the second univariate predictor of the risk of cardiovascular events (relative risk 3.4), followed by TC (relative risk 2.4) and LDL-C (relative risk 2.4), in a prospective case control study over 3 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533611436173">18</xref></sup> Hence, higher TC:HDL-C ratios in vegetarians are likely to predict lower risk of CVD.</p>
<p>The results regarding glucose metabolism in the present studies also indicated lower cardiovascular risks in Chinese lacto-vegetarians. Significantly lower FBG paralleled with higher HBCI and ISI was present in lacto-vegetarians compared with omnivores, despite no statistical difference in FIns, HOMA-IR, and IAI. Lower FBG in vegetarians<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533611436173">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533611436173">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533611436173">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0884533611436173"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0884533611436173"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533611436173">22</xref></sup> and even in elder vegetarians (older than age 50 years)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533611436173">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0884533611436173">24</xref></sup> has also been reported by previous cohort and case control studies. Furthermore, higher HBCI and ISI, which suggest better β cell function and insulin sensitivity, have been seen in vegetarians in previous investigations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0884533611436173">21</xref></sup> In contrast, a study on 36 Taiwanese patients older than age 50 years found no difference in ISI and HBCI but significantly lower FIns and HOMA-IR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533611436173">23</xref></sup> Nevertheless, lower FBG and higher HBCI and ISI in vegetarians suggest better β cell function and lower risks for disorders of glucose homeostasis. Undoubtedly, impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity could subsequently lead to metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, which could greatly account for the morbidity and mortality of CVD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533611436173">12</xref></sup> Vegetarian diets also comply with the guidelines for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, and studies indicate that these guidelines reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Interestingly, we found markedly lower γ-GT in vegetarians compared with omnivores. γ-GT is highly related to oxidative stress, which plays important roles in both metabolic diseases and CVD. Raised γ-GT has been considered a significant independent predictor of impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus, associated with all the features of the metabolic syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533611436173">25</xref></sup> Moreover, a follow-up study concluded that γ-GT is an independent risk factor for the development of high TG, hypertension, impaired fasting glucose, and diabetes mellitus in Japanese adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533611436173">26</xref></sup> These results are in line with the findings in the present study and support the view that better metabolic parameters in vegetarians might contribute to lower cardiovascular risks.</p>
<p>Carotid IMT measured by ultrasound is strongly associated with CVD and its risk factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533611436173">9</xref></sup> Carotid IMT has been widely used in epidemiological and clinical studies for the evaluation of early atherosclerosis because it can provide a surrogate end point to assess early atherosclerosis in the absence of “hard” clinical outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533611436173">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533611436173">11</xref></sup> In the present study, we observed thinner IMT in lacto-vegetarian men compared with that in omnivores. This is in concert with a cross-sectional study, which reported that a long-term low-calorie, low-protein vegan diet led to significantly thinner IMT of carotid arteries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533611436173">6</xref></sup> However, conflicting results were reported in a study of 118 healthy postmenopausal Taiwanese women, in whom no significant difference in IMT was found between vegetarians and omnivores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0884533611436173">27</xref></sup> This might be due to the following reasons: on one hand, different types of participants were chosen, so the populations were different in age, gender, and other characteristics compared with the present study; on the other hand, the cross-sectional design may have limited the causal inference. As discussed in that report, overmatching might partially explain the negative findings of no difference in carotid atherosclerosis and carotid IMT.</p>
<p>The CVR in 5–10 years, calculated by using the points table developed by the Framingham Study, might help clinical prevention and treatment of CVD. The equations and the point score prediction probability algorithm attempt to elucidate the multifactorial etiology of coronary heart disease and produce possible comparisons and interpretations for clinicians and their patients at risk. Risk factor scores and calculations can be discussed with patients and provide a framework for intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533611436173">8</xref></sup> In our analysis of CVD risks, participants aged 24–55 years were selected from both groups (117 vegetarians and 126 omnivores). Combined with the IMT results and other parameters, these data generally suggested lower risks for CVD in male Chinese lacto-vegetarians. Previous investigations on different ethnic groups with different ages have provided similar results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533611436173">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533611436173">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0884533611436173">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0884533611436173"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0884533611436173">30</xref></sup> A favorable profile associated with CVD by a vegetarian diet in individuals with type 2 diabetes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0884533611436173">31</xref></sup> individuals with hypertension,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0884533611436173">32</xref></sup> and elderly volunteers (&gt;50 years)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0884533611436173">33</xref></sup> with various diseases such as essential hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and other CVDs has been reported as well. Some studies report the detrimental aspects of vegetarian diets to CVD, such as the relatively low consumption of unsaturated fatty acids and long-chain ω-3 and trans fatty acids (eg, α-linolenic acid, EPA, and DHA),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533611436173">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0884533611436173">34</xref></sup> as well as functional vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency and subsequent hyperhomocysteinemia, another risk factor for CVD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0884533611436173">35</xref></sup> However, in general, lower CVR in vegetarians has been confirmed by numerous studies. Taken together, when calculated using multiple parameters, the favorable characteristics such as better SBP, lipid profiles, and IMT contribute to the lower CVR found in vegetarians.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to this study. The cross-sectional design may limit the causal inference. The participants were recruited from healthy volunteers, not a randomized population. Hence, the results may underestimate the true effects of a long-term lacto-vegetarian diet consumption.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our data suggest that, when compared with the omnivore diet, the typical Chinese lacto-vegetarian diet has favorable effects on blood pressure, lipid profiles, and metabolic parameters and results in significantly thinner carotid IMT and lower CVR in healthy men. Because of the different predictive value of these risk factors, we believe that the typical Chinese lacto-vegetarian diet is correlated with improved cardiovascular health and is clinically significant for the prevention of cardiovascular disorders. Long-term consumption of a vegetarian diet, according to our results, is promisingly a beneficial dietary pattern, especially for the people with other cardiovascular risks or diabetes/glucose intolerance. We therefore recommend that more vegetables should be eaten instead of meat, and it is never too late to change eating habits.</p>
