<p><italic>Education, Conflict and Development</italic> is a stimulating and provocative work of particular interest to development practitioners and specialists in post-conflict education. Essentially, the collection proposes a refinement and reframing of approaches to education in emergencies. Readers are invited to consider the (im)precision of existing discursive terminology and the limitations of current education practice – argued to be partially a result of these ambiguities. Prevailing assumptions are consistently challenged; several contributors examine, for example, the ‘negative face’ of education as a <italic>facilitating</italic> factor in conflict and barrier to reconciliation. Part One of the book is centred primarily on conceptual themes, while Part Two explores a series of case studies illustrating the complex relationship between education and the socioeconomic dynamics of post-conflict societies. Part Three focuses on the legacy of conflict for learners and learning in northern Uganda.</p>
<p>A number of themes resonate throughout the work. Among these are the importance of informal education and the broader question of the best conduit for the delivery of content. There is useful discussion of the persistent challenge of defining general principles and practices while remaining mindful of the uniqueness of local conditions. Some more specific points, such as the assertion that traditional, authoritarian teaching practices may reinforce learner disempowerment, also tend to recur. The challenge of educating in this context is reinforced by another recurring image – that of disruptive and unmotivated learners scarred by conflict and straining beyond teacher control.</p>
<p>Having read Audrey Bryan’s recent (2011, Issue 12) <italic>Development Education</italic> editorial suggesting incipient deradicalisation of the development education agenda, I was struck by the clarion ambition of Colin Brock’s call for no less than ‘a reconceptualisation of education in all countries and communities in the world’ (p. 30). Brock makes many thoughtful and important points on the imperative for increased female participation in education, the need to understand the culturally embedded nature of education, and the vulnerability of education systems to political manipulation. Brock’s assertion that ‘correspondence between curriculum and economy is extremely difficult to achieve’ (p. 21) is intriguing. Presumably this predicament appears most acute to those holding a view of education as essentially <italic>about</italic> addressing prevailing labour market requirements. This perspective may obtain in any society and would seem positively correlated to both (longer-term) economic insecurity and (shorter-term) contractions in the business cycle. In any case, short-term economic skills requirements will always surge ahead of curriculum content. Yet this predicament is somewhat illusory if one perceives ‘conflict’ between instrumental/economic and humanist conceptions of education as spurious when social and economic development is considered <italic>over the long term</italic>. This latter perspective is rooted in a belief that the kind of creative, critical thought required in the best humanities educations nurtures the dynamic approach to learning so critical for long-term education and civil society development. Even if one finds Brock’s approval of UNESCO’s call for ‘radical transformation and moral change in the character of society’ (p. 26) a trifle messianic, his belief in the ameliorative power of ground-up education to instil commitment to planetary sustainability and the prevention of conflict makes for a thoughtful and stirring beginning to the work.</p>
<p>Stephanie Bengtsson rightly points out that enhanced development outcomes must be grounded in improved conceptual/terminological precision. In particular, the value of the term/classification ‘fragile states’ is examined. The ‘Fragile States’ Problem, as she sees it, is largely based on the term’s ambiguity and consequent confusion as to, for example, the number of people living in affected areas. She is concerned that insufficient time or context is allowed for ‘collaborative critical reflection’ towards shared understandings of these meanings. Bengtsson’s point that poor theory results in poor practice is well taken. What one might take issue with is the assertion, alluded to in her contribution, that the use of terms like ‘fragile’ is gratuitously offensive or condescending to those living in the countries so described. Elites in developing states may well find a diagnosis of fragility ‘marginalising’, or ‘ghettoising’. Working for a number of years at the grittier end of education in Cambodia, I became aware that my local colleagues tended to be more concerned with, for example, the unlawful seizure of land by unaccountable local officials than by any imagined affronts to national pride. Expressions of disapproval of terms such as these sound more like the voice of local elites than of the majority, none of whom – in my experience – had any difficulty characterizing aspects of their societies as chronically dysfunctional. The terminological tit-for-tat of ‘an unnamed donor’ asserting that violence in European and American schools demonstrates an equivalent ‘fragility’ in those societies is difficult to take seriously. Excessive attentiveness to the pride and sensitivities of local elites, though strategically understandable, may produce approaches insensitive to the experiences and interests of those most in need.</p>
<p>Jeremy Rappleye’s lucid contribution raises a host of issues. One essential question is the interaction of development and conflict paradigms and consequent assumptions about causality, appropriate interventions and their implications for education. Given the current turbulence in North Africa and elsewhere, Rappleye’s consideration of varying catalysts of conflict is also timely and engaging. Christine Pagen, meanwhile, begins Part Two with a discussion of how the process of democracy-building through informal and community-based mechanisms can be achieved. She calls for support of ‘multiple sources of learning’ (p. 116) and suggests that future research should explore how interactions with international NGOs affect attitudes and behaviour in contexts such as southern Sudan.</p>
<p>Mitsuko Matsumoto considers whether our expectations of education as a peace building force are realistic. Her stark response, at least in the current context of Sierra Leone, is negative. In the process of calling for a more contextualized approach to education, Matsumoto asserts that Sierra Leone is failing in its efforts to fundamentally reform its ‘elitist and divisive’ education system. Matsumoto concludes her interesting analysis with the relatively sanguine assertion that a more enlightened understanding of the expectations of education amongst learners might ‘play a constructive and perhaps transformative role in their lives’ (p. 139).</p>
<p>Reading Tomoe Otsuki’s fascinating account of the Joint History Textbook Initiative undertaken by educators and bureaucrats from China, Japan and South Korea, one is reminded of the enduring power of historical experience to define national identities – and their associated animosities. Aside from intriguing discussion of the challenges inherent in reaching consensus on emotive and deeply contrasting accounts of recent history, Otsuki presents her description of the place of collective memory and intergenerational responsibility for past collective transgressions. Otsuki’s account of the impasse amongst Initiative participants on the numbers of casualties resulting from the 1937–8 Nanking Massacre is just one illustration of how difficult the process of producing <italic>History [that] Opens to the Future: the contemporary and modern history of the three nations in East Asia</italic> (2005, 2006) must have been. Whether Korean or Chinese students ought to explore the suffering inflicted in Hiroshima, Nagasaki or Tokyo might seem a less contentious issue - though here, too, consensus proved illusive. Some might feel that histories that teach that war is awful <italic>exclusively</italic> because of what <italic>we</italic> have suffered through it are insufficient, ineffective and immature. Otsuki ultimately concludes that no shared history project has yet succeeded in prompting introspection on domestic nationalisms.</p>
<p>Murphy et al. begin Part Three with an analysis of the prospects and experiences of female survivors of sexual violence. This heartrending account of victims often so stigmatized and marginalized that they are compelled to withdraw from school highlights the urgent need for programmes to shift perspectives on gender and sexual violence. Ezati et al’s important contribution describes teachers’ perspectives on the effect of young people’s experience of war on their learning. This chapter examines the needs of both traumatized learners and teachers, and laments the impact that poor morale and working conditions have had on ‘wounded healers’ in the classroom.</p>
<p>In the final chapter, Jeremy Cunningham discusses the characteristics of good-quality peace building education. Once again, the chapter’s focus is on attitudes and values; the <italic>internal</italic> infrastructure for education. Cunningham reminds readers of the crucial distinction between peace <italic>keeping</italic>, which may be implemented through autocratic means, and peace <italic>building</italic> – directed towards equality and empowerment. Cunningham calls for comprehensive human rights education to be ‘firmly built into the taught curriculum’ (p. 222), while also noting teacher concerns that students be informed of the reciprocal nature of rights and responsibilities. Given the potential for education to empower resistance to entrenched inequities, Cunningham’s contention that human rights education ‘generally does not address national political, legal and social institutions and their operation’ (p. 213) is perhaps unsurprising.</p>
<p><italic>Education, Conflict and Development</italic> makes compelling reading for anyone with a professional or personal interest in ameliorative approaches to education in the most challenging of circumstances. This is not to imply that readers will find a single reforming programme or ideological thrust cohering across these very different contributions. One need not agree with all the arguments contained in this work to find it useful; one might even suggest that agreeing with all the contributors would <italic>require</italic> a degree of inconsistency on the part of the reader. Yet this diversity perhaps highlights the overall strength and value of the work; <italic>Education, Conflict and Development</italic> effectively compels readers to consider the diversity, ambition and vitality of discourse in this critical area of educational research.</p>
