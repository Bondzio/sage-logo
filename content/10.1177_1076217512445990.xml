<p>This column is devoted to a discussion of the importance of gifted education participating in the translation of the new Common Core State Standards (CCSS) in local and state contexts. There are several reasons we need to engage in this process.</p>
<p>The CCSS is the most successful attempt to gain consensus across states for 21st century standards in language arts and mathematics. So far, 46 states have accepted these standards, with two consortia organized to translate them into resources and sample activities. A consultant firm has been hired to develop the assessments that will replace current state tests and be more performance based in orientation than many state assessments currently are. These standards and assessments then will become a de facto national curriculum that intends to be rigorous and challenging for all learners in these core subject areas. Plans for the science standards are currently in process as well.</p>
<p>This is all good news for gifted education as the level of some of the standards is well aligned with our new National Association for Gifted Children (NAGC) program standards. The CCSS language arts standards, for example, emphasize the importance of building argument, through using informational texts as well as literature and doing so in written and oral forms. This emphasis elevates the thinking and problem solving of students in this subject area.</p>
<p>In mathematics, the emphasis for mathematically proficient students centers on the following areas:</p>
<list id="list1-1076217512445990" list-type="order">

</list>
<disp-quote>
<p>“Gifted learners will need to be assessed through performance-based and portfolio techniques that are based on higher level learning outcomes than the new common core may employ.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Again, we see in the math standards an emphasis on reasoning and argument, an excellent match to desirable outcomes for gifted learners from a math curriculum.</p>
<p>The inauguration of the CCSS in almost all states is cause for gifted education as a field to reflect on its role in providing appropriately for gifted and high-potential learners in the content areas. As a field, we have not always differentiated systematically in the core domains of learning, but rather focused on interdisciplinary concepts, higher level skills, and problem solving, typically across domains. With the new common core, it becomes critical for us to show how we are differentiating for gifted learners, within a set of standards that are reasonably rigorous in each subject area.</p>
<p>It has been stated by some that the common core does not require any special differentiation for the gifted since the standards are already high level. Unfortunately, although the standards are strong, they are not sufficiently advanced to accommodate the needs of most gifted learners. As the Chief State School Officers (CSSO) and the National Governors Association (NGC) have noted, some students will traverse the standards before the end of high school, which will require educators to provide advanced content for them. Beyond accelerative methods, however, there is also a need to enrich the standards by ensuring that there are open-ended opportunities to meet the standards through multiple pathways, more complex thinking applications, and real-world problem-solving contexts. This requires a deliberate strategy among gifted educators to ensure that these standards are translated in a way that allows for differentiated practices to be employed with gifted and high-potential students.</p>
<p>Finally, as with all standards, new assessments will likely drive the instructional process. As a field, we must be aware of the need to differentiate new assessments that align with the standards as well. Gifted learners will need to be assessed through performance-based and portfolio techniques that are based on higher level learning outcomes than the new common core may employ.</p>

<title>What Can We Do Now?</title>
<p>All coordinators of gifted programs can begin work that will inform their constituencies of what the CCSS is and how gifted education would be affected. Moreover, they can begin the alignment task by designing first a scope and sequence of the opportunities that are provided for gifted learners in the areas of math and language arts from K-12 and then correlating it with the CCSS.</p>
<list id="list2-1076217512445990" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Organize professional development on awareness and implementation issues.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Ensure that teachers of the gifted are socialized to the importance of alignment to the common core with their curriculum for gifted learners in both language arts and math. Alignment work has already been done with several differentiated materials used with gifted learners (see the Center for Gifted Education website at William and Mary, for example). If your district uses these materials, some of the design work is already done for you. If the curriculum used in a gifted program is primarily teacher developed, then this curriculum should go through the alignment process.</p>
<list id="list3-1076217512445990" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>2. Design scope and sequence charts for gifted learners in math and English Language Arts</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>This task is called for by the new CCSS but also by the NAGC curriculum standards. It is critical that we define what is differentiated in these core subject areas at each stage of development for gifted learners, showing how our curriculum connects to that which is relevant for all learners but also how it deviates. A good strategy to begin the task is to design down from Advanced Placement options and/or the International Baccalaureate program. This will solidify an emphasis on higher level thinking in each domain as well as align well to the highest level of curriculum available to gifted learners in most school districts.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As the challenges of 21st century learning are all around us, we need to practice the skills that are touted to be the new basics—critical and creative thinking, problem solving, collaboration, and communication—by using them to teach our best learners in the core curriculum domains. By so doing, we demonstrate our commitment to the direction of the new standards and assessments that will drive our teacher education programs at preservice and in-service levels for the next decade. For once, gifted education will have the wind at its back rather than bucking the gusts of change as we often do.</p>
