<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cricket has evolved over the last 30 years to offer three distinct products at the international level: Test Match cricket, played over 5 days (6 hr of playing time per day with an additional hour for lunch (40 min) and tea (20 min) with a mandatory 90 overs per day; one day internationals, played over a single day (approximately 8–9 hr) with each side batting/bowling for 50 overs (ODI); and Twenty20 matches, usually played in the evening, with each side batting/bowling for 20 overs (T20). The fact that T20 cricket matches, unlike Test Matches and ODIs, are not demanding in terms of spectator time—with a typical T20 match being completed in 3–4 hr—and that the 20-over format encourages and promotes exciting and explosive play has done much to promote the popularity of this form of the game.</p>
<p>The formation of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2008 sought to unlock the commercial potential that the popularity of T20 cricket offered by modeling itself on football’s English Premier League (EPL): IPL teams, like those in the EPL, would be based on geographical areas within the relevant country but would include players of various nationalities. The IPL teams—of which there were eight in 2008—were franchises of the IPL. The IPL acted as a holding company, securing the participation of players through a guaranteed base price and then selling these players to the various IPL franchises though an auction system which determined their final payment. There were thus two components to a player’s “value”: the base price determined by the IPL and the final price paid at the IPL auction by the winning bid for that player.</p>
<p>The basic assumption made in this article is that the base price for a player is founded for the most part on the <italic>publicly available</italic> information about him. For example, batsman X’s base price might be based on inter alia his batting average, his strike rate (runs per 100 balls), his specialist position in the batting order, the form of cricket—Test Match or ODIs—to which he was best suited.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1527002511406994">1</xref></sup> Of course, one cannot rule out the possibility that private information might also enter the base price equation—for example, it might be “known” for an Indian player that he was a positive (or negative) influence in the dressing room without corresponding information being available about, say, Australian players. Nor can the role of sentiment be ruled out. Prior to the formation of the IPL, international cricket was largely based on intercountry competition. Although the IPL sought to form teams of mixed nationalities one cannot rule out bias in setting base prices: a nationalistic bias in favor of Indian players or, conversely, an excessive awe of foreign heroes. However, given that cricket is a game replete with publicly available statistical information about all international (and national) players, we believe that in essence—the above caveats notwithstanding—base prices follow the <italic>semi-strong</italic> version of the efficient market hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527002511406994">Fama, 1970</xref>): the base prices of players reflect all the publicly available information about them and that these prices would change in subsequent (post-2008) IPL rounds in response to newly available public information.</p>
<p>In a rational market, both the base and final prices would be engendered by the publicly available—to both the IPL and its franchisees—information on the players; consequently, there might be expected to be a close correlation between the base prices and the final prices. However, this did not appear to be the case with the player auction under IPL 2008 characterized as it was with large and unexpected differences between the base and final prices: for example, cricketing giants such as the Australian Test captain Ricky Pointing and the legendary (albeit recently retired) spin bowler Shane Warne attracted lower final prices than players of substantially inferior pedigree. This raises the possibility that noncricketing factors entered the bidding process and that these were driven by the “irrational exuberance” (hereafter, IE) created within the newly formed franchises.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1527002511406994">Shiller (2005)</xref> observes that the term “IE” was first used on December 5, 1996, by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, in an after-dinner speech to the American Enterprise Institute on “The Challenge of Central Banking in a Democratic Society.” In that speech, he posed the question: “but how do we know when <italic>irrational exuberance</italic> has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions?” Since then, the term “IE” has come to mean a heightened sense of speculative fever. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527002511406994">Akerlof and Shiller (2009)</xref> in their seminal book on the role of human psychology in driving the economy draw attention to Keynes' contention that much of economic activity was driven by “animal spirits”; left to its own devices, capitalist economies would pursue excess with <italic>manias</italic> followed by <italic>panic</italic>. In attempting to flesh out Keynes' ideas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527002511406994">Akerlof and Shiller (2009)</xref> emphasized five aspects which comprised animal spirits: confidence, fairness, corruption and antisocial behavior, money illusion, and stories.</p>
<p>It is the contention of the article that the IPL auction of 2008 was characterized by irrational exuberance which led to a disjoint between auction prices and base prices. The auction itself was characterized by a great deal of razzmatazz and received considerable publicity on television and in newspapers; there was the heady combination of industrial magnates (Vijay Mallya, Mukesh Ambani), Bollywood starlets (Preity Zinta, Shilpa Shetty), and past cricketing heroes (Sunil Gavaskar, Ravi Shastri). Serving as a backdrop to the adrenalin-suffused atmosphere of the auction was a sense of <italic>confidence</italic> related to the financial clout that Indian cricket commanded. The <italic>story</italic> that underpinned this confidence was that of “India Shining”—the pride that many Indians took in their country’s growing economic strength. Given that the franchises were Indian owned—and given also that it was an IPL requirement that 7 of the 11 players in any match had to be Indian—the franchises were keen to promote <italic>fairness</italic> in salaries between foreign stars (the Pontings and the Warnes) and Indian players of lesser renown (the Jadejas and the Asnodkars); competition between the franchises in the crucible of the auction meant that a few million overspent on a player did not seem to matter—<italic>money illusion</italic> prevailed over the duration of the auction; finally, as subsequent events—replete with allegations of arrogance and high-handedness and of money laundering and tax avoidance—unfolded, the stench of <italic>corruption</italic> and <italic>antisocial behavior</italic> began to spread through the IPL.</p>
<p>Against this background, this article has three objectives:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>To propose, and to implement a method, for measuring the amount of investor IE in the IPL 2008 auction and to separate exuberance as being due to a mean-enhancing and an inequality-increasing effect.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>To examine the markups (that is, the ratio of sale to base price) for the individual players and to use inequality decomposition techniques for analyzing the factors underpinning interplayer inequality in markups?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>To propose, and to implement for measuring the value of a player to his owners and to thereby arrive at an assessment of the cost of a player per unit of performance: given a price paid for a player did his subsequent IPL performance make him a ‘lemon” or a “plum.”</p>

<title>Past Research on Wage Determination in Professional Sport</title>
<p>There are two areas of research of direct relevance to the payment outcomes in the IPL: that relating to the determination of wages in professional sport; and that dealing with investor behavior in sports auctions and player drafts. Although there do not appear to be studies on the determination of wages in cricket (however, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527002511406994">Lenten, Geerling, &amp; Konya, 2010</xref>, discussed below) there are a number of studies of player payments in baseball which, to a greater degree than other team sports, places emphasis on individual performances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1527002511406994">Hill &amp; Spellman, 1983</xref>; Scully,1974). All these studies used a combination of individual and team performance data and sport-specific institutional settings to assign player valuations.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1527002511406994">Scully (1974)</xref> attempted to value the marginal productivity of baseball players, in terms of pitching and batting, to examine the deadweight loss of the “reserve system” that characterized contracting arrangements in baseball prior to 1975. Using a simple linear model to predict the expected wages of batters and pitchers—in which the determining variables included an observed individual output variable (number of home runs/strikeouts), a team performance variable (win/loss ratio), and an intercept term to reflect average wages in the industry and a stochastic error term to pick up unexplained factors—he found that under the reserve system, star players were underrewarded to a significant degree and were subsidizing average players and contributing to producer surpluses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1527002511406994">Hill and Spellman (1983)</xref> undertook a similar exercise after the reserve system and found that now player wages were aligned more closely to individual performance.</p>
<p>The other area of direct relevance to the IPL is that of bidder behavior in sports auctions such as player drafts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527002511406994">Massey and Thaler (2010)</xref> used archival data on draft-day trades, player performance, and remuneration to compare the market value of draft picks with the historical value of drafted players in the National Football League (NFL). They found that in the draft process “nonregressive predictions, over confidence, the winners curse, and false consensus” all combined to produce over valuations in the upper level of the draft picks, with corresponding undervaluation of lower ranking draft picks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527002511406994">Massey &amp; Thaler, 2010</xref>)</p>
<p>The NFL draft process has two aspects of direct relevance to the IPL: predicting the future and competitive bidding. In models that stress rational behavior and market efficiency, agents are assumed to make unbiased predictions about the future and markets are assumed to aggregate individual expectations into unbiased predictions of fundamental value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527002511406994">Massey &amp; Thaler, 2010</xref>). However, research in this area suggests that actual behavior in the bidding process can deviate substantially from that suggested by such models. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527002511406994">Massey and Thaler (2010)</xref> tested the null hypothesis of rational expectations and market efficiency by examining whether the ratio of the market values of picks will, on average, be equal to the ratio of surplus values produced. They could not, at the 5% level of significance, accept this hypothesis but found instead that, for lower picks, the market value declined more steeply than the surplus value of the drafted players. This finding is accounted for by a number of factors common to the competitive bidding process in professional sports. These include overconfidence, winners curse, and false consensus.</p>
<p>The role of overconfidence is a spin off from the work on representativeness by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527002511406994">Kahneman and Tversky (1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527002511406994">2000</xref>). They argued that intuitive predictions are “insufficiently regressive” by which they mean intuitive predictions are more extreme and varied than is supported by the available evidence. Similarly, overconfidence reinforces these intuitive failings whereby bidders often believe that their knowledge is more precise than is actually the case. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527002511406994">Alpert and Raiffa (1982)</xref> conducted a trial where subjects were asked to define 90% confidence limits. They found that the subjects gave responses that were too narrow (overconfident) 43% of the time in comparison to the expected 10%. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527002511406994">Slovic and Corrigan (1973)</xref> found that individuals gained confidence in their predictions as their level of information increased, even if their prediction accuracy remained unchanged. This is not dissimilar to the problem faced by bidders in the IPL auction of accumulating increasing amounts of, often contradictory, information of the performance of players as the bidding process approached.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1527002511406994">2</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>It is also well-known that in a situation where bidders are competing for an item with a commonly agreed but uncertain value range, the winner commonly suffers the “winner’s curse” of overpaying. The winner’s curse first surfaced in the literature on competitive bidding for oil leases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527002511406994">Capen, Clapp, &amp; Campbell, 1971</xref>) and has been identified in a number of studies and within a number of competitive bidding environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527002511406994">Dessauer, 1981</xref>). Point to the similar concept they identify as “expectation inflation” whereby in an uncertain situation, winners of a bidding competition often come to regret their choice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527002511406994">Thaler (1988)</xref> argued that winner’s curse can occur even if bidders have “unbiased but noisy estimates” of the players true worth because “the winning bidder is very likely to be someone who has over-estimated the actual value of the player” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527002511406994">Thaler, 1988</xref>, p. 10). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527002511406994">Harrison and Bazerman (1995)</xref> point out that nonregressive predictions, the winner’s curse, and expectation inflation have a common root in bidder uncertainty which increases as the number of choice options increases. This is exactly the situation faced by bidding franchises in the IPL entering a new competition with limited information on the ability of individual players to adapt to this new form of the game.</p>
<p>Since 2008, there have been studies on player payments in the IPL focusing, in the main, on identifying those factors that determined the final prices paid for each player. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527002511406994">Lenten et al. (2010)</xref> used a series of cross-section regression models to determine the final valuation of players in the IPL in which the regressor variables were a combination of personal characteristic and playing ability factors, applied to Test Match and ODI performances, respectively. While the models exhibited some explanatory success they were, in the main, unable to successfully fully explain final prices by reference to past performances. As well, the models exhibited serial correlation among the variables.</p>
<p>Although serial correlation is normally regarded as a sign of model misspecification, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527002511406994">Lenten et al. (2010)</xref> argued that it was more likely the result of “bidder irrationality” and cited as evidence of this their finding of underbidding at the bottom, and overbidding at the top, of the final prices range. The extensive regression analysis undertaken by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527002511406994">Lenten et al. (2010)</xref> probably exhausts the useful information on the bidding process that may be gained by regression analysis using player performance data. In addition, regression analysis is hampered by the difficulty in specifying robust models for each of the three playing skills: batting, bowling, and fielding. As an alternative to the regression method, this article uses a different methodology to analyze the IPL auction process by focusing on interplayer inequality in payment outcomes.</p>

<title>Investor Exuberance in the IPL 2008 Auction</title>
<p>Structurally, the IPL consisted of eight franchises whose centers of gravity were some of India’s largest urban conurbations. These were: Bangalore Royal Challengers, Chennai Super Kings, Deccan Chargers, Delhi Daredevils, Kings XI Punjab, Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians, and Rajasthan Royals. In January 2008, an auction was held for ownership of these franchises, with a base (reserve) price for securing a franchise set at US$50 million. The realized prices ranged from $67 million to $112 million. Media rights were sold for over 1 billion. Each of the franchises acquired players through a modified auction system, the salient points of which were:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Each franchise required a squad of players with 11 players playing at any one time, of which only 4 could be non-Indian.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1527002511406994">3</xref></sup>
</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The franchises bid on the basis of the salary they were prepared to offer the players.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>There was an overall salary cap of $5 million, with a minimum requirement of $3.3 million.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Salaries were to be proportionately reduced if a player was unavailable for the entire 6-week IPL season. If a player is unavailable for less than 25% of the season the franchise was still liable for 25% of the salary, which also counted toward the salary cap.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The salary offer would run for 3 years, with some flexibility for player transfer.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Each bid would start with a base (reserve price) and no upper limit would be fixed, except for the overall constraint of the salary cap.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Players were to be grouped into different bands within the auction based on their similar experience and ability.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Each franchise would nominate an iconic player who would then attract a 15% wage differential over the next highest player. Captaincy would also attract a wage loading.</p>

shows the outcomes for the IPL auction of 2008 in which a total of 75 players from 8 countries, contracted to the IPL, were sold to the 8 franchises. The average reserve and sale prices for the 75 players in their entirety were, respectively, $203,400 and $488,067 implying a markup of 2.4 of the sale price over reserve price. By player type, the markup was <italic>lowest</italic> for wicketkeepers (an average of 1.87 for the 10 wicketkeepers) and was highest for all-rounders (an average of 3.07 for the 21 all-rounders); the 24 batsmen and the 20 bowlers obtained, respectively, markups of 2.07 and 2.0.

<p>Furthermore, interplayer inequality in base prices was considerably less than interplayer inequality in final prices. The values of the Gini coefficient were 0.186 and 0.321 for the distribution over the 75 players of, respectively, base and final prices. The Gini value of 0.186 implies that the difference in <italic>reserve price</italic> between two players chosen at random would be 37.2% of the average: since <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-1527002511406994">

</inline-formula> = 203,400, this difference would be $75,664. However, the Gini value of 0.321 implies that the difference in <italic>sale price</italic> between two players chosen at random would be 64.2% of the average and since <inline-formula id="inline-formula2-1527002511406994">

</p>
<p>The above results were the consequence of two effects operating simultaneously. The first was a <italic>mean-enhancing</italic> effect whereby the average price <italic>rose</italic> from its reserve value of $203,400 to its sale value of $488,067; the second was an <italic>inequality-increasing</italic> effect whereby, in the movement from reserve prices to sale prices, the distribution of rewards became <italic>more unequal</italic>. If there was no change in inequality between the reserve price and sale price distributions (that is, the Gini value of 0.186 remained unchanged), the average difference in <italic>sale price</italic> between two players chosen at random would have been $181,561.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1527002511406994">6</xref></sup> So, the difference of $105,897 between the average difference in sale and reserve prices (respectively, $181,561 and $75,664) between two players chosen at random, <italic>inequality unchanged</italic>, represents the <italic>mean-enhancing</italic> effect. Similarly, the difference of $131,778 between the average difference in sale price between two players chosen at random, <italic>inequality (first) changed and (then) unchanged</italic>—respectively, $313,339 and $181,561—represents the <italic>inequality-increasing</italic> effect. So, of the total difference of $313,339 in the sale price of two players chosen as random: $105, 897 was due to mean-enhancement, $181,561 was due to inequality enhancement, and the residual of $25,881 was the result of mean-inequality interaction.</p>
<p>In finance, the Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH) asserts that financial markets are “informationally efficient” in that prices of traded assets reflect all known information relevant to the performance of those assets: consequently, it is impossible to outperform the market except by using information unavailable to the market or through “luck.” We assume in this article that the reserve price for each player, as established by the IPL, is “informationally efficient” in the sense that it encapsulates <italic>all</italic> known and relevant information about the player in question.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1527002511406994">7</xref></sup> We assume also that the owners of the eight franchises were unlikely to have, on any systematic basis, information about the players which was not in the public domain. Consequently, any departure of the sale price from the reserve price is attributed in this article to <italic>investor exuberance</italic>. As we have argued, this exuberance can take one (or, more typically, both) of two forms: mean-enhancing exuberance and/or inequality-increasing exuberance.</p>

</italic> (θ = 1), <italic>E</italic> = 1 and there is no investor exuberance. Investor exuberance increases as the mean markup (λ) and the inequality markup (θ) increase. Since, on the available data, λ = 2.4 and θ = 1.73, <italic>E</italic> = 4.15: consequently, investor exuberance in the IPL auction of 2008 was more than four times its “base value.” As ) implies, investor exuberance is additively decomposable in logarithmic form since log(<italic>E</italic>) = log(λ) + log(θ).Using this property, 61% of investor exuberance in the IPL 2008 auction was generated by <italic>mean-enhancing</italic> and the remainder, 39%, was generated by <italic>inequality-increasing</italic>.</p>
<p>However, the above calculations must be tempered by the fact that the Gini coefficient shows a significant downward small sample bias when income is generated by one of three distributions: uniform, log-normal, and exponential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527002511406994">Deltas, 2003</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527002511406994">Deltas (2003)</xref> shows that the downward bias is quite small when the sample size is 50. When <italic>n</italic> = 50, the raw and adjusted Gini values are 0.329 and 0.336 for the uniform distribution, 0.270 and 0.276 for the log-normal distribution, and 0.490 and 0.500 for the exponential. Even assuming that the prices of the IPL players were generated by one these distributions, the sample size of 75 players makes it more than likely that the downward bias will be very small.</p>
<p>An interesting question is why, if the reserve prices incorporated all relevant information about the players, there should have been such a large degree of investor exuberance associated with the IPL auction? To explain this one has to appeal to the literature on <italic>behavioral finance</italic> which emphasizes the psychological underpinnings of financial transactions. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527002511406994">Krugman (2009)</xref> observed, “Practitioners of this approach emphasise two things. First, many real-world investors bear little resemblance to the cool calculators of efficient-market theory: they’re all too subject to herd behaviour, to bouts of irrational exuberance and unwarranted panic. Second, even those who try to base their decisions on cool calculation often find that they can’t, that problems of trust, credibility and limited collateral force them to run with the herd.” Under this paradigm, investors may display “overconfidence,” wish to “gamble and speculate,” perceive history as “irrelevant,” and “posture and pose” by making extravagantly expensive purchases.</p>

<title>Inequality Analysis of the IPL 2008 Auction</title>
<p>The markup figure of 2.4, of the average sale over average reserve price, varied considerably between players: for Manoj Tiwai (Delhi), Ishant Sharma (Kolkata), and David Hussey (Kolkata) the sale price was over six times the reserve price; at the other extreme, 19 of the 75 auctioned players were sold at their reserve price. The behavior of the markup values encapsulates investor exuberance: an average value of the markup greater than unity raises the sale price above reserve levels and the fact that the markup is different for different players makes the distribution of sale prices different from that of reserve prices. Since the Gini value of the distribution of the markup over the 75 players was 0.325, the inequality in its distribution was considerable: the difference in <italic>markups</italic> between two players chosen at random will be 65% of the average: since average markup was 2.4, this difference would be 1.56.</p>
<p>Let λ<sub>
<italic>t</italic>

</inline-formula> representing the average markup. Suppose, for an inequality index <italic>I</italic> (say, the Gini coefficient), I (<bold>λ</bold>) is the inequality associated with the distribution <bold>λ</bold> = (λ<sub>1</sub>,…, λ<sub>
<italic>N</italic>
</sub>). A natural question that arises from the inequality in the distribution of markups is the following: if the players were divided into mutually exclusive groups, then how much of the observed inequality in markups was due to inequality <italic>within</italic> the groups and how much was due to inequality <italic>between</italic> the groups. For example, if the two groups were Indian and Overseas players, then part of the overall inequality in markups was due to inequality <italic>within</italic> the ranks of Indian and of Overseas players and part was due to inequality <italic>between</italic> the groups of Indian and Overseas players, with Indian players obtaining, on average, a higher markup than Overseas players. Similarly, if four groups were distinguished by player type—batsmen, bowlers, wicketkeepers, and all-rounders—then part of the overall inequality in markups was due to inequality <italic>within</italic> the batsmen, bowlers, wicketkeepers, and all-rounders and part was due to inequality <italic>between</italic> the different player types with some types obtaining, on average, a higher markup than other types.</p>
<p>In this section, we attempt to answer this question using the methodology of <italic>inequality decomposition</italic>. The property of <italic>decomposability</italic> implies that there should be coherent relationship between inequality in a group and inequality in its subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527002511406994">Cowell, 1977</xref>): the basic idea is that total inequality (say, among the salaries of all the IPL players) should be capable of being written as a function of inequality within and between player subgroups (say, Indian and Overseas players). A particularly attractive form of decomposability is <italic>additive decomposability</italic> when total inequality can be expressed as the <italic>sum</italic> of within and between subgroup inequalities.</p>
<p>More formally, suppose that the <italic>N</italic> players in the auction are divided into <italic>M</italic> mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive groups with <italic>N<sub>m</sub>
</italic> (<italic>m</italic> = 1,…, <italic>M</italic>) players in each group. Let <bold>λ</bold> = {λ<sub>
<italic>t</italic>
</sub>} and <bold>λ<sub>m</sub>
</bold> = {λ<sub>
<italic>t</italic>
</sub>} represent the vector of markups among, respectively, all the players (<italic>i</italic> = 1,…, <italic>N</italic>) and the players in group <italic>m</italic>. Then an inequality index <italic>I</italic>(<bold>λ</bold>;<italic>N</italic>) defined over the vector of markups is said to be additively decomposable if:<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-1527002511406994">

</disp-formula>The inequality index defined in ) is known as the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1527002511406994">Theil’s (1967)</xref> Mean Logarithmic Deviation (MLD) and, because of its attractive features in terms of the interpretation of the weights, it was the one used in this study to decompose players' markups.</p>
<p>Although inequality within a given group or subgroup is a purely <italic>ordinal</italic> concept, the decomposition by component subgroups is contingent upon the specific <italic>cardinalization</italic> of the inequality measure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527002511406994">Cowell and Jenkins (1995)</xref> show that there are two approaches to the cardinalization issue: one based on statistically convenient considerations and the other based on explicitly additively separable social welfare. Cardinalization based on the former property (<italic>G</italic>-cardinalization) results in the Generalized Entropy family of indices of which the MLD index of ) is a specific case. Under both <italic>G</italic>- and <italic>A</italic>-cardinalizations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527002511406994">Cowell and Jenkins (1995)</xref> have argued, the proportionate contribution of the between-group component (<bold>B</bold>) to overall inequality is the inequality literature’s analogue of the <italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup> statistic used in regression analysis: the size of this contribution is a measure of the amount of inequality that can be “explained” by the factor (or factors) used to subdivide the sample (for example, by type of player).</p>
<p>When the division of players was by whether they were Overseas or Indian players, 17% of overall inequality in the distribution of markups between the 75 players auctioned was explained by inequality between the groups (the term B in ), above): in other words, the fact that the average markups for Indian and Overseas players were, respectively, 3.43 and 2.07 was sufficient to explain 17% of overall inequality; the remaining 83% was due to markup inequality within the ranks of Indian and Overseas players. Similarly, when the division of players was by country, 23% of overall inequality in the distribution of markups between the 75 players auctioned was explained by inequality between the groups.</p>
<p>In contrast, when the division was by player type—batsman, bowler, wicketkeeper, all-rounder—5% of overall inequality in the distribution of markups between the 75 players auctioned was explained by inequality between the groups; when the division of players was by the team to which they belonged—Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Jaipur, Mohali, and Mumbai—less than 2% of overall inequality in the distribution of markups between the 75 players auctioned was explained by inequality between the groups (the term B in ), above): as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1527002511406994">Table 2</xref>

<p>From this analysis, we conclude that nearly one quarter of the observed inequality between the players in their markups over their reserve prices was explained by their country; in contrast, very little of such inequality between the players was explained by the franchise team which bought their services.</p>

<title>Value for Money: The Market for Lemons or Plums</title>
<p>The amounts of money that the eight franchises paid for the different players raise the very natural question: what did the franchisees get for their money? Did they buy a “lemon” that cost a lot and performed poorly? Or did they acquire a “plum” that performed well and did not cost very much? These are the questions addressed in this section.</p>
<p>The problem with comparing performances across players is that different types of players contribute in different ways: batsmen score runs, bowlers take wickets, and everyone is supposed to field. So, how does one compare the performance of a bowler who, over the season, scored a few runs, took a number of wickets, held a few catches with that of a batsman who scored many more runs, probably did not take any wickets, and also held a few catches? Furthermore, how does one factor in the performance of the captain who, in addition to batting/bowling/fielding, has to organize the team’s strategy and tactics. Lastly, some players, on some occasions, made match-winning contributions and this, too, should be factored into their performance.</p>
<p>We begin by adopting the analogy of the market. Different suppliers bring different quantities of their products to the market so that, say, 1,000 kilograms of potatoes are competing with 300 kilograms of apples and 100 kilograms of sausages. The relative supply of these products then establishes the exchange rate between them: 1 kilogram of sausages exchanges for 10 kilograms of potatoes and 3 kilograms of apples. Over the course of the 2008 IPL tournament, the 77 players (auctioned and iconic) collectively scored a total of 11,227 runs, took 322 wickets, and took 496 catches and stumpings. Consequently, adopting the above food market analogy, the exchange rate between these activities was that 1 wicket taken was equivalent to 35 runs being scored and to 1.54 catches/stumpings being taken. So, if <italic>R<sub>i</sub>
</italic>, <italic>W<sub>i</sub>
</italic>, and <italic>C<sub>i</sub>
</italic> represent the runs scored, the wickets taken, and the catches affected by player <italic>i</italic> (<italic>i</italic> = 1,…, <italic>N</italic>) in the course of the tournament, we define the performance of the player (measured in “performance units”) as:<disp-formula id="disp-formula4-1527002511406994">

<p>However, in terms of the unit cost of performance—defined as the ratio of sale price to performance level—the 10 players providing the best value for money—the plums—were: Gul, Maharoof, Fernando, Warne, Chawla, Patel (M), Smith (G), Akmal, Pathan (Y), and Sharma (J). At the other end of the scale, the 10 players providing least value for money were: Tiwari, Sharma (I), Singh (H), Taibu, Tendulkar, Oram, Kaif, Kallis, Kartik (M), and Laxman.</p>
<p>In order to assess the cricketing and financial acumen of the different teams in buying players, we begin by considering the case of the Kolkata Franchise. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1527002511406994">Table 4</xref>
shows, this franchise bought six players who committed to play for the entire season of whom one was a wicket keeper (Taibu), two were bowlers (Sharma (I) and Kartik (M)), two were batsmen (Ganguly and Hussey (D)), and one was an all-rounder (Agarkar). The performance of this squad, as measured in performance units, over the 2008 IPL season was 69.5 and when combined with the $3,567,500 that the franchise spent on these six players yielded an average cost of $51,330 per unit of performance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1527002511406994">Table 5</xref>

<p>In retrospect, this was clearly not the best use of its money. Instead of Agarkar ($350,000 for a performance of 10.2) it could have bought Yusuf Pathan ($475,000 for a performance of 27.3); instead of Ishant Sharma ($950,000 for a performance of 9.3) and Murali Kartik ($425,000 for a performance of 7.1), it could have bought Piyush Chawla ($400,000 for a performance of 27.4) and Sreesanth ($625,000 for a performance of 21.3); instead of David Hussey ($625,000 for a performance of 15.8) it could have bought Suresh Raina ($650,000 for a performance of 25.3); instead of Taibu ($125,000 for a performance of 1.5), it could have bought Parthiv Patel ($325,000 for a performance of 14.5). If it had done so, its total expenditure would have remained unchanged but its total performance would have increased from 69.5 to 141.4 and, in consequence, its unit cost would have fallen by more than half from $51,330 to $25,229 per unit of performance.</p>

<title>Postscript and Conclusions</title>
<p>The auction of January 2008 offered players a 3-year contract. So, in January 2011 there was a fresh auction in which 127 players were sold to 10 franchises—Kochi and Pune being the new entrants—with players setting their base price by placing themselves in one of three base price tiers: $400,000, $300,000, and $200,000. Of the 215 players who were put up for sale in 2011, but who could not find a buyer only two—Ganguly and Jaffer—were Indian, the rest being overseas players. The highest prices were paid for Indian players: Gambhir set an IPL record with a price of $2.4 million and the average price of $735, 333 paid for the 45 Indian players sold in the auction contrasted with the average of $362,622 paid for the 82 overseas players.</p>
<p>These two features reflect a growing trend toward making the IPL more “Indian.” In turn, this is based on three factors. First, there is a growing confidence among Indians that their players stand comparison with the best in the world: India is the top-ranked Test playing country and a former World Cup T20 winner and the 2011 auctions followed hard on the heels of Indian victories over Australia and New Zealand at home followed by a successful tour of South Africa. Second, there is the growing realization that some foreign stars either do not take their commitment to their IPL teams very seriously or their commitment to their own countries' playing schedule reduces their availability to the IPL: in the 2001 auction, former stars like Chris Gayle and Brian Lara could not find an IPL home. Third, there is the issue of security: having expensive overseas stars in the side increases the need for greater security and protection. The security consideration has particularly affected Pakistani players: first, there is the problem of securing visas for Pakistani players which becomes particularly acute in a period of Indo-Pakistan tension; second, right-wing Hindu political parties would prefer to see Pakistani players excluded from the IPL.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1527002511406994">9</xref></sup> As a consequence, after an initial presence in the 2008 IPL—when, perhaps, for reasons of chauvinism they attracted low prices—Pakistani players have subsequently failed to attract buyers.</p>
<p>The results of the 2011 IPL auction suggest that irrational exuberance has not gone away; it has merely been turned toward Indian players. A more pressing question for the teams is how to ensure, and sustain, attendance for its matches. In large part this needs a large and loyal fan base based on team performance and the continued presence of iconic players with whom fans can identify. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527002511406994">Bairam, Howells, and Turner (1990)</xref> address the question of the type of player that would maximize the chances of winning first-class matches: for Australia, with its 4-day matches, the best combination is attacking batsmen and defensive bowlers and that was also true for the now defunct (40 overs a side) John Player League games in England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527002511406994">Schofield, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1527002511406994">1988</xref>). The same is likely to be the case in T20 cricket where it is as important for the bowler to bowl “dot balls” as “wicket-taking” balls.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1527002511406994">10</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The retention of iconic players whom fans identify with the team—witness the fans' wrath when Wayne Rooney recently threatened to move from Manchester United to Manchester City—is another important factor influencing attendance. In this, Delhi Daredevils surely missed a trick when, by releasing Gambhir, a local player, it dismantled the most destructive and exciting opening combination of Sehwag and Gambhir. However, all said and done, in one respect, the IPL contrasts strongly with football’s English Premier League: in the latter, it is often said that foreign stars prevent home-grown players from blooming; in the IPL, it is home-grown talent which occupies center stage and keeps foreign stars in the wings waiting for buyers.</p>

<p>Anecdotal evidence would suggest that the IPL employed advisers to establish base prices of players.
