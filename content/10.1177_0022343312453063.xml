<abstract>
<p>The allegedly complex relationship between trust and victimization has rarely been modeled and, when done, the effect of trust on victimization has been found not statistically significant. This study finds otherwise, estimating an instrumental model with community data from Cali, Colombia. Cali’s dismal levels of victimization were only second to Medellin, the most violent city of the world in the 1990s. But Cali also pioneered a strategy of social capital formation as the backbone of a deliberate public policy to crack down on high levels of crime. This article first develops a model of victimization that includes interpersonal trust as determinant and then instruments interpersonal trust with district-level average trust. We argue that an individual-specific level of trust in his or her community members does not affect the community level of interpersonal trust in the margin. However, the levels – or perceived levels – of interpersonal trust in the community may affect the specific level of trust of an individual in other members of that community, along with personal characteristics and experience. Using GMM estimates, this study finds evidence of a relationship between interpersonal trust and victimization, statistically significant and negative in sign. The result is robust across specifications of trust, victimization, and estimating techniques. We conclude that increasing trust in trusting communities contributes to reducing victimization in its own right, although the effect is modest. Consequently, strengthening interpersonal trust is another bullet to combat victimization but it is not a <italic>silver</italic> bullet.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Social capital is being used to explain anything and everything, to the point that some analysts advise against the risk of turning social capital into the ‘new mantra’ of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022343312453063">Arrow, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022343312453063">Durlauf &amp; Fafchamps, 2005</xref>). Allegedly, social capital helps explain child anthropometrical development, household expenditures, farming practices, migration, academic performance, democracy, economic growth, and even military desertion during the US Civil War! See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022343312453063">Costa &amp; Kahn (2003)</xref>. This article focuses on one aspect of social capital that has received less attention: its interaction with victimization. More specifically, theories from criminologists, political scientists, and sociologists have long shown that crime shapes social capital formation: ‘victims trust less than non-victims’. However, the effect of social capital on victimization has been the subject of much less study. Also, studies that allegedly explore such links have typically failed to account for a potential double causality.</p>
<p>The traditional storyline of ‘victim trusts less’ ignores the notion that social capital fosters exchange and improves delivery of public goods by reducing free-rider and opportunistic behavior and substituting for missing or expensive legal structures for <italic>licit</italic> activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022343312453063">Greif, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022343312453063">Glaeser, Laibson &amp; Sacerdote, 2002</xref>) as well as for <italic>criminal</italic> activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022343312453063">Lederman, Loayza &amp; Menendez, 2002</xref>). Empirically, the final outcome of these two competing effects is far from settled and the existing literature does not provide a conclusive answer. As a result, a first contribution of this article is a better understanding of the effects of social capital on victimization. In particular, the article will test whether social capital – using interpersonal trust as proxy – has a substantive effect on victimization (main hypothesis). In order to conduct this test, the analysis relaxes the <italic>a priori</italic> imposition of a univocal interaction between interpersonal trust and victimization and, instead, estimates an instrumental variable model, which is then tested against ordinary least squares to find the preferred specification. This strategy neither develops a structural model of victimization and social capital formation nor estimates a simultaneous equation model rooted in a structural model. Rather, the analysis pursues a reduced form equation that addresses the hypothesized endogeneity of victimization and social capital. A by-product of the article is to test whether the effects of interpersonal trust and victimization are offense-specific, in which case the traditional generalizations from a single offense – typically homicides – may be misleading. A second contribution is the unit of community used in the analysis, which differs from countries, cities, and specific neighborhoods found in previous studies. It is believed that administrative districts within a given city constitute the right scope for the analysis of interpersonal trust and victimization. They are sufficiently limited to capture relevant interpersonal interactions at the local level and sufficiently large to capture relevant community heterogeneity typically assumed away in nationwide or intercity analyses.</p>
<p>We find that interpersonal trust affects victimization levels in Cali, Colombia. This result provides three important implications: theoretically, it dismisses the implicit and potentially mistaken notion that the effect of interpersonal trust on victimization is insignificant. Empirically, it questions both countrywide and intracommunity analyses of interpersonal trust, arguing that the scope of analysis is critical to capture relevant effects of trust. Operationally, interventions that ignore externalities in the form of social capital reducing victimization – and that such effects may be offense-specific – may not be optimizing resources in the fight against crime, a result that complements similar claims in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022343312453063">Dilulio (1996)</xref>.</p>
<p>This article is divided into seven sections. The following section reviews the existing literature on social capital – particularly on interpersonal trust – and victimization. The third section analyzes the experience of Cali. The fourth section describes the data used in this study. Section five discusses an instrumental variable model and the strategy used to capture interpersonal trust and crime interactions. The sixth section reports and discusses the results, and the final section concludes with broad policy guidelines.</p>

<title>Literature review: Theoretical and empirical links between social capital and victimization</title>
<sec id="section3-0022343312453063">
<title>Effects of social capital on victimization</title>
<p>Social capital remains an elusive concept and difficult to measure. For this reason, the vast majority of empirical works on social capital have used indicators or proxies based on people’s participation in social organizations, attitudes of civic cooperation, and interpersonal trust among community members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022343312453063">Lederman, Loayza &amp; Menendez, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022343312453063">Coleman (1990)</xref> defines social capital as those relations of authority, interpersonal trust, and allocation of rights that become norms in a society. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022343312453063">Putnam (1993</xref>: 89–90) emphasizes social capital as the bonds that are created by belonging in groups, either family-related or of a different nature, which instills ‘habits of cooperation, solidarity, and public service’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022343312453063">Fukuyama (1995)</xref> defines social capital as a capability that arises from the prevalence of trust in a society or in certain parts of it, which is usually created and transmitted through cultural mechanisms such as religion, tradition, or historical habit. Such bonds and trust turn individuals into more cooperative agents who address conflicts through nonviolent ways. Specific channels through which such nonviolent outcomes come about refer to strengthening of social networks and reciprocated exchanges, strengthening of mutual trust, and development of a culture of self-regulation within communities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022343312453063">Browning, Dietz &amp; Feinberg, 2000</xref> for a review of such channels). All these channels place a community in a better position to overcome the free-rider problem of collective action against a peaceful solving of conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022343312453063">Lederman, Loayza &amp; Menendez, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the literature identifies two types of social capital, one good and the other perverse. This distinction is critical in the discussion of how interpersonal trust may affect criminogenic behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022343312453063">Glaeser, Sacerdote &amp; Scheinkman (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022343312453063">Rubio (1997)</xref> argue that stronger social interactions including interpersonal trust allow an easier exchange of information and know-how among criminals, which reduces the costs of crime. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022343312453063">Lederman, Loayza &amp; Menendez (2002)</xref> refer to a bonding and trust-generating mechanism among participants that requires the exclusion of others, thus separating those able and willing to embrace the group from other members unwilling to do so. Initiation rituals or assignments in violent groups such as the Mafia, the Ku Klux Klan, or the <italic>Mara Salvatrucha</italic> respond to this logic.</p>
<p>All these notions have not led to a substantial volume of theoretical literature, however, and the few existing works do not refer specifically to interpersonal trust. Previous literature theorizes social capital as a reputation mechanism in the context of repeated prisoner’s dilemma games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022343312453063">Kandori, 1992</xref>); as a determinant of monitoring costs in contexts of moral hazard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022343312453063">Zak &amp; Knack, 2001</xref>); as a social network structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022343312453063">Dasgupta, 2003</xref>); and as another type of asset in models of individual accumulation of capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022343312453063">Glaeser, Laibson &amp; Sacerdote, 2002</xref>). Specific to crime theory, recent developments in the theory of rational criminal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022343312453063">Robison &amp; Siles, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022343312453063">Lederman, Loayza &amp; Menendez, 2002</xref>) have included social capital as a determinant of the costs incurred by conducting individual criminal activities. In their modeling, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022343312453063">Lederman, Loayza &amp; Menendez (2002)</xref> show that individuals will commit crime when the net benefit of crime (loot minus foregone wages from licit activities) exceeds the individual ‘moral’ utility threshold. Social capital is modeled to affect foregone wages (but not the probability of success) and, therefore, the cost of crime. Social capital of an individual depends on the relationship that the individual has with other members of society (that is, whether sympathetic/antipathetic or trusting/untrusting) and on the ‘social distance’ between that individual and the rest of society (higher if the individual does not belong to a given social group). Social capital is then split into society-wide and group-specific capital. The model shows that increases in society-wide (vis-à-vis group-specific) social capital lower the net benefit of crime as the foregone wage exceeds the rise of the loot. If group-specific utility increases, the final outcome will depend on whether or not the criminal is excluded from the group. If that happens, the criminal will see his or her utility decreased from losing sympathy from his or her peers (and, therefore, his or her incentives for crime decrease). Although the original model does not explicitly discuss its role, a strong interpersonal trust prevalent within a community may well increase society-wide social capital and raise the moral threshold after which crime becomes acceptable. Thus, interpersonal trust makes committing a crime more costly, which turns out to be a critical mechanism for confronting crime when socio-economic, political or legal contexts do not contribute to further crime control. Of course, it is also possible not only that interpersonal trust affects social distance and moral tolerance to crime but also that these two affect interpersonal trust. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022343312453063">Wikström (2006)</xref> argues that individual criminal activities are shaped by both the individual’s moral engagement and the moral context in which he or she operates. In other words, the criminal will apply his or her own morality (self-control regarding committing a crime) to the location, which is shaped by opportunities, obstacles, and the familiarity (moral context) of the setting.</p>

<title>Effects of victimization on social capital</title>
<p>Rational behavior models have little to say about the effect of crime on social capital, let alone interpersonal trust. Typically, the rational crime theory argues that the prevalence of homicides depends on the probability of arrest and conviction and the severity of crime (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022343312453063">Becker, 1968</xref>). Within this logic of costs and benefits associated with criminal behavior, factors that affect the relative benefit of crime will be expected to increase its likelihood: factors such as inequality (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022343312453063">Ehrlic, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022343312453063">Soares, 2004</xref>) or the lack of human capital (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022343312453063">Lochner, 2004</xref>). They also fail to incorporate additional motives for violent crime. For example, ‘emotional’ violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022343312453063">Buvinic, Morrison &amp; Shifter, 1999</xref>) is believed to react to neuro(logical)-cognitive problems, personality features, affective links, and belonging to dismantled families and be ignited by stressors such as alcohol or drug abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022343312453063">Llorente &amp; Chaux, 2004</xref>). Either emotional or rational, crime operates within a context, and the interplay of community interactions is increasingly believed to be the critical context (as it was the case in rational behavior models described above). The increasing attention to community has contributed to strengthen the analysis of the mutual links between social capital and crime. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022343312453063">Sampson &amp; Raudenbush (1999)</xref> refer to ‘collective efficacy’ as the degree of control that the community exerts over its members. Whenever collective efficacy is strong and working towards antisocial goals, crime springs and prevails. Explanations on what factors turn interactions antisocial are manifold. A popular argument is the ‘broken-windows’ theory. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022343312453063">Wilson &amp; Kelling (1982)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022343312453063">Skogan (1990)</xref> propose that both physical and social disarray, from abandoned buildings, graffiti, dark streets, and street brawls to the presence of homeless people and prostitutes in the streets, favor the unfolding of violence and crime in such neighborhoods. At some point, community members stop trusting each other, which results in members avoiding each other. Others, similarly, talk of ‘environmental criminology’, indicating that there are hot zones towards which crime converges and concentrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022343312453063">Bottoms, 1996</xref>). The theory of ‘social learning’ also emphasizes the community’s role in the persistence of crime. In as much as crime permeates daily life, individuals are no longer sensible to its consequences and may grow to believe in crime as a legitimate way to solve conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022343312453063">Bandura, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022343312453063">Guerra, Huesmann &amp; Spindler, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>However, it is not clear that violence may only lead to deterioration of social capital: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022343312453063">Bellows &amp; Miguel (2006)</xref> have shown for Sierra Leone that political mobilization and participation in local organizations – particularly religious organizations – have increased in areas that experienced more violence. Interestingly, they do not find a significant effect of exposure to conflict on measures of community cooperation and self-expressed trust in others.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022343312453063">
<title>Empirical evidence</title>
<p>Empirically, numerous studies have linked crime and social capital formation, at both the community and national levels, and through quantitative and qualitative approaches (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022343312453063">Glaeser, Sacerdote &amp; Scheinkman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022343312453063">Moser &amp; Holland, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022343312453063">LaFree, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022343312453063">World Bank, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022343312453063">Fajnzylber, Lederman &amp; Loayza, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022343312453063">Gaviria, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022343312453063">Rosenfeld, Messner &amp; Baumer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022343312453063">Lederman, Loayza &amp; Menendez, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022343312453063">Llorente &amp; Chaux, 2004</xref>, among others). These studies are representative of cross-country analyses as well as case studies. They cover different time spans and several definitions of social capital: some are based on voluntary involvement and/or participation in community organizations, others define social capital as interpersonal trust, and still others include more general definitions of networks, norms, or social interactions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022343312453063">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Interestingly, only a few of the econometric studies have attempted to establish and measure the causality regarding interpersonal trust and victimization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022343312453063">Lederman, Loayza &amp; Menendez (2002)</xref> report that homicide rates decline across more trusting countries, but the authors themselves cast doubts on the reliability of their empirical analysis and on the true specification governing both variables. They argue that their results may reflect compositional effects accruing from different types of social capital that cancel each other out. In another study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022343312453063">Akcomak &amp; ter Weel (2008)</xref> find that social capital (defined through several proxies: interpersonal trust, charity giving, blood giving, and municipal electoral turnout) explains only about 10% of the variance in crime rates across cities in the Netherlands. Evidence from these two studies is clearly inconclusive of the role and magnitude of trust on victimization, a gap that this article addresses by providing more conclusive evidence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022343312453063">
<title>Main hypothesis on the relations between interpersonal trust and victimization</title>
<p>The existing theoretical arguments of good and perverse social capital and the role of interpersonal trust on the one hand, and inconclusive empirical evidence, on the other, are combined in a hypothesis that is tested using data from Cali. In particular, tests are run on the following hypothesis: the effect of interpersonal trust on victimization at the community level in Cali is statistically significant and negative as community-wide interpersonal trust constitutes a tool for the community to countervail intragroup perverse trust and networking (that reduces transaction costs for criminals), a historical culture of violence generalized in the country, and the lack of citizen security public interventions until recently.</p>

<title>Victimization and social capital formation in Cali, Colombia</title>
<p>Based on a universal comparison of crime incidence, Colombia ranks high on the list. At its peak in 1994, Cali – the focus of the empirical exercise in this article – reported a homicide rate of 124 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants that was above the rate in Bogotá, but below the rate in Medellín, which was considered the most violent city in the world at that time. More recently, with a homicide rate of 81 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010 (Municipio de <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022343312453063">Cali, 2011</xref>), crime remains a fundamental problem for the city.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022343312453063">Gaviria (2010)</xref> associates the current high levels of victimization with a failed demobilization of <italic>paramilitares</italic> and the fragmentation of organized crime. Earlier, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022343312453063">Pecaut (1997)</xref> rejected the notion of a simplistic criminogenic explanation in Colombia. Instead, Pecaut believes that a more complex mosaic of historical influences from politically motivated violence, ‘the economy of drugs’, and social conflicts has intermittently, but intensely, affected the history of the country. This has led to a generalized and prevailing familiarity with violence and crime among the people of Colombia. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022343312453063">Rubio (1997)</xref> substantiates a significant role of drug cartels in the creation of a ‘perverse’ social capital in Colombia. Guerrilla groups provided extensive military training to youngsters in Medellín, which contributed to the emergence of criminal gangs in that city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022343312453063">Salazar, 1994</xref>). Drug traffickers became role models for a broad sector of the population, and many people began to imitate their actions and attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022343312453063">Salazar &amp; Jaramillo, 1992</xref>). As crime became part of life, youngsters were predisposed to criminal behavior, thus solidifying a culture of violence. Distrust and coercion govern the relations among individuals at all strata of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022343312453063">Waldman, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, social capital formation has also played a role in Colombia. Cali constitutes a pioneering experience in the innovative and deliberate use of social capital formation for crime prevention purposes. Prior to Bogotá and Medellín, Cali designed a strategy of citizen security based on social capital formation within communities. During the Guerrero Administration (1992–94) peaceful coexistence was put at the center of the security agenda. DESEPAZ (which stands for development, citizen security, and peace), a comprehensive action plan to reduce and prevent crime and violence, was articulated around four major strategic areas of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022343312453063">Guerrero &amp; Concha-Eastman, 2001</xref>): diagnostics of crime trends and composition; law enforcement and justice; social development; and social cohesion and citizen empowerment. The extent to which these programs have been successful in reducing crime remains an open question.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>The information used to conduct the econometric analysis herein is drawn from a survey conducted in 2005 by the Cisalva Institute at the Universidad del Valle in Cali (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022343312453063">Cisalva, 2005</xref>). The survey was stratified in four judicial districts. In a first stage, 50 random conglomerates of nine contiguous residential blocks each were randomly selected. In a second stage, six households and their respondents (males and females age 15 and older) were also randomly selected. As a result, the survey collected data on 1,202 households of Cali’s 131 neighborhoods or districts distributed in the 21 <italic>comunas</italic>. A <italic>comuna</italic> is the smallest administrative division with an organized government body in the form of local government supporting councils (<italic>juntas de apoyo local</italic>). The average size of a <italic>comuna</italic> in Cali exceeds 100,000 people, a size that is assumed to be too large for an individual or a household to conceptualize as his or her proximate community.</p>
<p>The survey is designed to evaluate security and coexistence programs that the municipality has implemented and collects information on several categories of victimization, from low-key neighbor disputes or unpaid alimonies to kidnappings and homicides. It also gathers data on beatings, injuries, sexual abuse, threats, property damage, and intrafamily and domestic violence. The survey enquires about the respondents’ levels of interpersonal trust, their perceptions of the helpfulness of their neighbors and other community members, and their levels of participation in community activities. Respondents report on their perceptions of citizen security, peaceful coexistence, and the presence and performance of public services. These services include teachers, doctors, police, local authorities, social services, and the judiciary. The survey records reactions and attitudes to non-civic acts and domestic and non-domestic violent episodes. For example, individuals are asked to report what they would do if they knew of cases of child abuse; whether they agree that in the midst of an argument it is legitimate to insult and/or beat the person responsible for the argument; or whether they seek guidance and advice among members of the community when they have a problem. In addition, the survey enquires about the presence and operations of public institutions as well as public programs – such as mimes – which encourage respect of transit norms, houses of justice, information dissemination activities, and workshops.</p>
<p>The survey captures perceptions on changes over time regarding citizen security although the reference period typically spans only from six months to a year. The questionnaire asks the individual whether he or she thinks that the security in his or her community has increased, decreased or remained the same during the last six months. Individuals are also asked whether their trust in neighbors during the last two years has increased, decreased or remained unchanged. Socio-economic, demographic, and geographic data permit cross-tabulation of interpersonal trust, victimization, public interventions, and perceptions with household features. Unfortunately, the survey does not capture the demographic composition of the household, nor other variables that would help gain knowledge on resource allocation and behavioral patterns within the household.</p>
<p>In addition to the variables reported in the survey, a number of controls for the econometric analysis are constructed. Specifically, interpersonal trust consists of a variable that ranks individuals’ reported trust in <italic>most </italic>of the people in their <italic>comuna</italic>; whether there are people in the <italic>comuna</italic> that would not take advantage of others; and whether most people in the <italic>comuna</italic> would help others in need. Adding the responses on each question and normalizing from 1 to 4 (where 4 means positive responses on the above questions), we construct a score on the degree of interpersonal trust among individuals of the <italic>comuna</italic> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022343312453063">Table I</xref>). This definition is more complete than the one captured in LAPOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022343312453063">Latin American Public Opinion Project, 2010</xref>), which simply asks whether individuals are very, somewhat or little/not trustworthy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022343312453063">Corporacion Latinobarometro (2010)</xref>, the other large opinion poll in the Latin American region, follows the World Value Survey question: Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with people? This strategy is deliberately parsimonious vis-à-vis the arbitrary re-weighting of offenses or statistically driven techniques (such as a principal component analysis).</p>

<title>Model specification</title>
<p>This section develops a single equation model of victimization that is determined, inter alia, by interpersonal trust. To cope with the presumed endogeneity between victimization and trust, this study instrumentalizes interpersonal trust. This strategy provides a reduced form equation that controls for endogeneity instead of developing a more ambitious structural model followed by a simultaneous equation estimation. As it is difficult to structurally capture channels such as culture of crime or isolate the various effects of multiple interventions, the analysis focuses on quantifying the magnitude of the aggregate effect of social capital on victimization on a reduced form equation. This does not make the challenge easy, however. Critically, the quality of the estimated model will depend on the validity of the instrument(s) used; that is, on finding a variable(s) strongly associated with interpersonal trust but without an effect on the probability of an individual being victimized directly within his or her community (or put differently, variables that affect victimization exclusively through their effect upon interpersonal trust). The main assumptions to identify such instruments are discussed below. Next, the model consists of the following equation:<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0022343312453063">

<p>In the above equation, the level of victimization of individual <italic>i</italic> is modeled to be determined by interpersonal trust (<italic>T</italic>); individual age (<italic>A</italic>), in nonlinear terms; gender (<italic>G</italic>); socio-economic status (captured by Sisben categories) (<italic>Y</italic>);<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022343312453063">2</xref>
</sup> and educational level (<italic>E</italic>). The selection of these variables is straightforward: interpersonal trust is the key variable whose potential effects on victimization we aim to test; age has been shown to clearly affect victimization as young people are more likely to be victims and perpetrators of crime; males are shown to perpetrate the vast majority of crimes while females are victims of some specific sex-related crimes. Education, as a proxy of human capital, may affect the probably of success of crime (thus increasing expected returns) but also reduce the probability of becoming a victim by increasing awareness and prevention against risky behaviors.</p>
<p>
<italic>Comuna</italic> dummies will capture the geographic location of the household. These variables are expected to capture specific features of each <italic>comuna</italic> that might be related to crime, such as geographical isolation, presence of public institutions (house of justice, judicial district), hot spots or ‘broken windows’ areas, that is, all the aggregated features that may affect the likelihood and/or intensity of victimization within a large administrative jurisdiction.</p>

<p>As for victimization, a binary variable is used to capture the occurrence, or lack thereof, of any victimization episode. Also, the study includes a variable that reveals the number of reported victimization cases among individuals within the last year. The variable adds up the number of instances in which the respondent was the victim of one, some, or all the following events: larceny, threats, beatings, injuries, sexual abuse, property damage, kidnapping, homicide, and intrafamily violence. The robustness of the binary index of victimization and the 1–4 score of trust is further validated with the <italic>number</italic> of victimization episodes and the use of specific victimization categories separately considered (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022343312453063">Table II</xref>). Socio-economic variables include the Sisben strata, an official means-test instrument used in Colombia to target social programs, where 1 is the poorest socio-economic stratum and 6 the richest. The survey reports incomes in eight brackets. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022343312453063">Table I</xref> provides the working definition of the key variables used in the empirical analysis and their basic descriptives, and reports individual averages for each of the variables. This article also considers ‘community variables’ with the district as a practical compromise to define community.</p>
<p>The selection of instruments and their exclusion assumptions requires careful consideration. Different variables have been used in the literature to instrumentalize for social capital or its proxies: among them, interpersonal trust, such as the length of residency in the community or village; past associationism; presence of a traditional authority in the community; number of associations created by the community; percentage of the adult population that reads daily newspapers; percentage of foreign-born residents; and, for country-wide studies, regional geographical dummies, telephone lines per capita, and radios per capita in the country. Some of these instruments are, however, implausible or inappropriate for the scope of this study (e.g. regional dummies) while others are not available in the dataset (e.g. access to radio, newspapers or media in general, and information on past associationism). Others might not be valid in the specific context of Cali. Residence might be associated with social capital levels, but it may reflect a decision driven by victimization levels, strong presence of organized crime, and/or demobilization of the guerrilla. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022343312453063">Engel &amp; Ibañez (2007)</xref> show that fears of kidnapping affect migration decisions in Bogotá. Furthermore, one’s level of participation in community organizations may also be the result of interpersonal trust levels. Historical instruments for social capital (used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022343312453063">Akcomak &amp; ter Weel, 2008</xref>) are not readily available for this analysis of Cali and may not be as relevant in this context given the (religious) heterogeneity of Colombia, including Cali.</p>
<p>The study considers one instrument, the <italic>district-wide average level of interpersonal trust</italic>, and tests the robustness of the results and the quality of the instrument by considering a second instrument candidate, place of birth.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022343312453063">3</xref>
</sup> Districts with a strong trusting climate may positively affect each individual’s level of trust in others, without one individual’s trust level affecting the overall community average (given an average size of 17,000 individuals per district for the 131 districts in which Cali is divided). In other words, we argue that an individual-specific level <table-wrap id="table2-0022343312453063" position="float">

</table-wrap>of trust in his or her community members does not affect the community level of interpersonal trust in the margin. However, the levels – or perceived levels – of interpersonal trust in the community may affect the specific level of trust of an individual in other members of that community, along with personal characteristics and experience. Historical, political, and/or economic traditions, factors, and shocks may well affect a community’s level of trust, which ultimately also affects an individual’s trust formation (alongside personal features and experiences).</p>
<p>District average level of trust is unlikely to affect victimization through other channels. It is unlikely that average trust within a district affects victimization through budgetary allocations (whose decisions are taken at a higher administrative level), district specific economic development or political outcomes (which may well be determined or critically influenced by nation or departmental decisions or events). In addition, whether or not being a victim of a given offense affects that individual level of interpersonal trust, it is unlikely that it will affect the contemporaneous district-wide level of trust. As a precaution, the district-wide trust variable constructed for each individual excludes its own reported level of trust. This is a practical precaution when the number of sample observations from the survey used to construct district averages is small (even though districts in Cali are also widely populated). Conceptually, it assumes away possible neighbor-to-neighbor ‘contagious’ effects arguing that a given individual’s <italic>perceptions</italic> are unlikely to affect district-wide perceptions, even though a high profile <italic>crime</italic> may indeed affect community-wide perceptions.</p>
<p>This study compares two standard instrumental specifications (i.e. two stage least squares, 2SLS)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022343312453063">4</xref>
</sup> and a generalized method of moments (GMM). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022343312453063">Hansen (1982)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022343312453063">Hayashi (2000)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022343312453063">Baum, Schaffer &amp; Stillman (2003)</xref> show how in the presence of heteroskedasticity or intragroup correlation, conventional IV estimators may remain consistent, but their error terms may not. In such cases, GMM provides efficient estimates. This study uses a heteroskedasticity test and Hausman specification tests to contrast the preferred specification.</p>
<p>There is, in addition, a potential problem of omitted variables to consider. Factors such as unemployment, inequality, economic growth, severity of punishment, and probability of being caught may all affect criminal behavior to the extent that they affect the relative benefits and costs of committing crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022343312453063">Becker, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022343312453063">Krueger &amp; Maleckova, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022343312453063">Lochner, 2004</xref>). To the extent that each of these variables is correlated with social capital and/or victimization,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022343312453063">5</xref>
</sup> their omission will cause a bias. It is, however, hard <italic>a priori</italic> to determine the significance of these biases. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022343312453063">Neumayer (2003)</xref> in an analysis of democracy and crime using a panel of countries over time found – to his acknowledged surprise – no effect of inequality on crime, and a lack of systematic effect of labor participation or economic growth on differences across national crime rates. Second, it may be the case that biases cancel each other, either because the bias is made up of multiple effects (for example, economic growth might simultaneously increase victimization and decrease social capital; or because inequality may increase intragroup trust while reducing intergroup trust). In any case, our reported specification includes district-clustered error terms, which expectedly control for unobserved variations within each district. In addition, <italic>comuna</italic> dummies control for inter-<italic>comuna</italic> variation.<sup>

<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022343312453063">Table II</xref> reports the OLS and IV estimates, including first stage estimates. Tests in the OLS specification (1) detect the presence of heteroskedasticity (White test: R<sup>2</sup>statistic of 46.62, <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.0078). Also, a Hausman specification test points to the GMM form (3) as the preferred specification vis-à-vis the OLS (1) specification (Chi-sq statistic of 0.66, <italic>p</italic>-value = 1). First stage estimates of the GMM regression show that the instruments are valid, with a first stage F statistic well exceeding the rule of thumb of 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022343312453063">Staiger &amp; Stock, 1997</xref>) – also confirmed by 2SLS estimates (see specification 2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022343312453063">Table II</xref>). The Hansen J statistic of 0.018 shows that the null hypothesis of over-identification cannot be rejected, implying that the orthogonality condition between the set of instruments used for this study and the trust equation error term are satisfied. However, the acceptance of the null hypothesis may well be the result of the presence of a weak instrument – birthplace was suspected initially to be weak – along with a ‘good’ one, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022343312453063">Baum, Schaffer &amp; Stillman (2003)</xref> show to typically bias the test towards acceptance. In effect, a closer look reveals that the first stage estimation in specification (3) in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022343312453063">Table II</xref>, birthplace, does not produce a result significantly different from 0, while the district-wide trust average is, in contrast, a highly significant factor explaining interpersonal trust. Reassuringly, the estimated coefficient for district-wide interpersonal trust is fairly robust across specifications. When district-wide trust is used as the only instrument, its statistical significance remains strong (specification 4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022343312453063">Table II</xref>) while, as expected from a valid instrument, it is found to be not statistically significant when regressed on victimization in an OLS specification (not reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022343312453063">Table II</xref>), thus confirming that its relationship with victimization is only indirect through interpersonal trust.</p>

<sec id="section12-0022343312453063">
<title>Results</title>
<p>GMM estimates in specification (4) show that trust is, in effect, a significant determinant of victimization (as proposed in the main hypothesis) with an increase in interpersonal trust leading to a reduction in the probability that an individual will be subject to victimization. Interestingly, the weakness of birthplace as an instrument provides some clue about how interpersonal trust might affect victimization. It may well imply that a notion of identity may not drive a strong connection from interpersonal trust to reduced victimization, at least not the sort of identity that may arise from the simple fact of birthplace. Instead, a stronger climate of trust within a community may affect an individual’s perceptions, values, and acts leading to participation in networks and activities that may reduce criminal behavior (for example, denouncing, and increasing demands to local politicians for transparency and results) and decrease the moral tolerance of such behaviors. As interpersonal trust increases within the community, the cost of victimization increases.</p>
<p>Regarding other controls, being a woman reduces the probability of victimization, a result that is statistically significant. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022343312453063">Table II</xref> specification (4) reports that education levels increase the probability of victimization, although the effect is not significant at the 5% level. This variable is expected to capture some notion of socio-economic status, in addition to individual preferences and the efficiency of individuals to adapt relevant information to prevent victimization, for instance. The aggregated effect of these dimensions on victimization levels is hard to predict. Victimization increases on a non-linear basis with age, with a tipping point around age 42. However, the coefficient is not significant, probably indicating a differentiated vector of age impact by type of offense. Four <italic>comunas</italic> are found in (4) to have specific impacts on victimization rates after controlling for individual socio-economic and interpersonal trust variables. None of these four <italic>comunas</italic> had safety programs or houses of justice, but six <italic>comunas</italic> in the same situation are not found to have a statistically significant effect in terms of victimization rates (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022343312453063">Tables I</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022343312453063">II</xref>).</p>
<p>The main findings are corroborated when analyzing victimization by the number of reported episodes rather than as a binary variable capturing whether or not an individual was subject to any form of victimization. Results are consistent either using GMM or a Poisson count model (results available upon request).</p>
<p>OLS estimates (specification (1) in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022343312453063">Table II</xref>) are less able than the instrumental specifications to capture significant effects on crime. Even when determinants have typically the same sign, they tend to be statistically insignificant. More importantly, interpersonal trust is found to be statistically significant and negatively related to victimization but its estimated effect is smaller than with instrumental specifications, which proved to produce a very robust estimate of the effect of interpersonal trust across IV specifications. In other words, endogeneity may, in effect, be playing a substantive role biasing downwards OLS estimates.<sup>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Few studies have estimated the impacts of social capital on victimization and their results are inconclusive. Their design has typically ruled out ex ante the possibility of two-way causality. This study implements an estimating strategy to confront such a bias, which uses a mix of personal and district-wide variables as instruments and controls for intradistrict (i.e. intracommunity) correlations through a GMM instrumental estimation. This study finds evidence of a relationship between interpersonal trust and victimization, statistically significant and negative in sign. As such, interventions directed to increase inclusive interpersonal trust in detriment of exclusionary group-specific trust may provide ‘double dividends’ in the form of cost-effective crime prevention policy (vis-à-vis more costly punitive measures) and contributions to improved governance.</p>
<p>However, this conclusion must be taken with great caution. The low explanatory power of the model suggests that even when interpersonal trust significantly affects victimization (in statistical terms), its impact is neither uniform nor necessarily substantive. Overall, results show that the generalized perception of ‘victims trust less than non-victims’ does not take into account the reverse effect of trust on victimization. Trusting people in trusting communities may also contribute to reduce victimization in its own right, although selectively and modestly. In other words, even if trust is a bullet, it is not a silver bullet.</p>

<p>Crime is also defined in several ways: as violent crime, homicide, violence, membership in gangs, and violent conflict. Empirical techniques also vary. Some studies conduct econometric analyses to test for and quantify statistically significant relations between social capital and crime, while other studies use a more ‘statistical’ approach by exploring correlations – rather than causality – between social capital and crime across geographical areas and/or time periods. Qualitative approaches are used as well, typically in violent conflict situations such as those occurring in Rwanda or Guatemala.</p>

<p>Locally born individuals may develop a sense of belonging and identity that affects interpersonal trust and facilitates social capital accumulation. However, hate crimes based on race, religion or immigration may clearly correlate with birthplace. Unfortunately, there is no information in the survey to identify hate crimes. If any of these considerations are relevant in the case of Cali, birthplace could become a weak instrument, with implications on the precision of over-identification tests.</p>

<p>A matrix of correlations shows that the correlation of variables such as district-wide unemployment, district-wide income dispersion or individual perception of police presence with victimization and interpersonal trust is low. Correlations of these three variables with interpersonal trust vary from 0.06 to 0.15 and with victimization from not statistically different from 0 to 0.06. Results are available upon request.</p>

<p>When analyzing the effects of interpersonal trust on each type of offense, results typically show differences in the significance of the impact and not in its sign. Among the most serious offenses, such as homicides and kidnappings, interpersonal trust does not seem to have a significant effect. This is consistent with the argument that these offenses are motivated by factors not very sensitive to moral tolerance and community dynamics (that is, factors having little to do with interpersonal relationships such as organized crime competition, for example). Instead, higher interpersonal trust reduces property offenses and larcenies, an effect that is statistically significant, where personal relationships may determine risky behaviors or, on the contrary, the undertaking of security and preventing measures. The impact of trust is significantly negative for intrafamily violence but insignificant (negative) for sex offenses. Again, while relationships of trust may affect the use of violent and aggressive behavior within the household, they may have more to do with psychological disorders manifesting in abusive behavior within and/or outside the household. Results are available upon request.</p>
