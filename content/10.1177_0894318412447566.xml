            <p>When someone faces loss of a loved one, that person simultaneously grieves and dies a little, just as the one dying also grieves. The author’s personal conceptualization of dying and grieving as a unitary rhythm is explored based primarily on her interpretation of Rogers’ science of unitary human beings, along with selected examples from related nursing literature and from the emerging focus on continuing bonds in other disciplines. Examples from contemporary songwriters that depict such a unitary conceptualization are given along with personal examples. The author concludes with her description of the unitary rhythm of dying-grieving.</p>

   <body>
      <p>Loss, impending or actual, initiates grieving. Although loss can be of anything meaningful in one’s life, the focus here is loss of a loved one, where simultaneously the person facing the loss grieves and dies a little, and the person dying grieves as well. Dying and grieving constitute a unitary rhythm. What is foreground in the rhythm for one is background for the other, but they are integral and are experienced as a unitary, shifting, kaleidoscopic pattern.</p>
      <p>Dying is a transformative process, simultaneously a shedding of the old and a birthing into the new, whatever that might be. The butterfly is probably a universal symbol for transformation. One of my favorite note cards carries the caption, “If nothing ever changed, there would be no butterflies.” Metamorphosis, such as caterpillar into butterfly, “is a transformation as by magic” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894318412447566">Soukanhov, 1992</xref>, p. 1134). Magic or not, it is certainly part of the mystery that is life. One visible form, caterpillar, flowing into another, butterfly, as the underlying patterning flows and creatively changes, suggesting that nothing is ever really lost, only the familiar, visible manifestation of what we hold dear. While not trivializing loss or making it less difficult to bear, hopefully such belief can help ease the transition for both the dying and those who remain.</p>
      <p>This conceptualization of the unitary rhythm of dying-grieving is explored in light of the author’s interpretation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894318412447566">Martha E. Rogers’ (1970</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894318412447566">1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894318412447566">1992)</xref> science of unitary human beings and other theoretical perspectives, illustrated with two examples from contemporary songwriters along with her personal experiences. Finally a description of this rhythm is offered.</p>

         <title>Rogerian Conceptualization</title>
         <p>Rogers did not write in detail about her views of dying, but she did offer brief insights into the process. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894318412447566">Rogers (1970)</xref> saw dying as a creative process, describing it in a way reflecting hope for unending change: “Death is postulated to represent a transformation of energy” (p. 91). This author reviewed her class notes taken as a student in Rogers’ nursing science course, where Rogers stated that <italic>death</italic>, a static term, is not appropriate to a dynamic universe, so <italic>dying</italic> is the preferred term. She also identified the living-dying process as one of nature’s rhythmicities. Rogers described dying as a transforming of energy, a moving beyond the visible spectrum in higher frequency, increasingly diverse patterning (M. E. Rogers, personal communication, December 9, 1976). Thus rather than being destroyed, the patterning persists.</p>
         <p>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894318412447566">Rogers (1986)</xref> identified the living-dying process as one characterized by rhythmical patterning, speculating that her science offers a new approach to studying the dying process. “The nature and continuity of field patterning subsequent to dying, while admittedly a difficult area to study, nonetheless is open to theoretical investigation” (p. 8). In a 1984 interview conducted by Barbara Sarter, published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894318412447566">Sarter (1988)</xref>, Rogers commented on her preference for the word <italic>dying</italic> over <italic>death</italic>, noting, “What I say is that field patterning is continuous, and is not determined by something called death or nondeath, or by living or nonliving” (p. 133). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894318412447566">Phillips (1992)</xref> noted, “A philosophy of living-dying encompasses one’s awareness of the wholeness of the life process, where living-dying is a rhythm of the life process that becomes more diverse and innovative in its unfolding” (p. 4). Energy patterning continues; it does not cease or fade away.</p>
         <p>Energy fields have no beginning and no ending. We are birthed into this life, dying to whatever came before, then dying to this life and birthing into whatever comes next. Energy patterning is continuously flowing. With flow comes change, with change comes transformation. The principles of homeodynamics describe this change process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894318412447566">Rogers’ (1992)</xref> principle of helicy is the “continuous, innovative, unpredictable, increasing diversity of human and environmental field patterns” (p. 31). The principle of resonancy specifies the “continuous change from lower to higher frequency wave patterns in human and environmental fields” (p. 31). The principle of integrality describes the “continuous mutual human field and environmental field process” (p. 31). Taken together the principles describe the nature and process of change within the human-environmental field, and, as noted earlier, Rogers speculated that the patterning persists beyond dying. Inherent in the principle of integrality, the mutuality of human-environment field process, is the idea that dying is not an isolated act involving a solitary person.</p>
         <p>Patterning beyond the physical body can be described as characterized by rhythms and motion so rapid that they seem continuous, visionary, timeless, beyond waking, and increasingly diverse, to highlight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894318412447566">Rogers’ (1992)</xref> suggested manifestations of patterning. Earlier manifestations, or <italic>correlates</italic> of patterning as they were then known, that Rogers suggested but later removed from her list also seem appropriate here, specifically ethereal and weightless. In a 1978 course handout entitled, “Postulated Correlates of Unitary Human Development,” she offered “more visibility—less visibility—ethereal” as a <italic>correlate</italic> of change. At some point she changed this to “materiality—ethereality” then dropped this one when people interpreted her meaning dualistically as mass vs. spirit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894318412447566">Sarter, 1988</xref>). In the 1984 interview with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894318412447566">Sarter (1988)</xref> cited earlier, Rogers indicated that she was struggling with how to change the wording so she could keep the idea of “experienced as ethereal” (p. 131), but by 1986 she had dropped it entirely. Another old “correlate” that seems to fit here is “heaviness—lightness—weightless,” also dropped for similar reasons. It is worth re-exploring these ideas as potential manifestations of change, especially from the perspective of a dying-grieving rhythm. Patterning beyond the physical suggests ethereal, weightless, visionary, timeless, beyond waking, and increasingly diverse manifestations of change, along with rhythm and motion so rapid they seem continuous. Grieving also runs the gamut of experiences of lower and higher energy manifestations.</p>
         <p>As a personal illustration, following my husband’s passing, my close friends usually knew how I was feeling by the language I used. If I spoke of him as dead, I was at low energy, feeling heavy and dense, dealing pragmatically with daily events, having trouble sleeping and meditating, and experiencing time as dragging. If I spoke of him as passing on, I was more energized, feeling connected through dreams and meditations, entering and experiencing a more timeless, visionary realm of existence. Rather than a linear process, moving from lower frequency toward higher frequency manifestations, I experienced this as a flowing rhythmicity, now up now down, now lower now higher frequency, never the same but always transforming, sometimes slowly, sometimes rapidly, and always different. The metaphor of the slinky, used extensively by Rogers over the years including on the inside cover of her 1970 book, comes to mind, visually representing this rhythmic swinging and oscillating motion of experience, sometimes constricted and sorrowing, sometimes expansive and experiencing healing dreams, sometimes feeling solitary and isolated, sometimes feeling integral with everyone and all that is. For example, with the manifestation of “longer sleeping—longer waking—beyond waking,” sometimes there was longer waking, little sleeping, and difficulty meditating. Beyond waking was symbolized by healing dreams, such as the house with the unknown rooms where my husband was waiting just beyond the door, eager to show me around, to explore together a new manifestation of what home could mean. Sometimes meditation helped to clarify experiences. For example, the following is a meditation from my journal dated May 18, 1998:</p>
         <p>Temple on hill where people bring their dead to lie. They gather outside, sitting quietly, reminiscing. Beautiful angel, female in aspect, greets each spirit as he/she rises above the temple, enfolding each in her arms, bearing them up a shaft of light, reuniting with loved ones who passed on before then returning for the next one. Physical bodies burned on a pyre, one by one, with prayers to water, fire, and air . . . .Walked among the people, asking what death meant to them . . .a transmutation of life force—a change in the energy pattern—a new beginning, like caterpillar to butterfly, only this butterfly will never die—soaring free now that their earthly roots have been released.</p>
         <p>Waking reality was not the only reality or even the preferred reality. In Rogerian terms, pandimensional experiencing transcends space and time.</p>
         <p>Following Rogers’ retirement from New York University, Dr. John Phillips taught the course on Rogerian nursing science. In his class on death and dying, he contrasted the traditional view of death, a unidirectional timeline moving from conception through death, to a Rogerian view of living, in which the line is bidirectional with arrows at both ends, meaning the beginning and ending are unknown, calling into question when life begins and if it ends (J. Phillips, personal communication, August 7, 2008). Furthermore, Phillips realized that a rhythm of living-dying better fits a three-dimensional universe. “There is no dying/death in a pandimensional universe,” “just living,” as by definition time and space are not characteristics of a pandimensional, relative present (J. Phillips, personal communication, August 3, 2010). Energy patterning is continuously flowing and changing.</p>
         <p>This theme is beautifully illustrated in the song “Breathe” by singer/songwriter Maura Kennedy, found on the CD “Better Dreams” recorded with her husband, Pete Kennedy. In the liner notes she describes how the song came to her following a dream of lying peacefully in her mother’s womb when she was suddenly expelled, feeling this birthing like a kind of death, and wondering if birth perhaps is a kind of death and death a kind of birth.</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>Didn’t we all die? Didn’t we all die at the start?</p>
            <p>Aren’t we alright? Aren’t we alright, for the most part?</p>
            <p>Is there an ending, really an end to all of this?</p>
            <p>Or just a beginning, another beginning, so why resist?</p>
            <p>Take a breath, let it out, let it in, just begin again and</p>
            <p>Breathe into a new life, breathe out the old times.</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>This idea of continuity is captured in qualitative research with bereaved widows conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894318412447566">Todaro-Franceschi (2006)</xref> where she identified synchronicity, meaningful coincidence, as a healing modality in which experiences with dead loved ones are seen as potentially healing for those who are grieving their loss. Characteristics of synchronicity included a “meaningful relationship between the deceased and the living” (p. 156), freed from time and space. She identified six significant paradoxical rhythms in such experiences, including connected-disconnected, hope-hopeless, and scared-reassured.</p>

         <title>Other Unitary Conceptualizations of Dying and Grieving</title>
         <p>Joan Halifax, Buddhist teacher and pioneer in the care of the dying, has written of the living-dying rhythm in a way that parallels Rogers’ view. In the introduction to her book, <italic>Being with Dying: Cultivating Compassion and Fearlessness in the Presence of Death</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447566">Halifax, 2008</xref>), she wrote that in many spiritual traditions, “the great divide between life and death collapses into an integrated energy that cannot be fragmented” (p. xv). “I have not made much distinction in this book between living and dying . . .in reality there is no separation between them, only interpenetration and unity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447566">Halifax, 2008</xref>, p. xviii). She described dying as a shared communal drama, with those involved with the dying not only grieving but dying a little, just as the dying person is also grieving. Although the grief can be overwhelming, it can also open one to the possibility of connecting with the universal community, enhancing the experience of compassion, wherein a <italic>personal</italic> loss can be transformed into compassion and loving kindness for all who have ever grieved a loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447566">Halifax, 2008</xref>). The meditation suggested by Halifax for <italic>encountering grief</italic> ends with the following: “May I be open with myself and others about my experience of suffering and loss. May I find peace and strength that I may use my resources to help others. May all those who grieve be released from their sorrow” (p. 195).</p>
         <p>In a qualitative study of grief, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894318412447566">Moules, Simonson, Prins, Angus, and Bell (2004)</xref> uncovered a variety of metaphors in the narratives of their participants, from visitors, doors, houses, journeying, to waves (water). For example, as one participant put it:
<disp-quote>
               <p>When you lose somebody, it’s almost like you’re building a house and when somebody dies, all the top get taken off but the foundation is still there . . .but we have to build it up again and in that foundation are my dad and my brother still there. And they’re so much engrained in who we are but all of the physical manifestations of them are gone. (p. 102)</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Following the death of her son, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894318412447566">Jonas-Simpson (2006)</xref> described how she continues to connect with him “through meditation or through spontaneous explicit-tacit signs in nature, a space and place where our connecting amid our separateness is most strong” (p. 92). She movingly describes how her other sons experience this connectedness, as well.</p>
         <p>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894318412447566">Ring and Valarino (1998)</xref> identified a transcendental awareness characteristic of near death experiences that they called mindsight, in which awareness is expanded beyond the confines of space and time. In a far-ranging discussion of varieties of vision, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447566">Dossey (2009)</xref> noted that James Carpenter of the Rhine Research Center called such awareness <italic>first sight</italic>, not limited to those facing death but operative in everyone, although often beyond conscious awareness. Although coming from a different viewpoint, this does resonate with pandimensional experiencing and awareness, described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894318412447566">Rogers (1992)</xref> as not bound by space and time.</p>

Using Parse’s phenomenological-hermeneutic research method, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447566">Cody (1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318412447566">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447566">2000)</xref> conducted three studies and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894318412447566">Pilkington (1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894318412447566">2005)</xref> two, from which the meaning of grieving could be synthesized as “a process of confirming-not confirming cherished beliefs about that which was lost, that which endures, and who one is becoming” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894318412447566">Pilkington, 2006</xref>, p. 301). Important from the unitary perspective is the focus on moving beyond with the loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447566">Cody, 2000</xref>), not separating from the person who was lost, as loss and separation do not fit a perspective that suggests loss is an illusion; the patterning persists.</p>
         <p>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447566">Florczak (2008)</xref> also presented grieving a loss from the perspective of humanbecoming theory, noting that grieving is simultaneously everpresent and everchanging. She noted the evolution of two worldviews characterizing perspectives on grieving a loss in the literature. The older view describes “a linear, normative process that culminates with a cathartic breaking of bonds” (p. 8) whereas the newer view describes “a unique, intersubjective process in which the individual maintains connections with the absent and the meaning of the experience continually changes” (p. 8). She conceptualized the process as “<italic>persistent sorrow arising with weaving familiar-unfamiliar patterns anew</italic>”(p. 8).</p>

         <title>Continuing Bonds</title>
         <p>The current focus on grief and bereavement from the perspective of disciplines other than nursing details the shift in paradigms noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447566">Florczak (2008)</xref>. This shift signals a move from the essentially Freudian view that detaching from the deceased and investing in new relationships was the hallmark of successfully negotiating the bereavement process to one characterized by the recognition of continuing bonds, whereby the relationship is maintained, albeit qualitatively different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894318412447566">Klass, Silverman, &amp; Nickman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894318412447566">Neimeyer, 2001</xref>).</p>
         <p>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894318412447566">Neimeyer (2001)</xref> identified this new paradigm emerging in theories of grief and grieving as one that highlights meaning reconstruction as the central process in grieving. It is human nature to continuously compose, edit, and rewrite the story of one’s life to find meaning amid change. “Significant loss—whether of cherished persons, places, projects, or possessions—presents a challenge to one’s sense of narrative coherence as well as to the sense of identity . . . . Ultimately they search for ways of assimilating the multiple meanings of loss into the overarching stories of their lives” (pp. 263-264).</p>
         <p>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318412447566">Attig (2001)</xref>, another in this new wave of grief theorists, noted that in grieving “We make a multifaceted transition from loving in presence to loving in absence. And we reweave that lasting love into the larger, richly complex fabric of our lives” (p. 34). We relearn, we transform, we reshape, and as we do “we give lasting love for those who died a place within the larger context of our lives” (p. 52). Attig affirmed the validity of various forms of encounters with those who have left us as an integral part of this whole process rather than a manifestation of dysfunctional grieving which, based on a normative stage model of grieving, is inherent in the older paradigm. The experience of a continuing bond with the deceased is a common one. It is paradoxical in the sense that simultaneously one can have a sense of continuity yet know that nothing will ever be the same again, to sense presence in absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894318412447566">Silverman &amp; Nickman, 1996</xref>).</p>
         <p>This new model of grief and bereavement offers an open-ended, growth-oriented view of processing loss. Continuing relationships and ongoing connectedness become a hallmark of this process, supporting the honoring of special occasions and rituals while acknowledging that people do not grieve in the same way. Rather, individuals grieve in their own unique ways. Although there may be similarities there are also differences; thus what constitutes a healthy versus a problematic grieving process also varies.</p>
         <p>Over an 8-year period, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447566">Frantz, Farrell, and Trolley (2001)</xref> interviewed 397 adults approximately a year following the death of their loved ones in an effort to determine what, if any, positive experiences they identified. The sample was 73% women; average age was 40-41. The majority of deaths were lingering ones that occurred in hospitals; 38% were parents and 17% spouses, with the remainder representing the range of other relationships. They found that significant positive changes did occur for a majority of the bereaved and summarized five major findings. <italic>First</italic>, many learned to appreciate and value life and the importance of living in the moment. <italic>Second</italic>, many became stronger, more independent, and more self-confident. <italic>Third</italic>, many found their relationships with loved ones were strengthened, and they learned to tell people how much they loved and appreciated them. <italic>Fourth</italic>, there were a minority of individuals who still felt devastated, sadder, lonelier, and powerless who felt worse off than before the loss. <italic>Finally</italic>, 96% said that they were able to help themselves and take actions that helped them cope with loss. The authors end with the insight, paralleling the shift in views on grieving, “that the quality of some people’s lives is in some ways better following their loved one’s death than it was before” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447566">Frantz et al., 2001</xref>, p. 206).</p>

            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447566">Davis (2001)</xref> suggested that some people, unable to find meaning in a loss, can compensate by finding something positive instead, focusing on what good has come about, for example, learning something about the value of relationships or something new about self. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318412447566">Conant (1996)</xref> explored imagery and sense of presence in interviews with 10 widows, ages 39 to 51, whose husbands had died suddenly. All reported at least one experience where they felt the presence of their deceased husbands, seen as representing a place of inner safety, with evidence of transformative experiences for the women. Although sense of presence could be more likely when a woman felt helpless, was discouraged from expressing her feelings, or faced a threat, it could also represent “positive coping with the existential issues and transformation of the internal relationship, and as such need not be seen as a symptom of anything” (p. 194).</p>

         <title>Unitary Rhythm of Dying-Grieving</title>
         <p>Synthesized primarily from personal experiences with dying and grieving, yet supported by the literature and aesthetic representations of the process going beyond the musical illustrations provided here, is the following description of what is perceived as a unitary rhythm. <italic>Dying-grieving is a process of kaleidoscopic patterning flowing now swiftly now gently, spiraling creatively through shifting rhythms of now-else when-elsewhere, becoming in solitude and silence alone-all one, timeless-boundaryless</italic>. No space, no time, no separation; unity, changing configurations of patterning, boundless potentials among which to choose. Turning again to music, singer/songwriter Joe Crookston creatively portrays a transformative view of dying in his song <italic>Fall Down as the Rain</italic> (CD of same name):</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>When my life is over</p>
            <p>And I have gone away</p>
            <p>I’m gonna leave this big ole’ world</p>
            <p>And the trouble and the pain</p>
            <p>And if I get to heaven</p>
            <p>I will not stay</p>
            <p>I’ll turn myself around again</p>
            <p>And FALL DOWN AS THE RAIN</p>
            <p>then becoming goldenrod which, brown and dry, becomes part of an eagle’s nest and on to finally end as part of the mystery.</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>Life is a mystery to be lived, not an equation to be solved, and dying opens the doorway to the new, to the greater mystery beyond as everything changes. For the bereaved, as for the dying, change has multiple meanings and wears a myriad of faces. From my journal again, an entry dated May 8, 1998:</p>
         <p>Grandmotherly woman weaving the universe. As images appeared they came to life and flow into the world, leaving behind their imprints—people, stars, butterflies, all that is . . . . Asked how long she had been doing this—since before time began, would be there once time ceased to exist. Asked if I could learn; no, her task, but I could learn how to weave a healing way in the world.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>The author has offered a personal synthesis of a unitary rhythm of dying-grieving in the hope of facilitating continuing exploration of dying and grieving within a unitary perspective, particularly from the viewpoint of Rogerian nursing science. She hopes to continue this exploration with planned qualitative research and through other artistic representations of dying-grieving, especially those by contemporary songwriters.</p>
         <p>What emerges from the selected literature and resonates with personal experience of loss is the experience of integrality, ongoing mutual process, captured in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894318412447566">Rogers’ (1970)</xref> insight that dying is a creative, transforming process. For this author and as recognized by others in the literature, this is experienced by the one dying and the one grieving, as both grieve and die simultaneously. Although only one is physically dying, both are changing and forever changed. As has been pointed out by those cited above, nurses and other healthcare providers need to be open to and supportive of experiences shared by those who are dying and grieving, encouraging exploration of the personal meanings they find in their experiences. Awareness flows in ways that are sometimes described as constricting, sometimes as expanding, but always in a rhythm that is continuously shifting and changing, feeling alone-all one, feeling constricted-boundaryless—being present and listening can facilitate the sharing of this process and contribute to our understanding of what it means to move <italic>beyond with</italic> rather than <italic>separating from</italic> the one who has moved on.</p>
