<abstract>
<p>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) exhibit more severe cognitive decline in females compared with males; however, the preventive approach to this gender-specific cognitive decline is still an enigma. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that also acts as an androgen receptor antagonist. Here, we investigated whether spironolactone attenuates cognitive impairment observed in female T2DM mice. Adult wild-type (WT) mice and an obese T2DM model, KKAy mice, were employed in this study. Cognitive function was evaluated by the shuttle avoidance test and Morris water maze test. Administration of spironolactone (50 mg/kg per day in chow) had no significant effect on blood pressure, glucose tolerance or insulin resistance. In WT mice, no significant sex difference in cognitive function was observed; however, treatment with spironolactone improved spatial memory in the water maze, especially in female WT mice. Administration of spironolactone markedly improved the cognitive decline in female KKAy mice up to the level in male KKAy mice. Spironolactone treatment also improved cognitive function in ovariectomized-KKAy mice, but failed to improve it in those with administration of estradiol (200 µg/kg per day). In diabetic mice, spironolactone improved impaired cognitive function observed in female mice, suggesting that spironolactone may prevent cognitive impairment associated with diabetes in females clinically.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gender-specific medicine has been highlighted as an individual approach to improve quality of life with consideration of sex differences. Many clinical studies have indicated that females with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) exhibit more severe cognitive decline than do males.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470320311412810">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470320311412810">2</xref></sup> Especially, Whitmer et al. reported that obese females were twice as likely to have dementia as women of normal weight, while obese men had a non-significant 30% increase in risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470320311412810">3</xref></sup> According to these clinical reports, we have recently investigated the sex difference in T2DM-induced cognitive impairment using T2DM and obesity model mice, KKAy. We reported that more marked cognitive impairment was observed in female than in male KKAy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470320311412810">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311412810">4</xref></sup> This indicates that a preventive approach to cognitive impairment is necessary, especially for females. However, treatment with estrogen did not improve cognitive impairment. Following that report, we tried several drugs to prevent cognitive impairment. A recent clinical paper reported that potassium-sparing diuretics, mainly spironolactone, are associated with reduced incidence of Alzheimer disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320311412810">5</xref></sup> Here, we found a beneficial effect of spironolactone on T2DM-induced cognitive impairment in female KKAy mice.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>This study was performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the use of experimental animals. All animal studies were reviewed and approved by the Animal Studies Committee of Ehime University.</p>
<sec id="section3-1470320311412810">
<title>Animal model</title>
<p>Adult (8 to 12-week-old) WT and KKAy mice (CLEA, Tokyo, Japan) were used in this study. Some mice were treated with spironolactone (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) at a dose of 50 mg/kg per day in food from eight weeks old. Ovariectomized (OVX) mice were treated with estradiol (E2) (β-estradiol, Sigma-Aldrich, MO) at a dose of 200 µg/kg per day or vehicle (propylene glycol) via an osmotic minipump (Alzet model 1002, Durect Corp., Cupertino, CA) implanted intraperitoneally at 10 weeks old.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1470320311412810">
<title>Passive avoidance test</title>
<p>Passive avoidance test was performed as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320311412810">6</xref></sup> The rate of avoidance of electric shocks in 20 trials was determined as an index of cognitive function. Tests were performed blindly, daily for five days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1470320311412810">
<title>Morris water maze test</title>
<p>The Morris water maze test was performed as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470320311412810">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311412810">4</xref></sup> In each trial, mice were given 120 seconds to find the platform. Tests were performed blindly, daily for five days. Swimming was video-tracked (AnyMaze, Wood Dale, IL) and latency, path length, swim speed and cumulative distance from the platform were recorded. Mean swim latency for all trials on each day in each group was determined and compared between groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1470320311412810">
<title>Blood pressure measurement</title>
<p>Systolic blood pressure was monitored by the tail-cuff method (MK-1030, Muromachi Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan), as described in a previous report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320311412810">7</xref></sup>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1470320311412810">
<title>Measurement of blood components, plasma electrolytes, insulin, estradiol, and testosterone levels</title>
<p>Blood samples were obtained using an animal bleeding lancet (Goldenrod, Medipoint, Inc., NY) at 11 to 12 weeks old in a non-fasted state. Blood components and plasma electrolytes were determined by i-STAT (Abbott Point of Care Inc., Princeton, NJ).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1470320311412810">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All of the data in the text and figures are expressed as mean ± SEM. Body weight was analyzed by Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test. And other data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. If a statistically significant effect was found, post-hoc analysis was performed by Scheffe’s test to detect the difference between the groups. A value of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.</p>

<title>Spironolactone improved spatial memory in WT mice</title>
<p>In the passive avoidance test, although significant reduced avoidance rate was observed in female WT treated with spironolactone only on day 2, overall there was no significant change by spironolactone treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470320311412810">Figure 1A</xref>), but in the Morris water maze test, female WT treated with spironolactone showed a significant improvement in escape latency compared with female control WT from day 2 to day 5, and compared with male WT treated with spironolactone from day 3 to day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470320311412810">Figure 1B</xref>).

<title>Spironolactone significantly improved cognitive function in KKAy mice</title>
<p>On the other hand, KKAy mice showed cognitive decline compared with WT mice. In the shuttle avoidance test, female KKAy showed marked impairment of the avoidance rate compared with male KKAy from day 2 to day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470320311412810">Figure 2A</xref>).

In the Morris water maze test, female KKAy treated with spironolactone showed significant improvement of spatial memory on days 2, 4, and 5 compared with that in female control KKAy.

Moreover, treatment with spironolactone significantly improved spatial memory in males at day 3 and day 5 compared with females. In the probe trial, female control KKAy showed decreased time spent in the correct quadrant and frequency of crossing the former platform place compared with male control KKAy, but spironolactone treatment improved them to levels similar to those in male control KKAy and male KKAy treated with spironolactone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470320311412810">Figure 2C</xref>).

<title>Effect of estradiol treatment on cognitive function in OVX-KKAy and OVX+E2-KKAy groups</title>
<p>In the shuttle avoidance test, spironolactone treatment showed a tendency to decrease the avoidance rate in OVX+E2-KKAy, although it had a tendency to improve the avoidance rate in OVX-KKAy. Treatment with spironolactone in OVX-KKAy significantly increased the avoidance rate at day 3 and day 4 compared with OVX-KKAy. However, estradiol treatment in spironolactone-treated OVX-KKAy significantly decreased the avoidance rate from day 3 to day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470320311412810">Figure 3A</xref>). Moreover, spironolactone-treated OVX+E2-KKAy also showed a significant decrease in the avoidance rate at day 3 and day 4 compared with OVX+E2-KKAy. In the Morris water maze test, spironolactone showed a tendency to improve the escape latency in OVX+E2-KKAy, although there was no significance except on day 4. In contrast, OVX-KKAy treated with spironolactone showed a marked significant improvement on all days compared with OVX-KKAy control and OVX+E2-KKAy treated with spironolactone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470320311412810">Figure 3B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study demonstrated that spironolactone treatment improved spatial memory in WT and KKAy mice. We also showed that estradiol with spironolactone treatment in OVX-KKAy attenuated the avoidance rate, rather than being effective. The influence on glucose tolerance and electrolytes did not show a significant difference between the control groups and groups treated with spironolactone at a dose of 50 mg/kg per day.</p>
<p>Previously we reported that female KKAy showed more severe cognitive impairment compared with male KKAy, and treatment with estradiol could not improve the cognitive decline in female KKAy mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311412810">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470320311412810">8</xref></sup> Female KKAy also showed greater impairment of glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, and lower PPAR-γ±expression compared with male KKAy. Accordingly, we tried an insulin sensitizer to improve cognition, but it did not markedly improve spatial memory (data not shown). Next, we used insulin to control hyperglycemia, but it also could not improve the cognitive decline (data not shown). Therefore, glucose metabolism does not seem to play an important role in the sex difference in cognition.</p>
<p>Spironolactone is used as a potassium-sparing diuretic. A recent clinical paper reported that potassium-sparing diuretics, mainly spironolactone, are associated with a reduced incidence of Alzheimer disease. They reported that the use of any antihypertensive medication was associated with a lower incidence of AD (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.64), and especially, the use of potassium-sparing diuretics was associated with the greatest reduction in risk of AD (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.26).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320311412810">5</xref></sup> The authors discussed the merit of potassium-sparing diuretics in increasing the potassium level; however, the present study showed that serum potassium level was not different in KKAy mice with or without spironolactone treatment. Thus, potassium level does not play a role in spironolactone-induced cognitive improvement.</p>
<p>Spironolactone is also known to be a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist. MR expression is found in the brain, restricted to the hippocampus and cerebral cortex under normal conditions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470320311412810">9</xref></sup> which are related to spatial memory. Some studies have examined the involvement of central MR and/or glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in spatial learning, a hippocampus-dependent memory. The results varied depending on the context and duration of antagonist treatment. For example, Engelmann reported that a reduction of hippocampal MR or GR binding capacity by 20–30% did not interfere with spatial navigation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470320311412810">10</xref></sup> In contrast, Oitzl and de Kloet reported that intracerebroventricular injection of an MR antagonist altered search-escape strategies in the water maze.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470320311412810">11</xref></sup> Recently, Stranahan et al. reported that glucocorticoid<bold>-</bold>mediated deficits in neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity are involved in cognitive impairment associated with diabetes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470320311412810">12</xref></sup> indicating that imbalance of GR and MR may be observed in diabetes mellitus and affect diabetes-induced cognitive impairment. Although the baseline cognition did not differ in each group; however, cognitive function was improved even from day 1 of the cognitive test by spironolactone treatment. One possible mechanism of this spironolactone-induced improvement of learning ability would be due to the differences in anxiety. Herrero et al. demonstrated that anxiety-like behavior is related to cognitive performance in spatial learning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470320311412810">13</xref></sup> Animals with low levels of anxiety display a sharper learning curve than those with high levels of anxiety. Smythe et al. showed that hippocampal MR modulates anxiety-like behavior with a non-genomic mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470320311412810">14</xref></sup> Although the detailed mechanism is not well known, this result may indicate that spironolactone treatment may also affect anxiety-like behavior.</p>
<p>In our study, we did not evaluate the plasma aldosterone level and mineralocorticoid receptor expression in the brain. Previous papers indicate a possibility of an increase in plasma or urinary aldosterone levels in diabetic mice;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470320311412810">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470320311412810">16</xref></sup> however, there are few papers describing the possible sex difference in aldosterone levels in diabetic mice. It is possible that gender or serial measurement of cognitive function determined by stressful tests would affect the aldosterone level. The differences of the aldosterone levels among experimental groups and on each consecutive experimental day will help to understand further the effects of spironolactone on the sex difference observed in our experiments. The detailed mechanism as to whether the beneficial effect of spironolactone is mediated by anti-MR signaling is unknown. Very recently, Yagi et al. reported that high plasma aldosterone concentration becomes a risk factor for cognitive impairment in hypertensives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470320311412810">17</xref></sup> They also demonstrated that treatment with spironolactone or eplerenone increased mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score in patients with hypertension but not controlled. We did not use eplerenone for this experiment; however, these results indicate that blockade of MR by spironolactone prevents cognitive impairment in female diabetic mice probably as a class effect of MR blockade. Further investigation is necessary to assess its mechanism.</p>
<p>E2 treatment worsened rather than improved cognitive function when it was used with spironolactone, although OVX-KKAy showed improved cognitive function. Spironolactone was reported to worsen glycemic control when it was used in poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470320311412810">18</xref></sup> However, there was no difference in blood pressure, electrolytes, hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia between animals with and without spironolactone treatment in this study. Rigsby et al. reported that treatment with spironolactone decreased ischemic cerebral infarct size in male spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (SHRSP); in contrast, spironolactone had no effect on infarct size in OVX-SHRSP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470320311412810">19</xref></sup> Although the detailed mechanism is unknown, spironolactone has a sex-different effect on brain MR activity involving estrogen. We speculate several possibilities why estrogen treatment seems to interfere with the beneficial effect of spironolactone on cognitive function. As shown in our previous paper,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311412810">4</xref></sup> the expression of AT<sub>1</sub> receptor in the brain was significantly higher in female KKAy mice irrespective of ovariectomy; however, E<sub>2</sub> treatment significantly decreased AT<sub>1</sub> receptor expression in ovariectomized-KKAy. In addition, chronic E<sub>2</sub> treatment decreases MR mRNA expression and MR binding in the hippocampus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470320311412810">20</xref></sup> Moreover, estrogen receptor (ER) activation could protect the cardiovascular system from the decrease in excessive MR activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470320311412810">21</xref></sup> It is also reported that GPR30, a membrane estrogen receptor, acts as a membrane-bound aldosterone receptor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470320311412810">22</xref></sup> GPR30 is expressed in brain regions for learning and memory, and has an effect on cognition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470320311412810">23</xref></sup> Therefore, chronic E<sub>2</sub> treatment may influence the level of GPR30 expression. Taken together, we could speculate that spironolactone-induced preventive effect on cognitive function was attenuated in E<sub>2</sub>-treated OVX-KKAy mice.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that treatment with spironolactone contributes to improvement of the cognitive decline associated with diabetes mellitus. Moreover, this beneficial effect is especially observed in females. Further clinical investigation is warranted.</p>
