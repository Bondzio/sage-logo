<abstract>
<p>A mixed method was employed to determine how caregivers view preschool children’s body size and associated health risks. A survey of 505 caregivers was nested in 10 in-depth case studies of mothers. Based on the International Obesity Task Force calculation of children’s weight status, the caregivers who had underweight children overestimated their children’s weight status but the caregivers who had overweight/obese children underestimated their children’s weight status. Their estimates were substantially different from those of the caregivers of normal weight children. The mothers’ thoughts revealed the complexity of beliefs and sociocultural experiences about weight preferences and affirmed the quantitative findings.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Prevention and management of obesity in preschool children require the involvement of parents or caregivers, and interventions are more likely to be effective when the caregiver perceives that the child’s body weight is a problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105312439729">Rhee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105312439729">Wald et al., 2007</xref>). Inaccurate recognition of the weight status of their children by primary caregivers is, therefore, seen as a threat to healthy weight control unless they believe in the necessity of lifestyle changes and/or active treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105312439729">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In traditional Chinese culture, plumpness is a sign of prosperity and robust health, whereas an emaciated body represents bad luck, illness, and early death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105312439729">Lee et al., 1993</xref>). However, modern-day Chinese culture is increasingly Westernized, assigning positive health and esthetic value to thinness and recognizing the health risks of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105312439729">Watson, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Obesity is the fastest growing epidemic in South East Asia. In Hong Kong, the number of obese children has tripled over the last 20 years, and it is predicted that by 2013, one-quarter of primary school children will be obese. In a survey of primary school children aged 6–18 years, conducted in Hong Kong in 2003–2004, it was found that 22.3 percent of boys and 20 percent of girls were obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105312439729">Department of Health, 2005b</xref>). As for children under 5 years of age in Hong Kong, 17 percent are currently reported by the government as being overweight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105312439729">Chan, 2010</xref>). Although the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105312439729">Department of Health (2005a)</xref> has raised concerns about childhood obesity, unbalanced dietary intake, and low levels of physical activity, there are still only a few studies on childhood obesity in preschool children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105312439729">Lau and Yip, 2006</xref>). In particular, there is a lack of Chinese studies on parents’ perceptions of a child’s body images and the understanding of parents’ attitudes, opinions, feelings, and behavior toward a child’s body shape and body size.</p>
<p>In this study, using survey and case studies, there were two research questions:</p>
<list id="list1-1359105312439729" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What are parents’ views on “ideal” body size, and to what extent can parents estimate their own child’s current body size?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To what extent do parents link their child’s current body size with their child’s future adult body size and an ideal adult body size?</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Mixed method research, including both quantitative and qualitative tools, was employed for this study. A survey of 505 parents and caregivers of preschool children was nested in 10 in-depth case studies of mothers of different weight statuses of children. The mixed method was used to compensate for the weaknesses of quantitative approach by providing an in-depth understanding of mothers’ attitudes, feelings, and behavior toward their child’s body shape and size, in order to provide a more complete picture of the enquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105312439729">Hubert, 2004</xref>). Ethical approval was obtained from the Hong Kong Institute of Education.</p>
<sec id="section3-1359105312439729">
<title>Sampling frame and participants</title>
<p>A total of 508 parents and primary caregivers were voluntarily recruited from 18 kindergartens-cum-childcare centers from the city of Hong Kong. This sample comprised mostly mothers (86%, <italic>n</italic> = 435) but also included fathers (7%, <italic>n</italic> = 39), grandparents, relatives, and maids (7%, <italic>n</italic> = 34). The kindergartens were selected according to geographic locations, types of housing estates (e.g. private housing, government-subsidies housing, and government rental housing estates), and levels of school fees. The factors of school fees and geographical locations likely correlate with socioeconomic status of children’s families. The SES of the individual caregivers also included education, employment, housing, and family income. Ten case studies of mothers who had a range of weight status of children including underweight (<italic>n</italic> = 2), normal (<italic>n</italic> = 4), overweight (<italic>n</italic> = 2), and obese (<italic>n</italic> = 2) were randomly recruited from the participating kindergartens. They came from different SES and had different weight statuses. These mothers were all voluntarily interviewed.</p>
<p>Information about height and weight, age, and gender of each child were obtained from the teachers of the participating kindergartens, using the International Obesity Task Force (2000) index for body mass index (BMI) for age and gender to classify each child’s weight status. The children in this sample were classified into four categories of weight status: underweight (<italic>n</italic> = 75), normal weight (<italic>n</italic> = 333), overweight (<italic>n</italic> = 70), and obese (<italic>n</italic> = 27).</p>

<title>Instrument</title>
<p>Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105312439729">Stunkard et al.’s (1983)</xref> study, we developed a series of drawings of silhouettes ranging from very thin to very fat (on a scale of 1–9), depicting a child aged 2–4 years and a young adult aged 16–18 years. Caregivers were asked to choose from the child silhouettes the one that corresponded most closely to their child’s body size and the adult silhouette that corresponded most closely to the size they predicted would be their child’s adult figure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1359105312439729">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105312439729">Stunkard et al.’s (1983)</xref> study, the Child Body Questionnaire was developed.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1359105312439729-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In total, there were 19 short questions relating to health perceptions that formed the Child Body Questionnaire (CBQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105312439729">Chan et al., 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312439729">2010b</xref>). These short health statements were generated by several groups of caregivers. Demographic variables included education level, length of stay in Hong Kong, employment status of caregivers, type of housing, and monthly family income. This instrument was validated using a Rasch analysis that achieved a reliability score of .73.</p>
<p>The International Obesity Task Force published a set of sex specific BMI cutoff values based on 6 representative data sets from Brazil, Great Britain, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Singapore, and the United States. For each of the surveys, centile curves were drawn that at age 18 years passed through the widely used cut off points of 25 and 30 kg/m2 for adult overweight and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105312439729">Cole et al., 2000</xref>), and below cut off point of 16 kg/m2 for underweight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105312439729">Cole et al., 2007</xref>). The resulting curves were averaged to provide age and sex specific cut off points from 2-18 years. The International Obesity Task Force included Hong Kong Chinese population, and thus, has been recommended by the Hong Kong Government to define and measure Chinese children’s body weight status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105312439729">Department of Health, 2005b</xref>).</p>
<p>The protocol for the semi-structured interviews was developed in relation to the quantitative findings. At first, the mothers filled in the CBQ. Based on the answers of their CBQ, several open-ended questions were asked, such as the following: “How would you describe your child’s current body shape/size and his/her future adult body shape/weight?” “How does your child’s body size compare with fat/thin/normal children’s body size?” “What are the health-related conditions of your child’s present body weight?” and “Explain the reasons of your views on this,” and so on.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1359105312439729">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The data were collected in a preschool setting following a child health talk given by the first author, who is a pediatric nurse. Primary caregivers included parents, grandparents, relatives, and foreign domestic workers. To provide assistance to individuals with limited literacy, the questionnaire was distributed in a group setting, typically between four and six persons at a time. First, the primary caregivers were invited to complete the demographic sheet with assistance. For caregivers who had difficulty understanding the questionnaire, individual assistance was offered. We then carried out qualitative interviews with 10 mothers of children of different weight statuses from different SES kindergartens. Tape recordings were employed during the interviews.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1359105312439729">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The relationship between demographic variables, child’s actual body size, and caregivers’ responses were explored by appropriate statistical methods including descriptive statistics and Spearman’s correlation using the SPSS, version 17. Fisher’s exact test in the R was employed for the analysis of the most abnormal weight children.</p>
<p>The nine children and nine adult silhouettes from the CBQ were transformed into four visual categories: underweight (images 1 and 2), normal weight (images 3–5), overweight (images 6 and 7), and obese (images 8 and 9). A discrepancy index of body image was created to identify caregivers’ Index of Child Body Size Estimation (IE) and an Index of Child Future Adult Body Size Predictions (IP). The IE was computed as the Child’s Perceived Current Body Figure minus the Child’s Actual BMI; the IP was computed as the Child’s Perceived Future Adult Figure minus the Child’s Actual BMI. The mean values of the caregivers’ perceived child’s ideal body size and the child’s current body size were calculated as follows: If IE = 0, this means the caregiver’s perception of their child’s current body size is equal to the child’s present actual body size; if IE &lt; 0, this means that caregivers underestimate their child’s actual body weight; if IP &gt; 0, this means that caregivers overestimate their child’s actual body weight. A similar calculation to the caregivers’ discrepancy index of perceiving their child’s ideal figure and their child’s actual figure was also applied. If IP = 0, this means the caregiver’s perception of the child’s future adult figure will be proportionally equal to the child’s present actual body figure that is in line with scientific evidence; if IP &lt; 0, this means that caregivers perceived that their child’s actual body weight will achieve normal weight on reaching adulthood; if IP &gt; 0, this means that caregivers perceived that the child’s future adult body weight will actually be higher than normal weight when reaching adulthood. A similar calculation to the caregivers’ discrepancy index of perceiving the child’s ideal future adult figure and their child’s actual figure was also applied.</p>
<p>We took 5 percent of the most underweight children (<italic>n</italic> = 25) and of the most obese children (<italic>n</italic> = 25), using Fisher’s exact test to investigate the relationships between these children and their caregivers’ SES. The 5 percent was decided to be selected because there were 27 obese children in total in the sample.</p>
<p>Qualitative data were analyzed by a multilevel framework that attempted to draw links between the mother’s different beliefs, expectations, and health-related ideas on child body size and also incorporated data from the quantitative study into an overall model. First, the tape recording of each interview was transcribed. Second, we used the framework method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105312439729">Ritchie and Spencer, 1994</xref>) to sort out the qualitative data in an Excel file. Subsequently, a further multilevel theoretical analysis was used to link quantitative and qualitative data: first to generate individual case descriptions, second to draw themes across cases, and third to place the findings in connection with the quantitative findings in order to answer the two stated research questions.</p>

<title>Demographics of the caregivers and their children</title>
<p>In sum, 505 caregivers participated in the study, the majority being parents (93.3%, <italic>n</italic> = 471). The mean age of the children was 4.8 years, of whom over half were boys (53.7%, <italic>n</italic> = 271) and just under half were girls (46.3%, <italic>n</italic> = 234). A wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds was represented. Two-thirds of the children (65.9%, <italic>n</italic> = 333) in the sample were of normal weight (BMI range: 13.89–17.86 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), while one-fifth (19.2%, <italic>n</italic> = 97) were either overweight (BMI range: 17.22–19.75 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) or obese (BMI range: 19.32–27.21 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and about one in seven children (14.9%, <italic>n</italic> = 75) were underweight (BMI: 11.30–14.81 kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p>The relationship between the children’s weight status and the caregivers’ demographic characteristics was investigated. There was significant association in type of housing and school fees (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, by Fisher’s exact test) between the most underweight and most obese children. The most underweight children were more likely to live in temporary housing and attended low-fee schools, while the most obese children and the normal weight children were more likely to attend medium-to-high-fee schools.</p>

<sec id="section9-1359105312439729">
<title>Caregivers’ views on “ideal” child body size, and to what extent caregivers can estimate their own child’s current body size?</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1359105312439729">Figure 2</xref> shows a comparison between the actual size of preschool children and their caregivers’ perceptions of their children’s current and ideal weight status. Based on the calculation of IE, the figure shows that the caregivers who had underweight children, overestimated their child’s weight (IE: Perceived Child’s Current Body Shape (CPC) minus BMI = 2.34) but those caregivers who had overweight or obese children underestimated their child’s weight status (overweight minus IE: −1.67 and obese minus IE: −3.57). Both groups’ perceptual attitudes significantly differed from the caregivers of the normal weight children (IE = 0.23), and both groups tended to believe that their child’s weight would normalize when reaching adulthood. Such a response pattern reveals a somewhat distorted perception of the child’s actual body shape and size. The caregivers’ perceptions of their child’s ideal and actual BMI also indicate some distortion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1359105312439729">Figure 1</xref> shows that the caregivers of normal weight children had a smaller perceptual gap between their perception of their child’s ideal body size and their child’s BMI (Perceived Ideal Child Body Shape (CPI) minus BMI = 0.59) than the caregivers of the underweight (2.85), overweight (−2.00), and obese (−4.06) children.</p>

<title>What the mothers said about their children’s current body shapes</title>
<p>Two single obese boys aged 4.7 and 6 years. The family has a small restaurant. This mother described her boy as
<disp-quote>
<p>He is big, not fat because he does not have double chins … I do not believe that he has a lot of body fat … (1S10: 45). If the child becomes fat in adulthood, it needs to pay attention BUT not now … fat means the body is good at absorbing nutrition … (1S14:49, 48, 50)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The father said: “I am fat (LAUGHED). I have a big tummy, my child looks like me, my child’s tummy is even bigger than me … LAUGHED.” The mother looked embarrassed and said: “He talks rubbish. His father is big and tall” (1S43: 102).</p>
<p>Another mother recently came to Hong Kong from China for family reunion. She said: “my mother told me that … not to let the child get thin because he will easily have all kinds of illnesses …” (2S34:89).</p>
<p>The two mothers of an obese child appeared similarly to those mothers of an obese child in the survey that single-line answers chosen mostly were child silhouette no. 5 and the adult silhouette no. 4, as shown in their CBQ. It indicated that they perceived their sons’ current and future body sizes were normal, with all positive health attributes, although they were able to identify that a fat child will become a fat adult (silhouette no. 7) and a fat adult (silhouette no. 8) will suffer more illnesses and sickness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1359105312439729">
<title>To what extent do caregivers link their child’s current body size to the child’s future adult body size?</title>
<p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1359105312439729">Figure 2</xref>, based on the calculation of the IP, the caregivers of the normal weight children also indicated lesser perceptual distortion of the predictions of their child’s future adult body size and the child’s BMI (Perceived Child’s Adult Body Shape (APC) minus BMI = 0.02) than the caregivers of the underweight children (IP = 2.39), overweight children (IP = −2.00), and obese children (IP = −3.73). The negative values here indicate that the caregivers of overweight/obese children predict their child‘s future adult body size as far more normalized than their child’s actual figure. This implies that those caregivers who had a child with abnormal body weight status would not consider the effect of the child’s current body size when predicting their future growth.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1359105312439729">Figure 2</xref> also shows that almost all caregivers perceived that an ideal adult figure is of normal body weight range. This indicates that regardless of the child’s current BMI status, the caregivers tended to choose a medium body size as representing both the child’s future adult body size and an adult’s ideal body image. However, the caregivers of a normal weight child had a smaller perceptual gap (Perceived Ideal Adult Body Shape (API) minus BMI = 0.29) between their prediction of the adult ideal body size and the child’s BMI than the caregivers of underweight children (2.77), overweight children (−2.00), and obese children (−4.20). The estimation values of the adult ideal body size and the child’s actual BMI indicated that the caregivers of abnormal weight children have a perceptual gap.</p>

<p>Similar to all mothers of normal weight children in the survey, the four mothers in the case studies gave a diverse pattern of answers in their CBQ, indicating a better understanding of weight-associated health risk.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study consists of data from three sources: actual BMI measurements, caregivers’ perceptions of the current and ideal body figures of the children in their care, and their views on their children’s associated health-related body image. By exploring the relationships between these variables, the study attempts to identify areas that might have an influence on caregivers’ perceptions of children’s weight and examine how a child’s weight status contributes to the caregivers’ perceptions on the relationship between health and weight.</p>
<p>The results of this study reveal two main points. First, the caregivers’ distorted perceptions of what may be happening to the child. The findings from both quantitative and qualitative data indicate that while the caregivers of normal weight children can generally estimate a child’s current body size, the caregivers of abnormal weight children cannot estimate a child’s current body size. The caregivers of children with abnormal weight tend to claim that their child has a normal weight status; the caregivers of underweight children generally overestimate the body sizes of their child, and the caregivers of overweight or obese children underestimate their child’s body size. Most caregivers of children with abnormal weight status, whether underweight, overweight, or obese, have a perceptual distortion far beyond the caregivers of normal weight children.</p>
<p>Exploring the caregivers’ perceptions of ideal child body image further suggests that the child’s ideal body figure, according to the perception of his/her caregiver, relates closely to positive health and social well-being performance. As for the ideal body image in the adolescent period, this again closely relates to a young person’s life prosperity. It is very likely that the perceptions of caregivers of the child’s body image relate to a wide range of sociocultural norms based on life experience. The mothers from the case studies further explained their distorted perceptual views of child body figures, such as child’s fat body, which will be shown by their “double chins” and “big tummy.” They thought that the child’s fat body will naturally be reduced to a normal size because of “adult’s hard work” and “adult’s body grows up.” Some mothers had a thin child perceived that her thin child body was associated with beauty and healthy. Most mothers of abnormal weight children found it difficult to distinguish child’s body size–associated health risks. In short, the distorted child body perceptions of the mothers of abnormal weight children in both the survey and the case studies appear as similar single-line answers in their CBQ, meaning that they may not have satisfactory cognitive ability to distinguish body weight–associated health risks. It is of interest to note that there exists a significant moderate and positive correlation between the likeness of a 2-year-old child with a good body size and the likeness of the child at 16–18 years with the ideal figure. This seems to indicate that caregivers tended to believe that the body size of their child is both good and ideal. Such a tendency seems to suggest that most caregivers reflect somewhat motherhood’s self-fulfilling prophecy as a measure to assess child body image, rather than directly referring to a BMI or a quantifiable weight measure.</p>
<p>Such a finding matches previous childhood obesity studies in which parents of preschool children often have a poor awareness of their child’s current weight status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105312439729">Baughcum et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105312439729">Carnell et al., 2005</xref>). The results in this study reveal that many caregivers’ distorted perceptions of child body size could be caused by the perceptual ambiguity of vision alone, as pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105312439729">Robles-De-La-Torre and Hayward (2001)</xref>. This distortion may relate to an optimistic bias concerning personal motherhood risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105312439729">Young-Hyman et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312439729">Kostanski et al. (2004)</xref> distinguish two levels of body image dissatisfaction: cognitive and affective dissatisfaction. As far as the results of this study are concerned, the caregiver’s distorted views of the child’s body image could be affective in nature because it is likely that caregivers tend to be in denial or dissatisfied with their children’s present body shape that was caused by unpleasant fear or even the emotional overtones of caregiver experiences. In light of this tendency, health workers’ support for the parents in the cognitive domain through parental counseling may be necessary because in the context of childhood obesity, the parents of children of abnormal weight status generally have difficulty in estimating the actual weight status of their own child.</p>
<p>The second issue concerns SES. This study finds that child body weight status does not correlate with socioeconomic background, with the exception of the varying family monthly incomes of the caregivers. The relationship tends to be weak in statistical terms. The results in this study indicate that the association between children of extreme weight status and their caregivers’ socioeconomic background, such as housing and types of school fee, is statistically significant. This implies that to a certain degree, poor Chinese families may have difficulty in providing a nutritional diet and quality food to their young children. The results of the variables between family monthly income, type of housing, and location of kindergartens imply that there are discrepancies between the health status of children living in poor and rich families. As the data indicate, new immigrants from China tend to have a low family income, poor housing, and no regular employment, and it is likely that their specific social needs may well be demanding and desperate; this may need further study. Supportive activities, such as education on childrearing and nutrition, or counseling groups for caregivers, should be encouraged in order to provide parental support to poor young families and newcomers to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The findings of this study differ from a US study in which mothers with less education are more likely to have had child body size misperceptions than those with education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105312439729">Baughcum et al., 2000</xref>). This study supports the previous studies indicating that global body image dissatisfaction is not a unidimensional construct but is multidimensional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312439729">Kostanski et al., 2004</xref>) because the caregivers’ perceptions may relate to a wider range of children’s social behavior factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105312439729">Leung et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105312439729">Phillipson, 2009</xref>), not a single factor of BMI measure.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the mixed method enquiry has expanded the context of body image study by contributing to the understanding of the factors influencing caregiver perceptions of child weight status against a background of Chinese culture. The key results indicate that the caregivers of children with abnormal weight status have a distorted perception of what actually happens to the young children. These caregivers tend to have some personal explanations about their beliefs and expectations about their child’s body shape: some are based on sociocultural norms, some are from personal experience, while others are based on health literacy. Intervention of child obesity should recognize that individual perceptions are essential factors that affect the perception of illness or diseases; individuals will alter health-related behavior according to the perceived severity of the threat to health. In light of these findings, health and education professionals should be aware of and should work on the parental views regarding their children’s body size, while providing support or intervention to the child’s primary caregiver.</p>
