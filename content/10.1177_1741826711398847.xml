<abstract>
<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Professional skills, education and accreditation, along with clinical outcome assessment, are considered important factors to achieve comprehensive delivery and quality of cardiac rehabilitation (CR). This study assessed professional educational programmes, accreditation and use of databases in CR across the European countries.</p>
<p><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> Questions on professional education, accreditation and clinical databases from the European Cardiac Rehabilitation Inventory Survey, which is a postal questionnaire survey, conducted from November 2007 to January 2009 among national CR-related organizations in Europe; 28 countries responded (72%) to this survey.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Among the participating countries, 32% had guidelines on professional CR skills, 61% had formal educational programmes and 29% had accreditation systems for professional CR skills. One hundred and seventy-four ad-hoc educational and scientific activities were registered during 2005–2007. Forty-three percent of the countries had established CR programme accreditation systems, primarily aimed at phase 2. One in three (35%) countries had established clinical CR databases with a further 25% planning to do so.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> More than half of the European countries had developed formal CR educational programmes. Furthermore, many ad-hoc CR-related meetings and conference activities take place across Europe. Although only a quarter of countries had developed accreditation systems aimed at professionals, programme accreditation was somewhat more widespread with over a third having programme accreditation systems. Clinical databases were underdeveloped. A greater focus on education, accreditation and database implementation is needed to promote CR availability and the quality of CR services for the benefit of cardiac patients across Europe.</p>

<p>Cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation improve clinical status, quality of life and prognosis in patients with cardiovascular diseases, in particular in patients recovering from acute events and interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711398847">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711398847">3</xref></sup> However, less than half of the eligible patients in Europe and United States benefit from this intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711398847">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711398847">6</xref></sup> Shortages in rehabilitation services, funding and adequately trained professionals, alongside lack of legislation, have been identified as some of the important contributors to the inadequate supply of cardiac rehabilitation (CR).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711398847">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711398847">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711398847">8</xref></sup> Education and accreditation have been pointed out as important tools to improve clinical practice,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711398847">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711398847">9</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711398847">12</xref></sup> and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Association of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation (EACPR) have placed considerable emphasis on education and accreditation to reach the highest possible standards in cardiac care throughout Europe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741826711398847">Figure 1</xref>). Promoting optimal CR service provision not only depends on a skilled workforce, but also on robust data systems so that CR coverage and gaps in service provision can be captured and used as the basis for planning improvements.

<p>The delivery and quality of CR depend on a major degree of the level of skills among professionals. CR interventions are based on complex professional skills – clinical, communication and behavioural change skills – within the multidisciplinary team.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711398847">13</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711398847">15</xref></sup> Programmes must deliver evidence-based interventions for a wide range of patient conditions in a manner that supports physically ill and psychologically challenged individuals to undertake a programme of lifestyle change with regard to physical activity, diet, smoking cessation, psychological management and medication adherence. Thus, it is extremely important that CR staffs are continuously educated to deliver updated evidence-based CR services. Knowledge about the current level of CR skills, education activities and accreditation among professionals in Europe is, however, limited. One earlier study – a European survey of CR centres in 13 European countries in 1997 – found that CR training programmes for professionals were not discussed in any of the European CR guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711398847">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711398847">16</xref></sup> Very few centres could make any estimate of the proportion of eligible patients receiving CR as databases and information systems did not capture such data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711398847">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711398847">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>To benchmark current professional training and information systems for CR in Europe to identify the focus areas for development within education, accreditation and clinical outcome assessment, this study investigates the level of professional education, accreditation and the use of clinical databases across the European countries. Explorative analysis is conducted to test whether external markers and CR-related markers are associated with more developed education, accreditation systems and the use of clinical databases.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1741826711398847" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>The European Cardiac Rehabilitation Inventory Survey (ECRIS) was designed as a postal self-administered questionnaire on national CR-related topics in European countries. The study design and methods are described briefly here and outlined in detail elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711398847">4</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec3-1741826711398847"><title>The European Cardiac Rehabilitation Inventory Survey questionnaire</title>
<p>The questionnaire was developed by the Nucleus of the Cardiac Rehabilitation Section and Committee on Education and Accreditation of EACPR.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711398847"><title>Skills, professional education and professional accreditation</title>
<p>The following definitions of the central terms were used: ‘skill’ is the ability of the professional to do something well. ‘Education’ is the process of teaching, training and learning to improve knowledge and develop professional competence. ‘Accreditation’ is an official recognition given by an organization of achievement of a required standard. Accreditation can be aimed at the professional or at a programme as a whole.</p>
<p>The following questions on skills, education and professional accreditation were included:
<list id="list1-1741826711398847" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Does the current national guideline/position paper demand specific skills among professionals delivering CR?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Are there any specific formal educational or training programmes for the staff delivering CR services in your country?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Please list any national or local/regional meeting and conference activity on CR in your country in the period 2005–2007 (ad-hoc professional educational and scientific activity).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Please list the national educational materials (text books, compendium etc.) on CR that are most used/useful in your country.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Are there any specific accreditation systems for the staff delivering CR services in your country?</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Within the questions on professional education and accreditation, the answers were differentiated according to the multidisciplinary healthcare professionals involved in CR: cardiologists, nurses, physiotherapists and others.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711398847"><title>Programme accreditation and clinical databases</title>
<p>In the ECRIS survey, we included the following questions on programme accreditation and clinical databases:
<list id="list2-1741826711398847" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Does your country have any forms of CR programme accreditation?</p></list-item>

</list></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711398847"><title>Study sample</title>
<p>Leaders of national organizations and working groups concerning CR in European countries were identified. For countries without specific national CR organizations, we used a number of approaches including key national informant identification by committee members of EACPR and by writing to the national societies as listed by the ESC. A total number of 39 countries were contacted.</p>
<p>The survey was sent through the European Heart House, the coordinating centre of the ESC, in November 2007, with reminders in 2008. A total of 28 European countries completed the questionnaire (response rate 72%). The participating and nonparticipating patients are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1741826711398847">Figure 2</xref>.

<p>Among the 16 European countries with national guidelines on CR, nine included professional skills and education as a part of the guidelines; thus, 32% of the European countries had guidelines on the skills of professionals in CR. National guidelines varied in addressing specific professions within the rehabilitation setting; only the guidelines of Ireland and Czech Republic listed cardiologists, nurses, physiotherapists and others (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711398847">Table 1a</xref>). In 17 (61%) of the participating countries, formal educational programmes were established for CR professionals. There were variations according to which professionals could undertake the educational programmes. France, Lithuania, Luxemburg and Ireland all had programmes or courses that could be undertaken by cardiologists, nurses and physiotherapists whereas other countries had formal educational programmes for either one or two of the cross-disciplinary groups involved. In 13 countries, there were formal educational programmes aimed at physiotherapists (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711398847">Table 1b</xref>). A total of 76 nationally used educational materials (textbooks and compendiums) were reported (median 2; range 0–10 per country). A total of 175 local, regional or national activities (median 3; range 0–30) were registered across the participating countries during 2005, 2006 and 2007 (47, 64 and 64 activities, respectively). Eight (29%) countries had established accreditation systems for professional skills; 25% had accreditation systems for physiotherapists, whereas two countries focused across cardiologists, nurses and physiotherapists (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711398847">Table 1c</xref>).

<p>Twelve (42%) countries had established programme accreditation systems; all were aimed at phase 2 CR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711398847">Table 1d</xref>). Ireland and Lithuania reported on programme accreditation for all three phases of CR. In Ireland, although accreditation standards had been included in the national cardiac-related strategies, accreditation was not formally enforced. By 2008, 10 (35%) countries had established clinical databases; six countries reported national databases, three countries reported national and regional databases, and one country reported on regional databases. Seven (25%) countries were planning to establish clinical databases within the coming year.</p>

<sec id="sec13-1741826711398847"><title>Statement of principal findings</title>
<p>The survey found that over half of the countries had formal educational programmes. At most, one in three countries included education in the national CR guidelines, and a similar proportion of countries have established professional accreditation systems. A large number of ad-hoc national and regional educational and scientific activities were undertaken across Europe (174 in 3 years). Few countries had established formal programme accreditation for all the three phases of CR. Databases were available in one-third of the countries; many others were in development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1741826711398847"><title>Guidelines on professional skills</title>
<p>Professional skills were included in half of the national guidelines/position articles, which is a substantial improvement compared with the 1997 survey in which professional skills were mentioned only sketchily.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711398847">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711398847">16</xref></sup> In the 1997 survey, there were, at best, general recommendations that professionals should have an appropriate licence to practise and that all CR team members should be familiar with resuscitation skills. Specialization in CR for physiotherapists in long-term CR (phase 3) was also recommended.</p>
<p>In this survey, there was a higher availability of educational activities in the economically more advanced countries, but there was no difference in the availability of guidelines or accreditation systems. This suggests that despite access to professional educational activities, a particular impetus, not necessarily linked to the level of national resources, is needed to advance formalized systems supporting CR. There may be a role for broader groups such as the EACPR in supporting national groups to establish robust systems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1741826711398847"><title>Professional education</title>
<p>More than half of the European countries had developed formal educational programmes. Furthermore, many ad-hoc CR-related meetings and conference activities take place across Europe. The 1997 survey did not cover distribution of professional education throughout Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711398847">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711398847">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the last 2 years, ongoing training courses on the aspects of CR have been promoted at the European level by the EACPR. The ESC has launched an e-learning system which will be regularly developed and updated. The ESC core syllabus and core curriculum have been revised, encompassing a major revision on prevention and rehabilitation. These activities, together with a strengthened national effort, will hopefully contribute in building CR skills across Europe. Furthermore, a European parallel of the American competence and Training Statement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711398847">18</xref></sup> could support the process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1741826711398847"><title>Professional and programme accreditation and clinical databases</title>
<p>Accreditation can be aimed at the skills of professionals or at a programme as a whole. Both levels contribute to the quality of CR. Although only a quarter of the European countries had developed accreditation systems aimed at professionals, programme accreditation was somewhat more widespread with over a third having programme accreditation systems. However, few countries have accreditation systems aimed at the cross-disciplinary professional groups.</p>
<p>Clinical databases were underdeveloped. These are an important source of continuous monitoring and the quality assurance of CR programmes in the individual patient and at a programme level. Developing national clinical databases can be a strategy to promote programme accreditation during the coming years. The role of the EACPR European Database in the CR project in providing a common platform for the countries or centres to enter data in a common minimum dataset format can be one important catalyst in promoting quality assurance for CR across Europe.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1741826711398847"><title>Strengths and weaknesses of the study</title>
<p>The survey and results have limitations. The response rate is high, at 72%, but nonetheless incomplete. We have no direct information on CR services and neither education, accreditation or database information in the nonpartici-pating countries. From the EuroAspire III survey,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711398847">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711398847">20</xref></sup> we have been able to stipulate the CR coverage in four of the nonparticipating countries. Latvia, Bulgaria and Turkey are in the lower third according to the CR attendance rate whereas Slovenia is among the countries with a high attendance rate. On the basis of these data, we assume that the CR coverage is in the same range or even lower than in the participating countries. Thus, the results are assumed to be representative for the European region.</p>
<p>Summary findings may provide an overly ‘positive’ view if the countries with more developed services replied - this would overestimate the level of professional development and database documentation of CR activities in Europe. On account of the lack of registries on CR-related activities, there may also be an underestimation, that is, when reporting on ongoing educational activities. The survey does, however, provide an important update on the information available – no European profile had been completed in over a decade.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec18-1741826711398847" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Ongoing professional education, programme accreditation and clinical databases documenting CR outcome assessment are priority methods to assure quality in CR service provision in Europe. Although there have been developments in the last decade, a lot more needs to be done to achieve equity across the European countries. Furthermore, the existing education/accreditation/database systems within each country are a very important tool to boost CR within each country. By focusing on the important elements of the ‘quality of care continuum’, it may be possible to assure the quality of CR delivery for the benefit of cardiac patients across Europe.</p>
