<p>Andrew Sayer’s <italic>Why Things Matter to People</italic> is in many ways a sequel to his excellent 2005 book, <italic>The Moral Significance of Class</italic>. In his earlier book, he argued that sociologists should extend the Bourdieusian model of class to include moral judgments as well as aesthetic and positional ones. With his latest intervention into social theory, Sayer generalizes this to argue that “people’s relation to the world is one of concern,” and that social theory as a whole needs to be modified to reflect that fact.</p>
<p>This book is bursting with original arguments, but despite being well written and well organized it is not what one might call linear. Interesting threads and nuances occur throughout as the discussion circles forward. This is not frustrating but stimulating as most (but not all) repetitions of key points contain new insights and reflections that shed light on the main themes. Sayer appears to be making three main claims. First, people do not just classify and cope with the world, they actually <italic>care</italic> about it and their relationship to it. Second, the oft-made distinction in social theory and philosophy between facts and values is fundamentally mistaken; moral judgments have everything to do with empirical, objective questions about flourishing and suffering. Third, because social arrangements can be evaluated according to the degree to which they promote flourishing and suffering, social science can and should be more “critical,” fearlessly pointing out where social arrangements are actually bad for people.</p>
<p>The main strength of this book is that Sayer is usually right. It is not hard to establish that people spend a lot of time thinking about how other people treat them and about how they and those they care about are doing in the world. It is also not difficult to show that (amazingly) most sociological theory does not take this seriously. Reiterating his claims from his 2005 book, Sayer correctly contends that “social struggles are not merely struggles for goods and power but about how to live, about what is a just, virtuous or good life and a good society” (p. 172). The book really stands out, however, in its skillful synthesis of many of the false dichotomies that crop up in discussions of morality and judgment. For example, rather than giving primacy to one or the other, Sayer acknowledges and works with a full range of cognitive modes, including emotions, habits, dispositions, discourse, and practical reason. He also shows in many ways how problematic (and ultimately indefensible) is the strong distinction between “is” and “ought.” He argues that values are not “beyond reason,” but that they are grounded in views of which practices lead to flourishing and suffering. Human beings have actual needs that are met more and less well by different sorts of relationships and institutions. He concludes that societies can—and should—critique each other’s cultural practices according to this standard.</p>
<p>Though I could not agree more with Sayer’s general arguments, my relation of concern to his book is that it works with a definition of morality that is too thin. On Sayer’s account, morality is only about harm and fairness (he generally uses the term “dignity”). But there is a well-established and well-known literature that shows that many people’s conceptions of morality extend beyond these sorts of concerns to include issues like loyalty, authority, and spiritual purity. Over the past two decades, Richard Shweder, Jonathan Haidt, and their collaborators have shown that both cross-culturally and within cultures, people differ in the extent to which they limit the definition of morality to the realm of harm and rights acknowledged by Sayer. Where Sayer does encounter those issues in his arguments, he quickly dismisses them as irrational or motivated by power. For instance, rather than try to understand how religious moralities might be grounded in ideas about flourishing, he claims (without argument) that churches often use morality as a “technique of domination” to “gain power over [their] members by making them feel guilty even where they have caused no harm” (p. 178). I found it ironic and disappointing that someone motivated to rescue morality from reductionist arguments about power uses the same arguments when the morality in question does not match his own.</p>
<p>These shortcomings could have been avoided by a greater engagement with the contemporary literature in moral psychology and moral philosophy, where these issues are currently at the forefront. His arguments about flourishing and suffering would also have benefitted from a greater engagement with the literature from positive psychology, where many scholars are making arguments similar to his own. If Sayer’s goal is to persuade other social scientists to take morality and issues of flourishing and suffering more seriously, my sense is that mobilizing arguments from contemporary psychology and philosophy will do more for his cause than appeals to Roy Bhaskar.</p>
<p>These reservations are hardly fatal to the book’s appeal and its overall importance. <italic>Why Things Matter to People</italic> deserves serious consideration from any sociologist who is working in the realm of morality, culture, social cognition, or “action theory” broadly defined. Indeed, no future research in these areas would be complete without a serious engagement with Sayer’s work.</p>
