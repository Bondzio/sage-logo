<p>Professor Teófilo F. Ruiz, currently a distinguished UCLA professor,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-097194581301600113">1</xref></sup> is a scholar of medieval Spain of an <italic>annaliste</italic> influence—something far from common in last century North American historiography—who honours us with an excellent work on royal visits or entries within the (limited albeit fruitful) framework of studies on festivities which has reached academic history from anthropology and the history of mentalities.</p>
<p>These thematic imports from other social sciences contribute to understanding the historiographic revolution of the twentieth century led by <italic>Annales</italic> and <italic>Past &amp; Present</italic>. Their main drive, let us remember, has been moving historians’ interest away from the ‘great figures’ and politics to focus on socio-economic issues, mentalities and common folk. Such main features of the new histories were not always taken into account by the new French historians and their followers when putting the innovative interdisciplinarity into practice.</p>
<p>Two are the virtues of <italic>A King Travels</italic> that we value the most, to say nothing of its documental rigour: (<italic>i</italic>) the effort to globally approach the analysis of royal travels going beyond the mere event; (<italic>ii</italic>) the joint analysis of the Late Middle Ages (more so the Crown of Castile than the Crown of Aragon) and the Early Modern period; change and continuity between the fifteenth and the sixteenth centuries that are seldom tackled because of the existing walls between academic disciplines. An inescapable connection, though, if we do not want the origin of state, social and mental modernity to come down to chronological conventions.</p>
<p>Recent Spanish literature on royal entries (which the author does not cite sufficiently) is of a local–regional nature and tends to be in the form of scholarly articles. Nevertheless, Teófilo F. Ruiz shares with it the traditional sources used: chronicles for the end of the Middle Ages and ‘travel accounts’ (and other royal festivities) for the start of the Modern Age. Our author adds, in the former case, biographies of Spanish knights and in the latter, Catalonian chronicles, all of them narrative sources of <italic>événemetielle</italic> orientation written by historiographers generally seeking to praise monarchic power, notably from the Catholic monarchs onwards. This allows us to know more about the mentality of the king, the court, its officials and nobles but less about the emotions and imaginary of the ordinary folk: the ultimate recipient of the solemn ceremonies of monarchy at this essential milestone in the formation of the modern state in Spain.</p>
<p>A continuation of the magnificent work by Professor Ruiz would therefore be welcome with wider sources and approaches. A historiographic approach with a true global ambition should contrast and complement ‘top-down’ history with ‘bottom-up’ history by combining political history with social history and history of mentalities, narrative documents with archive documents, written sources with oral sources. References may even be sought in municipal, notarial and judicial minutes and proceedings where the king is seldom mentioned but when mentioned outside the ceremonial paraphernalia the information usually proves invaluable for the social historian of mentalities.</p>
<p>To what extent the towns and the people who are visited by the king experience the festivity as told in the chronicles? What could be the contribution of the rites and pomp of the powerful to our knowledge of the variable, collective image of the king and the monarchy at a time of great historical change?</p>
<p>These questions lead us to add to our virtual list of heuristic absences the literary and iconographic sources that are so suited to look into the collective imaginary as regards the king, in the double sense of image and invented reality, outside the elitist, courtly, aristocratic and urban circles.</p>
<p>In sum, an inviting book for researching into the real and imaginary but always diverse and difficult relation between Castilian and Spanish kings and their subjects starting with the plurality of the medieval crowns and kingdoms to reach the Absolutist Bourbon state.</p>
