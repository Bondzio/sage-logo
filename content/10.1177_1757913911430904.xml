<p>Cannon to right of them. Cannon to left of them. Into the valley of Death rode the four hundred.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This was the famous Charge of the Public Health Brigade in a mass letter to <italic>The Telegraph</italic> expressing concerns about the NHS Bill and calling for its withdrawal, just ahead of the Lord’s debate back in October.</p>
<p>It was a brave and glorious moment in public health history. Brave because many of the 400 or so public health experts who put their names to the letter also put their careers on the line. Stories have emerged of hapless directors of public health being hauled over the coals for insubordination – some being brutally stripped of their rank or hideously reconfigured.</p>
<p>Glorious because, although the Bill survived and continued inexorably on its way, the number of times the words ‘health protection’ and ‘health improvement’ and ‘joint strategic needs assessment’ were heard ringing round the venerable red-benched chamber broke all known records. Never before had so many noble lords expounded so knowledgably on the nuances and niceties of public health. For two head-spinning days our humble profession was the talk of the highest talking shop in the land.</p>
<p>And it was by no means a foolhardy and futile gesture. This wasn’t mere light cavalry – there were some pretty heavy guns on that impressive list of signatories – and ministers were truly shaken. The sleeping giant that was public health had risen up and rudely rattled the Government’s cage. Indeed the repercussions are still echoing round the ever more empty corridors of the Department of Health as we speak.</p>
<p>Looking back now, what was most interesting about the Great Public Health Charge was the way it apparently came from nowhere, suddenly, without warning, and rapidly went viral. It was the closest thing I’ve seen to a public health flash-mob in action. And also the fact that representatives of the main public health bodies were notably absent. Indeed it was partly triggered by a feeling of frustration born of the impression that the public health community was doing nothing to challenge the Bill and just letting it all happen – an impression fuelled by a hard-hitting piece by <italic>Lancet</italic> editor Richard Horton, criticising in particular the Faculty of Public Health (FPH).</p>
<p>In fact, throughout the autumn, a great deal of lobbying by all the main public health stakeholders had been going on behind the scenes: mass-petitioning of MPs; buttonholing of various peers; submitting statements to select committees; tossing ideas into the Transition Team and the Future Forum. And athough things might have seemed rather quiet on the outside, the pressure on the inside was (and still is) forceful and sustained.</p>
<p>The trouble with behind-the-scenes lobbying is that it can all too easily be sidelined and ignored, however skilfully and cogently applied. Plus it has the inbuilt snag of being invisible to the world at large – which of course is precisely why it gains so little external credit and why it can so easily be sidelined and ignored. The stuff that really gets ministers jumping is the stuff that gets onto the front pages – and this is what the plucky 400 certainly managed to achieve in some style, although to what ultimate effect remains in doubt.</p>
<p>Anyway, here we are in the New Year with just over 12 months to go, and we still haven’t got the full picture. It’s like painting-by-numbers with half the numbers missing. How much longer can we wait? The frustration’s bubbling up again. I feel another flash-mob coming on. Forward the Public Health Brigade. Lower your lances. Charge!</p>
