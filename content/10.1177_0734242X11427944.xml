<abstract>
<p>This paper describes the business model of municipally-owned MSW (municipal solid waste) companies in Sweden. A comparative study of two of these companies shows that they combine three types of activities: public service activities that collect solid waste from households, commercial establishments, and industry; processing activities that transform this waste; and marketing activities that enable products and recycled material to re-enter the economy. The historical success of the two companies rests on their ability to create value by combining these three distinct yet mutually dependent types of activities. However, an ongoing legal controversy may develop into a threat to this business model and to the entire organization of Swedish waste management.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Municipal solid waste (MSW) management companies that are owned by one or more municipalities are the cornerstones of the Swedish waste management system. They are responsible for most of the post-collection treatment of household waste and also handle a significant proportion of commercial and industrial waste. However, so little is known about their organizational rationale that most often it remains ’black-boxed‘ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X11427944">Latour, 2005</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0734242X11427944">Thomasson, 2009</xref>). To understand the Swedish waste handling system, and its critical contribution to sustainable urban development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X11427944">Johnson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X11427944">Scheinberg et al., 2010</xref>), it is beneficial to understand the business logic of these companies.</p>
<p>Addressing this need, this article describes the business model of two influential Swedish municipally-owned MSW companies. The notion of a business model expresses the business logic of an organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11427944">Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2005</xref>). It tells how the pieces of a business fit together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X11427944">Magretta, 2002</xref>) and describes in particular how a company generates revenues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11427944">Plé et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0734242X11427944">
<title>Rights and constraints of municipally-owned MSW companies</title>
<p>Sweden deregulated the treatment of commercial and industrial waste in 2000, and of hazardous waste in 2007. With the exception of waste that falls under the principle of the extended producers’ responsibility scheme introduced in 1994 (newsprint, packaging, electrical and electronic equipment, tyres, vehicles), the collection and treatment of household waste and comparable waste from other sources are the responsibility of municipalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X11427944">SFS 1998:808</xref>). Most municipalities handle this responsibility by owning or contracting municipally-owned MSW companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11427944">Avfall Sverige, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>These companies manoeuvre in a heavily regulated environment. Because of their potentially significant environmental impact, the companies operate per the terms of environmental permits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X11427944">SFS 1998:808</xref>). These permits are precise. For example, they set maxima for how many tonnes of waste that can transit through any given facility, be incinerated or brought to landfill. Permits also regulate gas emissions, leachate, or transportation to and from the waste management facilities. However, permits are not only constraining. They are also social licences to operate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X11427944">Azapagic, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X11427944">McCorquodale, 2009</xref>) that certify, among other things, an environmental competence. In this way, environmental permits equal competitive advantages for the permitted company as they allow for activities that not all competitors can do, for example, operate an incineration plant or run a landfill.</p>
<p>Another consequence of the Swedish legislation on waste is that MSW companies enjoy a monopoly on household waste within the jurisdiction of the municipalities that own them. This monopoly concerns only household waste and comparable waste from other sources. It is only valid in accordance with the legislation of the municipalities that own the company. Other services, for example, the treatment of waste from commercial or industrial establishments, are gained in competition with other waste management companies, either privately or municipally-owned. A municipal solid waste management company can process the waste that originates from another municipality, but only if it has won the tendering process that the other municipality organizes in accordance with the Swedish legislation on public procurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X11427944">SFS 2007:1091</xref>).</p>
<p>Municipally-owned companies are also subjected to political control. The companies operate under so-called owners’ directives (<italic>ägardirektiv</italic>) that define company objectives. Their board is composed of politically appointed members. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0734242X11427944">Thomasson (2009)</xref> shows, a change in the political majority in municipal owners can have profound strategic implications for municipally-owned MSW companies. New board members can challenge the very idea that municipalities should own such a company, and can impose strategic options that have more to do with political ideology than with the operation and rationale of the company. The fact that municipalities are both owners and customers of their MSW companies determines these companies’ governance.</p>
<p>Finally, municipally-owned MSW companies are subjected to strict pricing practices, even if only a few fully respect the existing legislation that the confederation of Swedish enterprise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11427944">Persson, 2007</xref>) demands. They have to follow the so-called prime cost price and may not levy charges exceeding the cost of the services or utilities that they provide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X11427944">SFS 1991:900</xref>). Neither are they allowed to compete by operating at a loss. Practices of cross subsidising competitive activities with resources from regulated activities are strictly forbidden and something carefully monitored by municipal owners, competitors and competition authorities alike. In practice, municipally-owned MSW companies have to design their accounting systems to distinguish between the costs and revenues from the two kinds of activities.</p>
<p>Taken together, the operations of Swedish municipally-owned MSW companies are embedded in a complex mix of rights and constraints outside of which their operational mode cannot be understood.</p>

<title>Two case studies</title>
<p>Two companies have been selected for case studies: NSR (<italic>Nordvästra Skånes Renhållnings AB</italic>, in translation: Northwest Scania Recycling Company, Ltd) and SYSAV (<italic>Sydskånes avfallsaktiebolag</italic>, in translation: South Scania Waste Company, Ltd).</p>
<p>The rationale behind this choice is that NSR and SYSAV represent a variety of similarities and differences. Among the similarities, both companies are owned by a consortium of municipalities. They own their processing facilities and combine various treatment methods to manage a broad range of waste categories. They show a positive economic result and a strong commitment to minimize landfilling, e.g., NSR landfills less than 2% and SYSAV landfills 4% of the waste that they process, incinerator ashes not included. (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X11427944">Table 1</xref> for key figures).</p>

<p>However, NSR and SYSAV also represent different approaches to waste management: NSR has focused on biological processing and SYSAV on waste-to-energy methods. The proportion of waste that is incinerated is nearly inverted between the two: 18% at NSR and 69% at SYSAV. This means that NSR is a major biogas producer whereas SYSAV is a large district heating producer. It also means that SYSAV is more capital intensive than NSR, as illustrated by the fact that SYSAV’s total balance sheet is four times larger than NSR’s where turnovers are in a relationship of only two to one.</p>
<p>The fieldwork for these two case studies has followed a classic design of qualitative studies. Data collection has involved meetings (approximately 10), semi-structured interviews (approximately 10), informal discussions, on-site observations, and document analyses. Interviews have been transcribed and processed together with other texts in a conventional manual manner.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0734242X11427944">
<title>The activities of municipally-owned MSW companies</title>
<p>Basically, the operations of NSR and SYSAV combine three distinct although mutually dependent types of activities: <italic>public service activities, processing activities</italic> and <italic>marketing activities</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section5-0734242X11427944">
<title>Public service activities</title>
<p>Like private counterparts elsewhere, such as Remondis in Germany, Republic in the USA, or Sita in France, municipally-owned NSR and SYSAV characterize waste management as a <italic>service</italic> activity. It is a service activity in the everyday sense of the term ‘service’: something done for the benefit or at the command of another, or an effort for human welfare or betterment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0734242X11427944">Webster and Gove, 1971</xref>). Waste management is also a service in the technical sense of the term as used in service management literature. How NSR and SYSAV managers view their activities corresponds to the definition of services given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X11427944">Grönroos (2000</xref>, p. 48): ’processes consisting of a series of activities where a number of different types of resources are used in direct interaction with a customer, so that a solution is found to a customer’s problem’. Likewise, their view is congruent with the suggestion by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734242X11427944">Vargo and Lush (2004)</xref> to understand service as the application of competences (knowledge and skills) by one entity for the benefit of another.</p>
<p>More specifically, their mission is one of <italic>public</italic> service. Swedish municipal companies such as NSR and SYSAV are legally allowed to make a profit, but this is not their raison d’être. As their owner’s manual directs, they have a two-dimensional mission of serving the public good.</p>
<p>The first and most important of these dimensions is to enable each municipal owner to manage solid household waste within its own jurisdiction in an environmentally responsible way. NSR and SYSAV offer this service to their municipal owners in exchange for waste management fees that are paid by the households – the single largest share of the companies’ income (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X11427944">Table 1</xref>). The levels of their waste management fees are not set on a market but set administratively by municipalities after consultation with the companies. Following the cost price principle, fee levels are based on the actual cost of managing household waste in each municipality.</p>
<p>The second dimension of the public service mission of municipally-owned MSW companies is to offer a competitive waste management alternative to local enterprises. According to their owners’ directives, SYSAV shall provide attractive prices for others than its municipal owners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734242X11427944">SYSAV Styrelsen, 2010</xref>, p. 2); likewise, NSR shall offer effective waste and environmental management solutions for local businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11427944">Helsingborg Stad, 2005</xref>). NSR and SYSAV generate waste management income from taking in and processing industrial waste, which is a deregulated activity. When they have waste treatment capacity available, NSR and SYSAV bid for public tenders issued by other municipalities for the treatment of their household waste. For example, NSR processes the biological waste of a neighbouring municipality that does not own processing facilities, and for a few years, SYSAV has been incinerating parts of NSR’s household and industrial waste. Occasionally, these bids are international, and SYSAV has started to import waste for combustion in their incineration plant, for example, from Norway.</p>
<p>NSR and SYSAV have also taken on a public service role of educating people on waste. Outdoor poster campaigns and sponsoring visits to the facilities for schoolchildren are forms of public service that build awareness for the environmental importance of processing and recycling waste in lieu of disposal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0734242X11427944">
<title>Processing activities</title>
<p>SYSAV and NSR share the ambition of minimizing landfilling, which is also Sweden’s national goal. But the two companies have developed dedicated facilities, selective technical skills and fixed commercial channels to achieve this goal by different means.</p>
<p>SYSAV has concentrated on energy production through thermal processes. The company’s main processing activities rest on two older hot water boilers that produce district heating and two more recent steam boilers that generate both district heating and electricity. However, SYSAV also operates units that retrieve metal from bottom ashes and a pre-treatment unit for bio-fuel production. In addition, SYSAV has installations for the biological treatment of contaminated soil, local treatment of leachate, garden waste composting and wood chip production for selling to external customers.</p>
<p>In contradistinction, NSR has prioritized energy generation from biogas fermentation. NSR has turned its facilities into logistic platforms where a whole range of waste flows are separated, sometimes in an artisanal way, by NSR itself or by contracted private entrepreneurs. The single most important processing unit of this platform is a biogas production unit, but there are many other processing units for specific material flows. Recently, NSR has constructed one of the largest facilities in Europe for purifying landfill gas to motor fuel quality. In another new installation, biogas is liquefied and compressed to facilitate long-distance transportation. NSR has also created a market for wood chips sold as fuel to factories and heating plants, and they have also built a woodchip burning facility on their premises to cover their own internal energy needs.</p>
<p>Over time, NSR and SYSAV have created for themselves narrow path-dependencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X11427944">Schreyögg and Sydow, 2010</xref>), but presently seem to be considering other waste management paths. A municipal power company is currently completing an incineration plant on NSR’s main site, and SYSAV is considering building a biogas production capacity of its own. In fact, both companies aim to develop a full-range waste processing capacity to provide their municipal owners with integrated municipal waste management service, with the risk of creating a regional over-capacity in waste treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0734242X11427944">
<title>Marketing activities</title>
<p>Effective waste management does not end with processing. If NSR and SYSAV are to fulfil their public service missions, they need to find ways for the output of their processing activities to re-enter the economic system as materials for the generation of new goods and services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11427944">O’Brien, 1999</xref>). Rag, scrap and junk collectors returning from the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X11427944">Strasser, 1999</xref>) might be surprised by the volume and types of waste processed, but they would immediately recognize the rationale of facilitating the reintroduction of waste into the economy. This rationale requires expertise in the marketing of recycled materials in competition with virgin materials. Marketing is to be understood in the original and literal sense of the term: the activity of bringing things into markets. This includes market research, product development, service innovation, pricing, market communication, personal selling and distribution, but it is not limited to any of those activities.</p>
<p>Both companies have devised systematic strategies to develop markets for their outputs. Relying on an industrial logic of large investment and growth, SYSAV has entered long-term sales agreements with a major private power producer for its production of heat, and NSR has a similar agreement with a municipal power company for the biogas it produces. Moreover, NSR markets various types of post-consumer plastics and paper in Sweden and abroad, whereas SYSAV sells electricity on the Nordic electricity spot market and scrap metal to European and Asian ironworks. In addition, NSR and SYSAV sell waste management services to the material companies that run the Swedish producer responsibility system, for example pre-treating and disassembling electronic equipment.</p>
<p>Market-based activities are often undertaken in collaboration with private companies that NSR and SYSAV contract or co-own. Patterns of collaboration can change, though, and partners can become competitors. NSR has seen a long-time contractor, specializing in the collection of industrial waste, start waste processing facilities of its own in the wake of the 2001 deregulation of industrial waste processing. This new competition resulted in an important diminution of NSR’s access to industrial waste, and entailed a drastic decrease of its waste processing volume and turnover, ultimately prompting a downsizing and reorganization of the company.</p>
<p>NSR and SYSAV managers describe how they think of conversion possibilities and marketing opportunities as two that need one another to be meaningful. One of SYSAV’s top managers takes pride in the fact that his company has always thought ‘economically’ rather than ‘ideologically’. Correspondingly, one of NSR’s top managers points out that there is such income potential in some kinds of waste that it might make economic sense for waste management companies to pay for waste (instead of charging a tip fee) if they can find ways to transform this into a product that they can sell at a premium. Matching waste management processes with markets to enhance marketability is one of the core challenges at these case study companies.</p>
<p>Moreover, finding reuses for waste serves the social and environmental objectives of NSR and SYSAV. Marketing activities serve to limit the amount of waste sent to landfill and reduce the use of virgin materials or non-renewable energy sources.</p>

<title>The business model of municipally-owned MSW companies</title>
<p>The business model of municipally-owned MSW companies such as NSR and SYSAV can be described as articulating three interrelated value creating activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X11427944">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<list id="list1-0734242X11427944" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>First, they have a <italic>public service mission</italic> to organize a co-creation of value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X11427944">Lusch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X11427944">Ramirez 1999</xref>) between authorities who are legally responsible to manage waste and those in need of getting rid of waste while also protecting public health and the environment for future generations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Second, they have developed <italic>processing activities</italic> that not only organize the disposal of waste in a safe, economically efficient and environmentally sustainable way, but also transform as much waste as possible into materials and/or products with a potential economic and environmental value. Even landfills participate in the production of value through the production of biogas that can be sold as fuel.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Third, they organize <italic>marketing activities</italic> that invent ways to insert the output of their processing activities into the circuit of production and consumption, thereby realizing the economic value potential of this output. However, municipally-owned MSW companies do not see marketing activities as ends in themselves. They consider these activities as some of the means to create the social, environmental and economic values of their public service mission.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>These three core activities stand for different combinations of financial and material inflows and outflows. Public service activities represent both waste and financial inflows; processing activities keep material circulating within the organization, but at a cost that corresponds to financial outflows; finally, marketing activities result in material outflows and financial inflows. Balancing and managing the interdependency of these inflows and outflows of money and material is a critical condition to the successful multidimensional value creation of municipally-owned MSW companies.</p>
<sec id="section9-0734242X11427944">
<title>A legal controversy</title>
<p>A current legal controversy might threaten the business model of municipal waste management companies such as NSR and SYSAV. This controversy sets municipally-owned MSW companies and the Swedish Government against private waste management companies and the European Commission. At its core is the question of how large a share of income municipally-owned MSW companies can make from commercial activities without losing their monopolistic right to collect and process household waste within the geographical jurisdiction of their municipal owners.</p>
<p>Referring to the Teckal case (C-107/98; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11427944">European Court of Justice, 1998</xref>), the Carbotermo case (C-340/04; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11427944">European Court of Justice, 2006</xref>), and the Swedish legislation on public tendering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X11427944">SFS 2007:1091</xref>), the European Commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11427944">Europeiska kommissionen, 2010</xref>) argues in a reasoned opinion that municipalities must procure waste management services via a public tender process unless two conditions are met. The first of these is that municipally-owned companies must derive only a marginal share of their income from customers other than their municipal owners (activity criterion), and the second is that these municipal owners must exercise a degree of control over these companies that is equivalent to what it exercises over its own departments (control criterion). The notion of marginal share is not quantified, but there is a broad understanding that it is less than the 20% limit applicable to public procurements in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X11427944">European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>NSR and SYSAV are explicitly referred to by the European Commission in its reasoned opinion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11427944">Europeiska kommissionen, 2010</xref>) [It should be noted is that the authors had designed their research project around these two companies before the intervention of the European Commission.]. When the controversy started, NSR declared in its annual report that 73% of its income was from municipal services and 27% from commercial activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11427944">NSR, 2009</xref>), and SYSAV declared 52% of its income related to household waste operations and 48% to industry-related operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X11427944">SYSAV, 2009</xref>). For the European Commission, this meant that neither NSR nor SYSAV fulfilled the activity criterion as they are more than incidentally active in the overall waste market and derive more than a marginal share of their income from customers other than their owners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11427944">Europeiska kommissionen, 2010</xref>). To meet the European Commission’s critique, NSR and SYSAV have taken drastic measures to lower their share of commercial activities incomes. Some of these measures are accounting-based. Both companies now consider all sales of energy and material as pertaining to their public service mission of taking care of waste and therefore as income made on behalf of their municipal owners. This redefinition of their accounting model only has a decisive impact on how large a share of income NSR and SYSAV consider making with others than their municipal owners. Other measures are operations-based. NSR and SYSAV are taking over the planning and billing of waste services to households from their owning municipalities. SYSAV is even planning to take over the physical collection of waste from its municipal owners that have so far managed this activity themselves and not contracted it out. NSR has contracted out several waste management processes that were previously managed in-house.</p>
<p>As a result, SYSAV plans to decrease its turnover from private customers to 11% by 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734242X11427944">SYSAV, 2010</xref>) and NSR to 8% by 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X11427944">Setterlid, 2010</xref>). Both companies expect this to meet the Commission’s demands, but it is not certain that the Commission will accept Sweden’s view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11427944">Regeringskansliet – Utrikesdepartementet, 2010</xref>) that NSR and SYSAV are now fulfilling the activity criterion. The controversy remains open.</p>
<p>The business model presented in this article illustrates that this legal controversy affects more than the marketing activities of municipally-owned MSW companies. Depending on the outcome, it may constrain their entire business practices. Already today, managers at NSR and SYSAV mention that they refrain from expansive commercial strategies to make sure that their company remains eligible to direct attribution of contracts from their municipal owners. A historical strength of Swedish municipally-owned MSW companies has been to be proactive and innovative in developing waste transformation processes that match markets and vice versa. Legislation that would arbitrarily limit the income they are permitted to generate from customers other than their municipal owners would compromise the capacity of these companies to maintain their innovative practices.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Swedish municipally-owned MSW companies bundle processing activities back to back with both public service activities and marketing activities. Impairing or dismantling the dynamic between these activities would seriously impede their capacity to create social, environmental and economic value. This capacity is pivotal for the Swedish waste management system. The pending legal decision described above is therefore a decisive challenge to the whole organization of Swedish waste management as it is known today.</p>
