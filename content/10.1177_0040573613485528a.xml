<p><italic>Miserere Mei: The Penitential Psalms in Late Medieval and Early Modern England</italic></p>
<p>Clare Costley King’oo</p>
<p>Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 2012. 283 pp. $38.00</p>
<p>Clare Costley King’oo is Associate Professor of English at the University of Connecticut. Her book, <italic>Miserere Mei</italic>, explores the status and history of Psalms 6, 32, 38, 51, 102, 130, and 143 (as numbered in English Bibles) in the late medieval and early modern periods. The subtitle reflects her interest in the Psalms as religious literature of the English-speaking world in the periods studied. On the face of it, this work would seem of use primarily to students of English literature and religious history of these periods. The author’s engaging style and nuanced discussion, however, make the book quite accessible and important for a much broader audience. Among those who will benefit from <italic>Miserere Mei</italic> are: those interested in the Psalms and the history of their interpretation, students of biblical narratives about David and the artistic portrayal of David, and students interested in the Reformation and the changes Protestants made to the Sacraments.</p>
<p>King’oo makes three principle points about the penitential psalms. First, she observes that this grouping of psalms proved remarkably resilient and was used widely in early Protestant communities even though the “seven psalms” were tied closely to the sacrament of penance, which the Reformers rejected. Second, the penitential psalms not only survived as a distinct group of psalms in England after the Reformation, but they came to be used in a more divergent way: for personal devotion, in prayers for the dead, and as literary expressions. Third, in the period being explored, the “seven psalms” were associated more and more with sexual immorality. Therefore, Psalm 51, and David’s sin with Bathsheba, came to represent the entire grouping.</p>
<p>The author develops her discussion in an introduction, five main chapters, and an afterword that reflects on the method and experience of researching the book. In the introduction King’oo clarifies that the penitential psalms as a group may be traced to the sixth century <sc>ce</sc>, mentioned first in Cassiodorus’ exposition of the Psalms (4). Although the seven psalms have divergent content, they held together for centuries because they were read according to what King’oo rightly calls “penitential hermeneutics,” a set of assumptions that these psalms are primarily confessions of sin and pleas to God for forgiveness (8–12).</p>
<p>In chapter 1, King’oo traces the artistic representation of the penitential psalms in the centuries in question. She demonstrates through the illustrations of these seven psalms how sin was “sexualized” in the wake of the Reformation (41–52). Chapters 2 and 3 show how the Reformers used the penitential psalms in arguments against penance, while at the same time they retained this grouping as part of a larger argument for the absolute necessity of repentance. In the dominant presentations of penitence, David emerged as the exemplar with Psalm 51 as the best example of his penitential prayer. The final two chapters show how the use of the penitential psalms among Protestants expanded as they became material for social commentary and personal piety.</p>
<p>This is a fascinating and well-researched study, and it deserves to be widely read. King’oo’s work will undoubtedly inspire other, related efforts to understand the influence of these psalms (and other, similarly important biblical texts). For example, her first chapter raises questions about the relationship between the artistic portrayal of David’s affair with Bathsheba and the English clergy’s opposition to Henry VIII’s extra-marital affairs. In addition to the general association of sin with sex, is it also possible that the multiple images of David and Bathsheba in the Great Bible were intended to condemn the sin of Henry VIII? A minor quibble is that King’oo adopts different numbering systems of the penitential psalms depending on whether she is referring to the psalms as they appear in Greek and Latin or Hebrew. Since most readers will associate the penitential psalms with the Hebrew order on which most English translations are based, that numbering system would make the work more accessible to a broader audience. Nevertheless, King’oo skillfully opens for us a window to a world in which the penitential psalms occupied a primary place in religious devotion. The work is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the impact of those psalms on the English-speaking world.</p>
