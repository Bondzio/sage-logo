Serum IL-6 levels were elevated in 43 of 90 cases (47.7%), and 23 (25.5%) of 90 cases stained positively for IL-6 (<italic>P</italic> = .00265). The prognosis of patients with NSCLC who had positive immunohistochemical staining was significantly worse than that for those who had negative staining, by univariate analysis (<italic>P</italic> = .0027). Multivariate analysis indicated that tumor size, postoperative stage, and overexpression of IL-6 were independent prognostic factors. <italic>Conclusions</italic>. The expression of IL-6 in tumor correlated with the concentration of serum IL-6, tumor progression, and overall survival in patients with NSCLC.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cytokines may either regulate tumor growth or alter the antitumor immune response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911436274">1</xref></sup> Tumor growth and metastasis of human lung cancer may be regulated by a variety of cytokines. We have preliminarily investigated the mRNA expression of various cytokines (interleukin [IL]-2, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, tumor necrosis factor–α, and transforming growth factor–β) in supernatants of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and found that IL-6 is produced more frequently than other cytokines. We also reported that 53% of lung cancer cell lines produce IL-6 mRNA and protein. Although IL-6 itself does not influence tumor cell proliferation in vitro, an association between IL-6 expression and tumor proliferation was found in vivo in nude and SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911436274">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>IL-6, a phosphorylated glycoprotein containing 185 amino acids, is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in different physiological and pathophysiological processes, such as bone formation and inflammation. Recent findings suggest that IL-6 is associated with cachexia, ovarian cancer, pleural mesothelioma, prostate cancer, lung cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and other malignant diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911436274">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911436274"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911436274"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911436274"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896911436274"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896911436274">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this study, we analyzed serum levels of IL-6 and immunohistochemically stained, excised tissue samples of 90 patients with NSCLC to clarify the association of the expression of IL-6 in tumor tissues with released serum IL-6. The aims of the study were to identify the significance of IL-6 production and to determine whether the production of IL-6 influences long-term survival in NSCLC.</p>

<title>Patients and Tumor Samples</title>
<p>This study included 90 consecutive patients with primary NSCLC who underwent surgery in the Department of Thoracic Surgery at Chiba University Hospital (Chiba, Japan) between 2005 and 2007 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1066896911436274">Table 1</xref>). The mean age was 64 years (range, 27-81 years), 58 patients were male, and 32 were female. Histological type, pathological stage, and Tumor, Node, Metastases (TNM) classification were determined by using the criteria of the American Joint Committee on Cancer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911436274">9</xref></sup> the staging committees of the International Union Against Cancer, and the general rules for the clinical and pathological recording of lung carcinoma described by the Japan Lung Cancer Society.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911436274">10</xref></sup> The histological types included 50 adenocarcinomas, 31 squamous cell carcinomas, 5 large cell carcinomas, and 4 carcinoids. Among the patients, 46 had stage I A/B disease, 12 had stage II A/B disease, and 32 had stage III A/B disease; 4 patients with obstructive pneumonia on chest X ray were excluded from the study because of increased IL-6 by an inflammatory factor. None of the patients underwent preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The survival times were determined from the day of surgery. As controls, tissues from 6 pulmonary hamartoma cases and 4 thymoma cases were stained immunohistochemically for IL-6.</p>

<title>Blood Count and Biochemical Analyses</title>
<p>Peripheral blood samples were obtained from patients before surgery. Serum IL-6 levels were measured via a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay in a commercial laboratory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896911436274">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896911436274">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>White blood cell (WBC) count was determined by automated particle counters; C-reactive protein (CRP) was determined by Turbid metric immunoassay; carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was measured by microparticle enzyme immunoassay; and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC) and cytokeratin 19 fragment (CYFRA21-1) were measured by immunoradiometric assay within 24 hours after venipuncture, in our institution. The threshold detection level in serum was 4 pg/mL for IL-6, based on the analysis of the values obtained in 99 healthy volunteers (SRL Inc, Japan). Normal levels are 3900 to 9800/µL for WBC, below 0.2 mg/dL for CRP, below 5.0 ng/mL for CEA, below 1.5 ng/mL for SCC, and below 2.0 ng/mL for CYFRA 21-1, which was based on the analysis of the values in our institution.</p>

<sec id="section5-1066896911436274">
<title>IL-6 Immunohistochemistry in NSCLC Samples</title>
<p>We performed immunohistochemical staining for IL-6 with the CSA (Catalyzed Signal Amplification) system (DAKO JAPAN, Kyoto) for IL-6. Sections of tumors 4-µm thick were cut from tissue blocks, placed on glass slides, and exposed to xylene twice for 20 minutes each. Tissues were hydrated in decreasing concentrations of ethanol (100%, 90%, and 70% for 1 minute each) and rinsed in distilled water. Slides were heated at 95°C in Target Retrieval Solution (DAKO JAPAN, Kyoto) for 15 minutes. After the excess liquid was blotted off, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubating tissues in 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 20 minutes. Slides were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 minutes. Nonimmune swine serum was applied for 5 minute to reduce nonspecific background staining. The serum was drained, and goat polyclonal antihuman IL-6 antibody diluted 1:500 in 0.01 M PBS, pH 7.2 (DAKO JAPAN, Kyoto) was applied for 15 minutes at room temperature. Slides were then rinsed with PBS for 15 min; this wash step was performed between all incubations with primary and secondary antibodies and other labeling reagents. Biotin-labeled antigoat immunoglobulin antibody, diluted 1:500 in 0.01 M PBS, pH 7.2 (DAKO JAPAN, Kyoto) was added for 15 minutes at room temperature. The ABC reagent was then added for 15 minutes, followed by biotin-labeled tyramide and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Peroxidase substrate solution was added for 15 minutes, followed by diaminobenzidine solution to achieve specific staining. Finally, sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Without having any previous knowledge of each patient’s clinical and pathological data, 2 pathologist (KH) independently evaluated all slides. A score was established that corresponded to the sum of (I) the percentage of positive cells (0, negative; 1, &lt;25% positive cells; 2, 26% to 50% positive cells; and 3, &gt;50% positive cells) and (II) the staining intensity (0, negative; 1, weak; 2, moderate; and 3, high). The maximum sum of (I) + (II) was 6. Scores between 0 and 2 were regarded as negative and scores between 3 and 6 as positive.</p>

<sec id="section6-1066896911436274">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS statistical software program package (SPSS version 12.0 for Windows, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). The relation between the expression of IL-6 in tumor samples and clinical features was examined with the <italic>t</italic> test, the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, and the χ<sup>2</sup> test. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test, and the Cox proportional hazards regression model. The survival curves were estimated by means of the Kaplan-Meier method. The role of each prognostic variable and its effect on overall survival was tested in univariate analysis by means of the log-rank test. Their joint effect on overall survival was tested in multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model. <italic>P</italic> values of less than .05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Serum IL-6 Levels and Clinical Variables: Univariate Analyses</title>
<p>The level of IL-6 in the serum of NSCLC patients correlated with histology, T status, N status, and stage via univariate statistical analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1066896911436274">Table 1</xref>). The serum IL-6 level was above 4.0 pg/mL (the normal limit) in 42 of 90 cases (46.6%). The mean (standard deviation) serum IL-6 levels before surgery were 4.136 ± 5.755 pg/mL in stage IA or IB, 9.845 ± 8.550 pg/mL in stage IIA or IIB, 10.747 ± 15.812 pg/mL in stage IIIA or IIIB, and 2.760 ± 2.010 pg/mL in the control group. Significant differences were observed in serum IL-6 levels between stage I and stage II and III (<italic>P</italic> = .0127, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test), between T1 and T2 to T4 (<italic>P</italic> = .0500, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test), between N0 and N1 to N3 (<italic>P</italic> = .0204, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test), and between squamous cell cancer and non–squamous cell cancer (<italic>P</italic> = .0017, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test) groups.

<title>Univariate and Multivariate Analysis for Overall Survival</title>
<p>Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model was performed to determine whether postsurgical stage, tumor classification, regional lymph node classification, serum IL-6 level, and immunohistochemical staining for IL-6 were independent prognostic factors. We divided the multivariate analysis into 2 parts (multivariate analyses I and II) to prevent T status, N status, and postsurgical stage from affecting each other. Univariate analyses (log-rank test) showed that T status, N status, postsurgical stage, serum IL-6 level, and IL-6 expression were significant prognostic factors for survival (<italic>P</italic> = .0495, .0357, .0292, .0166, and .0027, respectively). No significant differences were found for age, sex, histology, and smoking index (<italic>P</italic> = .3958, .106, .729, and .133, respectively). After multivariate analysis with a Cox regression model, immunohistochemical expression of IL-6 (<italic>P</italic> = .0326), T status (<italic>P</italic> = .0417), and postsurgical stage (<italic>P</italic> = .0150) remained the most significant and independent prognostic factors for survival (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1066896911436274">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine with a wide range of biological activities. Several studies suggest that IL-6 influences the prognosis of many neoplastic diseases, such as ovarian cell carcinoma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911436274">4</xref></sup> renal cell carcinoma, and multiple myeloma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896911436274">13</xref></sup> as well as NSCLC. Renal carcinoma cells and cell lines have also been reported to express IL-6 mRNA and to produce IL-6 in supernatants, indicating that IL-6 is an autocrine growth factor for these cell lines. In patients with lung cancer, the presence of IL-6 in malignant pleural effusion has been described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896911436274">14</xref></sup>; furthermore, several lung cancer cell lines constitutively produce IL-6 in vitro.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911436274">2</xref></sup> Yamaji et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911436274">2</xref></sup> had reported that 53% of lung cancer cell lines produce IL-6 mRNA and protein, and an association between IL-6 expression and tumor proliferation with NSCLC cell lines was found in vivo in nude and SCID mice (although IL-6 itself does not influence tumor cell proliferation in vitro, as detailed in our last report).</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the immunohistochemical expression of IL-6 in excised tumor tissues and preoperative serum IL-6 levels in NSCLC patients who underwent surgery. We made several important findings about IL-6 in NSCLC. First, we found that positive immunohistochemical staining of tissues with an anti-IL-6 antibody correlated with the clinical features of T status, N status, and staging. Second, serum concentrations of IL-6 in NSCLC patients correlated with these clinical features as well. Furthermore, patients with NSCLC who overexpressed IL-6 had a poorer prognosis compared with those who had lower expression levels, both in the serum and the tumor tissue.</p>
<p>Some investigators have indicated that the serum concentration of IL-6 is elevated in approximately 40% of patients with NSCLC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911436274">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896911436274">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066896911436274">16</xref></sup> They suggested that elevated serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 may have prognostic value, being associated with a poorer prognosis in NSCLC, although they could not identify the site responsible for IL-6 production. We demonstrated a correlation between elevated serum IL-6 and overexpression of IL-6 in tumor tissues, and all patients with elevated serum IL-6 levels had normalized levels within 3 weeks after surgery (data not shown). Preoperative elevated serum IL-6 may be derived from tumor tissues in most patients with NSCLC.</p>
<p>Staining excised tumor tissues of NSCLC, we characterized the expression of IL-6 in the tumor tissue as well as other clinical parameters such as tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and pathological stage as prognostic factors. We found via univariate analysis that the expression of IL-6 correlates strongly with shorter survival and is predictive of poor prognosis. Moreover, IL-6 overexpression was closely associated with prognosis and was an independent prognostic factor according to multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Overexpression of IL-6 may be one of the most important prognostic factors in NSCLC. This is the first report to demonstrate the correlation of long-term survival and tumor tissue expression of IL-6 in NSCLC patients.</p>
<p>The mechanisms responsible for the correlation between the expression of IL-6 and poor prognosis still remain obscure. Strassmann et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911436274">3</xref></sup> reported that IL-6 might be responsible for the cachexic status associated with cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066896911436274">17</xref></sup> In patients with various tumor types,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1066896911436274">25</xref>,26</sup> including lung cancer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066896911436274">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066896911436274"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066896911436274"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066896911436274"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066896911436274">24</xref></sup> malnutrition was found to be related to an increased level of IL-6. IL-6 could play an important role leading to poor prognosis directly or indirectly. Saito and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1066896911436274">25</xref></sup> stressed that tumor-derived IL-6 induces an immune-mediated antitumor reaction and increases vascular permeability. In our last report, we demonstrated a marked correlation between IL-6 expression and tumor doubling time in vivo in nude and SCID mice but not BALB/c mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911436274">2</xref></sup> The striking difference between the in vivo and in vitro tumor proliferation rate of the IL-6-producing and nonproducing cell lines must reflect the significant relationship that exists between the host tissue and the tumor cells. Moreover, the different rates of tumor progression in vivo are not mediated by B-, T-, or NK-cell-mediated immune responses because the pattern of tumor growth of the 2 cell lines was almost the same in athymic nude mice and SCID mice. Further studies are required to clarify these issues.</p>
<p>In conclusion, elevated serum IL-6 is derived from overexpressed IL-6 in the tumor tissue itself in many cases in NSCLC. The expression of IL-6 in tumor tissues correlated with the concentration of serum IL-6, tumor progression, and overall survival in NSCLC. Overexpression of IL-6 may indicate poor prognosis in NSCLC, and the assay for IL-6 could be an adjunct tool to assess the tumor burden of NSCLC. Further biological and immunological studies are required to clarify the interaction between IL-6-producing lung cancer cells and the host-bearing NSCLC. An anti-IL-6 reagent could provide a novel therapeutic approach for patients with NSCLC who produce significant IL-6.</p>
