<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Psychotherapy is an integral part of the practice of psychiatry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212475326">1</xref></sup> There is a growing body of evidence that psychotherapy is efficacious as sole or adjunct treatment for a wide variety of psychiatric disorders including complex co-morbid disorders. The holistic biopsychosocial approach has been the new face of psychiatry treatment in the last few decades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212475326">2</xref></sup> For these reasons, psychotherapy has been widely recognised as a core competency of psychiatry training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212475326">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The recent growth in non-medical providers of psychotherapy could be attributed to cost-related factors and a perception amongst primary care providers that psychiatrists are not interested in, or as accessible for, psychotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212475326">3</xref></sup> However, the psychotherapy conducted by psychiatrists is unique by virtue of psychiatrists’ exposure to severe, complex and co-morbid conditions, clinical training and knowledge about psychological theories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212475326">4</xref></sup> In spite of this, there is evidence that psychotherapy is declining as part of the identity, skill set and training of psychiatrists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856212475326">5</xref></sup> This trend is well documented in the USA and reported in other countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212475326">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856212475326">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212475326">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Advanced training in psychotherapy (ATP) for psychiatrists is broad-based and involves general medicine, general psychiatry and psychological treatments. This enables the development of a distinctive set of skills and attitudes that can be utilised in treating patients and families or within multidisciplinary teams for analysing groups and systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856212475326">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the UK, ATP comprises three years at speciality training (ST) 4–6 level conducted by local deaneries through the schools of psychiatry. This training is offered in either cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy, or systemic therapy. The ATP in Australia and New Zealand (NZ) is open both to advanced trainees and consultant psychiatrists who wish to extend their training in this field. This two-year training is conducted by state or regional panels. The training is offered in CBT, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and family, couple and group therapy.</p>
<p>This is the first study to investigate trends in ATP among psychiatrists in UK, Australia and NZ. We studied the trends in ATP among psychiatry trainees and psychiatrists in the UK, Australia and NZ between 2005 and 2010 using recorded training data from Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych) and Royal Australian &amp; New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP).</p>
<p>The number of psychiatrists or trainees enrolled in ATP increased from 13 to 19 in Australia and NZ during 2005–2010, while numbers reduced from eight to five in the UK over the same period. Most of the training was done in London, Sydney and Melbourne. No data was available from the UK on the choice of specific psychotherapy streams. In Australia and NZ, psychodynamic psychotherapy was the most popular choice while those opting for CBT had gradually increased to equal the psychodynamic stream by 2010. Very few candidates chose the family therapy stream. The increased enrolment in Australia and NZ was mainly among advanced trainees and newly qualified consultant psychiatrists. Although the RCPsych decides the number of posts in psychotherapy available in the UK, the uptake (50%) and competition ratio (1.8) are among the lowest of all available fields of advanced training in psychiatry.</p>
<p>In the UK, interest in psychotherapy is declining among advanced and basic trainees.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856212475326">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212475326">7</xref></sup> There have been no similar studies on basic trainees in Australia and NZ. However, psychotherapy training in Australia and NZ is heavily mandated during basic training as supervised completion of specified psychotherapy cases is compulsory.</p>
<p>The contrasting trends between the UK and Australia and NZ could be partly explained by training opportunities in the UK being available only for trainees while in Australia and NZ, training is available for both trainees and consultant psychiatrists. The latter group’s interest may have increased during practice as specialists with the need for psychotherapy skills in providing holistic care became more apparent. RANZCP exams place a greater emphasis on psychotherapeutic formulation which in turn may foster a greater interest in psychotherapy amongst Australian and NZ trainees.</p>
<p>In Australia, psychiatrists have opportunities to practice psychotherapy in the private sector with some government-funded reimbursement, which may encourage them to obtain training in psychotherapy, whereas similar opportunities are limited in the UK. The National Health System in the UK has opted for psychotherapy provided by psychologists rather than by psychiatrists for several reasons, including monetary concerns. This may have contributed to a decline in the perceived need for psychiatrists to be trained in psychotherapy, leading to less availability of ATP posts.</p>
<p>In our quest to provide holistic care to patients, psychiatrists trained in psychotherapy who take the lead in training future generations of psychiatrists must not become a dying species. It is reassuring to see increasing trends in ATP in some regions, but diminishing rates in other areas are of concern. Further research into the benefits of psychotherapy as a therapeutic intervention may also have a role in increasing the popularity of this training, thus allowing the psychotherapeutically oriented psychiatrist to take their legitimate place alongside those considered the ‘real’ doctors.</p>
