<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Popliteal artery aneurysms (PAAs) account for approximately 70% of all peripheral aneurysms with an incidence estimated as less than 0.1%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574413475888">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574413475888">2</xref></sup> The goal of repair is to prevent the complications of arterial embolization, thrombosis, and, least commonly, rupture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574413475888">3</xref></sup> The indications for elective repair are supported by the literature with diameters greater than 2 cm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574413475888">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574413475888"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574413475888"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574413475888"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574413475888"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574413475888"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574413475888">10</xref></sup> Recently, the approach to repair these aneurysms has become a subject of debate, particularly with the increased utilization of endovascular techniques and the paucity of evidence-based data evaluating these procedures.</p>
<p>Despite the feasibility of endovascular repair of PAAs, there still remains considerable deliberation regarding the best treatment for PAAs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574413475888">6</xref></sup> The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the longitudinal outcomes for repair of popliteal aneurysms comparing open and endovascular approaches. We utilized large population-based database in order to examine outcomes after open and endovascular approaches to PAA based on mortality, morbidities readmission, and reinterventions.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1538574413475888">
<title>Data Sources</title>
<p>Data were collected from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR), and Carrier claim files from 2005 to 2007. The MedPAR is the Medicare inpatient database that includes demographic characteristics of hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries, source of admission and destination of discharge, principal and secondary diagnoses and procedures during hospitalization, and use of the hospital resources (length of stay [LOS] and total and specific charges for a variety of services). However, surgical procedures in this database are coded with the <italic>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification</italic> (<italic>ICD-9-CM</italic>) codes that are not very specific and do not allow identifying variations in surgical procedures. The latter is possible utilizing the more specific Current Procedural Terminology, fourth edition (CPT-4) codes that are presented in the carrier file with the date when the procedure was performed. We used unique patient identifiers in both files to merge them in 1 data set for the analysis and to follow-up patients after the initial procedure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1538574413475888">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>We identified all Medicare beneficiaries at age 65 years and older who were electively hospitalized with a diagnosis code of PAA (<italic>ICD-9-CM</italic> code 442.3 for principal diagnosis) and underwent aneurysm repair. To identify those undergoing open surgery (OPEN group) we used the CPT-4 codes 35151, 35556, 35566, 35583, 35587, 35656, and 35666; patients with endovascular surgery (ENDO group) were identified with the CPT-4 codes 34812, 37205, and 37207. To identify postoperative complications, we utilized the following <italic>ICD-9-CM</italic> diagnosis codes for secondary diagnoses: 997.1, 410.xx, and 427.5 for cardiac complications and myocardial infarction; 997.31, 997.39, 507.0, 512.1, 518.4, 518.5, 518.82, 480.x, 481, 482.xx, 483.x, 484.x, 485, and 486 for respiratory complications and pneumonia; 997.5, 584.x, and 593.81 for renal complications; 998.11 for hemorrhage complicating a procedure; 998.12 for hematoma complicating a procedure; and 996.62, 998.31, 998.32, 998.5x, and 999.3x for surgical infection. Using the appropriate CPT-4 codes, we identified the following secondary procedures: thrombolysis (37201 and 37202), embolectomy/thrombectomy (37184, 37185, 35302-35306, 34201, and 34203), and repeated angiogram (36140, 36200, 36245-36248, 75626, and 75630). Amputations in the lower extremities during 30 and 90 days after the popliteal aneurysm repair were identified utilizing CPT-4 codes 27590-27592, 27880-27882, 28800, 28805, 28810, 28820, and 28825. Comorbid diseases in observed patients were evaluated with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project comorbidity software, version 3.5, available at http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/comorbidity/comorbidity.jsp#download. We analyzed AHRQ comorbidity measures including congestive heart failure, hypertension, pulmonary circulation disease, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus with or without chronic complications, renal failure, and obesity.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The SAS 9.2 software (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) was utilized for data analysis and statistics. Differences between the groups were assessed by chi-square analysis for categorical variables by calculating odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) and by Student <italic>t</italic> test for continuous variables. In order to assure the reliability of the results of the univariate analysis, we run a multivariable stepwise logistic regression analysis where dichotomous-dependent variable was adjusted by patient’s demographic characteristics (age, gender, and race), type of surgical procedure, and the AHRQ comorbidity measures. Because values of hospital LOS and charges were not normally distributed and skewed to the right, we calculated their medians and compared them with the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Two-sided <italic>P</italic> ≤ .05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 2962 patients who met our inclusion criteria were identified. Demographic characteristics of these patients are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538574413475888">Table 1</xref>. The vast majority of the study patients underwent open PAA surgery (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0002) versus an endovascular PAA repair. Patients 65 to 79 years of age represented a larger proportion (68.3%) of the OPEN group than that of the ENDO group (56.7%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0002). The proportion of octogenarians was greater among patients undergoing an endovascular procedure (43.3% vs 31.7%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0002). Males predominated over females in both the groups. However, the percentage of males in the OPEN group (95.0%) was greater than in the ENDO group (90.9%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0002) while the proportion of females was greater in the ENDO group (5.0% vs 9.1%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0002). There were no statistically significant differences in racial structure between the population groups.</p>

<p>Logistic regression models were created including patient’s age, gender, race, and comorbidities as independent variables. We found that the probability of having endovascular procedure was greater in octogenarians compared to younger patients (OR = 1.6; 95%CI = 1.36-1.99; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). In addition, we found that the probability of having an endovascular procedure was greater in females compared to males (OR = 2.0; 95%CI = 1.39-2.79; <italic>P</italic> = .0001).</p>
<p>During the study period, from 2005 to 2007, the proportion of endovascular procedures significantly increased whereas the percentage of open surgery decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574413475888">Figure 1</xref>). We did not find significant differences between the 2 surgical groups in overall hospital mortality during the initial hospitalization as well as mortality at 30 and 90 days after initial discharge in both univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses. There were also no significant intergroup differences at 30- and 90-days rates of lower extremities amputations and hospital readmissions.</p>

<p>We computed the rates of various postoperative complications in both the groups. The overall complication rate in both the groups were similar (OPEN = 11.3%; ENDO = 9.3%; <italic>P</italic> = .17). However, individual complication rates varied. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574413475888">Figure 2</xref>, patients with open surgery had greater rates of cardiac and respiratory complications and postoperative infection whereas postoperative hematoma developed more frequently after endovascular repair of PAA. These findings were confirmed by the results of the multivariable logistic regression analysis. Patients who underwent open surgery were more likely than patients with endovascular procedure to have any studied postoperative complication during the index hospitalization (OR = 1.4; 95%CI = 1.03-1.96; <italic>P</italic> = .036) including cardiac (OR = 2.6; 95%CI = 1.04-6.64; <italic>P</italic> = .04) and respiratory complications (OR = 2.6; 95%CI = 1.16-5.71; <italic>P</italic> = .02) and postoperative infection (OR = 9.9; 95%CI = 1.36-71.91; <italic>P</italic> = .02).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Endovascular repair of PAAs, which was originally described over a decade ago,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574413475888">1</xref></sup> has led to the increased utilization of this technique for the treatment of popliteal aneurysms. There have been multiple publications evaluating the feasibility and safety of this procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574413475888">2</xref></sup>
<sup>, </sup>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574413475888">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574413475888">5</xref></sup> However, most these studies are underpowered without an adequate number of participants in order to establish any significant evidence-based practice for the optimal approach to PAA.</p>
<p>Our analysis reports a population-based outcome analysis for PAA repair, which is reflective of current practice and not limited to small individual series. Our data, representative of the US Medicare population, demonstrate a significant increase in the utilization of endovascular repair of PAAs across the United States during mid-portion of the first decade of the 21st century. Our results are parallel to the national trends for the treatment of lower extremity peripheral vascular disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574413475888">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574413475888"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574413475888">9</xref></sup> Goodney et al reported a 3-fold increase in endovascular interventions among the Medicare beneficiaries between 1996 and 2006. In addition, their data revealed that lower extremity bypass surgery had decreased by 42% within 10 years. Their findings of a national trend toward increased utilization of endovascular approaches corroborates our finding of an increase in endovascular PAA repair and decline in open PAA repair by 25% between 2005 and 2007.</p>
<p>Our analysis demonstrates no statistical difference in overall mortality between elective open and endovascular repair of PAAs. Both open and endovascular PAA repairs were associated with substantially low 30- and 90-day mortality rates. Johnson et al performed a retrospective analysis from 123 United States Veterans Affairs Medical Centers via their National Surgical Quality Improvement Program and drew similar conclusions showing surgical intervention for PAA is associated with low-operative morality after open repair. Despite the fact that 88% of these patients were American Society of Anesthesiologists Class 3 or 4, the 30-day mortality rate was only 1.4% with unadjusted patient survival at 92.6% at 1 year and 86.1% at 2 years. Our Medicare data, evaluating only elective repairs, showed a slightly lower mortality rate most likely attributed to Johnsons inclusion of emergent PAA repairs. Nonetheless, endovascular PAA repairs failed to show any mortality benefit at 30 and 90 days postoperatively over an elective open PAA repair portraying noninferiority to an open repair. Despite an increase in the utilization of endovascular PAA repairs, our data suggest that this approach offers no mortality benefit when compared to an open repair.</p>
<p>In addition to no mortality benefit, there was no statistical difference in overall in-hospital complication rate between open and endovascular PAA repairs (OPEN 11.31% vs ENDO 9.29%, <italic>P</italic> = .17). However, there were some striking differences in individual complications. Endovascular repair appeared to convey a benefit in minimizing postoperative cardiac, respiratory, and infectious complications with such complications occurring nearly 2:1 in the open PAA versus the endovascular group.</p>
<p>Nowygrod et al examined 2 large national data sets using <italic>International Classification of Disease, 9<sup>th</sup> Revision </italic>[<italic>ICD-9</italic>], diagnostic and procedural codes comparing trends in peripheral vascular surgery between 1998 and 2003.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574413475888">9</xref></sup> During this time, they found that an open approach for lower extremity revascularization was associated with a 3-fold increase in cardiac and respiratory complications. Another nationwide inpatient study using <italic>ICD-9</italic> codes in over 800 000 patients undergoing open lower extremity revascularization was associated with a significant increase in postoperative infection compared to an endovascular approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574413475888">3</xref></sup> These data support the current literature depicting that the rates of individual complications are less for endovascular approaches when compared to an open approach.</p>
<p>Despite offering a benefit with regard to cardiac, respiratory, and infectious postoperative complications, our analysis also found a significant increase in postoperative bleeding associated with the endovascular group. A study using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample data, for the years 2003 to 2007, identified a greater number of patient safety indicators (PSIs) with lower extremity endovascular .<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574413475888">10</xref></sup> These PSIs were primarily associated with increased number of postoperative bleeding complications in women and elderly individuals, which ultimately translated into increased cost of care.</p>
<p>Endovascular repair was associated with increased overall cost despite a higher length of hospital stay associated with an open repair. This trend in endovascular intervention associated with increased cost is echoed throughout the literature. A Nationwide Inpatient Sample database between 1999 and 2007 identified over half-million patients with atherosclerotic disease using <italic>ICD-9</italic> diagnosis codes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574413475888">11</xref></sup> Comparing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) to peripheral bypass graft (BPG), PTA was associated with increased costs, with average costs increasing twice when compared to BPG during this time period. Our results are consistent with the national trends showing increased hospital costs for endovascular reinterventions which can be obviously attributed to the cost of instrumentations and devices during the procedure itself. The shorter LOS associated with an endovascular repair did not translate into any fiscal benefit in overall hospital costs.</p>
<p>Significantly, the reintervention rates where almost quadrupled at 30 days (7.42 vs 2.11, <italic>P</italic> = .01) and almost tripled at 90 days (11.84 vs 4.55, <italic>P</italic> = .01) after an initial intervention for endovascular PAA repair. This trend in reinterventions is suggestive of short-term graft complications when an endovascular approach is used. There have been many studies attesting the feasibility of endovascular grafting of PAA; however, many omit comparisons with open repairs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574413475888">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574413475888">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574413475888">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574413475888">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574413475888"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574413475888">14</xref></sup> The majorities of these studies are single armed and contain low numbers of participants. Often, these studies evaluated the techniques’ achievability and not the practicality.</p>
<p>In a recent meta-analysis, authors identified 3 studies comparing the outcomes of both endovascular and open PAA repairs; based on the 150 cumulative patients, their conclusion substantiates our results that endovascular PAA repair is associated with high-reinterventions rates secondary to short-term graft thrombosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574413475888">15</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>On subanalysis of reinterventions, angiography followed by thrombolysis were performed 2:1 following an endovascular versus open at 30 days (<italic>P</italic> = .0002). At 90 days following endovascular repair, the rates of angiography tripled with rates of thrombolysis doubling than that after open repairs. Our data are consistent with the current literature which suggests that endovascular repair of PAA is associated with higher reintervention rates compared to open repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574413475888">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538574413475888">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574413475888">17</xref></sup> Short-term graft patency is most likely attributed to graft thrombosis which is evident by the most common type of reinterventions.</p>
<p>Antonello et al performed a prospective randomized trial involving 30 patients at a single institution comparing elective open PAA versus endovascular PAA repairs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538574413475888">16</xref></sup> Their conclusion, similar to ours, found no statistical differences in major outcomes but did conclude that endovascular repairs were associated with shorter operating time and hospital stays. Despite the power limitation of this study, its authors concluded that endovascular repair had several advantages. Our study, a large population-based analysis, concurred with their conclusion that endovascular PAA repair was associated with a shorter hospital stay and quicker recover; however, our data suggest that those advantages are less apparent longitudinally as an endovascular approach is associated with increased rates of readmission, reinterventions, and overall hospital costs in the long term.</p>
<p>Patients undergoing endovascular repair did have higher rates of reinterventions at 30 and 90 days after their initial procedure. Our data suggest that patients in good health may benefit from the durability of an open repair rather than an endovascular approach that can be associated with higher reintervention rates. Angiography, thrombolysis, and embolectomies were the most common procedures performed after the initial procedure.</p>
<p>Limitations of this analysis include selection bias as this is not a prospective randomized trial. Overall, the ENDO group had a higher proportion of patients older than 85 years of age, which may be associated with increased comorbidities and poorer overall health. With the known complication associated with open surgery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574413475888">9</xref></sup> there is a natural bias for physicians to offer endovascular approaches to patients who are deemed more sick. This natural tendency toward nonrandomization can be viewed as a bias in our study accounting for nonrandomization and differences in our cohorts. Nonetheless, taking this bias into account, overall complications between our 2 groups showed no difference in overall mortality and complications. Furthermore, there are limitations in the Medicare data as the administrative database and clinical information may be limited by the <italic>ICD-9-CM</italic> and CPT codes. Definition of indications and coding could be variable between institutions and coders. Certain complications may not be captured in administrative data sets. Refined clinical data are not possible from administrative data, and this study describes rates of procedures and readmission of Medicare patients undergoing PAA repair.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In conclusion, this population-based analysis has demonstrated that despite a significant increase in the number of endovascular repair of PAA in the US Medicare population, endovascular repair did not convey a significant benefit on in-hospital mortality, rates of lower extremity amputation or readmission rates. No difference was found among any of our primary end points when comparing both techniques to PAA repair suggesting noninferiority to open approach. However on further analysis, our data demonstrated that endovascular repair was associated with greater rates of reinterventions suggesting possible higher rates of graft failure in short term due to thrombosis. Comparing open to endo PAA repair, our data suggest that an open approach appeared to convey greater durability and greater fiscal benefit than that of endovascular approach. Further refined clinical studies are warranted to delineate the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.</p>
