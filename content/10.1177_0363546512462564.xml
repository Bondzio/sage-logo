<title>Background:</title>
<p>Tibial plateau fractures requiring surgery are severe injuries. For professionals, amateurs, and recreational athletes, tibial plateau fractures might affect leisure and professional life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512462564">
<title>Hypothesis:</title>
<p>Athletic patients will be affected in their sporting activity after a tibial plateau fracture. Despite a long rehabilitation time and program, physical activity will change to low-impact sports.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512462564">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512462564">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A total of 89 consecutive patients (age range, 14-76 years) were included in the study and were surveyed by a questionnaire. Inclusion criteria were surgical treatment of tibial plateau fractures between 2003 and 2009 with a minimum follow-up of 24 months. The sporting activity was determined at the time of injury, 1 year postoperatively, and at the time of the survey at an average of 52.8 months postoperatively. The clinical evaluation included the Lysholm score, the Tegner activity scale, the activity rating scale (ARS), and a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain perception. Fractures were classified and analyzed using both the Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen (AO) and the Schatzker classifications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512462564">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>At the time of injury, 88.8% of all patients were engaged in sports compared with 62.9% 1 year postoperatively and 73.0% at the time of the survey. Of the professional or competitive athletes (n = 11 at the time of injury), only 2 returned to competition at the time of the survey. The number of different sporting activities declined from 4.9 at the time of injury to 3.6 at the time of the survey (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The sports frequency and the activity duration per week, being 2.8 sessions and 4.5 hours at the time of injury, respectively, declined to 2.4 sessions and 3.8 hours (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001 and <italic>P</italic> = .007, respectively) at the time of the survey, respectively. The Lysholm score (98.7 points before accident) and the VAS for pain perception (0.2 before accident) illustrated significant declines to 76.6 points for the Lysholm score and 2.6 for the VAS (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001 and <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001, respectively) at the time of the survey. The high-energy traumas, Schatzker IV to VI, had significant worse results in the clinical scores compared with the low-energy traumas (Lysholm, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001; Tegner, <italic>P</italic> = .027).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512462564">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The majority of patients could not return to their previous level of activity, and for patients playing competitive sports, this injury can be a career ender. Overall, we noticed a postinjury shift toward activities with less impact. However, at the time of the survey, 73% of all patients were engaged in sports.</p>

<body>
<p>Tibial plateau fractures are common injuries in impact sports such as downhill skiing or soccer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512462564">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512462564">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512462564">15</xref></sup> Because many patients sustaining tibial plateau fractures are young, active, and in the middle of their working life, these injuries may have an enormous effect on a person. The various fracture patterns range from undislocated split fractures and slightly or severely displaced depression fractures to complex comminuted fractures with severe destruction of the joint lines and cartilage lesions. Therefore, individual treatment plans need to be applied to decide between nonoperative treatment, simple screw fixation, or plate fixation with conventional or locking plates. Because the clinical outcome after tibial plateau fractures is closely related to the quality of reduction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512462564">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512462564">28</xref></sup> each surgical technique must aim for an anatomic reconstruction of the injured joint.</p>
<p>However, despite modern techniques and new angular stable implants, an anatomic restoration of displaced or comminuted tibial plateau fractures can be challenging even for experienced trauma surgeons. While studies in the 1970s and 1980s focused on nonoperative versus operative treatment,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363546512462564">§</xref></sup> recent studies focused on open reduction versus arthroscopically assisted treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512462564">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512462564">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512462564">13</xref></sup> and new angular stable implants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512462564">25</xref></sup> or bone substitution material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512462564">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512462564">26</xref></sup> Only very few studies have addressed the knee function in the long-term follow-up,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512462564">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546512462564">38</xref></sup> and to our knowledge, no study has considered the sequelae after tibial plateau fractures with regard to return to sports or heavy work.</p>
<p>Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the sporting abilities of patients after operative treatment of tibial plateau fractures. In particular, we focused on participation in different types of sports and their intensity. We hypothesized that despite good clinical results, the majority of patients would give up their ambitious sporting activity and that the sports disciplines would change to low-impact sports.</p>

<title>Data Acquisition</title>
<p>Patients who underwent surgical treatment for a tibial plateau fracture were surveyed by a questionnaire to determine their sporting activity. As previously described by Naal et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512462564">26</xref></sup> and Salzmann et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512462564">30</xref></sup> the survey included a sports and activity questionnaire for assessment at the time of injury, 1 year postoperatively, and at the time of the survey in 32 different sports and recreational activities. The questionnaire also inquired about the patient’s overall satisfaction with the surgery (very satisfied = 1, satisfied = 2, partially satisfied = 3, not satisfied = 4) and about the use of any pain medication during sports activity (regularly, occasionally, never). The modified Lysholm score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512462564">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512462564">34</xref></sup> and a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain (0 representing “no pain” and 10 representing “maximal imaginable pain”) were used to assess clinical outcomes. The Tegner activity scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512462564">34</xref></sup> and the activity rating scale (ARS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512462564">22</xref></sup> were used to determine activity levels. All of these scores were obtained at 3 different points in time: at the time of injury, 1 year postoperatively, and at the time of the survey, 52.8 ± 23.1 months (4.4 years) postoperatively. The study protocol was approved by our local ethics committee (IRB 5178/11).</p>

<title>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</title>
<p>Between January 2003 and April 2009, a total of 172 patients with tibial plateau fractures were treated operatively at our department (level I trauma center); 109 fractures fulfilled the inclusion criteria: operatively treated tibial plateau fractures in patients with closed epiphyseal cartilage with a minimum follow-up of 24 months. The exclusion criteria for this study included nonoperatively treated tibial plateau fractures and patients with multiple traumas or concomitant injuries in case the tibial plateau fracture was not the most severe injury (n = 5). Furthermore, we excluded patients with attendant injuries in the same extremity (n = 3), bilateral tibial plateau fracture (n = 1), residence outside the country (n = 4), psychosis or addictive disorder (n = 6), handicapped/walking disability before the tibial plateau fracture (n = 5), severe pre-existing condition (n = 3), age over 76 years on the day of surgery (n = 19), re-osteosynthesis after initial treatment elsewhere (n = 9), and pathological fractures (n = 1). Three patients were excluded after high tibial osteotomy during the follow-up period to correct a varus malalignment, and another 3 patients were excluded after a conversion to total knee arthroplasty during the follow-up period.</p>
<p>One patient died during the follow-up period, and 14 patients were lost to follow-up. Six patients refused to participate in this study. The remaining 89 patients were included in this study (81.7% of all patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512462564">Figure 1</xref>). All fractures were classified according to the Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen (AO) and the Schatzker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546512462564">32</xref></sup> classifications.</p>

<title>Operative Techniques</title>
<p>Patients were placed in a supine position with the ability to bend the knee to 90° of flexion. For unicondylar lateral fractures, a standard straight lateral approach was used. After arthrotomy, the knee joint was inspected for fracture patterns and injuries of the ligaments, meniscus, and cartilage. The anterior horn of the meniscus was released for better exposure and reinserted with absorbable sutures after fixation of the fracture.</p>
<p>After anatomic reduction, the fractures were fixed with screws and angular stable L- or T-plates for buttressing. In isolated split fractures, reduction was usually controlled arthroscopically, and fixation was performed using cannulated 7.0- or 7.3-mm titanium screws. In impaction fractures, the fragments were elevated through the fracture or through a cortical window. If necessary, remaining bony defects were augmented with autologous cancellous bone harvested from the iliac crest or with bone substitution material (Chronos, Synthes Inc, Umkirch, Germany). The fracture was finally fixed using a buttress plate. In bicondylar fractures, an additional medial approach was used for sufficient reduction and for addressing the medial fragment.</p>
<p>For postoperative rehabilitation, weightbearing was limited to 20 kg for 6 weeks after surgery. Knee flexion was limited to 60° in cases of meniscal reinsertion. Weightbearing was gradually increased from week 6 to week 12 after radiographic evaluation 6 weeks postoperatively. Full weightbearing was initiated at 12 weeks after surgery.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using the software package SPSS (Version 19, IBM Corp, Somers, New York). All data were tested for normal distribution. Afterward, normally distributed data were compared using <italic>t</italic> tests. Nonnormally distributed data were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank and Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests (paired/unpaired). Group data were compared using 1-way analysis of variance. Unless otherwise stated, descriptive results were demonstrated as the mean ± standard deviation. The level of significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 for all tests; all confidence intervals are calculated for a 95% confidence level.</p>

<title>Cause of Accident and Operative Treatment</title>
<p>In our series, 54.0% of all tibial plateau fractures were caused by sports accidents. Downhill skiing was the most common sporting accident, with 31.5% of all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512462564">Figure 2</xref>). Traffic accidents (20.2%), especially motorcycle accidents (11.2%), and falls (17.9%) were other common causes of tibial plateau fractures. The severity of the tibial plateau fractures correlated with the cause of the accident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512462564">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In the evaluated 89 patients, 63 fractures (70.8%) were treated with open reduction and internal fixation, 21 fractures (23.6%) were arthroscopically assisted, and 5 minimally displaced fractures (5.6%) were treated with percutaneous screws. Plates were used in 53 fractures (59.6% of all fractures); of these plates, 50 (94.3%) were angular stable, 2 (3.8%) were less invasive stabilization system (LISS) plates, and 1 (1.9%) was a conventional plate.</p>
<p>Bone defects had to be addressed in 39 cases (43.8% of all fractures); the bone substitute was chosen according to the surgeon’s preference: β-TCP ceramic bone substitute (Chronos, Synthes Inc) was used in 24 fractures (61.5% of all defects), cancellous bone from the iliac crest was used in 9 fractures (23.1% of all defects), donor allogenous femoral head spongiosa was used in 5 fractures (12.8% of all defects), and a combined procedure (allogenous bone + Chronos [Synthes Inc]) was performed in 1 patient (2.6%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0363546512462564">
<title>Sports and Recreational Activities</title>
<p>Throughout the year before the injury, 88.8% of the patients were engaged in an average of 4.9 ± 2.6 different disciplines (range, 1-12), and a total of 12.4% were engaged in competitive or professional sports. One year postoperatively, 62.9% of the patients were engaged in an average of 3.0 ± 1.8 different sports and recreational disciplines (range, 1-8), demonstrating a significant decrease (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). At the time of follow-up at a mean of 52.8 months after surgery, 73.0% of the patients were engaged in an average of 3.6 ± 2.0 different sports and recreational disciplines (range, 1-9), again illustrating a significant increase (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) when compared with physical activity 1 year postoperatively.</p>
<p>The tibial plateau fracture marked the end of a professional sports career in 9 of 11 competitive athletes (81.8%); 1 of 11 patients (9.1%) returned to competitive or professional sports 1 year after surgery, and 2 of 11 patients (18.2%) participated in competitive or professional sports at the time of the survey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512462564">Figure 3</xref>). In our series, 4 patients (4.5%) had to give up their job or change jobs to less physically demanding work as a consequence of their knee injury.</p>

<p>Distribution patterns among the top 5 cited sports activities changed from the time of injury to postoperative periods. Patients switched from higher-impact sports such as downhill skiing (58.4% before accident) and jogging (28.1% before accident) to lower-impact sports such as Nordic walking (22.5% 1 year after fracture). Cycling remained the number 1 cited activity; however, the amount of patients engaged in cycling decreased from 78.7% to 65.2% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546512462564">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Clinical Outcome</title>
<p>The overall satisfaction with surgery, on a scale from 1 (very satisfied) to 4 (not satisfied), averaged 1.6 ± 0.9 (range, 1-4); 57.3% of patients were very satisfied, 31.5% were satisfied, 4.5% were partially satisfied, and 6.7% were not satisfied with the outcome. Overall, 87.6% of the patients required no pain medication to play sports or recreational activities, 12.4% of the patients required occasional pain medication, and 4.5% of the patients required regular pain medication. The VAS for pain increased significantly from 0.2 ± 0.5 (range, 0-3) before the injury to 3.7 ± 2.7 (range, 0-10) 1 year after the fracture (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and decreased again significantly to 2.6 ± 2.4 (range, 0-9) at the time of the survey (52.8 months) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The Lysholm score decreased significantly from 98.7 ± 3.6 (range, 80-100) before the injury to 66.2 ± 24.1 (range, 0-100) 1 year after the fracture (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and improved again to 76.6 ± 21.0 (range, 14-100) at the time of the survey (52.8 months) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>Activity levels according to the Tegner scale declined significantly from 5.2 ± 1.6 (range, 1-9) at the time of injury to 3.0 ± 1.8 (range, 0-9; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) 1 year postoperatively and increased again to 3.6 ± 1.7 (range, 0-9; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) at the time of the survey.

<title>Subgroup Analysis: Age, Hardware Removal, and Ligamentous Injuries</title>
<p>For subgroup analysis, the collection of patients was divided with regard to the age at the time of injury as follows: group I, &lt;30 years of age (n = 9); group II, 30 to 60 years of age (n = 63); and group III, &gt;60 years of age (n = 17). In all groups, the clinical outcome compared with the preinjury value decreased as well as the activity and intensity of sports both 1 year postoperatively and at the time of the survey. There were no significant differences between the groups.</p>
<p>Hardware removal was recommended after a period of 12 months. Removal was performed in 60 patients (67.4%) at an average of 14.4 ± 6.5 months after surgery (range, 5-38). Twenty-nine patients refused implant removal. Subdividing the patients into 2 groups with and without hardware removal, there was no difference in the distribution of fracture patterns; in 67%, hardware was removed in both the high-energy and low-energy trauma groups. There were no differences in the VAS (<italic>P</italic> = .893) and the Lysholm score (<italic>P</italic> = .964). However, the patients who had undergone hardware removal had significantly worse results in the Tegner score (<italic>P</italic> = .028) and reported a worse outcome in self-reported satisfaction (1.72 vs 1.38; <italic>P</italic> = .083).</p>
<p>In 14 patients (15.7%), meniscal injuries were found. The meniscal injuries were either sutured or reinserted in cases of meniscal root injuries. Ligamentous injuries were found in 13 patients (14.6%). Among these injuries, there were 4 bony anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) lesions, 4 ligamentous ACL lesions, 2 combined ACL/posterior cruciate ligament lesions, 2 medial collateral ligament lesions, and 1 lateral collateral ligament lesion. Analyzing the sustained ligamentous injuries, we found no statistical significance in comparison to the group without ligamentous injuries in the Tegner score (<italic>P</italic> = .693) or Lysholm score (<italic>P</italic> = .374) nor in the sporting activity (h/wk) (<italic>P</italic> = .365).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Several studies have shown that an anatomic reduction of the tibial plateau and thereby a reconstruction of the axis are predictors for a good clinical outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512462564">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512462564">28</xref></sup> Marsh et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512462564">21</xref></sup> found in their review that the cartilage injury sustained at the time of injury may be the most important factor for the development of posttraumatic osteoarthritis. Because most studies in the literature focus on the long-term outcomes and prevention of osteoarthritis, little data exist concerning sporting ability and the return to sporting activity after tibial plateau fractures. However, the expected outcome in terms of possible sporting activity after tibial plateau fractures is important to discuss, as patients today demand full functionality after an injury.</p>
<p>The results from the present study support the hypothesis that tibial plateau fractures have a great effect on patients’ sporting activity. Despite good clinical results, patients were likely to give up their ambitious sporting activity and switch to lower impact sports. Furthermore, our data support that high-energy traumas (Schatzker IV-VI) lead to worse results than low-energy traumas (Schatzker I-III), which has been reported previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512462564">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast to other studies, where typically road accidents were the reason for tibial plateau fractures,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512462564">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512462564">28</xref></sup> we found that 54.0% of our cases were sports accidents. Within our high number of sports accidents, we found a notable proportion being caused by downhill skiing accidents (n = 28; 31.5%). These findings might be related to the geographic location of Munich being 100 km from the Alps. While most skiing injuries were AO type B fractures (B fractures, 78.6%; C fractures, 21.4%), motorcycle accidents as high-energy traumas resulted in a higher rate of AO type C fractures (B fractures, 60.0%; C fractures, 40.0%).</p>
<p>There was some debate about the incidence of tibial plateau fractures due to skiing in the 1980s and 1990s. While some authors reported a low incidence of tibial plateau fractures, approximately 1.5% of all skiing injuries,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512462564">23</xref></sup> other authors reported increasing numbers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512462564">29</xref></sup> It should be noted that these studies from the 1980s were based on a rather small number of patients. However, Wasden et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546512462564">37</xref></sup> could show that skiers are likely to suffer from injuries of the lower extremity, which might be caused by the introduction of carving skis and a faster, more aggressive riding style. Our study also supports the reported low occurrence of tibial head fractures in snowboarding,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512462564">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546512462564">37</xref></sup> including only 1 snowboarder compared with 28 skiers in this study.</p>
<p>As 54.0% of all accidents were sporting accidents, and 76.4% of our patients engaged in sports were recreational-level athletes, our data suggest that our patients with a mean age of 47.2 years at the time of injury were typical weekend warriors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512462564">17</xref></sup> This type of athlete usually works from 9 o’clock to 5 o’clock or longer during the week and only finds time for sports on the weekends. They have high ambitions but usually lack in fitness and skills, resulting in severe sporting accidents, such as tibial plateau fractures. As these patients are in the middle of their working life, and with a long period of rehabilitation, tibial plateau fractures may have a big socioeconomic impact: 4 of our patients (4.5%) had to give up or change their job after the tibial plateau fracture. In our study, the tibial plateau fracture marked the end of professional sports careers in 9 of 11 cases (81.8%). This high number illustrates the enormous effect of a tibial plateau fracture on knee joint function. In the professional athlete, not only knee function but also muscular atrophy have to be addressed in a rehabilitation program. Implementation of more specific rehabilitation programs as they are already used in cartilage surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512462564">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512462564">27</xref></sup> may help professional athletes to return to their previous sports level more frequently.</p>
<p>In the current study, tibial plateau fractures have shown not only to have a great effect on the sporting activity of professional athletes but also on the activity of the so-called weekend warriors. These patients, representing the most patients in this study, also had to adapt their sporting activity. Whereas 58.4% of our cohort were downhill skiers 1 year before the accident, only 23.6% of the patients returned to the slopes at the time of the survey. More severe injuries such as type C fractures resulted in a reduction in high-impact sports as expected. Furthermore, we noticed that patients avoided the type of sports in which the accident had happened. Besides the functional limitation of their knee joints, many of our patients stated that they have given up impact sports because they wanted to prevent sporting injuries and additional adverse effects on their knee in the future.</p>
<p>In agreement with results reported by Markhardt et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512462564">20</xref></sup> the return to sports is dependent on the type of fracture. Low-energy tibial plateau fractures classified as Schatzker I to III<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512462564">5</xref></sup> had significantly better outcomes concerning the decline of sports disciplines, sports per week, and in the ARS and the Tegner score compared with the high-energy Schatzker IV to VI fractures. The poorer outcome of bicondylar fractures has already been demonstrated by several studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546512462564">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546512462564">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>In most of the prior studies on tibial plateau fractures, the return-to-sports aspect was only evaluated incidentally and among a limited number of patients. A recent study by Siegler et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512462564">33</xref></sup> reviewing 21 patients with Schatzker I to III fractures, measured the return to sports of patients using the Tegner score only. They concluded that 57% of the patients returned to sports within a mean of 14 months, having no data of the preinjury level of activity. Holzach et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512462564">13</xref></sup> reported that 14 of 16 patients returned to the previous level of activity in a study with AO type B fractures after a mean follow-up of 1 to 6.5 years. Nevertheless, assessment of the sporting activity has not been very meticulously carried out, only categorizing the aspect of return to sporting activity as full, with restriction, very reduced, and none.</p>
<p>Gill et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512462564">11</xref></sup> published a series of 25 tibial plateau fractures in skiing and reported that 84% of the patients returned to full sporting activity. However, the methods used to measure the return to full sporting activity remain unclear.</p>
<p>In a 1997 analysis, Houben et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512462564">14</xref></sup> divided their 46 patients into 3 groups based on follow-up time: group I had a follow-up &lt;37 months, group II had a follow-up of 37 to 71 months, and group III had the longest follow-up &gt;71 months. They concluded that patients who were between 37 to 71 months out of surgery had the best results. Patients in group I were still in their rehabilitation period, and group III patients, as concluded by the authors, already had problems with the onset of posttraumatic osteoarthritis. These findings are comparable with the results of our study, showing better results at the time of the survey as compared with the 1-year results, although the differences are statistically not significant in all evaluated scores. Comparable with a study published by Cassard et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512462564">8</xref></sup> in 1999, the data of the present study suggest that loss of function and symptoms of early osteoarthritis might occur earlier than 71 months after injury.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the patient group that declined implant removal was more satisfied with the clinical outcome than the hardware removal group. As there were no differences in the VAS and the Lysholm score, the limitation of the sporting activity measured in the Tegner score may be blamed for the reduced satisfaction.</p>
<p>The present study has some limitations including the midterm outcomes reported, which do not allow us to draw any conclusions regarding sporting activities at a later time point or the development and progression of knee osteoarthritis. A second limitation of the study is its retrospective design. Patients were asked for sports activities and clinical information that, in some cases, dated back several years. Also, 20 patients of 109 (18.3%) in the present study were lost to follow-up or declined participation, raising the possibility of some selection bias. Furthermore, we could not perform a subgroup analysis for the ligamentous injuries because the number of cases was too low.</p>
<p>However, we present the results of 89 patients and their return to sports at a mean follow-up of 52.8 ± 23.1 months postoperatively. Sports activity was assessed by the use of specially designed questionnaires and several widely accepted activity scores. To our knowledge, this study is the largest series to date, with the longest follow-up, focusing on the return to sporting activity after tibial plateau fractures.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The current study shows that tibial plateau fractures have a great effect on patients in terms of quality and quantity of sporting activity. The poor outcome data at 1-year follow-up underline the long rehabilitation time necessary to regain activity.</p>
<p>The majority of our patients were satisfied with the overall outcome and achieved good values in the Lysholm score. Nevertheless, a tibial plateau fracture is a setback in an athlete’s life, and most patients were forced to reduce their sporting activity or had to give up their career in competitive sports. The results of the study also demonstrated that patients with high-energy fractures had significantly reduced activity subsequently. Furthermore, tibial plateau fractures have been shown to be responsible for a shift from high-impact sports to low-impact sports after injury. Whether this was a direct consequence of the injury and related to pain or impaired function or related to avoidance behaviors remains unclear.</p>
