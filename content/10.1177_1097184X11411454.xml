<p>Jacqueline Moore offers a detailed portrait of the lives of men on Texas ranches. In this extended essay, cattle men are endlessly middle class while cow boys are always working class. Each ranch boasts thousands of cattle and spreads out over massive territories. Missing from this landscape are the smaller ranch owners, even though some of the men who were once cowboys managed to get a ranch for themselves.</p>
<p>Hundreds of original sources, including letters, diaries, memoirs, book length treatments of ranches and cowboys, and some professional writings document Moore’s thesis that an almost unbridgeable gap separated the men and the boys. Men and boys kept their class positions even as the attributes of masculinity in these two social classes changed over the latter part of the nineteenth century. As middle class became defined as owning property, cattle men quit working with cattle, substituting hired managers to direct the ranch work. As that work became deskilled and cattle men looked for cheaper labor, cow boys became rowdier and ranch owners and townspeople alike sought to control them by stifling their drinking, gambling, and fist fighting. Before, cow boys could rely on their skills and ability to get the job done to define their masculinity. As time passed, cattle men became increasingly paternalistic, reducing the workers' status to that of “boy” rather than “man.” The youth of the cow boys—ranging in age from twenty to forty—encouraged the paternalism of ranch owners.</p>
<p>The author sketches women’s lives only in their relationships with men. Wives of cattle men were restricted to private rather than public roles; some adapted the tenets of “true womanhood.” Cow boys honored these women but did not know how to approach them. Women who owned their own ranches were not mentioned; however, those few girls who did cow boy work were no longer defined as feminine. Cow boys turned to prostitutes to satisfy their sexual needs, but “considered it their prerogative to police disreputable women” (p. 159). Moore’s discussion defines women only in relation to me; though probably unintended, she conveys a sharp dichotomy between madonna and whore.</p>
<p>Social patterns in Texas differed little from those in the east, mostly because the “settlers imported class and social hierarchies wholesale” (p. 4). For example, with no supporting evidence, Moore suggests that many of the settlers were from the South causing Black cow boys to be given the lowliest jobs on the ranch. She also argues that cattle men were more interested in getting property than in continuing to raise cattle. They acquired other business interests and managed them competitively and aggressively. Earlier, these men may have taken pride in their physical prowess, but Moore’s cattle men take pride in their ability to control and channel their own physical aggression. They shrewdly used cow boys as political pawns to strengthen their economic and political position.</p>
<p>The book gives glimpses of Moore’s admiration for cattle men who quickly spotted trends, adopted business methods, and experimented with different breeds of cattle. And, as cattle men saw the need to be well informed, they increasingly sought education for themselves or their sons. Moore states that “second generation cattle men were among some of the best educated men in Texas” (p. 55). Again, no statistical evidence is provided to bolster this claim.</p>
<p>In a concluding epilogue, Moore points out that cowboys were not the glamorous, strong, all-knowing idols that the popular media has proclaimed. The image of cowboys declined toward the end of the century just as public fascination with cow boys became widespread. Moore argues that William F. Cody and his Wild West Show (presented first in 1882) did the most to rehabilitate their image. At first, Cody incorporated Black and Hispanic cowboys in the show, but later reduced them to ineffectual stereotypes. In combating white middle-class anxieties about immigrants, the end of the frontier, and the decline of masculinity, Cody presented an ideal of white male virility that was uniquely American.</p>
<p>Overall, Moore’s book captures a wealth of detail and funnels all of it through the distinctions of social class. The book will captivate a variety of audiences: masculinity scholars, ranching enthusiasts, and those who simply love Texas. Audience members, however, should be aware of the specifics of time and place. After 1900, ranching continued to develop in the more remote areas of the American West and featured many smaller ranches. In Texas, ranching characterized only the western two thirds of the state; cotton culture prevailed elsewhere.</p>
