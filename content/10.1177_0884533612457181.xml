<abstract>
<p><italic>Background</italic>: Many patients with advanced head and neck cancer become unable to obtain sufficient nutrition and hydration orally, leading to considerable weight loss and compromised clinical outcomes. The percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube is ideal for this population who require longer term nutrition support due to the effects of cancer treatment. Although clinical experts at the Odette Cancer Centre (OCC) report positive patient feedback with PEG tubes, there is debate in the literature regarding the associated quality of life (QoL). The study objective was to learn about the experience of patients living with a PEG tube. <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>: A neutral questionnaire with closed- and open-ended questions was developed, tested, and used to collect data. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics to determine whether the patients’ experiences were positive/neutral or negative. Qualitative data were assessed for common themes, and frequency was counted. <italic>Results</italic>: Of the 51 participants, 84% felt the PEG tube had a positive/neutral effect on their QoL. Ninety percent felt that the PEG tube was “very much” or “quite a bit” worthwhile. In addition, 96% would recommend it to another patient. The 11 questions reflecting domains of QoL affected by living with a PEG tube were answered positively or neutrally at least 71% of the time. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: Results indicate that the patient experience with the PEG tube is generally positive or neutral, thus demonstrating a different outcome than recent literature. This study will help improve understanding regarding the experience of living with a PEG tube from the patient perspective.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Head and neck cancer (HNCA) is among the 10 most common cancers in the world, and there is evidence that the incidence is increasing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612457181">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612457181">2</xref></sup> For patients with head and neck tumors, 20%–50% present with reduced nutrition status prior to any therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612457181">3</xref></sup> Often aggressive, multimodal therapy is required, which may further worsen nutrition and functional status. Treatment commonly results in side effects, making the consumption of adequate nutrients and fluids challenging and often contributes to severe weight loss and dehydration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612457181">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, a compromised nutrition state may result in more complications, reduce response to anticancer treatments, require longer hospitalization, and incur higher healthcare costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612457181">5</xref></sup> Supportive nutrition therapy is often part of the management regimen and is intended to both improve current nutrition status and prevent further deterioration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612457181">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The placement of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes has become an established part of the management regimen when treating patients with HNCA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612457181">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612457181">7</xref></sup> The PEG tube procedure has been found to be safe with few complications, low morbidity, or procedure-related mortality and has been shown to reduce hospital admissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612457181">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612457181">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612457181"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612457181">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the Odette Cancer Centre (OCC) within Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre (SHSC), PEG tubes are placed as an outpatient procedure for patients unable to obtain adequate nutrition orally or as a prophylactic measure. The OCC dietitians educate patients regarding placement, care, and use of the tube and provide ongoing follow-up to help minimize the risk of complications. Outpatients at the OCC are primarily taught to administer feeds via bolus syringe. This drastically reduces feeding time and often allows patients to avoid overnight feeds with associated complications, both complaints raised in the literature.</p>
<p>There is a growing body of research on HNCA patients and their associated quality of life (QoL) with a PEG tube<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612457181">11</xref></sup>; however, few studies report specifically on the impact from a patient’s perspective. As the nutrition and medical benefits of PEG tubes have become well established, there remains debate as to the impact of PEG tube feeding on QoL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612457181">8</xref></sup> It has been suggested that PEG tubes with their associated complications and restrictions may have a dramatic negative effect on QoL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612457181">12</xref></sup> This topic is of particular concern; although artificial means of nutrition may result in improved clinical outcomes, if it is done at the expense of an acceptable QoL, then it raises an ethical dilemma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612457181">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612457181">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Research evaluating QoL has used quantitative questionnaires to translate the patient’s perceived state of health into a tangible QoL measure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612457181">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612457181">13</xref></sup>; however few PEG-specific questionnaires for the HNCA patient population have been developed. Those available provide insight into QoL by measuring the patient’s experience living with a PEG tube through questions addressing the physical, social, and psychological dimensions that comprise QoL. These questionnaires predominantly focus on exploring the frequency and extent of tube complications, as well as interference with various aspects of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612457181">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612457181">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612457181">15</xref></sup> In addition, questions are often phrased in a manner that only allows for answers along a progressively negative continuum and may not capture the full range of emotions experienced by patients. The literature is deficient in neutrally phrased PEG-specific questionnaires for this population. The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of the experience of the HNCA patient population specific to their PEG tube using a distinctly neutral questionnaire.</p>
<p>The rationale for this study was 3-fold: (1) to lend support to the decision making of patients considering a PEG tube; (2) to enable clinicians to better understand the impact of PEG tube placement on patients, thereby informing their decision making when recommending it as a treatment option; and (3) to allow further evaluation of the OCC outpatient PEG tube program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0884533612457181" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This cross-sectional, retrospective descriptive study ran from October 2009 to June 2010 at the OCC in Toronto, Canada. Consecutive sampling was used to recruit eligible participants from a list of HNCA patients.</p>
<p>Inclusion criteria were as follows: patients with “advanced” HNCA, defined as stage III–IV tumor with completion of radiation therapy or a tumor requiring chemoradiation treatment, who had an outpatient PEG tube placement at the OCC and were older than 18 years could be contacted.</p>
<p>Exclusion criteria were as follows: patients who had a PEG tube inserted palliatively and those who passed away or were unable to communicate sufficiently due to a neurological condition or mental impairment. Patients undergoing radiation treatment or within 1 month of treatment completion were excluded as it has been found that treatment modalities and their side effects influence QoL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612457181">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>A mixed-method, PEG-specific questionnaire was developed with questions that were neutrally phrased to avoid leading the participant, and Likert scales allowed for positive, neutral, and negative answers. The quantitative questions were constructed based on available literature that speaks to the experiences of patients with PEG tubes, as well as clinical expertise of the OCC dietitians. Eleven questions gathered information regarding the dimensions of QoL by providing insight into the experience of living with a PEG tube. Three additional questions were determined to be “key” as they asked directly about QoL, if the PEG tube was worthwhile, and if the respondent would recommend it to another patient. Two questions, unrelated to QoL, explored the degree to which respondents used the tube as well as the significance of having a PEG tube. Four open-ended questions were asked to enhance the richness of the study; these questions are supported by previous qualitative work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612457181">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although validation of the questionnaire has not yet been achieved, preliminary tests for face and content validity were conducted. Two patients considered similar to the participants enrolled in the study (had received radiation treatment at the OCC for head and neck cancer and were either living with or had previously lived with a PEG tube) and their family members reviewed the questionnaire for face validity. Content validity involved the questionnaire being reviewed by a panel of 8 clinical experts who either worked closely with patients living with PEG tubes and/or had experience in research questionnaire development. The questionnaire was reviewed to ensure questions were relevant to the topic, comprehensive, and reflective of clinical knowledge and information from in the literature. Any concerns regarding clarity of the questions or question gaps were addressed, and the questionnaire was modified.</p>
<p>The questionnaires were administered primarily over the phone, although a small number were mailed, e-mailed, or conducted in person to accommodate patient preference. The 2 dietitians who administered the questionnaires were not involved in the care of the participants. Informed consent was received from all patients, and they were assured that responses would remain anonymous to the healthcare team.</p>
<p>Ethical approval was granted by the Research Ethics Board of SHSC.</p>
<sec id="section3-0884533612457181">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables of interest. Continuous measures were summarized using means with standard deviation and ranges, whereas categorical measures were summarized using counts and percentages. Contingency tables were presented on outcomes of interest. Univariate analyses were carried out, differences in continuous measures were assessed using a 2-sample 2-sided <italic>t</italic> test, and differences in categorical measures were assessed using the χ<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher exact test where appropriate. Relationships between ordinal survey questions were assessed using Spearman correlation coefficients. A standard significance level of <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was used for all analyses. All analyses were carried out using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p>
<p>Responses were grouped in a binary fashion (positive/neutral or negative) as it was felt that a neutral effect on a patient’s experience is acceptable in the context of the demonstrated clinical benefits of the PEG tube. Nonnegative responses (ie, positive and neutral) were grouped for analysis, and they have been consistently presented as representative of both categories of responses. Neutrality refers to having “no effect” on an aspect of QoL and is not simply the absence of a positive or negative experience.</p>
<p>Using a basic form of grounded theory analysis, open-ended responses were coded independently by 2 researchers and subsequently grouped into larger concepts and then categories jointly to achieve consensus. Response category frequencies were then counted and represented as percentages of total responses. Researchers determined that when 10% (n = 5) of the total respondents made reference to the same category, a sufficient number of responses were captured to be considered clinically relevant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 68 patients who met the eligibility criteria and contact was attempted, 51 (75%) participated in the study.</p>
<p>The demographic, disease, and treatment characteristics of the study population are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612457181">Table 1</xref>. English as a first language was found to be statistically significant in relation to the question on QoL (<italic>P</italic> = .0215) in that the PEG tube had a more positive/neutral effect on QoL for these participants. The number of days the PEG tube was inserted relative to the start of radiation treatment did not have a statistically significant effect on any question in the questionnaire. Ten respondents (20%) had their PEG tube in situ at the time of the interview. The presence of a PEG tube had a statistically significant relationship to questions regarding family/social life (<italic>P</italic> = .0086) and the attitudes of others (<italic>P</italic> = .0004). Participants with the PEG tube in situ were more likely to report that the PEG tube had a more negative effect on their family/social life and found the attitudes of others toward their PEG had a more negative effect on them.</p>

<p>Regarding the significance question, 71% thought the PEG tube experience was either “very significant” or “quite significant,” whereas only 16% responded that it was “not significant.” A strong correlation was found between this question and the key questions on QoL and if the tube was worthwhile. As people reported the experience of having a PEG tube being more significant (in relation to their experience with cancer), they were more likely to report the PEG having a positive/neutral effect on their QoL (<italic>P</italic> = .0004) and the PEG tube being worthwhile (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001).</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0884533612457181">Table 3</xref> show that respondents felt the experience of having a PEG tube did not have a negative effect on their lives.

<p>Most respondents found that the PEG tube had a neutral effect on their activities of daily life, their family/social life, how they felt about their appearance, and how they were affected by the attitudes of others toward their PEG tube. A positive/neutral correlation was found between the effect of the PEG tube on performing activities of daily life and its effect on QoL (<italic>P</italic> = .0191).</p>
<p>Eighty-four percent of participants reported either never or only occasionally experiencing PEG tube problems (discomfort, leakage, infection). This question was not significantly correlated with the key questions relating to QoL (<italic>P</italic> = .8474) and if the PEG tube was worthwhile (<italic>P</italic> = .9139). People who were more negatively affected by PEG tube problems were more likely to respond that the PEG tube was disruptive to their sleep (<italic>P</italic> = .0473), although 94% reported never or only once in a while experiencing sleep disturbance due to the tube. Although 62% of participants reported no effect, 12% reported the PEG tube affected their intimate relationships “all the time.” The effect on intimacy was observed to have a positive/neutral and significant correlation with how the PEG tube affected their feelings toward their appearance (<italic>P</italic> = .0191). Almost half of respondents (47%) did not report feeling stressed about eating to maintain their weight. Finally, the majority of respondents found the PEG tube was “very easy” to both use and fit feeding into their day.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0884533612457181">Table 4</xref> contains the results for the key questions. When asked directly about the effect of the PEG tube on their QoL, 39% reported that it had a “very positive” effect during the time they were using it most. In total, 84% reported it as having a positive or neutral effect on their QoL. It was found that 82% felt the PEG tube had been “very much” worthwhile, with a total of 90% choosing a positive/neutral response. Ultimately, 96% of respondents would recommend getting a PEG tube to another patient in a similar situation.</p>

<p>The PEG tube was described as being “a lifesaver,” and another participant stated that “the benefits (of getting a PEG tube) outweigh the negatives.” Three participants commented on how the PEG tube alleviated the burden of eating when saying,
<disp-quote>
<p>The idea of having no appetite whatsoever but knowing that if you don’t put something in your body you’re going to disappear and or get sick. . . . It makes the most horrible process in the world almost bearable. . . . You can alleviate a concern and a worry and replace it with a solution.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another respondent stated the disadvantage of “having a tube attached to you is an inconvenience” but followed with
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m cancer free and totally cured . . . I would have to say that obviously the chemo and the rads and all that stuff was a big part of making it happen ’cause that was the actual medicine, but if I was unable to hydrate and unable to get nutrients there’s no way I would have survived. . . .</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study staunchly examined the patient’s perspective of the experience with a PEG tube in the presence of advanced HNCA. The predominantly older, male study population is representative of the general HNCA population, increasing the likelihood of transferability to other HNCA patient populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612457181">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Overall, participants had a positive or neutral experience as evidenced by the fact that a positive/neutral response was chosen a minimum of 71% of the time to the 11 questions relating to the dimensions of QoL (ranging from 71%–98%). This was supported by 1 participant who said, “Get the tube because it will definitely save your life. Everything else you go through is excruciating . . . it takes more pain off your plate. It should be policy.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, of the respondents who chose a negative answer for the 11 questions related to QoL, very rarely did they pick the extreme negative option. This is in contrast to recent literature revealing a predominantly negative effect on QoL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612457181">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612457181">11</xref></sup> Exceptions to the lack of negative responses were noted for the intimacy question. An interesting distribution of responses also emerged relating to the stress around the weight maintenance question. Based on the OCC dietitians’ experiences and selected evidence in the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612457181">14</xref></sup> it was somewhat surprising that almost half (47%) of the respondents did not feel stressed about eating to maintain their weight, whereas only a quarter felt the PEG tube decreased their stress and another 20% felt it actually increased their stress.</p>
<p>The majority of respondents (70%) found the question on difficulty finding a place to feed outside their home “not applicable” as they predominantly used the PEG tube at home. They did not, however, indicate that they found this restrictive. This is further supported by 92% of respondents who reported finding it easy or neutral to fit tube feeding into their day as well as the generally neutral effect on family/social life. Again, these findings do not reflect the current literature, with several studies showing an appreciable burden on patients regarding difficulty finding a place to feed, negative attitudes of others toward feeding, and interference with social life.<sup>7,14,18-20</sup></p>
<p>Participant responses to the 4 open-ended questions presented additional valuable information about their experiences. In response to the question that asked, “What would you tell another patient in a similar situation?” the principal message was “get it.” This finding differs substantially from the primarily negative impact of the PEG tube revealed by the qualitative interviews of Brotherton et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612457181">14</xref></sup> It does, however, align with the findings of Verhoef and Van Rosendaal,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0884533612457181">20</xref></sup> which revealed that all of the surviving study patients indicated they would make the decision to have a PEG tube again.</p>
<p>The most common disadvantage and area for improvement that emerged from the open-ended questions was that the cap at the end of the PEG tube, which is intended to prevent stomach contents from escaping, was prone to leaking and ought to be improved. This problem of leakage is not a unique concept, as other studies have reported the same.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612457181">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0884533612457181">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533612457181">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The results of the question asking how often patients used the tube to feed when eating was hardest revealed that the vast majority of participants used the tube “all the time,” emphasizing the critical role of the PEG tube program. These results, combined with the fact that more than half the respondents felt that the PEG tube was “very significant,” underscore the importance that any negative effect of the PEG tube on the patient’s life be minimized. It should be noted that of the 4 participants who answered that the PEG tube was “not at all worthwhile,” they had earlier responded that they either never or only partly used the PEG tube for feeding. It is remarkable to note that 2 individuals who did not find the PEG tube worthwhile themselves would still recommend it to someone else. This is expressed in the following comment:
<disp-quote>
<p>I suspect for people that need it, it’s very good. In my own case, I probably didn’t . . . but that’s like saying you don’t wear a life jacket if you didn’t fall in the water; well you know, good for you, you didn’t fall in the water but if you had you woulda been . . . glad you had it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The responses for the 3 key questions were emphatic in their affirmation of the positive effect and worth of the PEG tube. The results of this study contradict a large portion of the literature that indicates the PEG tube has a negative impact from the patient’s perspective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612457181">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612457181">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612457181">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533612457181">19</xref></sup> However, earlier studies demonstrated similar outcomes of the positive or stabilizing effect of PEG tubes on QoL, indicating the current study results are not in isolation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612457181">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0884533612457181">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The researchers propose that these differences in findings may be explained by one or both of the following: (a) there is a true difference in the results, and this population’s experience was more positive (or less negative) than previous study populations’ experiences, due perhaps to the quality of the PEG tube program at the OCC, and/or (b) the study methodology—namely, the unique questionnaire allowed participants to express a positive/neutral experience that was not captured by prior work.</p>
<p>Further qualitative research into this topic is under way, which will help in understanding the experience of living with a PEG tube, and has potential to benefit future patients through improvements to the PEG tube program.</p>
<p>Limitations of this study are acknowledged, including recognizing that the difficulty for participants to separate their experience with cancer from their experience with the PEG tube is a notable confounding variable. Additional limitations include the potential underreporting of negative experiences, as well as a sample limited to those patients who have survived advanced HNCA until administration of the questionnaire. The study is limited by the retrospective nature of the data collection. Reliance on patient memory may be questioned, although the literature has demonstrated that recall for traumatic events is accurate and often detailed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533612457181">23</xref></sup> In this study, the researchers found that patients were able to recall very specific events and conversations from their experiences. However, future research on this topic may include the variable “elapsed time from PEG tube removal to time of assessment” to determine what, if any, impact this has on QoL. The researchers also recognize the potential bias in the use of their interpretive judgments of open-ended data. The results of the study are reflective of the OCC PEG tube program and are thereby limited by the program’s patient selection criteria, primarily built around contraindications to outpatient PEG tube placement. Last, it is acknowledged that the PEG-specific questionnaire developed as part of this study has yet to be appropriately validated.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The objective of this study—to assess the experience of the HNCA patient population with PEG tubes placed at the OCC—was achieved in the development of a neutrally phrased PEG-specific questionnaire that elicited positive, neutral, and negative responses. This is a novel approach in comparison to questionnaires in the literature today.</p>
<p>The results of this study indicate that most patients with advanced HNCA who went through the outpatient PEG tube program at the OCC had a positive or neutral experience and would recommend the PEG tube to patients in similar situations. This is in direct opposition to recent research into this topic. Furthermore, the highly positive results from the key questions lend compelling support for the outpatient PEG tube program. These results will offer patients and clinicians evidence of the positive or neutral impact that a PEG tube has on a patient, as well as ideas for continued improvement of the OCC program. Future steps for applying these results to practice include the development of a patient resource highlighting results, participant quotations, and basic statistical evidence garnered from this study. In addition, a thorough review of the findings has taken place with the healthcare team at the OCC with the intention of improving the outpatient PEG program based on study recommendations. In-depth qualitative research is under way to further explore this topic, allowing for a richer understanding of the patient experience and contributing to an area where there remains a paucity of knowledge.</p>
