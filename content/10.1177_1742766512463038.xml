<abstract>
<p>This study explores mass media’s agenda-setting function in a context of increased globalization to determine whether the theory, which was built upon intra-nation environments, functions in the global setting. It matches public agendas with media agendas to investigate agenda-setting effects in 11 countries worldwide, then compares media agendas across countries to consider whether inter-nation intermedia influence exists. Results suggest a general pattern of the agenda-setting function of mass media in the countries examined. The study finds evidence of inter-nation intermedia influence and thus presents a new way to look at the intermedia agenda-setting relationship – moving this research from comparisons within a local area to cross-national intermedia comparisons. Furthermore, this study checks for evidence of directional inter-nation intermedia agenda-setting. The findings suggest a complex inter-nation intermedia relationship and imply that, in the age of globalization, the simple ‘powerful West’ reasoning derived from the old days may need to be rethought and updated.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Agenda-setting is a fascinating idea and it has attracted a tremendous amount of research attention. The idea of exchanging influence among the media originally came from a simple curiosity – if media set the public agenda, then who sets the media agenda? The expansion of the parameters of agenda-setting research of who sets the public agenda to that of who sets the media agenda results in three major categories – media agenda-setting, public agenda-setting and policy agenda-setting studies. This study pertains to the first category, which deals with the influence that mass media agendas have on each other and, thus, is usually referred to as ‘intermedia agenda-setting’.</p>
<p>The idea of agenda-setting travels widely and well in this age of globalization. The phrase itself rarely requires translation and has been used in studies in at least 15 countries outside the United States. Yet, few systematic cross-national comparative studies have been undertaken. On one hand, agenda-setting may be a truly universal phenomenon that cuts without distinction across all cultures, post-industrial or pre-industrial, sectarian or secular, and all kinds of media systems, authoritarian or free, partisan or professional, sophisticated or primitive. If so, a major explanation of media influence is universal and can be studied with equal productivity in any country. On the other hand, differences in media systems may have implications for media effects at both the individual and collective level and, thus, the agenda-setting process may differ from country to country.</p>
<p>Agenda-setting research is now well into its fourth decade of existence and development. Most of the hundreds of agenda-setting studies have a made-in-the-USA label. Although there are some studies that have explored the agenda-setting process in other countries, such as Japan, Spain, and Germany, few of them have been able to examine more than one country and provide comparative information. This is because, perhaps, it is difficult to conduct multinational studies for feasibility and practicality reasons. Collecting data from different countries is a hard task, which demands extensive international cooperation and inevitable compromises.</p>
<p>A chance to replicate and extend the original agenda-setting study – a comparison of the salience of a set of objects measured in public opinion and media content – across a wide range of political and media systems, is a target of opportunity that should not be missed. One such opportunity occurred in early 2006, when PIPA (the Program on International Policy Attitudes) released the report for the BBC World Service poll of 27 countries from around the world, which asks a question that is strikingly similar to measures used in many of the agenda-setting studies in the past 40 years: ‘In the future, when historians think about the year 2005, what event of global significance do you think will be seen as most important?’ This has brought forth the possibility of a multinational agenda-setting test.</p>
<p>In this study, the results of the BBC study in 11 countries were matched with a content analysis of major media in those countries to examine the correspondence between media agendas and public agendas in a variety of political and media systems and then to compare media agendas across the countries to identify whether inter-nation intermedia agenda-setting effects may exist – for instance, whether the Western media set the agenda for other media systems nearer the periphery of the global system.</p>

<title>Literature review</title>
<sec id="section3-1742766512463038">
<title>Theoretical critiques</title>
<p>Since the initial Chapel Hill study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742766512463038">McCombs and Shaw (1972)</xref> found that the public’s perception of the relative importance of issues is determined to a strong degree by the amount of media coverage devoted to issues, hundreds of follow-up studies have found a link between public concerns and media emphasis. The important and straightforward Chapel Hill study highlights both the strengths and limitations of agenda-setting as a theory of media effects. ‘Agenda-setting’ implies causality, but correlation statistics do not serve the purpose of such a hypothesis test. The direction of agenda-setting effect was questioned by some scholars: what is the actual nature of the relationship between news and its audience? Could it be the public setting the media’s agenda and then the media reinforcing it? Maybe the media are simply responding to their audiences? Because of the unanswered causality, some scholars lamented that agenda-setting might be an apt metaphor, but it is no theory.</p>
<p>To overcome the causality questioning, some researchers have conducted research with an experimental approach, which is commonly agreed to prove causality. Longitudinal panel analysis and quasi-experimental design, such as cross-lagged correlation analysis, are two other approaches that have been employed to overcome the causality questioning.</p>
<p>The fascinating idea of agenda-setting has attracted a large amount of research attention. However, most of the hundreds of agenda-setting studies have an American context, comparing American people’s public opinions with American media agendas. As more and more evidence accumulated about mass media’s agenda-setting function in the US, some scholars began to ask instead whether agenda-setting effects existed in diverse political and cultural settings?</p>

<title>Agenda-setting in other countries/regions</title>
<p>Agenda-setting studies conducted either in other countries, or using data from other countries, are generally influenced by the American agenda-setting research approaches. Studies have been carried out in Argentina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742766512463038">Lennon, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1742766512463038">Pereson, 2002</xref>), Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742766512463038">Gadir, 1982</xref>), Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1742766512463038">Winter et al., 1982</xref>), Denmark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1742766512463038">Siune and Borre, 1975</xref>), Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742766512463038">Kepplinger et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1742766512463038">Schoenback and Semetko, 1992</xref>), Ghana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512463038">Anokwa and Salwen, 1988</xref>), Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742766512463038">Caspi, 1982</xref>), Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1742766512463038">Mikami et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1742766512463038">Ogawa, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1742766512463038">Takeshita, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1742766512463038">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1742766512463038">Takeshita and Mikami, 1995</xref>), Saudi Arabia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742766512463038">Al-Haqeel and Melkote, 1994</xref>), Singapore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742766512463038">Holaday and Kuo, 1992</xref>), South Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742766512463038">Lim, 2006</xref>), Spain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742766512463038">Berganza and Martin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742766512463038">Lopez-Escobar et al., 1998a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742766512463038">1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1742766512463038">McCombs et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742766512463038">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1742766512463038">Sanchez-Aranda et al., 1997</xref>), Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742766512463038">Asp, 1983</xref>), Taiwan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742766512463038">King, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742766512463038">1997</xref>), Venezuela (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742766512463038">Chaffee and Izcaray, 1975</xref>), and maybe elsewhere. Although dealing with varied countries, these foreign studies have certain aspects in common, one of which is that they follow the American agenda-setting paradigm in observing the agenda-setting process in the target country or countries on either the first level or the second level, or both, and compare the results with those found in American studies.</p>

<sec id="section5-1742766512463038">
<title>Intermedia agenda-setting</title>
<p>The area of research usually referred to as ‘intermedia agenda-setting’ deals with the influence that mass media agendas have on each other, which concerns how media agendas are being shaped, instead of how they are shaping the public’s agenda. That is, if one medium publishes its stories, other media will mirror that medium’s content and deal with the content in their publications as prominently as in the original medium.</p>
<p>Previous research has documented empirical evidence for this process of intermedia agenda-setting (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742766512463038">King, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742766512463038">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742766512463038">Lim, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742766512463038">Lopez-Escobar et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742766512463038">McCombs and Shaw, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742766512463038">Reese and Danielian, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1742766512463038">Takeshita, 2002</xref>). In general, at the national level, high status news organizations, such as <italic>The New York Times</italic> and Associated Press, set the agendas of other news organizations; at the local level, local newspapers and television stations influence the news agenda of their competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742766512463038">Gold and Simmons, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1742766512463038">Whitney and Becker, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>The intermedia agenda-setting process has also been examined in countries outside the US. In Spain, an examination of intermedia influence among newspapers and television during the 1995 local elections measured both first- and second-level agenda-setting effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742766512463038">Lopez-Escobar et al., 1998b</xref>). Intermedia agenda-setting at the first level was found significant. At the second level, for substantive attributes, newspaper political advertising influenced both the newspaper and television news agendas, whereas TV news, in turn, influenced the TV political advertising agenda; for affective attributes, the intermedia relationships are largely reciprocal. In Taiwan, a comparison of the issue agendas for three major daily newspapers and three television stations in Taipei during the 1992 Taiwan legislative elections found a median correlation of +0.75 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742766512463038">King, 1994</xref>). A comparison of the attribute agendas in the major Taipei newspapers for three mayoral candidates found a median correlation of +0.93 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742766512463038">King, 1997</xref>). In Japan, the framing of economic problems by two major newspapers was compared for two sets of attributes – problematic situation frames and sub-issue frames – and across two different time periods – 26 weeks and 52 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1742766512463038">Takeshita, 2002</xref>). The median correlation for these four comparisons fell between +0.72 and +0.73. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742766512463038">Lim (2006)</xref> examined the causal relationships among the issue agendas of three online news media in South Korea during two time periods, finding that the leading online newspaper influenced the issue agendas of both the secondary online newspaper and the online wire service.</p>
<p>Originally, the idea of exchanging influence among the media came from simple curiosity emerging in the early 1980s, following one decade of agenda-setting research on media’s influence on the public – if media set the public agenda, then who sets the media agenda? This is a major expansion of the parameters of agenda-setting research. Intermedia agenda-setting studies examine mainly the relationships among different media, attributing the source of the media agenda to other media. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742766512463038">McCombs (2004)</xref>, the interactions among news organizations, or intermedia agenda-setting, is one of the three key elements that shape the media’s agenda (the other two are news sources and news norms).</p>

<sec id="section6-1742766512463038">
<title>Global media systems</title>
<p>International communication scholars (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742766512463038">Hachten and Scotton, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742766512463038">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1742766512463038">Stevenson, 1994</xref>) are often struck by how differently journalism is practised in different parts of the world. They constructed ‘normative concepts’ of press systems to highlight the special features and to help distinguish the underlying elements among them. These concepts, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742766512463038">Hachten and Scotton (2007)</xref> call them, reflect the varied ideologies of press control worldwide. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742766512463038">Hachten and Scotton (2007)</xref>, there are five different country-level media systems. The Western concept is found in Western nations such as the US, the UK, Canada, Italy, Spain and France, among others. The Western concept values the right of the press to report on, comment on and criticize the government without retaliation. The other four concepts are the Authoritarian, Communist, Developmental and Revolutionary concepts. Since the mid-1990s, when democratization gained popularity, the Western concept has become more and more pervasive, although it continues to be criticized for being sensationalist and profit-oriented.</p>
<p>Despite the diverse media systems worldwide, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742766512463038">Haynes (1984)</xref> pointed out that there exists an overwhelming similarity of international news with regard to topic selection – political relationships between nations and domestic politics occurring in foreign countries are the primary focuses of foreign news across the spectrum of the world’s journalism. Among the factors that contribute to this similarity, the Western news purveyors play an important role globally. Besides the big news agencies, such as Reuters, Associated Press (AP) and Agence France-Presse (AFP), that have long been regarded as the world’s media agenda shapers, several international newspapers, magazines and broadcasting organizations are believed to be especially important among opinion leaders around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742766512463038">Rampal, 1995</xref>). These include newspapers such as the <italic>New York Times, the Times</italic> (of the UK), <italic>the Guardian</italic> (also of the UK), the <italic>International Herald Tribune</italic> (based in France), the <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic>, the <italic>Financial Times</italic> (of London); newsmagazines such as <italic>Time, Newsweek</italic> and <italic>the Economist</italic> (of the UK); and news broadcasters such as CNN and BBC (of the UK). Among them, the impact of CNN on global communication, in particular, has been extensively researched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1742766512463038">Volkmer, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The practices of Western mass communication have been more and more widely dispersed and accepted by people worldwide. The 11 September 2001 incidents and, later, the bombings in Madrid and London, as well as the tsunami and hurricanes Katrina and Rita, showed the world how crucial it is for professional journalism, signified by Western media, to supply reliable and verifiable news to their audience in times of crisis. For instance, when the 2004 Madrid bombings happened, some media first reported the connection between the calamity and the Basque separatists based on information from official sources in the José Maria Aznar government, which was in power at the time. Such claims of connection were soon challenged by the media and the public as the Basque organization refuted the allegations and evidence surfaced that the bombings were the work of Islamic terrorists. News coverage then turned around and further uncovered that the government had supplied the misleading Basque claim in an attempt to avoid damage to Aznar’s campaign in the general election. Aznar subsequently lost the election, which was generally believed to be the result of the media coverage of his intention of disentangling his own policy of backing the US in its invasion of Muslim countries from the bombings in order to win the election.</p>
<p>Since the fall of the Communist ‘second’ world, the Western concept of journalism and mass communication has become the dominant model throughout the world and is widely emulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742766512463038">Hachten and Scotton, 2007</xref>). Many non-Western nations have adopted not only the logistics of the Western press and broadcasting, but also its norms, ethical standards and philosophy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1742766512463038">
<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>By and large, previous agenda-setting research conducted in countries outside the US has generally found similar agenda-setting patterns in each individual country studied as in the US. Despite the hundreds of agenda-setting publications, however, we are unable to see a universal picture of the agenda-setting function of the mass media due to the lack of multinational comparison. More research in a wide variety of countries is needed for this.</p>
<p>This current study, while asking a traditional agenda-setting research question, whether public concerns correspond to media emphasis, is able to include multiple countries so that comparisons across different cultures are possible and a global picture may be seen. Moreover, previous agenda-setting research on intermedia agenda-setting effects is limited to the media outlets of one particular city, area or country. This study aims to move beyond this limitation. It explores international intermedia agenda-setting effects with multinational agenda data in the context of increased globalization. This is a significant extension of the research on agenda-setting. The extent to which media in different countries perceive the same events as significant is an indication of how much the media world has become globalized. Along with the rapid progress of globalization, inter-nation intermedia agenda-setting certainly deserves attention.</p>
<p>Based on previous research, the following hypotheses are proposed in this study:</p>
<list id="list1-1742766512463038" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>H1:</bold> There are positive correlations between the public object agendas and media object agendas in the countries studied.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>H2:</bold> There are positive international intermedia correlations among the object agendas of the media outlets of the countries studied.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>H3:</bold> Western countries’ media have more influence on the object agendas of non-Western countries’ media than vice versa.</p></list-item>

<title>Sampling and data sources</title>
<p>The BBC World Service Poll of 27 countries<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1742766512463038">1</xref></sup> asked respondents about the most significant global events in 2005: ‘In the future, when historians think about the year 2005, what event of global significance do you think will be seen as most important?’ The poll was conducted for the BBC World Service by the international polling firm, GlobeScan, together with the Program on International Policy Attitudes (PIPA) at the University of Maryland. The poll was conducted during October, November and December 2005, with a total sample of 32,439 people.</p>
<p>A remarkable finding of the poll is how similar the assessments were across countries. The top three events cited worldwide, the war in Iraq, the Asian tsunami and hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the US, were also among the three most frequently cited in a large number of countries. As Steven Kull, director of PIPA, says, the extent to which people in different countries perceive the same events as significant is an indication of how much the world has become globalized.</p>
<p>The BBC poll data were used as a measure of the public agenda in each country. For media agenda, data were collected from the LexisNexis Academic database.</p>
<p>From the 27 surveyed countries, first, the seven English-as-official-language countries were selected for this study: Australia (AU), Canada (CA), the United Kingdom (UK), India (IN), Kenya (KE), the Philippines (PH) and the United States (US).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1742766512463038">2</xref></sup> With the availability of bilingual helpers, the list of investigated countries was then expanded, with Spanish-as-official-language countries Argentina (AR), Mexico (MX) and Spain (ES) and French-as-official-language country France (FR) being included. As a result, 11 countries in six different continents (Asia, Africa, Europe, Latin America, North America, Oceania) and newspapers in three different languages were included in this study.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1742766512463038">
<title>Variable operationalization and data collection</title>
<p>For each country, the agenda-setting effect analysis involves two major variables: public agenda (percentage of the public in a particular country that cited a particular event as Most Significant Event (MSE), as reported in the BBC poll) and media agenda (frequency of news reports on a particular event in the major newspapers of a particular country during 2005, as returned in the search of the LexisNexis Academic database).</p>
<p>In the LexisNexis searches, ‘keyword (MSE) “in Headline, Lead paragraph, Terms”’ was used as the search criterion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1742766512463038">3</xref></sup> To identify what papers qualify as ‘major newspapers’ in a country, first the World Press Trends, published by the World Association of Newspapers, was consulted for a list of top national dailies (by circulation). Several scholars and librarians who are specialized in the area of international communication were also consulted to further ensure validity. Additionally, which newspaper(s) to include in the search was decided in accordance with availability in the LexisNexis database. For example, if a country’s top national daily was not included in the database, the second paper, if available in the database, was considered. As a balanced result, the following newspapers were included in the searches for media agendas: <italic>Herald Sun</italic>, the <italic>Daily Telegraph</italic> (Australia); the <italic>Toronto Star</italic> (Canada); the <italic>Daily Telegraph, the Guardian</italic> (the United Kingdom); the <italic>Times of India, Hindustan Times</italic> (India); the <italic>East African</italic> (Kenya); <italic>Philippine Daily Inquirer</italic> (the Philippines); <italic>USA Today</italic>, the <italic>New York Times</italic> (the United States); <italic>La Nacion</italic> (Argentina); <italic>El Universal</italic> (Mexico); <italic>El Pais, El Mundo</italic> (Spain); <italic>Le Figaro, L’Equipe</italic> (France).</p>
<p>The public agenda (percentage) and media agenda (frequency) data collected were entered into SPSS for statistical analysis. Correlation tests were conducted to observe the relationship between the public object agendas and media object agendas in each country, and the inter-nation intermedia agenda-setting effects.</p>

<title>Cross-lagged correlation analyses for causal relationships</title>
<p>Traditionally, agenda-setting theory hypothesizes that the agenda-setting function of news media causes the correlation between the media and public ordering of priorities. Over the years, the major criticism of agenda-setting research has been that correlation itself does not prove causation. To overcome this weakness, this current study employs the cross-lagged correlation technique to explore the directional causality of the inter-nation intermedia agenda-setting process. The validity of this cross-lagged correlation method is justified by a few recent agenda-setting publications, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1742766512463038">Roberts and McCombs (1994)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742766512463038">King (1994)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742766512463038">Lopez-Escobar et al. (1998b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742766512463038">Lim (2006)</xref>.</p>
<p>The cross-lagged correlation technique was first suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742766512463038">Campbell (1963)</xref> as a method of studying mutual effects with continuous variables. It can be used to investigate causal relations without experimental manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1742766512463038">Rozelle and Campbell, 1969</xref>). The cross-lagged approach investigates causality in the absence of a true experiment design, but in a passive manner – that is, instead of addressing the traditional causal question of whether X causes Y, the cross-lagged analysis examines which is the predominant cause-effect direction. Two variables, X and Y, are measured at two points of time, Time 1 and Time 2. Six correlations can then be computed. The synchronous correlations, R<sub>X1Y1</sub> and R<sub>X2Y2</sub>, refer to those typically obtained in static correlation studies. Correlations between the same variable at different points in time, R<sub>X1X2</sub> and R<sub>Y1Y2</sub>, are referred to as auto-correlations. The causal analysis focuses on a comparison of the two cross-lagged correlations, R<sub>X1Y2</sub> and R<sub>Y1X2</sub>. A cross-lagged analysis uses the following reasoning: if X has a stronger effect on Y than vice versa, then the correlation between Xt<sub>1</sub> and Yt<sub>2</sub> (R<sub>X1Y2</sub>) should be greater than the correlation between Yt<sub>1</sub> and Xt<sub>2</sub> (R<sub>Y1X2</sub>).</p>
<p>H3 is a directional hypothesis, in other words, regarding cause and effect. To test H3, cross-lagged correlation analysis was conducted using object agendas of the multiple countries’ media. Cross-lagged correlations offer two advantages for hypothesis-testing. First, two competing hypotheses are examined simultaneously: X causes Y and Y causes X. Furthermore, both of these hypotheses can be assessed by the Rozelle-Campbell Baseline, the level of correlation to be expected on the basis of the autocorrelations and synchronous correlations alone.</p>
<p>To obtain media agenda data in different countries at two time points, ‘Time 1’ was defined as the first week of the first occurrence of the event and ‘Time 2’ as the second week.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1742766512463038">4</xref></sup> For practical reasons, the long-running global topics of 2005, such as the ‘war in Iraq’, ‘global warming’ and ‘avian flu’, were excluded. As a result, the ‘Asian tsunami (26 December 2004)’, ‘US hurricanes (29 August 2005)’, the ‘death of [the] [P]ope (2 April 2005)’, ‘London bombings (7 July 2005)’, ‘Bali Bombings (1 October 2005)’ and ‘Pakistan Earthquake (8 October 2005)’ were the remaining six MSEs included in this cross-lagged analysis to test H3. The numbers of news reports on a particular event in the major newspapers of a particular country at Time 1 and Time 2 were then collected, respectively, as returned in the search of the LexisNexis Academic database.</p>

<title>Relationships between public object agendas and media object agendas</title>
<p>The overall correlation between media and public object agendas was tested first: for all 11 countries studied, the general correlation turned out to be significant (<italic>r</italic> = 0.573, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>N</italic> = 9*11 = 99). Thus, the study further looked into the correlations for each of the individual countries. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1742766512463038">Table 1</xref> shows, the correspondences between the public and media agendas in 10 of the 11 countries are highly significant (median correlation <italic>r</italic> = 0.855), with the US having the astoundingly highest significant correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.982). The UK has the lowest significant correlation among the 10 countries, but it is still considered very strong (<italic>r</italic> = 0.692). The correlation for Mexico turned out to be non-significant. The precise reason for this is unknown. One possible explanation lies in the availability of data sources in the LexisNexis database – the study included only <italic>El Universal</italic> in the search because it is the only top Mexican national daily included in the database. <italic>El Universal</italic> is one of the oldest and most respected newspapers in Mexico, but its circulation has declined to third place in the country, according to World Press Trends statistics (2005). And this suggests that it is not very influential in public opinion in Mexico.</p>

<p>Because of the aforementioned evidence of a global agenda-setting phenomenon, it is reasonable to expect international intermedia relationships. To test Hypothesis 2 – ‘there are positive international intermedia correlations among the agendas of the media outlets of the countries studied’ – the 55 sets of bivariate correlations among the media agendas of the 11 countries were calculated. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1742766512463038">Table 2</xref> illustrates, 20 pairs of bivariate correlations were found significant, with the highest significant correlation being 0.950 (Canada and Argentina) and the lowest significant correlation being 0.670 (Argentina and Australia). Hypothesis 2 is thus partially supported.</p>

<p>Specifically, as the highlighted numbers in the table indicate, the US media agenda corresponds significantly to the media agendas of the UK, Canada, Spain and Argentina; the UK media agenda is associated significantly positively with the media agendas of Canada, Spain and Argentina, as well as the US; the Canada media agenda corresponds significantly to the media agendas of Australia, Spain, Argentina and France, as well as the US and the UK; the Australia media agenda corresponds significantly to the media agendas of India, the Philippines, Spain, Argentina and France, as well as Canada; the India media agenda corresponds significantly to the media agendas of the Philippines and France, as well as Australia; the Kenya media agenda corresponds significantly to the Philippines media agenda; the Philippines media agenda corresponds significantly to that of France, as well as the media agendas of Australia, India and Kenya; the Spain media agenda corresponds significantly to the media agendas of Argentina and France, as well as the US, the UK, Canada and Australia; the Argentina media agenda corresponds significantly to those of the US, the UK, Canada, Australia and Spain; and the France media agenda is associated significantly with those of Australia, India and the Philippines.</p>
<p>In these international intermedia agenda-setting tests, Mexico appears again as erratic – its media agenda is not statistically significantly associated with those of any other countries. The study attributes this to the same reason as explained in the findings and discussion regarding Hypothesis 1 – that <italic>El Universal</italic> might not be a powerful representative of the general media agenda in Mexico. It should be pointed out, however, that Mexico’s correlations with the US (.663), Canada (.496) and Argentina (.555) are fairly strong, although not statistically significant.</p>
<p>Intermedia agenda-setting has been well documented, although not in an internationally comparative context or at a global level. As mentioned before, most previous agenda-setting research on intermedia agenda-setting effects is limited to the media outlets of one particular city, area or country. For example, the pioneering studies typically focused on the vertical relationships between national news agencies and local newspapers in a specific country. Other studies focused on the horizontal relationships between different types of media outlets, such as newspaper versus television, in a local area. This study intends to move beyond this limitation to test cross-national intermedia influence.</p>
<p>Overall, although there is no perfect agreement, our hypothesis about international intermedia agenda-setting is supported in 20 of the 55 sets of comparisons. The significant correspondences suggest that an international intermedia agenda-setting function may exist among the news media in different countries about the globally significant events of 2005. Without empirical evidence, we don’t want to speculate on why a particular country’s media agenda is associated with the media agendas of some countries, but not others (and, thus, we won’t assume that the intermedia correlation between the US and France is non-significant because the French and Americans don’t like each other in many ways, or that the UK and Canada have significant intermedia correlations because, as a charter member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, Canada has connections with the UK in many aspects, etc.). However, this phenomenon can be discussed in general. News sources, other news media and news norms can all play a direct or indirect role in shaping the media agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742766512463038">McCombs, 2004</xref>). In particular, interactions and relatedness, such as colonial ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742766512463038">Atwood, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742766512463038">Nnaemeka and Richstad, 1980</xref>) and language groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742766512463038">Kariel and Rosenvall, 1983</xref>), can bear significant influence on this inter-nation intermedia matter.</p>
<p>The inter-nation intermedia agenda-setting phenomenon discovered here can be attributed to three factors: (1) the nature of the BBC survey (it asks people from around the world ‘what event of <italic>global</italic> significance do you think will be seen as most important’, and in accordance with this, this study collected media data on these <italic>global</italic> events); (2) the Internet as a global news medium, which has made international intermedia agenda-setting possible because most of the media outlets have put their news products online, allowing instant access by other media outlets from around the world; and (3) most importantly, the considerable power of Western media, the global influence of which has been well documented in previous research literature.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that the existence of an international intermedia agenda-setting function of the mass media around the world is not <italic>proved</italic> by the correlations found in this part of the study, of course, but the evidence is in line with the conditions that must exist if such a function does occur.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1742766512463038">
<title>Cross-lagged comparisons</title>
<p>Based on the inter-nation intermedia correlations found in the previous section, this study further speculated what kind of directions of intermedia agenda-setting, if any, exist in this seemingly interconnected global media world. As stated earlier, the Western media’s global influence has been well documented and this study thus hypothesized such a directional international intermedia agenda-setting process. Such a directional hypothesis concerns cause and effect. To test H3, cross-lagged correlation analysis was conducted using the object agendas of the 11 countries’ media.</p>
<p>Drawing conclusions for H3 involves how one defines the term, ‘Western’. It has been found quite challenging to define Western versus non-Western clearly. The basic definition of what constitutes ‘the West’ varies, expanding and contracting over time, in relation to various circumstances. It is dependent on the context, which can be political, economic, cultural, linguistic, religious, and so on. The exact scope of the ‘Western countries’, thus, has to be somewhat subjective in nature, depending on what criteria are employed. There is always room for debate. In general, however, it is commonly agreed that, in a geopolitical context, it includes the countries of Western Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. These are Western European or Western European-derived nations, which enjoy relatively strong economies and stable governments, tolerate free Christian institutions, have chosen democracy as a form of governance, favour capitalism and free international trade, and have some form of political and military alliance or cooperation.</p>
<p>In accordance with the commonly agreed geopolitical scope, six countries investigated in this study are defined as Western countries (AU, CA, UK, US, ES, FR) and the remaining five are non-Western (IN, KE, PH, AR, MX). Given this criterion, four composite variables were computed: the combined Western media agendas at Time 1 and Time 2, and non-Western media agendas at Time 1 and Time 2. Cross-lagged correlation analysis was conducted to determine the direction of intermedia agenda-setting between the Western and non-Western countries. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1742766512463038">Figure 1</xref> shows the correlation of the Western media agenda at Time 1 with the non-Western media agenda at Time 2 compared with the reverse time order: non-Western media at Time 1 and Western media at Time 2. The direction of influence is not clear-cut because both cross-lagged correlations, .617 and .645, exceed the baseline of .607, which suggests reciprocal influence.</p>

<p>The fact that this study has not found adequate evidence for an overall flow of media agenda from Western to non-Western countries suggests, on one hand, that the decades-old problems pointed out by the psychology-laden NWICO (New World Information and Communication Order) debates, which concern themselves with the impact of Western powers, may need to be rethought to enhance our understanding of the global media landscape in the age of globalization. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742766512463038">Lynch (2008)</xref> pointed out, the ‘minority world journalism’ is now growing and divided, taking either a modernization approach, which is geared more towards the implantation of Western-style rationales and methods for reporting, or a critical pedagogical approach, which is meant to empower the indigenous manpower and thinking to enable participatory media development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742766512463038">2008</xref>: 291). This may suggest that a reviving call for structural reform is due in the world information and communication order.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it also raises questions about whether this lack of evidence may be due to sampling bias (at the country level, all the non-Western countries included in the study are either English or Spanish countries, which are generally closer to the West in many aspects than many other countries in the world; at the media level, only newspapers are examined) or data deficiency (limited data for some non-Western countries). The definition for Time 1 and Time 2 in testing this hypothesis (two consecutive weeks) may be another reason. Future research may test the same hypothesis by analysing media content for constructed weeks or a more extended period of time.</p>
<p>As globalization accelerates, the geographical and cultural borders for news are becoming more and more blurred. The confluence of an increasingly open political climate, growing economies in many non-Western countries and the wonders of technology may have contributed to the blurring of unilateral direction of influence from Western to non-Western countries.</p>
<p>This study looked for evidence of directional inter-nation intermedia agenda-setting based on the assumption that the media of the politically, economically and culturally pivotal and powerful West have stronger influence on their non-Western counterparts than vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1742766512463038">Wu, 1998</xref>). The findings suggest that the international intermedia agenda-setting process could be far more complex than we can disentangle with cross-lagged correlation techniques and imply that, in the age of globalization, a simple ‘powerful West’ reasoning derived from the old days could possibly be outdated. This having been said, the ‘powerful West’ hypothesis cannot be dismissed lightly. Instead, the emphasis is that now that the media world has become more and more globalized, the information flow in the intermedia agenda-setting process may be so complicated that it requires more sophisticated measurements and analytical methods to explicate.</p>

<title>Conclusions and future research</title>
<p>By taking a cross-nationally comparative perspective on mass media’s agenda-setting function, this exploratory study offers some initial insights into the agenda-setting process in a global context. The first contribution of this study is that it offers a general big picture of the object agenda-setting function of mass media around the world, rather than giving an account of one or two countries, like most previous research has done. This was made possible by the multinational data source, which allows cross-national comparisons. Another significance of this study is that it presents a new way to look at the intermedia agenda-setting relationship – that is, it moves this research from vertical (for example, national wire services vs. local newspapers) or horizontal (for example, local newspapers vs. local television) comparisons within a country or a local area to multinational intermedia comparisons. Given the rapid development of globalization and its impact on media outlets around the world, this is certainly noteworthy. This study thus opens the way to a new frontier in both international communication and agenda-setting research.</p>
<p>Most significantly, this study is the first to explore directional intermedia agenda-setting between Western and non-Western countries. Although this study did not acquire adequate evidence to support its hypothesis (it could be argued that the samples of countries and media outlets were too limited, or the content data source, LexisNexis, is inadequate for certain countries/media), this innovative approach itself is seminal and worth noting. The initial observations of this study should not be considered conclusive. Overshadowing the study is the unanswered question, ‘Do Western countries’ media indeed still have a stronger influence on the media agenda of non-Western countries than vice versa?’ The inconclusive findings of this study certainly imply that further investigation is needed. Future research should aim at clarifying this issue, if conditions allow, with representative samples at both the country level and the media level. Future studies can address this issue by expanding country and media outlet samples or using other data sources than LexisNexis.</p>
<p>The 11-country sample is not systematically selected or representative of some kind of random sample of countries, media or news coverage. In addition, the number of media sampled in each country is not the same. These reservations should be taken into account when assessing the results of this study and developing future research.</p>
<p>Due to language barriers, this study was able to examine only those countries where the official languages are English, Spanish or French. Future research may include countries with other official languages to see an even bigger picture of the media world, if coders of other languages are available. Additionally, due to resource constraints, this study examined only major newspapers’ content as representatives of the media agenda in each of the countries. Future research may expand the news content sample to multiple media types. What if television or radio outlets regard the world’s most significant events or most important problems in a different way from newspapers? What if, determined by the particular nature of radio as a news medium, inter-nation intermedia influence across radio stations around the world is virtually impossible? Most of all, as the Internet has emerged as the ‘fourth mass medium’, and especially as it has drastically impacted the global media world as the newest context of news, it is important to pay attention to Internet news content in future research.</p>
<p>The prospects for news content selection and flow look better than ever before at the dawn of the 21st century. Thus, international communication, or global communication, as it is more trendily labelled nowadays, via the channels of news media appears more important than ever, and definitely needs to be further examined in this age of globalization. With the advent of more advanced technologies and more channels to access information worldwide, global news exchange will be much more rapid and diversified. The existing and newly discovered hypotheses pertaining to this research topic will have to be updated constantly.</p>
<p>These factors, in combination with the results of the content analyses in the current study, suggest that the context of increased globalization offers a rich opportunity to expand our theoretical horizons. The author hopes this study will ignite the potential for new theoretical developments in both agenda-setting and international communication.</p>

<p>For Mexico and Argentina, because only one top national daily of each country was available in the LexisNexis database and the searches using this criterion returned a very limited number of news reports for each object (fewer than four for the entire year), we expanded the searches using ‘in full text’ instead.</p>

<p>Research literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1742766512463038">Winter and Eyal, 1981</xref>) suggests that the optimal time span for observing agenda-setting effects is four weeks or more, which applies primarily to the process from media to public. Literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742766512463038">Riffe et al., 1993</xref>) also suggests the superiority of constructed week sampling over simple random and consecutive day samples of newspaper content. Since this study involves ‘events’ (rather than ‘issues’), which started mostly as breaking news, and examines the agenda-setting process from media to media, constructed week sampling does not serve the research purpose, and a four-week period could be too long to capture media response. This study adopts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742766512463038">Lopez-Escobar et al.’s (1998b)</xref> sampling method, which is two consecutive weeks of the target period.</p>
