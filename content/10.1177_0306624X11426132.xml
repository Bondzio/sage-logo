<abstract>
<p>Reintegration of offenders following incarceration is most successful if matched to the needs of offenders, victims, and the community. This study explored child sex offenders’ expectations for and experiences of reintegration into the community. A longitudinal design was used in which semistructured interviews covered issues identified in the literature as being related to reintegration. Nine offenders were interviewed within 1 week prior to release, 3 months post release, and 6 months post release. Interviews were analysed using thematic analyses producing six key themes. The interviews revealed that most of the participants feared their release from prison into the community and once released struggled to live in society. Overall, reintegration planning was simplistic and aimed primarily to manage risk factors rather than promote reintegration. Those participants who reported most satisfaction with their adjustment following release had more comprehensive reintegration plans, which enabled them to visualise what life would be like after release.</p>

<body>
<p>Adult sex offenders of children, or child sex offenders, are frequently sentenced to imprisonment with many of them receiving treatment in specialised programmes prior to release into the community. The combination of imprisonment and treatment reflects the two main types of justice responses to crime that aim to punish offenders (retributive justice) and to rehabilitate offenders (reformative justice). Retributive justice assumes that punishment deters crime, discourages offenders from committing further crimes, and illustrates to society the consequences for violations of the law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306624X11426132">Darley &amp; Pittman, 2003</xref>). Custodial sentences are a common form of punishment for more serious crime under the retributive approach. Reformative justice assumes that there is something wrong with the offender and that he or she will benefit from treatment.</p>
<p>There are currently two main models guiding the treatment of child sex offenders in New Zealand. The “risk-need-responsivity model” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306624X11426132">Andrews &amp; Bonta, 2010</xref>) assumes that the probability of recidivism will be minimized if an individual’s dynamic risk factors (e.g., deviant sexual arousal) are reduced through need-specific treatment and managed by teaching individuals how to recognise and cope with their individual risk factors. The “good lives model” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306624X11426132">Ward, 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306624X11426132">2002b</xref>) assumes that criminal behaviour occurs when there is a problem in the way an individual’s self-determined needs (e.g., close relationships, happiness) are sought, thus, treatment is focused on constructing an individual’s “ideal self” or “ideal life” and giving offenders the internal capabilities (e.g., social skills) and external environment (e.g., opportunities and supports) to translate their “good life” into a reality. These models have in common a focus on individual factors that contribute to an offender’s decision to offend. While the primary reasons for addressing or modifying these factors (i.e., to reduce risk or to enhance the opportunity of the individual to lead a more prosocial life) is contended, it is a common belief that offenders are treatable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306624X11426132">Andrews &amp; Bonta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11426132">Hanson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306624X11426132">Schmucker &amp; Losel, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In the risk-need-responsivity model, distinctions are made between criminogenic needs—those that are considered to contribute directly to offending—and noncriminogenic needs (e.g., housing, financial problems, self-esteem, health risk factors that indirectly contribute to offending). Criminogenic needs are considered to be factors that, if not addressed, will progress and contribute to an offender’s risk of recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306624X11426132">Andrews &amp; Bonta, 2010</xref>). Treatment typically targets a number of criminogenic needs, including intimacy deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X11426132">Ward, McCormack, &amp; Hudson, 1997</xref>), poor social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X11426132">Biswell, 2003</xref>), attitudes or values tolerant of sexual assault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306624X11426132">Hanson &amp; Bussière, 1998</xref>), problems with sexual self-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11426132">Hanson et al., 2002</xref>), and emotional self-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306624X11426132">Gottfredson &amp; Hirshi, 1990</xref>). More specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X11426132">Hanson and Harris (2000)</xref> have identified the acute risk factors that are associated with sexual recidivism, including substance abuse, negative mood (depression, anxiety), anger or hostility, and opportunities for victim access.</p>
<p>Noncriminogenic needs are not directly targeted during treatment because they are considered to be only indirectly related to offending and therefore weakly associated with recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X11426132">Beech &amp; Mann, 2002</xref>). However, recent research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306624X11426132">Willis and Grace (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X11426132">2009</xref>) suggested that reintegration variables or noncriminogenic needs may be causally linked to reoffending, with low-quality accommodation arrangements in particular considered to be strongly linked to recidivism.</p>
<p>Ultimately, imprisoned offenders are released into the community. As a group, child sex offenders are one of the most feared groups of offenders due to the insidious and socially condemned nature of their offending, making reintegration particularly difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306624X11426132">Willis, Levenson, &amp; Ward, 2010</xref>). To counter such disadvantage, reentry of child sex offenders into society may be more successful if it is a holistic process, in which reintegrative initiatives match the needs of offenders, victims, and the community, minimising the risk of recidivism and developing offenders into prosocial citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306624X11426132">Austin, 2001</xref>). However, reintegration initiatives worldwide are often considered to lack proper planning and coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306624X11426132">Swain, 2004</xref>). Commonly, offenders return to live in communities in which they are despised and isolated with limited or no support and restricted in their job prospects and accommodation arrangements, which ultimately hinders long-term treatment generalisation and true reintegration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306624X11426132">Willis et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, offenders may fail to adapt to a new lifestyle and become a productive member of society. It seems that we lack the knowledge to conceptualise reintegration for what it is: a long-term process of lifestyle change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306624X11426132">Ward, 2002a</xref>), one that cannot be simply managed according to narrow risk assessment and measured by the presence or absence of recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306624X11426132">Ward, 2002b</xref>).</p>
<p>To date, research on the process of reintegration for offenders has focused on intervention programme evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306624X11426132">Petersilia, 2004</xref>), risk management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X11426132">Willis &amp; Grace, 2009</xref>), and the needs of ex-prisoners in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306624X11426132">Graffam, Shinkfield, Lavelle, &amp; McPherson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306624X11426132">Petersilia, 2003</xref>). Although the available literature is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306624X11426132">Graffam et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X11426132">Taxman, Young, &amp; Byrne, 2002</xref>), four broad general offender need areas have been identified for successful reintegration. These include individual needs such as the availability of social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X11426132">Hanson &amp; Harris, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X11426132">Hepburn &amp; Griffin, 2004</xref>), accommodation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306624X11426132">Hammett, Roberts, &amp; Kennedy, 2001</xref>), and employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X11426132">Hanson &amp; Morton-Bourgon, 2005</xref>). It is, however, likely that child sex offender needs differ from the nonsexual offender population and in particular that reintegration barriers exist due to the socially condemned nature of their crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306624X11426132">Wilson, Huculak, &amp; McWhinnie, 2002</xref>). In recent research conducted in New Zealand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306624X11426132">Willis and Grace (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X11426132">2009</xref>) highlighted how poor reintegration planning is likely to be associated with not only unsuccessful reintegration but also a greater risk of sexual recidivism.</p>
<p>Child sex offenders in New Zealand who are sentenced to prison attend one of two specialist child sex offender prison-based treatment programmes: Te Piriti (Auckland) or Kia Marama (Christchurch). This study was conducted with offenders within Te Piriti. These two units primarily operate under the risk-need-responsivity model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306624X11426132">Andrews and Bonta (2010)</xref>. Each unit holds 60 men, with approximately 40 involved in treatment at any one time. A cognitive-behavioural/social learning theory–based approach is used within both treatment units to promote behaviour change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11426132">Hudson, Wales, &amp; Ward, 1998</xref>). However, in addition, Te Piriti has an explicit mission statement to adhere to provide treatment within a bicultural context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X11426132">Larsen, Robertson, Hillman, &amp; Hudson, 1998</xref>). For further information about the Te Piriti programme, see the evaluation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306624X11426132">Nathan, Wilson, and Hillman (2003)</xref>.</p>
<p>Treatment within the secure units is followed by temporary graduated release and final release. Release plans are initiated by the reintegration coordinator located within the prison treatment units. Offenders are asked to identify potential support people. Those with no support people are encouraged to build relationships with members of the church or through application with New Zealand Prisoner Aid and Rehabilitation Society (PARS) for an appropriate support volunteer. Social support meetings within the prison are conducted after completion of the victim empathy module of the treatment programme in which reintegration issues such as accommodation, Community Probation Service programmes (often a condition of release), community support, victim issues, education, employment, and any other individualised needs are discussed. The offender enters the community under the supervision of a probation officer, and any other treatment or conditions as dictated by the Parole Board are coordinated by the probation officer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306624X11426132">Department of Corrections, 2005</xref>). However, in practice, the process of reintegration may lack coordination and initiatives that recognise the real barriers to reintegration that exist in the community for sex offenders.</p>
<p>The current study attempted to understand reintegration from the perspective of child sex offenders by talking to offenders about their reintegration into the community before and after release from prison. The present study was guided by two aims. The first aim was to describe child sex offenders’ <italic>expectations</italic> for reintegration and the associated factors that participants anticipated would aim or hinder their reintegration. The second aim was to describe child sex offenders’ actual <italic>experiences</italic> that aided or hindered their reintegration into the community. Information about the factors that hindered or helped child sex offenders reintegrate from their perspective could be used to develop a more thorough and needs-based approach to reintegration.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>All potential participants were adult male offenders above the age of 18 convicted of a child sexual offence. New Zealand Department of Corrections records indicated that 76 offenders were incarcerated within the Te Piriti unit at some point during the 4-month period in which participants were recruited. From this population of 76 offenders, 25 offenders agreed to participate in the study should they be released during the duration of the study. Only 27 offenders were released over this period, 9 of whom had previously volunteered to participate in the study.</p>
<p>Demographic data were collected for each participant and are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0306624X11426132">Table 1</xref>. In this table “sexual index offence” refers to the most serious offence for which the offender had been convicted in the current sentence. The sexual index offence may not represent the most serious offence the offender has ever committed, as there may be more serious offences that the offender has committed for which he had served previous sentences, or an offender may have committed more serious unreported offences. “Combined risk score” refers to the offenders’ assessed risk of sexual reoffending based on a combined risk score on the Automated Sexual Recidivism Scale (ASRS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306624X11426132">Skelton, Riley, Wales, &amp; Vess, 2006</xref>) and STABLE-2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11426132">Hanson, Harris, Scott, &amp; Helmus, 2007</xref>) as collected by the first author via file audit. The ASRS is a New Zealand–validated brief actuarial instrument designed to estimate the probability of sexual recidivism among adult males who have been convicted of at least one sexual offence against a child or nonconsenting adult. The ASRS includes items that assess static factors relating to risk and has been found to accurately classify sex offenders into four risk categories from low to high risk of sexual recidivism. The STABLE-2007 assesses six relatively stable factors (significant social influences, intimacy deficits, sexual self-regulation, attitudes supportive of sexual assault, cooperation with supervision, and general self-regulation) that predict sexual recidivism.</p>

<p>Reconviction data were collected via file audit at 6 months post release (T3). One of the participants (P2) was convicted over this period for nonsexual offending, with no offenders reconvicted for sexualised offending. However, sexual offending is a low–base rate behaviour, and therefore, the rate of sexual offending within the limited study period (6 months) was expected to be low. In a North American sample, at 1 year post release, the average rate of sexual recidivism was found to be only 4% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306624X11426132">Hanson &amp; Morton-Bourgon, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0306624X11426132">
<title>Interview Schedule</title>
<p>Semistructured interviews were conducted at prerelease (T1) and postrelease (T2, T3) in accordance with three related interview schedules. The semistructured interview format allowed the interviewer to approach the interview with an open framework in which a conversational style was used to focus on specific and sometimes sensitive topics. A deductive approach was used to develop the interview schedules based on the existing literature of reintegrative factors. This produced 10 key topics of enquiry: accommodation, social support, employment, knowledge/skills/attributes, financial situation, physical/mental health, stress, culture/identity, long-term goals, and community responses.</p>
<p>Prerelease interviews (T1) began with initial questions regarding the participants’ expectations for release and experience of the release planning process while in prison, designed to elicit information on participants’ preparation for reintegration (e.g., “What are the things that you fear upon your release from prison?” “What do you anticipate you will need or could need to help you successfully reintegrate into the community?”). Postrelease interviews (T2, T3) began with initial open-ended questions regarding participants’ experience of reintegration at 3 or 6 months after release (e.g., “What types of things have you had difficulty managing in the last 3 months?”), with particular emphasis on how their experience may have differed from their prior expectations. While it was accepted that some participants would talk freely about many of the key topics of enquiry during initial open-ended questioning, it was acknowledged that others would require prompts to elicit information specific to the 10 key topics of enquiry (e.g., “Who are the important people in your life?” “What type of support does each of these people provide for you?”).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0306624X11426132">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Ethical approval for the study was granted by the University of Auckland Human Participants and Ethics Committee and the New Zealand Department of Corrections Ethics Committee.</p>
<p>Psychologists within the Te Piriti unit introduced the study to potential participants in an open forum to all offenders, outlining the purpose and proposed methodology, at three points during the 4-month recruitment period. The first author was notified by the reintegration worker within the Te Piriti Unit as soon as each participant had a confirmed release date by the New Zealand Parole Board. Participants were formally interviewed for approximately 60 to 90 min individually, face-to-face, as close as possible to their release date (prerelease) at the Te Piriti unit or transfer prison. Postrelease interviews in the community at 3 and 6 months took place at the nearest Probation Service Centre to the participants’ residence. Prior to the start of each interview, the researcher outlined the bounds of confidentiality, the consequences of spontaneous disclosure of offending, and their right to withdraw from the study or stop the tape at anytime. All participants gave permission for the interview to be audiotaped and for handwritten notes to be taken. In addition, participants were advised of the interview process and the topics to be discussed. All participants, regardless of ethnicity, were given the opportunity to request that a cultural consultant sit in on the interview(s) to provide support; however, all participants declined this opportunity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0306624X11426132">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The audiotaped interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed by the first author. A total of 10% of interview transcripts were reviewed by the second author to assist in the interpretation of the data. A theoretical thematic analysis according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11426132">Braun and Clarke (2006)</xref> was conducted with transcribed data organised in separate word processing documents according to semantic content to capture broad features of the data according to the specific research questions: (a) child sex offenders’ expectations for reintegration into the community and (b) child sex offenders’ experiences of reintegration into the community. The interview data from the two postrelease interviews were combined in the analysis because there appeared to be little difference in the participants’ concerns across the two time periods. Data were then sorted into the 10 topics of enquiry, whether or not comments were made in response to a particular question about that topic. This produced 10 word processing documents for prerelease data and an additional 10 documents for each of the postrelease data points.</p>
<p>From here, fragments of text were coded that were identified as sharing similarities in content or meaning related to the research and manually highlighted on hard copy documents. These coded responses were then collated by copying and pasting data extracts into more refined versions of the original word processing documents to more clearly organise the data into potential themes.</p>
<p>At this stage, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11426132">Braun and Clarke (2006)</xref> identified as a thematic visual map was used to investigate the frequency of coding and the relationship between coding, subthemes, and themes via consultation between the research team and the New Zealand Department of Corrections Maori Cultural Consultant. Themes were then finalised when it was felt that they represented the dataset and adequately addressed the research questions.</p>

<title>Analysis of Interviews</title>
<sec id="section7-0306624X11426132">
<title>Expectations for Release</title>
<p>Six major themes were identified from the prerelease interviews that fell within the 10 topics of enquiry. The reintegration issues identified in the literature did not completely match the reintegration expectations or fears of child sex offenders in the current research. Notably, none of the participants regarded cultural identity issues as important.</p>
<sec id="section8-0306624X11426132">
<title>Fear of community members’ reactions</title>

Participants’ responses reflected different views about significant problems that have an impact on accommodation planning. These included problems of institutionalisation and the uncertainty for offenders not knowing where they would live.</p>

<title>Need employment to support self</title>
<p>The participants described plans to financially support themselves, initially by obtaining “steps to freedom” financial support and then, applying for a benefit. Participants’ expected that they would need to obtain employment as they perceived that they would be unable to support themselves financially by relying on the benefit as a sole source of income. However, participants also expected that employment would be difficult to obtain. Despite these difficulties, participants reflected on the intrinsic value of working for a living, particularly the associated satisfaction and increases in self-esteem.</p>

<title>Experiences After Release</title>
<p>Seven major themes emerged from the postrelease interviews that fell within the 10 areas of enquiry. The reintegration issues identified in the literature were not identical to the reintegration experiences of participants in the current research. The data from postrelease interviews at 3 (T2) and 6 months (T3) were merged at the data analysis stage, as participants noted few differences in their experience of reintegration between the two time points.</p>

<title>Negative community reactions were stressful</title>
<p>Many participants experienced negative community reactions to their release and believed that they were persecuted on a number of different ways by the community, particularly in workplaces or in seeking accommodation. Their experiences of persecution ranged from ostracism, discrimination, attempts to defame character and reputation, prejudgements of character, malicious rumours, intrusions of privacy (e.g., spied on by neighbours), community petition, and verbal and physical threats to property and person.</p>

<title>Obtaining employment is important</title>
<p>Most participants discussed financial difficulties while in receipt of an invalid, pension, or unemployment benefit as they considered this source of income as insufficient to meet basic needs (e.g., food, rent). As a result, most participants considered that obtaining employment was particularly important. However, many participants frequently experienced difficulty finding employment that could be flexible enough to allow adherence to parole conditions, while others experienced frequent rejection by employers due to their history of sexual offending.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Overall, child sex offender participants in the current study struggled to reintegrate into the community. Furthermore, changes in the experience of reintegration were not apparent between the 3-month and 6-month interviews. The most significant barriers experienced were unfamiliar and unstable accommodation arrangements, difficulty obtaining employment, and limited personal and professional support. These barriers, clearly identified by participants in the current research, reflect recent findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306624X11426132">Willis and Grace (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X11426132">2009</xref>) that the quality and comprehensiveness of accommodation, employment, and social support contributes strongly to reintegration.</p>
<p>Prerelease, participants feared returning to society as they expected that the public would respond negatively to them. They were worried about their living arrangements, how they were going to support themselves financially, how they would renegotiate old relationships, and form a relationship with their probation officer. After they were released, as they feared, they did experience negative community reactions, unstable accommodation arrangements, difficulty obtaining employment and financial support, problems negotiating old relationships and forming new prosocial relationships, and lack of support from their probation officer. Reintegration planning was experienced by the participants as simplistic and aimed primarily to manage risk factors rather than to promote reintegration. In particular, supervision by probation officers, in their accounts, focused on risk management with avoidance goals (e.g., avoiding being alone with children) prioritised over strength-based or approach goals (e.g., developing better adult relationships). Taking into account findings of recent research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X11426132">Willis &amp; Grace, 2009</xref>) that poor reintegration planning may in itself be a risk factor for sexual recidivism, this would suggest a shift by probation officers to adopt a broader or holistic approach.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many participants were unsure at 1 week prior to release where they would be living, which meant that there was added uncertainty about available social support, employment opportunities, and potential accommodation. Reintegration staff had trouble accommodating participants in the limited residences provided by support agencies (e.g., PARS, Christian Ministries). Without certainty of living arrangements, including locality, there was unsatisfactory social support to assist offenders to develop independent living skills. Social support in particular has been identified as one of the key factors in promoting desistance from crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X11426132">Hepburn &amp; Griffin, 2004</xref>) and a basic human need or “primary good” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306624X11426132">Ward &amp; Stewart, 2003a</xref>). Without comprehensive release planning that targets reintegration and desistance variables, satisfactory reintegration is unlikely.</p>
<p>Overall, participants tended to fall into one of two groups. Those participants who initially presented as more optimistic considered release to be an opportunity which they could visualise in concrete terms. While they expected that they would experience difficulties, they did not believe that such difficulties were insurmountable, instead believing that things would work out. For these participants, their release plan had an element of certainty (e.g., employment prearranged), and as a result, they felt more satisfied and secure with their situation. This was evident in their report of greater security in their living arrangements, financial independence, and presence of social support. Those participants with more optimism experienced better outcomes, despite experiencing many of the same challenges (e.g., rejection by employers). Conversely, those participants who expected negative things to happen or perceived that there were formidable barriers to reintegration, experienced greater difficulties in the community. Such negative expectations, however, are influenced by the adequacy of reintegration plans.</p>
<p>In all likelihood, child sex offenders’ experience of reintegration is a combination of personality shaped by past experience (e.g., optimism/pessimism), adequacy of reintegration planning, the availability of supports, and some luck in relation to opportunities and events that come their way. The reintegration factors identified as important in the current study reflect the major conclusions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306624X11426132">Willis and Grace (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X11426132">2009</xref>), with accommodation, employment, and social support being particularly important.</p>
<p>In considering the two prominent correctional models of treatment, the risk-need-responsivity model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306624X11426132">Andrews &amp; Bonta, 2010</xref>) and good lives model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306624X11426132">Ward &amp; Stewart, 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306624X11426132">2003b</xref>), there are a number of ways that reintegration planning could be improved. The risk-need-responsivity model closely considers the potential risks of a reintegration plan in terms of traditional predictors of recidivism, such as deviant sexual arousal and acute factors such as drug and alcohol problems and access to children. The good lives model of treatment and reintegration underlines the importance of meeting “primary human goods,” such as close relationships and happiness. Until more recently, at least in New Zealand, treatment and planning for reintegration has been dominated by the risk-need-responsivity model with less emphasis on achieving primary human goods and helping offenders build happy, healthy lives. A renewed focus within treatment programmes on reintegration planning is indicated in this study as well as those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306624X11426132">Willis and Grace (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X11426132">2009</xref>). In practical terms, this would require quality reintegration planning within child sex offender treatment programmes, where offenders are encouraged to visualise what a new way of life would look like, thus enabling them to be more optimistic about their future. More specifically, this would require treatment programmes to include behavioural skills for offenders in how to achieve primary “goods” or goals, such as close relationships, intimacy, and happiness, in appropriate and socially acceptable ways.</p>
<p>The participant sample was small and possibly nonrepresentative as only 9 of the available pool of 27 men released within the recruitment period volunteered to participate in the study. Furthermore, participants were drawn from a particular programme and released to particular sites in New Zealand: Other treatment programmes and postrelease environments may differ in the experiences offered to offenders. However, the men who did participate were both willing to discuss their anticipation of the future and experiences, and on the whole, were articulate and often forthright in the expression of their views. The reports and opinions of child sex offenders about their hopes and fears for release, and subsequent experiences, provide an additional and valuable source of information for the planning and implementation of treatment and reintegration programmes. Accessing a larger population of offenders in future studies would contribute further to this knowledge base and would allow for more complex analyses that could tease out the relative contributions to postrelease satisfaction of factors such as treatment programme components, adequacy of release plans, and also individual factors such as intelligence, personality, differences in expectations, and other characteristics of offenders.</p>
