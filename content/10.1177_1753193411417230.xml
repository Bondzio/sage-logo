<p>Thumb in the plane of the hand (TPH) is a congenital deformity in which the nail plane of the radial-most digit is parallel to that of other digits, but structurally the digit retains the characteristics of a thumb. Four hands from four patients were retrospectively diagnosed as having TPH, with the underlying congenital conditions being symbrachydactyly, cleft hand and constriction band syndrome. Thumb web-plasty was carried out in all hands; one required additional rotation osteotomy of the metacarpal. Postoperative hand function was markedly improved and pinch function was possible in all cases. In most cases of TPH, the thumb has the potential to act in opposition, indicating that a thumb web-plasty is worth considering as an initial procedure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The term TPH (thumb in the plane of the hand) was recently coined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411417230">Langer et al. (2009)</xref>. Although it is not an independent classification, it provides a new concept in congenital hand anomalies. In TPH, the nail plane of a thumb is typically parallel to that of one of the other digits. It can be differentiated from the five-fingered hand, in which the radial-most digit resembles a finger. Although the thumb is abnormal in TPH, it is structurally similar to a normal thumb, consisting of one metacarpal with a proximal growth plate and, typically, two phalanges. We retrospectively diagnosed four patients with congenital anomalies as having TPH according to the criteria of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411417230">Langer et al. (2009)</xref> and investigated their characteristics and the results of surgical treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1753193411417230" sec-type="methods">
<title>Patients and methods</title>
<p>We reviewed the medical records, including preoperative history, physical examination, results, surgical notes, and relevant clinical photographs and radiographs, for cases of congenital anomalies that had received surgical treatment from the authors in our hospital between April 2005 and March 2009. TPH was diagnosed according to the criteria of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411417230">Langer et al. (2009)</xref>; that is, the position of the thumb was in the coronal plane of the hand, and the thumb ray was hypoplastic but included a metacarpal with a proximal growth plate, one or two phalanges and thenar musculature. Four hands from four patients with congenital anomalies who underwent surgical treatment were retrospectively diagnosed as having TPH. None of the patients presented with a dysplastic thumb as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411417230">Blauth (1967)</xref>, or radial longitudinal deficiency. We investigated the underlying congenital conditions in the affected hands, as well as the characteristics of the thumbs, radiographic findings and surgical procedures. Pre- and postoperative objective evaluation of thumb function included pinch function. The assessment of pinch function was done using a tape measure, a method that we have recently described for the scoring of pinch function in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411417230">Iba et al., 2011</xref>). The tape measure is suitable in size and weight for the infant’s hand and the tricky movements required to wind the tape measure are very attractive to the children and maintain their interest. The scoring of possible tasks using the tape measure method is as follows: unable to do test = 0; grasp the tape measure = 1; push the button = 2; pinch the end of the measuring tape = 3; pull out the tape by side pinch = 4; and pull out the tape by pulp pinch = 5. Subjective assessment included postoperative improvement in hand function as noted by the parents, graded as ‘no change’, ‘improved’, or ‘markedly improved’ at 6 months after the first operation.</p>
<p>Informed consent was obtained from the parents of each patient before enrolment in this review, and the institutional review board of our university hospital approved the study.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The underlying congenital anomalies of the four TPH patients included symbrachydactyly in two, cleft hand in one, and constriction band syndrome in one case (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193411417230">Table 1</xref>). In all hands, the thumbs were positioned in the plane of the hand and could not be used to pinch. In Case 1 the hand was similar to a cleft hand in appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411417230">Figure 1A</xref>). The thumb had one metacarpal and two phalanges. There were no middle phalanges, and hypoplastic distal and proximal phalanges on the other fingers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411417230">Figure 1B</xref>). In Case 4 (constriction band syndrome) the complex appearance was based on the combination of constriction band, lymphoedema and acrosyndactyly, causing the digits to be indistinguishable from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193411417230">Figure 2A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193411417230">B</xref>).</p>

<p>Case 1. A. There was symbrachydactyly with short digits, cutaneous syndactyly between the thumb (T) and index (I), ring (R) and little (L) fingers, and an absent middle finger. B. Radiographic findings revealed that the metacarpals were hypoplastic, but normal in morphology, and the thumb had two phalanges. There were no middle phalanges, and the distal and proximal phalanges of the fingers were severely hypoplastic. C. At 6 months after rotation osteotomy of the first metacarpal, side-pinch could be obtained.</p>

<p>Thumb web space reconstruction was done in all cases, and included the Snow–Littler procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411417230">Snow and Littler, 1967</xref>) for the cleft hand (Case 3). The thumb of one patient with symbrachydactyly (Case 1) required an additional first metacarpal rotation osteotomy to reconstruct an opposing position. The average age was 11.3 months (range, 8–14 months) at the time of the first web-plasty. The average duration of post-surgical follow-up was 38.3 months (range, 23–65 months). The mean number of surgical procedures per hand was 2.0 (range, 1–3 procedures), including web-plastic procedures for the other fingers.</p>
<p>At 6 months after the reconstruction of the web space or rotation osteotomy, one of the four children (Case 2) was able to pull out the tape measure by pulp pinch and the other three hands could achieve the same results by side pinch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411417230">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193411417230">2C</xref>). According to the objective scoring of pinch function using the tape measure method, there was an improvement in function from the mean preoperative score of 0.8 (range, 0–2) to the mean postoperative score of 4.3 (range, 4–5). The subjective assessment of postoperative improvement in hand function by parents is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193411417230">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>The radiographic findings confirmed that the thumbs in all patients, except Case 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193411417230">Figure 2D</xref>), consisted of a metacarpal with a proximal growth plate and one or two phalanges.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A number of hand manipulation skills are developed by the age of three, and one of the most important skills is pinch function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411417230">Case-Smith, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411417230">Gordon and Forssberg, 1997</xref>). An important aim of surgery in hands with congenital anomalies is to improve functionality, including grip and pinch. Opponensplasty is a common surgical procedure for the reconstruction of pinch function. Although a standard opponensplasty is used in the treatment of dysplastic thumbs, there are a number of congenital anomalies in which the deformities are too complicated to allow assessment of thumb function before planning the surgical procedure.</p>
<p>A previous report indicated that a rotation osteotomy with thumb web space deepening could improve thumb function in TPH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411417230">Langer et al., 2009</xref>). We looked at cases of TPH that had undergone surgery and assessed the postoperative results to determine whether a diagnosis of TPH is helpful or not when planning surgery. Before surgery no patients were able to pinch with the thumb. Postoperatively hand function was markedly improved in all cases and all the children obtained side- or pulp-pinch. These results indicated that if TPH could be diagnosed, good surgical outcomes could be expected through first web-plasty or rotation osteotomy of the first metacarpal. In three of the four hands, we found that reconstruction of the first web space alone was sufficient to improve pinch function. One of the reasons for the good surgical outcomes might be that the mean age at the time of the first web-plasty (11.3 months; range, 8–14) was younger than that in the report of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411417230">Langer et al. (2009)</xref> in which the mean age was almost 29 months. However, an additional rotation osteotomy was performed at an average age of 46 months in that series, indicating the need for a careful follow-up to determine whether osteotomy will be required in the future in our cases.</p>
<p>In most TPH cases, the thumb has the potential to act in opposition, indicating that reconstruction of the first web space is worth considering as an initial procedure even in children aged less than 1 year. Although the TPH deformity is not an independent classification of congenital anomaly, we believe that it is a useful concept when planning surgery for hands with congenital anomalies.</p>
