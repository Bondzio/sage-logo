<abstract>
<p>While advances in biomineralization have been made in recent years, unanswered questions persist on bone- and tooth-cell differentiation, on outside-in signaling from the extracellular matrix, and on the link between protein expression and mineral deposition. In the present study, we validate the use of a bioengineered three-dimensional (3D) dense collagen hydrogel scaffold as a cell-culture model to explore these questions. Dental pulp progenitor/stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs) were seeded into an extracellular matrix-like collagen gel whose fibrillar density was increased through plastic compression. SHED viability, morphology, and metabolic activity, as well as scaffold mineralization, were investigated over 24 days in culture. Additionally, measurements of alkaline phosphatase enzymatic activity, together with immunoblotting for mineralized tissue cell markers ALPL (tissue-non-specific alkaline phosphatase), DMP1 (dentin matrix protein 1), and OPN (osteopontin), demonstrated osteo/odontogenic cell differentiation in the dense collagen scaffolds coincident with mineralization. Analyses of the mineral phase by electron microscopy, including electron diffraction and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, combined with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and biochemical analyses, were consistent with the formation of apatitic mineral that was frequently aligned along collagen fibrils. In conclusion, use of a 3D dense collagen scaffold promoted SHED osteo/odontogenic cell differentiation and mineralization.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Characteristic of mineralized tissues is a fibrillar collagenous extracellular matrix infiltrated with additional non-collagenous proteins and proteoglycans thought to guide the mineralization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034513488599">McKee <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Conditions for matrix mineralization require macromolecular assembly and maturation, which involve enzymatic processing of matrix components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034513488599">Kaartinen <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034513488599">2005</xref>; Barros <italic>et al</italic>., 2012). As a result, in bone, dentin, and cementum, there is a lag time before mineralization occurs, resulting in an unmineralized layer of osteoid, predentin, and cementoid, respectively. Such a three-dimensional (3D) extracellular matrix scaffolding appears to be essential for eliciting differentiation responses from resident cells to create a molecular environment receptive to mineralization.</p>
<p>Currently, there is a lack of cell-culture models for mineralized tissues capable of reproducing, in particular, the 3D matrix environment essential for the study of cell differentiation as it relates to matrix mineralization. While primary cell cultures that produce mineralizing extracellular matrix nodules are useful for some purposes, most commonly used cell-culture lines produce very little extracellular matrix and are largely two-dimensional (2D) systems on plastic dish surfaces, thus calling into question their physiologic relevance. From a handful of cell lines that are often used to study mineralization, only the MC3T3-E1 (subclones 4/14) mouse osteoblast cell line has highly reproducible osteoblastic differentiation, abundant extracellular matrix production/accumulation, assembly and maturation, and mineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022034513488599">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). Thus, available culture systems for bone, cartilage, and tooth cells remain far from replicating <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions, and thus the use of 3D collagen hydrogel scaffolds is currently being explored to mimic natural osteoid, predentin, and cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022034513488599">Wallace and Rosenblatt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034513488599">Geckil <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034513488599">Salmon <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Dense collagen 3D scaffolds likely better reflect the natural matrix environment in terms of guiding cell differentiation (and mineralization) relevant to tooth and bone biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034513488599">Bitar <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034513488599">Buxton <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034513488599">Pedraza <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034513488599">Chicatun <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>) compared with the highly hydrated collagen hydrogels used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022034513488599">Wiesmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034513488599">Takitoh <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Plastic compression of <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstituted collagen type I hydrogels is a rapid and reproducible technique for the production of scaffolds with physiologically relevant increased collagen fibrillar density (<italic>i.e</italic>., greater than 10% by weight) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034513488599">Brown <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). This compression method results in scaffolds with increased mechanical properties and extracellular matrix-like mesoscale characteristics, while including the option of having viable cell seeding as part of the processing route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034513488599">Abou Neel <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034513488599">Pedraza <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034513488599">Chicatun <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034513488599">Ghezzi <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>); as such, they show great promise for tissue-engineering applications.</p>
<p>While some cell-culture models exist that mimic certain aspects of tooth development and matrix mineralization, the quantity of <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental data available for tooth cells has generally not kept pace with that obtained for osteoblasts and chondroblasts/cytes, and mineralized tissue craniofacial biology research as a whole has suffered from this lack of information. However, there have been recent improvements in methodologies for obtaining and cultivating stem cells from teeth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034513488599">Gronthos <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034513488599">Shi and Gronthos, 2003</xref>). Promising new approaches can now be applied to dental ectomesenchymal progenitor cells (stem cells) obtained from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs) that are readily available through routine tooth extraction and natural tooth exfoliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034513488599">Miura <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034513488599">Kerkis and Caplan, 2012</xref>). Combined use of SHEDs with 3D dense collagen hydrogel scaffolds would thus appear to be promising for promoting cell differentiation toward the odontoblastic and osteoblastic phenotypes in a way that would not only allow for a better understanding of tooth and bone cell biology, but which could also be useful for dental and craniofacial reconstructions and other bioengineering purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034513488599">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034513488599">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Having previously reported on SHED differentiation in 2D conventional cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034513488599">Salmon <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>), and with the objective of describing their behavior in the 3D environment of plastically compressed, dense collagen scaffolds, here we report that, in these 3D scaffolds, SHEDs are a highly proliferative population of cells that differentiate toward an odontoblastic/osteoblastic phenotype with concomitant mineralization of the surrounding collagen.</p>

<title>Cell Source and Culture</title>
<p>Normal exfoliated human deciduous teeth were collected from children aged 3 to 7 yrs with the informed consent of the patients and their parents, according to ethical guidelines set by French bioethics law. SHEDs were isolated and expanded following an established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034513488599">Gronthos <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034513488599">Miura <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). For all experiments, SHEDs were used between passages 4 and 7.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022034513488599">
<title>Scaffold Preparation</title>
<p>Plastically compressed collagen gels were used as 3D scaffolds and were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034513488599">Brown <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034513488599">Abou Neel <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Briefly, 3.6 mL of sterile rat-tail collagen type I (First Link Ltd., Wolverhampton, UK) at a protein concentration of 2.01 mg/mL in 0.6% acetic acid was mixed with 0.9 mL of ×10 DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium) and neutralized by drop-wise addition of 5 M NaOH to ~pH 7.4. After neutralization, SHEDs were incorporated into the collagen solution at a cell density of 150,000 cells/mL, and then a quantity of 0.9 mL/well was pipetted into a 4-well plate, followed by 30 min of incubation at 37°C.</p>
<p>After polymerization, highly hydrated hydrogels (with &lt; 0.5 weight % fibrillar collagen density) were placed on a stack of blotting paper, nylon, and stainless mesh, and dense collagen scaffolds (with &gt; 10 weight % fibrillar collagen density) were produced by the application of an unconfined compressive stress of 1 kPa for 5 min to remove excess casting fluid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034513488599">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034513488599">Brown <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p>

At days 8 and 16, a high density of viable cells is observed with a limited number of dead cells (red, in boxes in panel C and inset). Two cell populations are observed: a population of finer, more stellar-shaped cells abundant in the core of the scaffold (bracket) and another cell population located more toward the edges of the scaffold presenting an aligned, spindle-shaped morphology.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, our objective was to determine whether a 3D fibrillar collagen gel scaffold with a density approaching that of native extracellular matrix as found in osteoid and predentin could sustain cell viability and induce odonto/osteoblastic differentiation from human exfoliated tooth pulp-derived stem cells (SHEDs). Furthermore, the production of odonto/osteoblastic marker proteins over time coincided with collagen scaffold mineralization. Importantly, and unlike what so often occurs dystrophically in other mineralizing cell-culture models (other than when the MC3T3-E1 cell line is used), mineralization occurred appropriately along collagen fibrils in a manner described previously for the potential of collagen fibrils to mineralize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034513488599">Silver and Landis, 2011</xref>), and the calcium-phosphate mineral phase was apatitic as is found in bones and teeth.</p>
<p>In the cultures, alkaline phosphatase activity − a commonly used measure for mineralized tissue cell lineage progression at early culture time-points − steadily increased until day 16 and then decreased, an observation consistent with previous reports for a variety of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034513488599">Bitar <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034513488599">Pedraza <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034513488599">Chicatun <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). DMP1 and OPN were also detected early in the cell cultures, starting from day 8. Analysis of the considerable quantity of recent data indicates that DMP1 promotes mineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034513488599">Gajjeraman <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>), while phosphorylated OPN and its peptides are generally thought to regulate crystal growth by direct binding and inhibition at formed crystallographic surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034513488599">Boskey <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034513488599">Gericke <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034513488599">Hunter <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Indeed, the presence of these secreted marker proteins, and their correlation with the appearance of mineralization in the cultures, attests to the matrix-inducible, cell-mediated deposition and regulation of the mineral phase, which is a critical end-point hallmark feature when odonto/osteoblastic differentiation is being considered. Likewise, the ultrastructural localization of the mineral phase along the dense collagen fibrils constituting the scaffold, together with identifying characteristic mineral properties, further attests to the fact that this 3D cell-culture system mimics, in some key ways, the conditions permissive to physiologic mineralization as seen <italic>in vivo</italic> in bones and teeth. Indeed, the finding of a carbonate peak by FTIR from the mineral phase is consistent with the known carbonate content (carbonate-substituted apatite, or carbonatoapatite) of tooth and bone mineral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034513488599">Pedraza <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034513488599">Chicatun <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the electron diffraction pattern showing poorly crystallized apatite is consistent with biologic hydroxyapatite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034513488599">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>We have previously reported that plastic compression of osteoprogenitor (MC3T3-E1 cells)-seeded collagen gels resulted in osteoblast marker gene expression and scaffold mineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034513488599">Pedraza <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). In that study, the differentiated osteoblasts produced nascent collagen fibrils that assembled extracellularly and contributed to the scaffold environment. In the present study, there was little evidence of this collagen production. For SHEDs as used in this system, the collagen scaffold provided to the cells appeared to be sufficient (not requiring additional nascent collagen secretion) to provide outside-in signaling, leading to cell differentiation and to the secretion of other, mineralization-regulating proteins (shown here for ALPL, DMP1, and OPN) concomitant with the observed scaffold mineralization. Somewhat different from our previous osteoblast study, where scaffold mineralization generally occurred in peripheral regions of the scaffold and in close proximity to the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034513488599">Pedraza <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), here we observed a fairly evenly dispersed mineralization pattern throughout all regions of the scaffold. On occasion, slightly increased mineralization was seen in the more central regions, perhaps reflecting a slight cell preference for hypoxic conditions, as has been proposed to increase cell-mediated mineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034513488599">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the current results indicate that SHEDs may behave similarly to rodent cell lines used previously showing cell differentiation, but with the important additional feature of now allowing for the consideration of potentially using patient cells for clinical repair of osseous and dental defects. Bioengineered mineralized tissue repair strategies might also benefit from this work, as might patients having genetic disorders detrimentally affecting bone and dentin mineralization.</p>
