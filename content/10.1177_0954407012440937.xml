<abstract>
<p>This paper shows that a split-fuel-injection strategy can achieve robust, near-zero smoke and nitrogen oxide emissions at reduced exhaust gas recirculation levels under low-temperature combustion conditions. The overall objective of the work was to investigate the sensitivity (in terms of the engine emissions and the fuel economy) of a 50:50 (by mass) split-injection strategy to variations in the key engine operating parameters. Experiments were performed at operating conditions corresponding to a gross indicated mean effective pressure of 500 kPa at an engine speed of 1500 r/min in a 0.51 l single-cylinder high-speed direct-injection diesel engine. The paper presents the effects of different relative fuel injection timings at a variable intake oxygen mass fraction (10.5% and 12%) at a constant intake pressure (120 kPa, absolute) on the smoke, total hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions with the split-main-injection strategy. The effects of a variable fuel injection pressure (90 MPa and 110 MPa) on diesel low-temperature combustion with split injection are also reported, as are the effect of an increased intake pressure (150 kPa, absolute). The combined effects of the operating parameters and the fuel injection timing on the smoke, nitrogen oxide, total hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions and the gross indicated specific fuel consumption are described. For selected operating conditions, the cycle-resolved spray and combustion processes are visualized together with the flame temperature measurement using two-colour optical pyrometry to understand the combustion phenomena occurring in the split-injection strategy. The results of the optical studies show that different low-temperature combustion operating conditions producing similarly low levels of ‘engine-out’ smoke emissions have substantially different histories of soot formation and soot oxidation. An increase in the intake oxygen mass fraction reduced the total hydrocarbon emissions and the gross indicated specific fuel consumption at a given intake pressure, while a higher intake pressure reduced them further. Although significant soot formation took place from the second injection event, the majority of the soot was subsequently oxidized because of a slightly higher flame temperature and slightly higher oxygen concentration than in single-injection high-exhaust-gas-recirculation low-temperature combustion. A higher injection pressure did not have any significant effect on the emissions and the gross indicated specific fuel consumption.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Diesel low-temperature combustion (LTC) with high exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) has received significant recent attention because of its potential to meet the stringent future engine emissions legislation for nitrogen oxides (NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>) and particulate matter (PM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407012440937">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954407012440937"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954407012440937"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954407012440937">4</xref></sup> Although the potential benefits of diesel LTC are clear, a practical diesel LTC system has yet to be implemented in a production engine. One of the main barriers remains the requirement to date for EGR levels that can exceed 65 vol % (depending on the engine operating conditions). These EGR levels are much higher than the approximately 50% needed to achieve near-zero NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions alone. However, at approximately 50% EGR (approximately 12% intake oxygen mass fraction), smoke emissions are substantially above conventional diesel engine-out levels with a single-fuel-injection strategy. Higher levels of EGR (often greater than 65 vol %, equivalent to 7% intake oxygen mass fraction) are normally required to reduce smoke emissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407012440937">5</xref></sup> With a lower intake oxygen concentration, the fuel efficiency is impaired and total unburned hydrocarbon (THC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions increase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407012440937">5</xref></sup> Furthermore, the ability of the engine to respond to transients is compromised.</p>
<p>There have been numerous publications reporting the potential benefits of the two-stage injection process under highly dilute LTC conditions; however, most of these investigations were limited to optimizing the fuel mass ratio between the two fuel injection events and the injection dwell time to reduce the emissions and to improve the fuel economy with either advanced or retarded injection timings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407012440937">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954407012440937"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954407012440937"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954407012440937"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954407012440937"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954407012440937"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954407012440937"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954407012440937"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954407012440937">14</xref></sup> In real-world applications, the engine operating parameters change constantly, especially when following a vehicle drive cycle. These changes in the operating parameters are expected to affect the robustness of the emissions and combustion control strategies significantly for an engine employing the split-injection strategy. The objective of this work was to investigate the sensitivity of the split-injection strategy to the effect of the variations in the operating parameters (i.e. the EGR level, the engine intake charge pressure, the injection pressure and the injection timings) on the emissions and the fuel economy at a fixed operating condition at higher intake oxygen mass fractions (varying between 10.5% and 12%). Koci et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407012440937">6</xref></sup> showed that higher boost pressures reduced the THC and CO emissions but increased the PM levels with a split-injection LTC strategy at very high EGR levels (67 mass %), whereas higher injection pressures reduced the PM, THC and CO emissions. It has been predicted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954407012440937">13</xref></sup> that near-zero NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and soot levels could be achieved in a premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI) engine with an optimized low-pressure early-cycle fuel injection combined with a high-pressure near-TDC injection strategy; this split-injection strategy allowed good control over the combustion phasing. In previous work by the present authors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954407012440937">15</xref></sup> a split-fuel-injection (50:50 by mass) strategy was shown to reduce the EGR requirements from 62 vol % (about 8% intake oxygen mass fraction) to 52 vol % (about 12% intake oxygen mass fraction) to achieve near-zero NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and smoke emissions at 120 kPa intake pressure. The THC and CO emissions were reduced significantly with improved fuel efficiency at 12% intake oxygen mass fraction with the split-injection strategy compared with the single-injection strategy at 8% intake oxygen mass fraction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954407012440937">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>This paper shows that a split-fuel-injection strategy can achieve near-zero smoke and NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions at reduced EGR levels under LTC conditions. It presents the effects of different fuel injection timings at variable intake oxygen mass fractions (10.5% and 12%) at a constant intake pressure (120 kPa, absolute) on the THC and CO emissions with a 50:50 (by mass) split-main-injection strategy. The NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions were less than 1 g/kg of fuel for all the different cases investigated and hence are not reported in this paper. The effect of the variable fuel injection pressure (90 MPa and 110 MPa) on diesel LTC with split injection is presented. An investigation of the potential of increasing the intake pressure (150 kPa, absolute), while keeping the smoke and NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions at acceptable levels is also described. The combined effects of the operating parameters and the fuel injection timings on the smoke, NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> THC and CO emissions are reported together with the gross indicated specific fuel consumption (GISFC) values. Simultaneously, for selected operating conditions, the cycle-resolved spray and combustion processes are visualized together with flame temperature measurement using two-colour optical pyrometry to understand the combustion phenomena occurring during split-injection LTC operation.</p>

<title>Experimental apparatus</title>
<p>The research facility used in this work is based on an AVL 5402 single-cylinder high-speed diesel engine which has a combustion system typical of an automotive 2 l, four-cylinder light-duty high-speed direct-injection diesel engine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012440937">Figure 1</xref>). It features a central fuel injector and three valves (two inlets and one exhaust) with a double-overhead-camshaft valvetrain. One of the original two exhaust valves was removed and deactivated to enable borescopic access to the combustion chamber. The fuelling system is a Bosch common-rail CP3 injection system consisting of a production-type high-pressure common-rail fuel pump supplying fuel up to a pressure of 135 MPa. An automotive grade diesel fuel was used. Details of the specifications of the engine, the fuelling system and the fuel used are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954407012440937">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>A custom-built air exchange system consisting of boost and EGR systems as illustrated schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012440937">Figure 1</xref> was used for this work. It was controlled independently from the engine, allowing investigation of wider ranges of intake pressures and EGR gas fractions and removing the sensitivity of the air exchange system to changes in the engine operating conditions. The intake air was compressed using an electrically driven centrifugal compressor and was then cooled in an air-to-water heat exchanger. The exhaust back pressure was maintained by an electrically actuated proportional–integral–derivative controlled butterfly valve in the exhaust line. Both the intake and the exhaust systems included 25 l surge tanks to damp out pressure pulsations. The EGR was routed between the two surge tanks to maximize mixing.</p>
<p>The research engine facility was fully instrumented to measure the air temperature and pressure, the fuel and air flow rates and the in-cylinder pressure. The crank angle (CA) was measured with a resolution of 0.5° with an AVL 365 optical CA encoder mounted directly on the engine crankshaft. The intake pressure was measured with a Kistler 4045A5 piezoresistive pressure transducer and the in-cylinder pressure was measured using a flush-mounted water-cooled AVL QC34C quartz piezoelectric pressure transducer. In the work reported here, all these high-speed data were averaged using at least 200 consecutive engine cycles and the average in-cylinder pressure data were used to derive the reported combustion parameters. Emissions measurements to determine the concentrations of CO, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), THC, NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) in the exhaust were made using a Horiba Mexa 7100HEGR emission analyser. This system also measured the intake CO<sub>2</sub> concentration to determine the EGR level. Raw exhaust gases, sampled after the exhaust back-pressure valve, were fed to an AVL 415 smoke meter to determine the smoke emissions. The details of the experimental set-up have been reported in earlier publications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407012440937">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954407012440937">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954407012440937">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>For in-cylinder spray and combustion visualization, an AVL fused silica optical window was attached to the end of an installation tube into which a standard borescope was fitted to form a pressure-tight shield. A similar optical window arrangement was provided to allow lightguide access. The two optical windows protruded slightly into the combustion chamber and so the piston lip was machined slightly to provide relief for the borescope and lightguide. Dummy plugs were installed in the outer sleeves when the borescope and the lightguide were not in use. A Karl Storz 84583B rigid borescope (3.8 mm outer diameter with a working length of 300 mm with Hopkins lenses) was used to visualize the spray and combustion events. The borescope was equipped with cooling channels which were supplied with filtered compressed air to prevent overheating of the internal optics (limited to 150 °C). A Prosilica GC1380 monochrome charge-coupled device camera (1600 × 1200 pixels) with a Pentax Machine-Vision Mega-Pixels lens (focal length of 25 mm and an <italic>F</italic> number of 1.4) was connected directly to the borescope via a quick-snap connector with a C mount. A PerkinElmer CX1200 stroboscope (xenon flash lamp) through a Karl Storz 81599 V fibre-optic lightguide and a 30° lightguide tip illuminated the combustion chamber for imaging the spray. A gigabit Ethernet interface cable communicated between the camera and the personal computer. The salient features of the borescope, camera and stroboscope are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954407012440937">Table 2</xref>.

<p>The camera was externally triggered with a 5 V transistor–transistor logic pulse from the data acquisition system based on the input engine CA encoder signal. The strobe was triggered and synchronized by the camera. To have CA-resolved images, subsequent images were captured with certain degree CA increments from other power cycles. All the triggering routines were written in LabVIEW 8.5. Norpix software was used to control the shutter speed, the region of interest, the gain, the exposure time and the frame rates of the camera and to adjust the flash duration of the strobe and the delay between the camera and the strobe.</p>
<p>A two-colour method was implemented to measure the in-cylinder flame temperature and the soot concentration. Radiation from the luminous flame in the engine’s combustion chamber was transmitted through a Karl Storz 84583A (0° direction of view) borescope to the two-colour pyrometry set-up through a dichroic mirror where the light beam was split into two parts. The transmitted and the reflected light beams were passed through 700 nm and 550 nm interference filters (full width at half-maximum of 10 nm) respectively. Subsequently, the two signals were detected using two Hamamatsu amplified photomultiplier tube modules (H5784-20) with a response frequency of 20 kHz. Data from 200 cycles were averaged to determine the flame temperature and the soot concentration. The principle and implementation of two-colour pyrometry have been reported in numerous sources;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954407012440937">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954407012440937"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954407012440937">19</xref></sup> hence a complete discussion is not attempted here.

<p>where <italic>p</italic> and <italic>V</italic> are the instantaneous cylinder pressure and volume respectively. θ is the CA and <italic>γ</italic> is the specific heat ratio (γ =1.33, assumed constant). Integrating the net energy release up to a certain CA and normalizing it by the cumulative energy release provides the fraction of energy release up to that point. Typical points of interest in this work included the phasing of the 5%, 50% and 95% values of the cumulative energy release (designated as CA5, CA50, and CA95 respectively). The start of combustion (SOC) was identified as being the start of the main energy release and did not include the ‘cool-flame’ pre-combustion reactions. The premixing time was defined as the difference in time (in degrees CA) between the first start of injection timing (SOI1) and the SOC. The combustion duration was defined as the time interval between CA5 and CA95.</p>

<p>The reported mass-averaged in-cylinder bulk gas temperatures were computed using the ideal-gas law in combination with the measured pressure (ensemble averaged over 200 cycles), the known cylinder volume and the measured mass of air and the recirculated exhaust gases. The molecular mass was calculated from the molecular mass of the constituent recirculated gases, fresh air and fuel. How much of the measured mass of the gases which escape at the beginning of the compression stroke has not been taken into account in this calculation. It may be noted that the local in-cylinder temperatures during the cool-flame and high-temperature energy release phases will be somewhat hotter than the mass-averaged temperatures (which includes the cold boundary layer regions), whereas the difference between the mass-averaged bulk gas temperature and the local in-cylinder temperature will be significant during the mixing-controlled combustion phase.</p>

<title>Operating conditions</title>
<p>For the split-injection and single-injection strategies, a constant fuelling quantity of 15.6 ± 0.2 mg/cycle was used at a constant engine speed of 1500 r/min. This generated a nominal gross indicated mean effective pressure (GIMEP) of 500 kPa corresponding to an operating point of specific interest to the project’s industrial partner. Note that the GIMEP accounts for the work done during the compression and expansion strokes only and does not include the pumping work. In this 50:50 split-injection strategy, for maintaining equal fuelling quantities in the two consecutive injections, the commanded first fuel injection pulse duration was kept constant, whereas the commanded second fuel injection pulse duration was adjusted to maintain the fuel flow rate at the desired level. Because of pulsations in the common-rail fuel system, it was not possible to guarantee that the fuel quantity in the first injection remained the same for all operating conditions. However, previous work on this engine has shown that the major influences of the pressure pulsations are on the quantity of fuel in the second injection; as a result, varying this provided the best estimate for maintaining equal fuel masses in the two injections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954407012440937">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>With regard to the fuel injection timing for split-injection operation of the engine, the SOI1 timing was varied between −36° and −51° CA after top dead centre (ATDC), while the start of injection timing for the second fuel mass (SOI2) was advanced depending on the EGR level so as to inject into the low-temperature cool-flame reactions from the first injection event to reduce the smoke emissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954407012440937">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954407012440937">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954407012440937">23</xref></sup> The SOI2 was adjusted for the ‘maximum advance for best indicated torque’ (MBT) to improve the combustion efficiency, while keeping the rate of pressure rise below 1 MPa/deg CA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407012440937">5</xref></sup> It was found that, for SOI1 timings earlier than −51° CA ATDC, the THC emissions and the GISFC increased significantly, most probably because of poor fuel evaporation (assuming a constant specific heat ratio γ=1.33 and an initial temperature at the beginning of the compression stroke to be 65 °C, the average in-cylinder gas temperature at −60° CA ATDC during the compression stroke is estimated to be about 375 °C, which is close to the final boiling point (360 °C) of a conventional diesel blend). A spray penetration analysis using the Hiroyasu–Arai<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954407012440937">24</xref></sup> model suggests that, for SOI1 timings earlier than −51° CA ATDC, the spray would impinge on the cylinder liner, which would dilute the lubricating oil. The basic fuel injection scheme is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407012440937">Figure 3</xref>. Note that the exhaust back pressure was maintained at least 15 kPa above the intake pressure to drive the required amount of EGR. The intake air temperature was maintained at 70 ± 5 °C. The engine lubricating oil temperature and the coolant temperature were maintained at 90 ± 1 °C and 80 ± 1 °C respectively.</p>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407012440937">Figure 4</xref> shows the experimental results for the smoke, CO and THC emissions and the GISFC for the engine operating with two different intake oxygen mass fractions (10.5% and 12%) at an intake pressure of 120 kPa (absolute) using a split-main-injection strategy as detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954407012440937">Table 3</xref>. The results are reported as functions of the SOI1 timing; the SOI2 timings are held constant at values of −18° CA ATDC and −15° CA ATDC respectively, corresponding to the MBT injection timings. For the purposes of comparison, the emissions and the GISFC levels corresponding to a single-injection strategy with an identical injected fuel mass at the MBT timing and an intake oxygen mass fraction of 11% are shown in the figures by a horizontal solid line. The CO and THC emissions are reported in terms of grams per kilogram of fuel; accordingly the error bars shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407012440937">Figures 4(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407012440937">4(c)</xref> represent the combined instrument error associated with the air, fuel and emissions measurement systems. Similarly, the error bars shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407012440937">Figure 4(d)</xref> are the combined instrumentation errors associated with the fuel flow and cylinder pressure measurements. The error bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407012440937">Figure 4(a)</xref> represent the instrument error of the smoke measurement system.

<p>The results show the CO and THC emissions and the GISFC to be consistently higher in the case of the 10.5% intake oxygen mass fraction than for the 12% intake oxygen mass fraction case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407012440937">Figure 4(b)</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407012440937">(d)</xref>). This is in agreement with earlier studies performed on the same engine using a single-pulse-injection strategy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954407012440937">25</xref></sup> The smoke emissions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407012440937">Figure 4(a)</xref>) are shown to be relatively insensitive to the intake oxygen mass fraction for SOI1 timings between −51° and −39° CA ATDC (in all cases the emissions have a filter smoke number (FSN) that is less than 1). At first glance the results do seem to indicate some sensitivity to the intake oxygen mass fraction at an SOI1 timing of −36° CA ATDC, where the smoke emissions for the 10.5% intake oxygen mass fraction case are markedly higher than for the 12% intake oxygen mass fraction case. However, considering the experimental results for smoke in conjunction with the CO, THC and GISFC data collected at this same SOI1 timing and accounting for the combustion chamber geometry, the results suggest that the emissions and the fuel consumption at this timing are strongly affected by spray–wall interactions.</p>
<p>A graphical investigation using the Hiroyasu–Arai<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954407012440937">24</xref></sup> spray penetration model indicated that fuel from the first injection event would probably impinge on the lip of the piston bowl for SOI1 timings between −30° and −36° CA ATDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954407012440937">Figure 5</xref> shows the case of SOI1 at −36° CA ATDC). As this simple geometric approach does not take the effects of swirl or changing cylinder pressure into consideration, this result was confirmed by in-cylinder imaging using a borescope. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954407012440937">Figure 6</xref> shows a sequence of spray images giving details of the first injection event (upper row) and the second injection event (lower row) for an SOI1 timing of −39° CA ATDC and an SOI2 timing of −15° CA ATDC respectively. The images clearly show that fuel from the first injection event misses the piston bowl and enters the squish region at CAs earlier than −36° CA ATDC. At −36° CA ATDC, the fuel is seen to impinge on the piston top land. Continued spray impingement on the piston top land–bowl lip region was observed until −34° CA ATDC during the first injection event. From this study, it is shown that the fuel distribution from the first injection pulse will differ markedly between SOI1 timings occurring before −39° CA ATDC, in which case all the fuel is expected to be distributed in the squish region, and those occurring after −39° CA ATDC, where some (unknown) fraction of the fuel is expected to be deposited on the piston top land and in the piston bowl (note that in all cases the fuel injected in the second injection event is wholly contained within the piston bowl).</p>

In order to maintain a fixed SOI2 timing for both injection pressure cases examined here, a higher EGR rate (53%) was found to be necessary at the higher injection pressure so as to limit the rate of pressure rise to less than 1 MPa/deg CA. The present authors hypothesize that the higher-injection-pressure case (giving better fuel atomization and vaporization) at the lower intake oxygen mass fraction results in a local equivalence ratio at the SOC that is not significantly different from the lower-injection-pressure case at the higher intake oxygen mass fraction, thus leading to the similar levels of smoke emissions seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954407012440937">Figure 10(a)</xref>.</p>

It is interesting to note that there are no significant differences in the peak reaction zone temperatures for the two cases (although the flame temperature decreases more rapidly for the higher-intake-pressure experiments) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954407012440937">Figure 12(c)</xref>). However, substantial differences are shown in the soot concentration as a function of the CA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954407012440937">Figure 12(d)</xref>) for the two cases, suggesting that soot production under these two operating conditions is strongly influenced by the local equivalence ratio. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954407012440937">Figure 12(a)</xref> shows the timing of the second injection event with respect to the energy release rate. It can be seen that, whereas in the lower-intake-pressure case the second fuel mass is injected into the negative-temperature-coefficient region of the cool-flame reactions, in the higher-intake-pressure case the second injection event occurs during a period of high energy release as the main combustion reaction is in progress. This is expected to reduce the ignition delay of the second injected fuel mass in the 150 kPa intake case compared with the 120 kPa case, thus yielding a richer local equivalence ratio and the substantially increased peak smoke concentrations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954407012440937">Figure 12(d)</xref>. Subsequently, the results indicate that soot oxidation is relatively more rapid and more complete in the 150 kPa intake pressure case. The higher oxygen concentration (per unit volume) for the 150 kPa intake pressure case clearly favours soot oxidation during the high-temperature mixing-controlled phase of combustion. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954407012440937">Figure 12(b)</xref> shows that the combustion duration is increased at the higher intake pressure. The increased combustion duration is reflected in the observation of continued soot oxidation late in the expansion stroke at the higher intake pressure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954407012440937">Figure 12(d)</xref>), ultimately reaching a soot concentration level significantly lower than for the 120 kPa intake pressure case. The rapid decreases in the flame temperature and the soot concentration indicate a rapid reduction in the local equivalence ratio at a higher intake pressure due to higher oxygen entrainment.</p>

<p>Returning to the effect of the intake pressure on the THC and CO emissions, as expected the THC emissions decreased, whereas surprisingly there was a marginal reduction in the CO emissions at higher intake pressure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954407012440937">Figure 11(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954407012440937">(c)</xref>). CO oxidation was not enhanced further at the higher intake pressure. The fact that the THC emissions were reduced with the higher intake pressure (and hence higher volumetric oxygen concentration) suggests that the oxidation of the hydrocarbons is oxygen limited. The fact that the CO emissions did not increase indicates that the hydrocarbons are becoming fully oxidized with the higher intake pressure rather than simply being converted to CO before the available oxygen is consumed. This is shown by the lower oxygen-based equivalence ratio reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954407012440937">Table 3</xref>. The GISFC marginally decreased at the higher intake pressure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954407012440937">Figure 11(d)</xref>) consistent with the THC emissions trend.</p>

The higher smoke emissions at −39° CA ATDC SOI1 timing may be attributed to the timing of the second injection event, where the fuel during the second injection event was injected into the gases at a higher temperature (as indicated by the higher magnitude of the energy release rate at the SOI2 timing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954407012440937">Figure 14(a)</xref> compared with −45° CA ATDC in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954407012440937">Figure 14(b)</xref>).</p>

<p>These observations are further supported by the flame temperature and the soot concentration results obtained through the two-colour pyrometry (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954407012440937">Figure 14(c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954407012440937">(d)</xref>). Although the local reaction zone flame temperatures are similar at the −15° and −18° CA ATDC SOI2 timings, the results plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954407012440937">Figure 14(d)</xref> show marked differences in the CA-resolved soot concentrations. The advanced SOI2 timing (with the fuel from the second injection event being injected into the cool-flame reactions) not only reduced the peak soot concentration but also resulted in near-zero soot concentration. This supports our earlier hypothesis that the smoke emissions can be reduced significantly when the fuel from the second injection was injected into the cool-flame reactions of the fuel injected during the first injection, despite the fact that there is a shorter ignition delay for the second injected fuel mass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954407012440937">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note that the rate of pressure rise was very high with −18° CA ATDC SOI2 timing (about 1.6 MPa/deg CA shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954407012440937">Figure 13(b)</xref>); hence, this advanced SOI2 timing was not investigated at other SOI1 timings (the rate of pressure rise with −12° CA ATDC SOI2 timing was about 0.8 MPa/deg CA). This demonstrates an interesting trade-off between the rate of pressure rise and the smoke emissions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954407012440937">Figure 13</xref>). Combustion rate shaping due to the overlapping second injection event and premixed combustion at retarded SOI2 timing reduced the rate of pressure rise. It is expected that, with retarded SOI2 timing, the fuel when injected into the high-temperature gases would cause cooling effects on the combustion products and these cooler gases would then be entrained into the spray. Hence, the subsequent partially premixed energy release reactions would take place slowly, thereby reducing the rate of pressure rise. It is also expected that the in-cylinder temperature would be higher during the second injection event owing to the proximity of the second injection event to TDC, thereby enhancing fuel vaporization for the mass of the fuel.</p>
<p>Retarding or advancing the SOI2 timing had a marginal effect on the THC and CO emissions (not shown here); however, the GISFC did not show any clear trend with SOI2 timing and varied indiscernibly with the SOI1 timing, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954407012440937">Figure 15</xref>. Looking at the GISFC data, it may be noted that there is a significant reduction in GISFC at certain injection timings and injection dwell timings.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This work investigated the effects of the intake oxygen mass fraction, the fuel injection pressure, the intake pressure and the fuel injection timings on the engine-out emissions and the fuel economy under reduced-EGR LTC conditions using a split-fuel-injection strategy. A comparison was made with a single-injection strategy at similar operating conditions. At selected operating conditions, in-cylinder visualization and two-colour pyrometry were carried out. The following conclusions were found.</p>
<list id="list2-0954407012440937" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>The split-injection strategy reduced the CO and smoke emissions at a given intake oxygen mass fraction compared with the single-injection strategy. Conversely, the THC emissions and the GISFC were increased.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>An increase in the intake oxygen mass fraction during split-injection operation reduced the THC and CO emissions and the GISFC with little effect on the level of the smoke emissions.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>A higher intake pressure with the split-injection strategy at 12% intake oxygen mass fraction reduced the THC, CO and smoke emissions and the GISFC.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>At a higher intake pressure, injecting fuel from the second injection event into the high-temperature gases reduced the rate of pressure rise compared with advanced injection timings where the fuel from the second injection event was injected into the low-temperature cool-flame reactions. The retarded SOI2 timing increased the smoke emissions marginally without any significant impact on the THC and CO emissions and the GISFC.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Significant soot formation took place from the second injection event in reduced-EGR split-injection LTC. However, the majority of the soot was subsequently oxidized as shown in the optical assessment of the combustion event. This behaviour differs significantly from the higher-EGR single-injection LTC combustion mode studied previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954407012440937">20</xref></sup> where the in-cylinder imaging did not show evidence of significant broadband soot emission.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>At a higher intake oxygen mass fraction and a higher intake pressure, enhanced soot oxidation reduced the tail-pipe smoke emissions despite the higher amount of soot formation. The local equivalence ratio is the key parameter affecting both soot formation and soot oxidation.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>A higher flame temperature and a higher oxygen concentration enhanced the THC and CO oxidation at the higher intake oxygen mass fraction and the higher intake pressure.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The higher injection pressure did not necessarily reduce the THC, CO and smoke emissions and the GISFC in the split-injection strategy.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The best performance engine operating boundary conditions for the split-injection strategy, with respect to the fuel economy and the total emissions, were found to be an SOI1 of −42° CA ATDC with an SOI2 at −12° CA ATDC, 150 kPa intake pressure and 12% intake oxygen mass fraction. These operating conditions produced a GISFC of 192 g/kWh with smoke emissions that had an FSN of less than 1, with NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions less than 1 g/kg of fuel, with THC emissions of 19 g/kg of fuel and with CO emissions of 39 g/kg of fuel.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>This work confirmed an earlier finding by the present authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954407012440937">15</xref></sup> that low-NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>-emission low-smoke-emission LTC can be obtained at reduced (approximately 52%) EGR levels by adopting a split-injection fuelling strategy. Importantly, the results of the present study showed that the engine-out emissions from reduced-EGR split-injection LTC operation are relatively insensitive to changes in the key engine and fuel system operating parameters, the major sensitivity being those of the hydrocarbon emissions and fuel consumption to the intake oxygen mass fraction. The THC and CO emissions remain high and warrant further research. However, the combination of a low-EGR requirement and the relative insensitivity of the emissions results to perturbations around a nominal operating point suggest that reduced-EGR ‘mixing-controlled’ LTC is a significantly more practical proposition for production automotive engines than has been previously demonstrated in the literature.</p>
