<p>Many diagnostic tests have nonbinary results. Thus, this fourth installment of our series in evidence-based medicine in otolaryngology focuses on understanding diagnostic tests with more than 2 possible results. We begin with a brief review of the types of multilevel results to be considered: continuous, ordinal, and nominal. Next, we discuss each of type in greater detail, including the methods to determine the posttest probability associated with each type of test result. The use of serial diagnostic tests and practicalities are also discussed. Frequently used diagnostic tests are utilized as examples.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent studies have shown that the majority of physicians cannot accurately determine the probability of disease based on a diagnostic test result,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813491070">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813491070">2</xref></sup> even when they are presented with the patient’s characteristics and the test’s sensitivity and specificity. The capacity to determine the posttest probability of disease is critical when making decisions regarding interventions based on a diagnostic test result. Misunderstanding such probabilities may lead to errors in judgment and impedes evidence-based practice, since even correct data regarding a useful intervention may be misapplied. Therefore, we have dedicated parts 3 and 4 of this series to an exposition of determining the probabilities of disease based on results of diagnostic testing.</p>
<p>In the preceding installment, we discussed the interpretation of diagnostic tests with binary (positive or negative) results. In this current installment, we focus on diagnostic tests with nonbinary (positive, negative, and intermediate) results, since additional levels of potential test results have implications for the test’s sensitivity and specificity, as well as the associated posttest probabilities. First, we consider the different types of nonbinary test results: continuous, ordinal, and nominal. Second, we discuss continuous results in detail, including the implications of varying cutoff points and receiver operator characteristic curves. Third, we consider ordinal results in detail, including means to determine posttest probabilities for results that are neither positive nor negative. Fourth, we discuss nominal results in more detail. Fifth, we review concepts and methods for evaluating serial use of more than 1 diagnostic test. Last, we consider practical aspects of these calculations.</p>
<p>Consider the following scenario: A 40-year-old woman presents with a thyroid nodule and undergoes fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the lesion. The FNA results return showing a follicular neoplasm. Her pretest probability of disease (follicular carcinoma) is estimated to be 27%. She plans to undergo thyroidectomy and asks her physician to estimate her chance of having a malignancy. Consider the following clinical questions: What is the probability of malignancy in her thyroidectomy specimen? When calculating the sensitivity and specificity of FNA, should a follicular neoplasm result be considered as a positive (malignant) or negative (benign) result? Is there a way to determine the posttest probability of malignancy with this result, without relying on the sensitivity and specificity? The subsequent sections address the answers to these and related questions.</p>

<sec id="section2-0194599813491070">
<title>Sensitivity and Specificity of Nonbinary Diagnostic Tests May Be Variable</title>
<p>Sensitivity and specificity are defined in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. Tests with nonbinary test results, however, have more than these simple 4 components. The additional potential levels of results introduce another element of variability in the diagnostic test characteristics.</p>

<title>Types of Nonbinary Diagnostic Test Results</title>
<p>Nonbinary diagnostic test results may be continuous, ordinal, or nominal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599813491070"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). <italic>Continuous test results are numeric with an inherent order and incremental differences between numbers are equal</italic>. For example, measurements of thyroid nodule diameter are continuous. A result of 2.5 cm is higher than that of 2.4 cm, and the difference between 2.5 cm and 2.4 cm is the same as the difference between 2.4 cm and 2.3 cm. Continuous results can be considered in their inherent unit increments, or they can be stratified into broader levels and analyzed as ordinal data.</p>

<p><italic>Ordinal test results have multiple categories with an inherent order, but incremental differences between adjacent categories are not necessarily equal</italic>. For example, a modified video swallow study may return results of gross aspiration, micro aspiration, penetration only, disordered swallow without penetration or aspiration, or normal swallow. There are 5 potential results, each with a successively more favorable implication for swallowing, so the results have an inherent order. The difference between gross aspiration and micro aspiration is not exactly equal to the difference between micro aspiration and penetration, so there are not equal differences among groups. Ordinal categories may also be used to analyze continuous results. For example, if thyroid nodule size (continuous data, as discussed previously) is considered in categories of less than 1 cm, 1 to 3 cm, and greater than 3 cm, then these categorical classifications are ordinal.</p>
<p><italic>Nominal results are categorical, but with no associated order</italic>. For example, consider an MRI of a petrous apex lesion. The MRI may return with results consistent with a cholesterol granuloma, cholesteatoma, inflammatory disease, or a schwannoma, among other lesions. There is no clear ordered value of each lesion, nor is it simply a binary result. Whether test results are continuous, ordinal, or nominal, such nonbinary results raise additional considerations regarding sensitivity and specificity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0194599813491070">
<title>Continuous Diagnostic Test Results</title>
<p>Continuous diagnostic test results are typically interpreted according to set cutoff points. In some tests, results above the cutoff point are considered normal, whereas the values below are considered abnormal. In other tests, results below the cutoff point are accepted as normal, whereas the values above are considered abnormal.</p>
<p><italic>The sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test with continuous results vary according to the established value of the cutoff point</italic>. In general, as the cutoff point is changed to maximize sensitivity, the specificity decreases, and vice versa. The choice of cutoff point is therefore critical and sometimes controversial. Choosing the ideal cutoff point may be based on several factors, such as: (1) maximizing sensitivity, (2) maximizing specificity, or (3) optimally balancing of sensitivity and specificity.</p>
<p>In some instances, one may wish to maximize sensitivity and thereby minimize the probability of false negative results. Consider a test that screens for the initial stages of an infection that is potentially fatal and highly contagious. In this situation, it may be both in the public’s and patient’s best interest to use a highly sensitive test to find all cases of the infection, even if it increases the chance of false positives. When a goal of increasing sensitivity exists, potentially intermediate results are considered as positive, in order to safeguard the general public. A test with high sensitivity means that a negative result is more likely to rule the disease out.</p>
<p>In other instances, one may wish to maximize specificity and thereby minimize the probability of false positive results. Consider a test that screens for a mild disease that requires a high-risk follow-up procedure for diagnosis. When the goal is to maximize specificity, intermediate results may be considered as negative, in order to minimize risks associated with the follow-up procedure. In general, a test with high specificity means that a positive result is more likely to signify the presence of true disease.</p>
<p>One may also wish to achieve a balance of optimal sensitivity and specificity. To achieve this goal, a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve may be utilized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813491070">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813491070">4</xref></sup> The ROC curve is a plot of the true positive rate (sensitivity) versus the false positive rate (1 – specificity), where the points on the curve delineate potential cutoff points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813491070"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). The ROC curve visually demonstrates several key aspects of a continuous diagnostic test. First, it depicts the reciprocal changes in sensitivity and specificity that occur with changes in the cutoff point. Second, it describes the overall accuracy of the test. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) may be used as a measure of the discriminatory ability of the test (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599813491070"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). The AUC can theoretically take values between 0 and 1, but the practical lower bound for the AUC is 0.5. An AUC of 0.5 is represented by a diagonal line on the ROC plot and is the line obtained if we relied on pure chance to distinguish patients with and without an outcome (ie, a useless test). In contrast, an AUC of 1 suggests a perfect test. The AUC can be calculated with a 95% confidence interval, and if the interval contains the value 0.5, then the test may not have true utility. Stated another way, the closer the ROC curve lies to the diagonal of the plot, the less meaningful the results are. This diagonal is referred to as “the line of insignificance” and points on this line depict a test that cannot discriminate between the diseased and nondiseased state. Third, the ROC curve can be used to determine the cutoff point that simultaneously achieves the highest sensitivity and specificity. The point on the curve that lies closest to the upper left portion of the graph is the cutoff point that maximizes the combination of sensitivity and specificity. Fourth, the ROC curve can be used to provide an estimate of the likelihood ratio (LR[+]) at each cutoff point. The slope of the tangent line at each point is equal to the LR(+) for that test result. Fifth, the AUCs for different diagnostic tests can be used to compare their relative utility. When comparing 2 AUCs, if the 95% confidence bands do not overlap, then the AUC and therefore test characteristics are statistically significantly different from each other.</p>

The slope of this line indicates the likelihood ratio for the cutoff point at that site.</p>

<title>Posttest Probability for Continuous Test Results</title>
<p>Continuous test results that are evaluated according to a particular cutoff point for positive versus negative results have a particular sensitivity and specificity for each cutoff point. As long as the specific cutoff value is accepted, the posttest probability can be calculated according to the same methods utilized for binary test results, as described in the previous installment, with the caveat that the user should understand that the sensitivity and specificity has variability according to the chosen cutoff. In addition, the LR(+) at each cutoff point can be utilized to calculate the posttest probability. Using the LR(+) to determine the posttest probability for nonbinary tests is further described in the following section on ordinal test results.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0194599813491070">
<title>Ordinal Diagnostic Test Results</title>
<p>Ordinal test results typically have a clearly positive value, a clearly negative value, and several intermediate values. <italic>The sensitivity and specificity vary according to how the intermediate values are assigned as either positive or negative results</italic>. The intermediate values need to be included in the numerator or denominator, but there may not be a clear consensus on how to account for them. For example, fine needle aspirates of the thyroid may have 6 potential tiers of results:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813491070">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813491070">6</xref></sup> malignant (positive), suspicious for malignancy (indeterminate), follicular neoplasm (indeterminate), follicular lesion of undetermined significance/atypia of undetermined significance (indeterminate), benign (negative), and nondiagnostic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599813491070"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). The indeterminate results must be sorted as either positives or negatives in order to perform the classic calculations for sensitivity and specificity. There is notable variability in how the results have been sorted for this particular test when doing these calculations in the published literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813491070">5</xref></sup> Thyroid FNA has a reported sensitivity of 35% to 98% and specificity of 40% to 99%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813491070">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813491070"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813491070">7</xref></sup> These wide ranges are in part due to the variability in cutoff points used during the data analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813491070">5</xref></sup> The sensitivity and specificity of FNA are 86% and 62%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813491070">5</xref></sup>
<italic>if all indeterminate results are considered as positive results</italic>. If, however, the indeterminate results are not all considered as positive, then the sensitivity and specificity change. Nonbinary diagnostic test results thus create the potential for variability in the estimation of the sensitivity and specificity of the test, based on the chosen assignments of the intermediate results as positive or negative. These assignments have substantial impact on the perceived characteristics of the clinical tests.</p>

As discussed in the previous installment, the likelihood ratio is the ratio of the density of the test result given that disease is present relative to the density of the test result given that disease is absent.

<title>Posttest Probability for Ordinal Test Results</title>
<p>Although the clinical implications of results that are not strictly positive or negative may seem somewhat ill defined, ordinal test results still have clearly definable posttest probabilities. Posttest probabilities for results that are neither positive nor negative may be determined with the aid of diagnostic likelihood ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599813491070"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). Consider an example data set, obtained from a retrospective review of 1621 patients who underwent FNA of thyroid nodules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813491070">8</xref></sup> Among these, 401 patients underwent both FNA and subsequent histologic examination of thyroidectomy specimens. Among the patients who underwent thyroidectomy, the prevalence of malignancy was 27.9%.</p>
<p>Consider the patient population that warrants a thyroidectomy (lobectomy or total). If the pretest probability of malignancy is 0.279, this data set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813491070">8</xref></sup> can be analyzed according to the method described in the caption to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599813491070"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>. The pretest odds are calculated as odds = probability / (1 – probability). In this case, the pretest odds are equal to 0.279 / (1 – 0.279) = 0.388. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0194599813491070"><bold>Table 4</bold></xref> shows the posttest odds and probabilities associated with each type of result. The odds of malignancy versus no malignancy in a patient who had a suspicious FNA result were 2.167, translating to a 68.4% posttest probability of malignancy. FNA results showing follicular neoplasm and follicular lesions of undetermined significance were associated with posttest probabilities of 33.0% and 27.4%, respectively.</p>

<p>Posttest probabilities of nonbinary diagnostic tests are still affected by alterations in the pretest probabilities. Consider a patient population in which the pretest probability is less, for example just 0.021 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0194599813491070"><bold>Table 5</bold></xref>). In this case, the pretest odds are equal to 0.021 / (1 – 0.021) = 0.021. The likelihood ratios remain stable properties of a diagnostic test and do not change with a change in the pretest probability. The posttest probabilities, however, do change in this low-prevalence population. Using the same diagnostic FNA, the probability of malignancy in a patient who had a suspicious result decreased to 10.7%. Results showing follicular neoplasm and follicular lesion of undetermined significance were associated with posttest probabilities of 2.6% and 2.0%, respectively, also decreased compared to the population described previously. As with binary test results, a lower pretest probability makes a negative result more meaningful, and here a benign (negative) test result has just a 0.4% chance of malignancy.</p>

<title>Nominal Diagnostic Test Results</title>
<p>Nominal diagnostic test results may be analyzed in 2 ways. First, they may be analyzed using likelihood ratios. For example, consider an MRI of petrous apex lesions that may have results consistent with a cholesterol granuloma, cholesteatoma, inflammatory disease, or schwannoma. The likelihood ratio for each of the diagnoses may be determined, namely, LR (cholesterol granuloma), LR (cholesteatoma), LR (inflammatory disease), or LR (schwannoma). These likelihood ratios can then be used to determine the posttest probabilities, using the same method as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599813491070"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>. Second, the results may be transformed into separate binary formats (eg, MRI sensitivity for cholesterol granuloma, MRI sensitivity for cholesteatoma, MRI sensitivity for inflammatory disease, and MRI sensitivity for schwannoma). Each of these analyses can then be processed according to the methods described in the previous installment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0194599813491070">
<title>Diagnostic Tests in Combination</title>
<p>Clinicians frequently use diagnostic tests in combination, since a single test may not have the capacity for both high sensitivity and high specificity. Thus, 2 or sometimes even 3 tests may be used in sequence. For example, one may start with a test that has high sensitivity, such that a negative result means disease is most likely absent. The subset that tests positive on that initial test then undergoes a follow-up study with high specificity, such that a positive result means the disease is most likely present.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813491070">9</xref></sup> One example of this approach is in a child where a juvenile nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a diagnostic concern. One may begin with a CT scan with contrast, for example, then perform a follow-up angiogram prior to embolization and resection.</p>
<p>When diagnostic tests are used in combination, use of the LR confers an additional advantage. <italic>When calculating the posttest probability of disease, the likelihood ratios of sequential tests can be used in simple sequence:</italic>

<p>One does not need to calculate the results of 3 separate equations. The calculations can be performed in a single equation. Consider an example scenario: A patient presents with a firm thyroid nodule and undergoes ultrasound and fine needle aspiration with suspicious results.

<title>Practicalities</title>
<p>It may be difficult to perform these calculations in real time. Therefore, if one utilizes certain diagnostic tests frequently, then it can be useful to do the calculations for sample scenarios ahead of time and then reference or learn the associated posttest probabilities. For example, consider thyroid FNA. One might consider 3 types of patient scenarios prior to an FNA: low pretest probability (approximately 20%), intermediate pretest probability (approximately 50%), and high pretest probability (approximately 80%). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0194599813491070"><bold>Table 7</bold></xref>, each category of pretest probability is associated with a posttest probability for each FNA result. For example, a suspicious result may have a posttest probability as low as 0.583 in a low pretest probability patient, but as high as 0.957 in a high pretest probability patient. Knowing or referencing a table similar to this for one’s most commonly utilized diagnostic tests can allow the information to be used in day-to-day practice. While online calculators are increasingly available to compute probabilities associated with binary tests, they are not readily available for multilevel tests in a user-friendly format.</p>

<title>Summary and Conclusions</title>
<p>Diagnostic tests with multiple levels of results are frequently used in the daily practice of otolaryngology. Such nonbinary test results are associated with potential variability in sensitivity and specificity. The method of determining posttest probability using pretest odds and likelihood ratios is versatile and consistently of use. An accurate understanding of posttest probabilities is crucial to making accurate judgments regarding the need for intervention based on diagnostic test results. A correct understanding of probabilities is needed to apply data from studies appropriately, an integral component of evidence-based practice.</p>
