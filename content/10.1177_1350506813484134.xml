<abstract>
<p>Narratives of street life from British Bangladeshi Muslim mothers, collected in the aftermath of the suicide bombings in London in 2005, are the focus of this article. The author examines how temporal schemas that combine the unpredictable time of racist events with a rendering of a foreseeable linear temporality of racism and of intergenerational identifications in the future provide the women with a means of living with ontological insecurity and threat. Although this reproduction of linear time can appear to exclude the singularity of unknown futures, with regard to the demands of multicultural living, understanding of time can be more open and undecided. The author locates an ethicality to the mothers’ deliberations in how to live in situations marked by racism and multiculturalism in both their negotiation of temporal registers and in the sharing and interrogation of perspectives and strategies with others. Particular attention is given to the ambivalent use of temporality as an instrument of narrative agency. The discussion also considers how the methodological apparatus of the focus group is engaged with matters of intimate citizenship, conveying and participating in the production of the research problem.</p>

<p>We can move through the same streets every day, wafted along by those visceral alliances between unthinking reflexes, sights, sounds, smells and temporal rhythms that together give us a habitual sense of place. And then all of a sudden the taken-for-granted of it all can fall apart. Things change. Matters of how to live with others, how to live now and in the future, surface and press in on us.</p>
<p>In this article I investigate stories of everyday street life from British Bangladeshi Muslim mothers collected in the aftermath of the suicide bombings in London in 2005. What interests me about these accounts is a place-based ‘intimate citizenship’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350506813484134">Berlant, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1350506813484134">Plummer, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350506813484134">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350506813484134">Smyth, 2008</xref>) and what it reveals about narrative agency and temporal schema at times of uncertainty. Seemingly oxymoronic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350506813484134">Smyth, 2008</xref>), the conceptualization of intimate citizenship does more than track a reterritorialization in the braiding of the public and the intimate, whereby personal practices – such as what you wear and how you parent – have made ‘people public, producing trans-personal identities and subjectivities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350506813484134">Berlant, 1998</xref>: 283). As Lauren Berlant first pointed out in <italic>The Queen of America Goes to Washington City</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350506813484134">1997</xref>), and as more recent feminist scholarship suggests, issues of rights and obligations with regard to such diverse matters as risk, prognoses and probability are continually reconfiguring temporalities of belonging and the regulation of populations. What is most at stake it seems in contemporary contestations of intimate citizenship is the body and how certain bodies ‘live and get to live time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350506813484134">Puar, 2009</xref>: 166).</p>
<p>It is important to point out at this stage that the notion of narrative agency that I use in this discussion does not rely upon idealizations of agency as individual or moral autonomy, a ‘slumbering ember’ of resistance to domination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350506813484134">Mahmood, 2005</xref>: 8). Rather, drawing upon ideas from the anthropologist Carol Greenhouse, I consider agency as something entirely more banal, not necessarily connected to intentionality or to dramatic actions that change the present. Perhaps indifferent to matters of domination/subordination, sometimes reiterating tradition and normalcy, agency for Greenhouse can be found in how people understand the temporality of how one thing leads to another (causation) and what is possible. Agency, Greenhouse contends, unearths usually tacit ‘cultural propositions about how the universe works’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350506813484134">1996</xref>: 4).</p>
<p>Working with the mothers’ accounts, given in a focus group, I examine how temporal schemas that combine the unpredictable time of racist events with a rendering of a foreseeable linear temporality of racism and of intergenerational identifications provide the women with a means of living with ontological insecurity and threat. Although this reproduction of linear time can appear to exclude the singularity of unknown futures and others, with regard to the demands of multicultural living, understanding of time can be more open and undecided. I locate an ethicality to the mothers’ deliberations in how to live in situations marked by racism and multiculturalism in both their negotiation of temporal registers and in the sharing and interrogation of perspectives and strategies with others.</p>

<title>Intimate citizens of the road</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350506813484134">Irene Gedalof (2012)</xref> has argued, attention to the disruption of public places by the appearance of subaltern mothers brings us to matters of belonging and the right to occupy public space. In the case of these British Muslim mothers not only ‘Where have <italic>they</italic> come from?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350506813484134">Gedalof, 2012</xref>: 85, original emphasis) but also ‘What are they <italic>doing</italic> here?’ In what follows, the constellations of intimate citizenship that concern me are those fabricated out of what the anthropologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1350506813484134">Kathleen Stewart (2007)</xref> has dubbed ‘ordinary affects’. For Stewart, ordinary affects have a material life and a temporal quality of the unfinished, reverberating between bodies, objects and social worlds:<disp-quote>
<p>Ordinary affects are public feelings that begin and end in broad circulation, but they’re also the stuff that seemingly intimate lives are made of. They give circuits and flows the forms of a life. They can be experienced as a pleasure and a shock, as an empty pause or a dragging undertow, as a sensibility that snaps into place or a profound disorientation … they can be seen as both the pressure points of events or banalities suffered and the trajectories that forces might take if they were to go unchecked. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1350506813484134">Stewart, 2007</xref>: 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The geographer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350506813484134">Daniel Swanton (2008)</xref>, amongst others, suggests that the street is an especially potent zone of contact in multicultural living where racialized differences are continuously sorted and assembled through ordinary affects. Not so much a constant, race for Swanton is an ‘assemblage’ shaped, modulated and put together through bundles of energetic and evolving forces. He writes,<disp-quote>
<p>For some – at particular times, or under certain intensities of sunlight – connections between particular bodies, things and spaces stir swirling intensities of terror, hate, fear and loathing. For others these temporary fixings of race inspire curiosity and engagement. Then again these assemblages might constitute an affective depression, laden with routine, banality and indifference.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There is an ontological and temporal roominess to such relational approaches to race that give attention to the content, tempo, shapes and changing (in)determinacy of everyday encounters. Although such diversity may characterize race-making in day-to-day life, racism as a temporality can also be experienced as more stable and enduring. And of course, to think about the ordinary affects of racialization on the streets for Muslim mothers at this contemporary moment is to involve ourselves in a bigger dialogue. A dialogue about gender equality and multiculturalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350506813484134">Benhabib, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1350506813484134">Phillips, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350506813484134">Prins, 2006</xref>), about mothering as a site of reproduction for race, nation and heteronormativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1350506813484134">Puar, 2007</xref>) and a dialogue in which the very category ‘Muslim’ has become homogenized and threatening amidst concerns of securitization and terrorism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350506813484134">Ahmad and Evergeti, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>With specific reference to Muslim immigrants, Humphrey tells us that ‘Muslim immigrants in the West have come to occupy the space of the abject, the racialised slot of the “suspect other” … at the limits of citizenship’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350506813484134">2009</xref>: 137). The racializing of Muslims as suspicious, dangerous and disloyal citizens is not confined to immigrants. British researchers have identified novel discourses of racialization arising from the involvement of British Muslims in the 7 July 2005 London bombings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350506813484134">Featherstone et al. (2010)</xref> argue that a post ‘7/7’ discourse has reordered British Muslims’ relationships to the state through the collapsing of the binaries foreign Muslim/British Muslim and ‘good’ Muslim/‘bad’ Muslim.</p>
<p>As much as such reconfigurations in race-making are being recognized, for many commentators it is the young Muslim man who remains the iconic threat to western democracies and whose citizenship has been most undermined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350506813484134">Humphrey, 2009</xref>). Yet, the effects of what can be described as a ‘super-surveillance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1350506813484134">Puwar, 2004</xref>) of Muslim citizens is by no means restricted to Muslim men and entails diverse modes of gendered racialization. The use of the term citizenship in such discussions is varied. Citizenship can denote a formal legal status conferred by the nation-state. It also includes more discursive and regulatory forms of transnational governmentality in which struggles over inclusion and exclusion are being performed and interrogated on the terrain of rights and obligations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350506813484134">Isin and Turner, 2002</xref>), community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350506813484134">Anderson, 2013</xref>) and ‘civilization’ itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350506813484134">Mahmood, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the ‘7/7’ bombings some of the mothers in our focus group talked about anti-Islamic sentiment and suspicion being projected onto them as <italic>quasi</italic> as-if-terrorists, producing something akin to a Duboisian double consciousness: the ‘sense of always looking at one’s self through the eyes of others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350506813484134">DuBois, 1994 [1903]</xref>: 2). In the public spaces of trains and supermarkets, the women could also find themselves complicit with the public surveillance and scrutiny of men’s bodies:</p>

<p>After the terrorist attack [July 2005] and I’m driving past, yeah, he’s [a stranger] like got his mobile out trying to take my number. I mean, you know actually recording it and I’m like ‘This is unbelievable’ and I just ignore it …</p>

<p>Well you try not to, but to be honest, I mean I um, I was going in Tesco [supermarket] and I saw this guy with a beard and … he had a backpack, and suddenly ‘Oh my God’ … I mean OK, I am being a Muslim myself, if I’m feeling like this-</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Several of the women:</speaker>
<p>Yeah</p>
</speech>
<p>The rubric of intimate citizenship captures and problematizes these material, affective and temporal relays between the public and the personal. However, an area that is unexplored in the intimate citizenship literature is how such relays are intertwined with our methodological devices, how methods are engaged with the matters that we investigate. In this case my concern is with the interactional and ethical apparatus of the focus group interview that convenes bodies, stories and opinions, and where polyphony can simultaneously convey and block the publicizing of intimacy. So my interest is in the mutual constitution of method and research problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350506813484134">Lury and Wakeford, 2012</xref>). There are two aspects of this constitution that I explicate. First, how focus groups can manufacture a ‘paradoxical’ spatiotemporality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1350506813484134">Rose, 1993</xref>), eliciting, showing and obscuring the extent to which phenomenon on either side of a threshold – intimate/public – can exist at the same time as well as sequentially. And second, how the dialogic nature of the method can promote an accounting for oneself in the presence of ‘narrative others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350506813484134">Cavarero, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>The research</title>
<p>The focus group from which the mothers’ accounts are drawn was a part of an ESRC (Economic and Social Research Council) funded project carried out with 19 first time mothers in Tower Hamlets, a poor and socially diverse area in East London. Carried out between 2004 and 2007, the study wanted to understand how women make sense of the identity transition involved in becoming a mother for the first time (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350506813484134">Elliott et al., 2009</xref> for an example). Wendy Hollway and Ann Phoenix led the project, with research also being conducted by Heather Elliott, Cathy Urwin, myself and trainee child psychoanalytic psychotherapists undertaking infant observation.</p>
<p>The mothers who took part in the focus group were drawn from outside our core sample of 19 first time mothers. The rationale for using focus groups was to interrogate and contextualize the emerging findings from the one-to-one interviews.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1350506813484134">1</xref></sup> The women in the focus group were aged between 20 and 35. Soraya (all names are pseudonyms) was a first time mother. Nasreen (with two young children) and Shirin (with one child and pregnant with her second) were sisters. Ameera was a disabled mother with five children and Tahira had four children. Munira had one young child and was pregnant. All of the women except Tahira were wearing either a burka or the hijab. I facilitated the interview, with Heather Elliott acting as an observer. The discussion was audio-recorded and fully transcribed.</p>
<p>In analysing the interview data, the focus group accounts were compared with narratives of ethno-religious identity in the one-to-one interviews with nine Bangladeshi mothers from the wider project (the women were interviewed three times). The comparison showed that ethno-religious identifications were narrated in a variety of different ways, and sometimes not at all for the Bangladeshi Muslim mothers in the core study group. Ethno-religious identifications were more muted and/or were more directly drawn out by researchers in the one-to-one interviews. In the focus group it was the participants who initiated discussions about identity. For example at the very beginning of the interview I asked an open narrative-inducing question about what is was like for the women to live in Tower Hamlets,</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Yasmin:</speaker>
<p>I don’t live in Tower Hamlets, but I just wondered if you could describe for me what it’s like for you living in Tower Hamlets? So any stories of everyday experiences, I mean even what you have been doing today that will give me a feel of, you know, what it’s really like to live here as a mother?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Tahira:</speaker>
<p>I would say, yeah, I would say it’s easy actually because we’ve got lots of facilities around and … it’s easy to get to them. And I don’t know, like I said, I actually, you know, like I said to you. I really like Tower Hamlets. And even though its houses and over-populated, I still like it. There’s a lot of things around where you can go and-</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ameera:</speaker>
<p>I think I agree with that too, because most of my family live up North … and they want me to go down there with them for the easier life … But in a way it’s better [in Tower Hamlets], even though you’ve got the disadvantage of drugs … it’s better in the way … because our children have got the different cultures here, like you can practise, you know like up North … you get stares, you get looks and like people really discriminate you. But like around here like, it’s easy to practise your beliefs because you see other sisters around … you see practising people, so it’s easy to adjust with everything, so your kids can see what’s going on like, different culture people and everything else.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Yasmin:</speaker>
<p>Do you mean particularly in terms of your religious practices and beliefs?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ameera:</speaker>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Yasmin:</speaker>
<p>So it’s quite important in terms of your Muslim identity and faith?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ameera:</speaker>
<p>It’s very important to me.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Nasreen:</speaker>
<p>I feel safe, yeah. For me, I think, the multicultural side of things is really an advantage, especially about living in Tower Hamlets, going about, seeing different faces, different colours, meeting with different people. And I feel proud to belong to a community that is just like this, so I feel, I feel good about that.</p>
</speech>
<p>The spontaneous discussion of being a practising Muslim did not feature in this way in the one-to-one interviews with Bangladeshi mothers. A possible reason for the difference is that the latter interviews were most explicitly concerned with the very first stages of becoming a mother, coinciding with and eliciting narratives of giving birth, feeding and the renegotiation of family relationships. This finding of differences in the nature of the interview accounts also supports the claims made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350506813484134">Sue Wilkinson (1998)</xref> that in focus groups participants are more able to exert control over the topics discussed. And at times it is some participants who exercise this control more than others. As you will notice the conversations about ethno-religious identifications were dominated by three women – Ameera, Soraya and Tahira. As the discussion moved on to consider a vignette about breast-feeding, the other women were more able to speak about their experiences of mothering.</p>
<sec id="section3-1350506813484134">
<title>Content, shape, tempo, flow</title>
<p>The interactions between the women and the shape of the transcribed extracts are especially interesting in considering the extent to which research methods are riveted technologies of intimate citizenship, capturing, facilitating and confounding the publicizing of the personal and the intimate. For example, of relevance is the velocity and pared-down quality of some of the exchanges, the way that the women talk in shorthand, pick up and finish off each other’s sentences and burst into simultaneous laughter and talk. It is tempting to read the kinetic flow and pulsations of the interactions as a sign of shared identifications and intimacy produced through synchronous, fast moving and condensed communication. To ‘intimate is to communicate with the barest of signs and gestures’, Berlant has observed, while ‘intimacy … involves an aspiration for a narrative about something shared’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350506813484134">1998</xref>: 281).</p>
<p>We should be cautious however about reading intimacy into the topology of the exchanges. Accelerated, simultaneous and economic talk may build up interactional flow and rapport, but it does not necessarily entail shared meanings. On the contrary, the danger of eliding simultaneity with commensurability is that the latter can occlude difference and its contestations within the ‘same’ moment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350506813484134">Bastian, 2011</xref>). For instance, in the midst of a long and rapid conversation between the women about dress as a symbolization of the practising of Islam, Tahira (the only woman in the group who did not cover) interrupted the exchange and sent it off in another direction by asking for a clarification of basic meanings and terms. She asked ‘When people say practise this and that, it’s like, well, just by covering your head, does that mean practice?’ This interception drew out tacit perspectives on the varied symbolic and temporal semiotics of dress and religious practice, with a consensus being reached that a woman’s decision to cover should come ‘from the heart’ and only when she is ‘ready’.</p>
<p>Simultaneous talk between the women is also problematic methodologically. Overlapping, engulfing talk was difficult, sometimes impossible, to decipher. It defied transcription, demonstrating the greater acoustic potential within group interviews for participants to both signify and limit the exposure of conversational intimacies. As a consequence, the distance and the ambiguities of transfer between the listening ear and the polyphony of recorded voices are more evident. The nature of these empirically convened intimacies though seemingly apparent, cannot be verified or made fully public, rendering them especially conditional and ragged. And so routine – often behind the scenes – practices of recording, transcribing and categorizing are disrupted and opened to scrutiny. At the same time, the focus group apparatus becomes more visible/audible as an active participant in the creation of the research object, mimicking and gesturing towards the paradoxical flows between the intimate and the public that the concept of intimate citizenship is concerned with.</p>
<p>Because interactions in focus groups are a vital part of the method, in the following discussion where I examine narratives of dress, racialized hostility and mothering dilemmas, I have tried to respect the recommended practice of not presenting interview extracts as ‘decontextualised snippets’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350506813484134">Frith and Kitzinger, 1998</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-1350506813484134">
<title>Dress</title>
<p>In listening to the women’s conversations about dress and clothing – a recurrent, but variegated theme in their conversations – it became apparent that the topic of what the women wore and when, moved beyond the purely descriptive or religious. Talk about dress, and covering in particular, was used by the women in three main ways: to signify contested relations between substance and superficiality in identity practices; to mark the women’s movements through time and space (including biographical transitions and intergenerational relationships); and to demonstrate the move from identity as being positioned to being practised.</p>
<p>The following excerpt centres upon a narrative from Ameera. Ameera said that she began wearing the hijab after her five-year-old daughter took the decision to cover in 2001. This is itself a reversal of the dominant temporality of intergenerational transmission where tradition is seen as being passed forwards. In the extract, Ameera talks about how wearing the hijab whilst driving her car has disturbed the everyday give and take on London’s roads. This account was preceded by an exchange between Monira and Soraya about whether Tower Hamlets was a place of safety for practising Muslims.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Soraya:</speaker>
<p>… I guess you know, until you’ve moved you wouldn’t know.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ameera:</speaker>
<p>I think it depends how much confident you are in yourself.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Several of the women:</speaker>
<p>Yeah</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ameera:</speaker>
<p>Like before I was, you know really, really scared and after I started practising, and ’cause I felt like that usually when I was driving along and I wasn’t wearing a headscarf I used to get ‘Yeah come on, get past’ (gesturing being waved-on with her hand) and all that ‘you can go’.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Munira:</speaker>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ameera:</speaker>
<p>And since I’ve started wearing it, no-one would give me (laughs) room. Trying to take a right turn, people are going past and when they see me it’s like-</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Soraya:</speaker>
<p>Same to you</p>
<p><italic>Several women talking at once, untranscribable</italic>.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ameera:</speaker>
<p>I actually let people cross the road and they won’t go!</p>
<p><italic>Laughter. Several of the women talking at once, untranscribable.</italic></p>
</speech>
<p>Ameera’s story pivots on the binaries of linear time as a ‘before’ and an ‘after’ (of wearing a headscarf) and as continuous and disjunctive. The account records how changes in the social – with regard to increased hostility towards Muslims in London – can filter into something as ordinary, habitual and controlled as driving. The narrated significance of the event derives its extraordinariness from the playing off of two interrelated significations. First, there is driving as a highly mapped out and choreographed spatiotemporal system with rules, anticipatory calculations and social obligations (the latter of which involve voluntary ‘good’ citizenly practices such as stopping to allow the passage of others). Second, is the depiction of more arbitrary unpredictables that can cause a stalling in the expected flow of traffic (reciprocal courtesies being withheld or refused).</p>
<p>If time can be a tool for managing social differences through the production of commensurabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350506813484134">Greenhouse, 1996</xref>), Ameera’s story shows how gendered and racialized difference can be fabricated and excluded through incommensurabilities. Ameera’s body when marked by the hijab is not allowed to become a part of the familiar and synchronized motility of life on London’s roads. Her visibly inscribed body becomes a body out of place by virtue of being thrown out of linear time, disrupting the smooth workings of the world around her.</p>

<title>Global and local terror: Natality and being in London on 7/7</title>
<p>The following account from Soraya emerged from the discussion reported earlier between Shirin and Ameera about suspicion – including their own – towards visible Muslims in London following the 7 July bombings. Soraya’s story was narrated virtually uninterrupted over three pages of the interview transcript. The account describes events that took place in Soraya’s local petrol station on the 7 July 2005:<disp-quote>
<p>I put my headscarf on just before I became pregnant, and I stopped filling up at the petrol station because it stank. So there was this big gap until when I went there, which was on the 7th July … last year was it? (one of the women: ‘yeah’). I filled up, went to the petrol station. Oh it was horrible. I was like five months pregnant and um obviously the emotion was in me. I was having a big cry at home thinking ‘Well I’ve decided to actually practise my religion properly, but these idiots go and do this, and I am to blame. Now it’s me, my family, my children, my future children, they’re gonna be affected. They are labelled already and they haven’t even had a chance to come into this world.’ But I put that aside, went to the petrol station and the first thing I had was ‘Bloody terrorists, oh they should all go back.’ This is a lady just … filling up her car and she’s saying this. I’m like ‘Forget it. She’s ignorant’, went into the er (.) station to pay, he wouldn’t even look at me. This was the same guy that would make such a, he’d make a point of speaking to me … And I know he recognized me. I mean I don’t cover completely … He wouldn’t even look at me and I’m like ‘OK, right’ and since then … a lot of people … who’ve known you from before … and they don’t judge you, but then you’ve got some people who did know you back then, who know you now and just (.) their perception of you is completely changed.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In similar ways to Ameera’s account, in this story there is a temporality of a before and an after of an identity transition. In this instance, the passing of time is marked in the wearing of the hijab and in Soraya’s pregnancy and becoming a mother, all of which are located against the externalized temporality of the 7 July bombings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350506813484134">Hannah Arendt’s (1998 [1958])</xref> theorizing of natality as the bodily process of gestation and giving birth to an unknown other and as the opportunity for a new unforeseeable future is valuable in thinking about the different types of violation, agency and time and their varied meanings in the narrative.</p>
<p>As a Muslim mother-to-be, Soraya fears that in the aftermath of the 7 July attacks, her unborn child and her future children will be preknown and misrecognized. The relationships between biological and political natality in Soraya’s story are nuanced in their multiple connotations (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350506813484134">Guenther, 2006</xref>). That a being <italic>in utero</italic> could be ‘labelled’ and identified before his/her emergence into the social world is an absurd violation. Nevertheless, the idea of the unborn child as already racialized exposes as it dramatizes the very ordinary symbolic violence and temporal registers of racialization that always rely upon preknowing.</p>
<p>It is significant that the narrative here moves from a description of the petrol station event to a moral evaluation of the repercussions of the ‘7/7’ bombings for Soraya’s children. It is in this movement in the telling of the story that there is also a temporal sweep of identification in mothering as cultural reproduction. Within the account there is a taken-for-grantedness that Soraya’s unborn child will be a Muslim like her and that Islamophobia will also continue to flow into the future. So in the midst of the narrative projection of a threatening present into a fantasized future, the child is again foreseen. What differentiates this preknowing is the extent to which it can be read as a response to and a protection from racism at times of profound uncertainty and when a community is under threat.</p>
<p>I would like to pursue and further interrogate Carol Greenhouse’s ideas about the use of time as a device of agency in tracing how Soraya’s story is narrated as affecting and flowing into her future. Directly after the account above Soraya spoke of another incident, weeks before our focus group, when she had approached three workers in a supermarket in a neighbouring London borough to ask for charcoal for a barbecue. In this story, Soraya emphasized the multicultural nature of the neighbourhood and how one of the workers that she had approached was ‘an Asian lady’:<disp-quote>
<p>And I asked a simple question ‘Where can I get some charcoal … for a barbecue?’ First she had a stunned look on her face, she probably thought ‘You do barbecue?’ (several of the women laugh) … The way they spoke to me, the way they looked at me, I felt like they were looking down on me. And for whatever their reasons, which I don’t know, the only way I can think of is the fact that I am Muslim (unknown woman: ‘Yeah’) and ‘You’re the terrorist’. You see they could be thinking anything. They could be having a really bad day and thinking ‘For god’s sake, go away woman’, you know ’cause I sometimes feel like that myself, and there’s no underlying feelings there. But because of this incident [the petrol station incident], because of what happened, you, for some reason, I immediately feel like ‘Right, they’re suspicious’, you know because I am Muslim (laughs).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Soraya’s account is nuanced; generous and humorous in the possibilities of the readings that it allows for. The hostility that Soraya feels could be because she is a visible Muslim, but it might be a more banal irritation, a random consequence of having one of those ‘bad days’ that we all have. Yet the account also suggests that the affective aftermath of the petrol station event is a continuity that is carried on into this different set of encounters, working to more readily interpellate Soraya as an <italic>as if</italic> terrorist, a source of suspicion and resentment.</p>
<p>What is interesting is Soraya’s response to these causal chains of association and the apparent closing down of the hospitable spaces around her. Rather than valorizing an imagined safety in the naturalizing of commonality as community in Tower Hamlets, Soraya used the supermarket story and her anger at increasing anti-Muslim hostility to again critique the ‘cushion factor’ of Tower Hamlets, arguing for the importance of <italic>struggling</italic> for religious identity in less culturally diverse settings in the future. In this regard, Soraya’s second narrative of a paranoid racial consciousness freely associated with experiences of racism in the past stretches the affective field of community in unexpected ways. It reprises through Islam an ethical value for antagonism, and the interruption of commensurabilities in multicultural living.</p>

<title>Mothering dilemmas: Mothering as inoculation</title>
<p>So far, I have examined narratives that demonstrate something of the varied temporal relationships between ordinary affects and matters of intimate citizenship for the mothers as they negotiate public hostility. Temporality in such accounts both references and displaces mechanical clock time, revealing the intermingling of simultaneous and differently experienced qualitative temporalities. Within such temporal categorizations, the present for example can include ‘the absence of those presences that are no longer so, but which one remembers (the past), and absence of those others that are yet to come and are anticipated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350506813484134">Mbembe, 2001</xref>: 16).</p>
<p>I now turn more specifically to how the changing social environment has impacted upon the women’s dilemmas as mothers and their vantage points on the future. It is in these narrative orientations to the future that the dialogic space of the focus group becomes more apparent, as the women share and respond to each other’s stories, state their own perspectives and opinions, and explicate prescriptive narratives for Muslim mothers and children. In the exchange below, the women discuss conundrums provoked by living in the relative ‘safety’ of multicultural Tower Hamlets and how they should prepare their children to face racism. In this extract, time as a tool of agency is explicitly biographical, relational and moral in the face of racism’s enduring temporality.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Nasreen:</speaker>
<p>Because we live in Tower Hamlets … there’s safety in numbers … people aren’t really gonna give you-</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Tahira:</speaker>
<p>There are people who are quite, you know, like to really, you know, make you feel really-</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ameera:</speaker>
<p>Uncomfortable.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Tahira:</speaker>
<p>Uncomfortable. I mean I experienced one a couple of weeks ago … I had my kids with me, um and my 11-year-old took notice of it and she said ‘Mum, why is that man talking to you like that?’ And I said ‘Some people are a bit crazy. That’s why they do it’ because I didn’t wanna go into the detail. I just like, I know he was being a bit racist, and you know, there was no-</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ameera:</speaker>
<p>… because you said that you didn’t wanna go into detail. But the only thing, if you protect them [children] too much, some day they will actually face it themselves.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Tahira:</speaker>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ameera:</speaker>
<p>Sometimes it’s good, like I always make my kids aware of racism and this and that’cause I always get. I don’t know why (laughs).</p>
</speech>
<p>The best way of describing Ameera’s narrative of ensuring that she makes her children aware of racism is as a mothering as inoculation discourse. By this I mean a schema of temporal causation in which controlled exposure to threatening realities such as racism in the present can help to build up a child’s resistance and resilience to anticipated racism in the future. The temporalities of mothering in a racist world have been an enduring topic in black feminist scholarship. The writing of Audre Lorde records numerous autobiographical memories of how her mother tried to protect her from an awareness of racist incidents in the street and on public transport (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350506813484134">Lorde, 1982</xref>). Lorde’s stories are offered from the perspective of the child and as part of the claiming of a retrospective racial consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350506813484134">Ahmed, 2010</xref>: 83).</p>
<p>In Tahira’s story, told from a mother’s viewpoint, the response elicited from Ameera concerns a future-oriented racial consciousness that articulates the responsibilities of a subaltern mother in educating and preparing her children to live in a racist world. This continuing vigilance towards future racism also characterized the women’s recurring deliberations about whether the cultural diversity of Tower Hamlets was advantageous for them and for the socialization of their children. Soraya’s rendition of a mothering as inoculation discourse was the most explicit in the connections forged between the everyday work of mothering and the reproduction of a citizenry through Islam: ‘Islam is, for a mother especially, you educate a nation’. Alongside this assertion, Soraya went on to situate a Muslim child’s exposure to social differences and to racism within the Islamic duty of jihad (struggle/striving):<disp-quote>
<p>It’s amazing, there’s so many Muslim people in Tower Hamlets. And at the moment it’s just getting better for Muslim people because everyone’s practising, so you’ve got all the support you need to like you know, do the right by your religion, do the right by yourself and for your children. Then again, I wanna leave that because … what Tahira said, you know, you cushion them too much, then they get used to that one thing, and when something new happens it’s a shock to the system. ’Cause I’d like them to be out there and struggle to actually practise their religion, and see others, and have that respect back, rather than being cushioned in Tower Hamlets.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In narratives about multiculturalism the temporality of identifications became less linear and calculable, opening out to competing demands. Tahira, for example, articulated a longstanding ambivalence in multicultural discourses between particularity and pluralism:<disp-quote>
<p>I’m more open about other religions than just my own, and it’s like I learnt my children to respect other religion too … At the end of the day everybody’s human being, so that comes first to me. My religion obviously comes first, but human being comes first to me and you know I want all the religion education, but at the same time I want my children to gain knowledge about other religion, to respect that religion.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>That both ‘my religion’ and ‘everybody’s’ humanity should ‘come first’ speaks of the ‘contradictory simultaneity’ of multiple orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350506813484134">Bastian, 2011</xref>) and an understanding of the temporal demands of multicultural living that also circulates in Soraya’s rendering of the jihad of identification. It is here that the commensurabilities of linear time in the mothers’ stories became more undecided. ‘Undecidability … names the condition of impossibility that underwrites decisive action’, the geographer Clive Barnett has explained of Jacques Derrida’s use of the term, ‘in the sense that what is impossible is founding action on a saturation of knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350506813484134">Barnett, 2004</xref>: 520). Living with the undecidable is about responding to and negotiating two distinct but related temporalities: the compelling urgency of acting in the now together with a openness to a future that can never be adequately known or planned for, but which must still be cared for and oriented to.</p>

<title>Precarious life</title>
<p>A central aim in drawing out matters of narrative agency in the mothers’ stories has been to consider the ways in which understandings of time are critical to matters of intimate citizenship. It is important to make clear that when these stories were being told, the alterity signified by the mothers was narrated as a novel, unsettled one; an effect of relatively recent movements in the ordinary affects of the street that appeared to take them by surprise in their violent intrusions into their daily lives. And while the mothers’ stories attest to the everyday currency of subject formation in response to the disruption of the ordinary by unforeseen events, they also convey something of the temporal journeying of the recognition and refusals of (mis)identification by others, and how the wispy continuities of dis/identification can be carried forward into new times and spaces.</p>
<p>It is important to acknowledge the particular constraints of opinionated narratives about hypothetical futures with regard to both ordinary affects and the undecided. Opinions are more susceptible to the influence of the prescriptions of canonical narratives – of how things ‘should’ be. They can exclude the inventive and open capacities of identification and affect; of how ‘no-one knows ahead of time what affects one is capable of’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350506813484134">Deleuze, 1988</xref>: 125). ‘The vagueness or the unfinished quality of the ordinary is not so much a deficiency as a resource’, writes Stewart, ‘like a fog of immanent forces still moving even though so much has already happened and there seems to be plenty that’s set in stone’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1350506813484134">2007</xref>: 127).</p>
<p>This tension between rationalized accounts and thinking and the openings of the embodied self, its non-volitional capacity to take its shape and rhythms from events and others in the world around it constitutes one vital quality of the intimate citizenship that I have been concerned with. But there is more. Throughout the process of writing, I have found myself returning to a passage that closes Judith Butler’s <italic>Precarious Life</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350506813484134">2004</xref>). In this passage, Butler contends that if the human sciences are to have a future as cultural criticism we have to find ways to ‘interrogate the emergence and vanishing of the human at the limits of what we can know, what we can hear, what we can see, what we can sense’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350506813484134">2004</xref>: 151). For Butler, a critical task for those working in the human sciences is how to,<disp-quote>
<p>… create a sense of the public in which oppositional voices are not feared, degraded or dismissed, but valued for the instigation to a sensate democracy they occasionally perform. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350506813484134">2004</xref>: 151)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The lure of this provocation lies in Butler’s insinuation of a reversal in a certain implicit spatiotemporal logic in citizenship scholarship wherein an intimate sphere is increasingly encroached on by the state. For me, this aspect of Butler’s work suggests the need for radical critique to hold open the possibilities for a democracy that is vulnerable to the incursions of marginal intimacies. This suggestion moves beyond identity politics and the importance of democratic tolerance or celebration of diverse bodies. It raises possibilities of how we might work towards expanding the receptivity and openness of the social body to the array of ambivalent and undecided times that some others struggle with, herald and bring with them.</p>

<p>The focus group took place nearly a year after attempted bomb attacks in London (21 July 2005). In the month before the focus group, on 2 June 2006, the metropolitan police had raided a Muslim home in the neighbouring East London Borough of Newham, where it was suspected that a chemical bomb had been manufactured. Mohammed Abdul Kahar was shot during the raid. No explosive devices were found in the house. All the men arrested were released without charge.</p>
