<abstract>
<p>In this study, we show that myometrial transcriptional complexes consisting of Sp1, Sp3, histone deacetylase (HDAC)1/2, RbAp48, and mSin3A are recruited to 4 out of the 6 Sp1-4 sites within the Gαs promoter. Moreover disruption in the binding of these complexes via mithramycin administration results in a substantial decrease in expression of Gαs proteins in myometrial cell cultures. In many instances, these transcriptional regulatory complexes repress expression of genes having a high CG content within their promoter region. This repression can be attenuated by inhibition of HDAC activity by the class I/II HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) resulting in increased gene transcription. However, although a substantial increase in Gαs protein levels was observed upon administration of TSA to primary cultures of human myometrial cells, this was not preceded by an increase in messenger RNA (mRNA) and thus an elevation in gene transcription. Importantly the increase in Gαs protein levels occurred via ubiquitination and inhibition of proteasomal activity, indicating that this pathway is also involved in regulating Gαs protein expression during pregnancy and parturition.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>G-proteins play an integral part in transmitting the effects of external signals to the cell via G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). G-proteins form heterotrimers which consist of αβγ subunits that dissociate into a single Gα subunit and a Gβγ dimer upon agonist binding to receptors and subsequent conformational changes in receptor structure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112450339">1</xref>
</sup> Both Gα and Gβγ subunits are then able to activate a variety of downstream intracellular second messenger pathways.</p>
<p>In the myometrium, G-proteins play an active role in the processes that control both quiescence and activation of myometrial smooth muscle cells during pregnancy and labour.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112450339">2</xref>
</sup> Binding of pro-quiescent hormones to their receptors, for example human chorionic gonadotrtopin (hCG), illicit a relaxant effect on the myometrium via a Gαs-dependent increase in adenylate cyclase (AC) activity followed by an increase in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and activation of protein kinase A (PKA).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112450339">3</xref>
</sup> In contrast, binding of oxytocin to its receptor leads to Gα<sub>q/11</sub> activation and an increase in phospholipase C (PLC) activity and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels leading to uterine contractions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112450339">4</xref>
</sup> Therefore, the balance between levels of Gα proteins which control relaxatory or contractile signalling pathways is believed to have a key impact on the regulation of myometrial activity during pregnancy and at the onset of labor.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112450339">2</xref>
</sup> In human myometrium, an increase in Gαs protein levels has been observed during the early stages of gestation and is maintained until the onset of labor, thereafter dropping to the levels observed in the nonpregnant (NP) myometrium.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112450339">3</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112450339">5</xref>
</sup> This increase is functionally coupled to an increase in intracellular cAMP formation and therefore is thought to play a major role in maintaining myometrial relaxation during pregnancy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112450339">5</xref>
</sup> Moreover, during pregnancy, specific spliced isoforms of Gαs containing additional serine residues are preferentially expressed in the myometrium,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112450339">6</xref>
</sup> which may be subject to phosphorylation by PKA and PKC and thus modify Gαs activity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112450339">7</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112450339">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Although fluctuations in Gαs protein levels during pregnancy and labor have been well characterized in the human myometrium, the mechanisms controlling gene expression of Gαs are not fully understood. The Gαs promoter region has a high content of CG nucleotides (85%), with putative binding sites for CREB, Erg1, WT-1, and the specificity proteins Sp1-4 family<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112450339">9</xref>
</sup> (www.generegulation.com/cgi-bin/pub/programs/alibaba). With respect to the latter, there are 4 canonical 5′-CCCGCCC-3′ and 2 noncanonical 5′-CCCTCCC-3′ Sp1-4 transcription factor binding sites present in the proximal region of the promoter.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112450339">9</xref>
</sup> The Sp1-4 proteins modulate gene expression by directly binding to the promoter via zinc fingers and serve as a binding platform for the formation of regulatory transcriptional complexes. Components of these complexes include HDACs 1 and 2, mSin3A, and RbAp46/48, and these regulators often act as repressors of gene expression.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112450339">10</xref>
</sup> In the myometrium, the human chorionic gonadotropin/luteinizing hormone receptor (hCG/LHR) and PKA regulatory subunit (RIIα) genes, which are components of the cAMP/PKA relaxatory pathway, appear to be regulated by Sp1-4 transcriptional complexes. Furthermore, inhibition of HDAC activity by trichostatin A (TSA) leads to de-repression of these genes, resulting in an increase in the expression levels of both messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112450339">11</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112450339">12</xref>
</sup> With respect to Gαs, phosphorylation of recombinant Sp1 protein by PKA appears to be required for binding to Sp1-4 elements in the promoter,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112450339">13</xref>
</sup> thus indicating that increased PKA activity may modulate Gαs gene expression by affecting the binding capacities of Sp1-4 transcriptional regulators. </p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to further investigate the role of Sp1-4 proteins and their transcriptional epigenetic coregulators in controlling the expression of the <italic>Gαs</italic> gene in the human myometrium. Using primary human myometrial cell cultures treated with the HDAC inhibitor TSA, we demonstrate that indeed transcriptional complexes consisting of Sp1-4 and HDACs 1/2 proteins bind to the proximal promoter region of the <italic>Gαs</italic> gene and that inhibition of HDAC activity by TSA resulted in an increase in Gαs protein expression. However, this increase was not preceded by an elevation in mRNA levels, suggesting that other molecular mechanisms were involved in regulating Gαs protein expression. In this context, we provide novel evidence to indicate that in human myometrial smooth muscle cells TSA inhibits proteosomal degradation of Gαs proteins, resulting in increased ubiquitinated isoforms and a subsequent rise in Gαs protein levels.</p>

<title>DNA Affinity Protein Binding Assays</title>
<p>Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts for DNA Affinity Protein Binding Assays (DAPAs) were prepared using a nuclear extraction kit (Chemicon, UK), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, myometrial cells were collected and centrifuged in ice-cold PBS. Cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold cytoplasmic lysis buffer and incubated for 15 minutes on ice and centrifuged (250<italic>g</italic>, 5 minutes, 4°C). The cell pellet was resuspended in cytoplasmic lysis buffer and drawn several times through a small gauge needle. After centrifugation (8000<italic>g</italic>, 20 minutes, 4°C), the resulting supernatant was kept as the cytosolic fraction. The remaining pellet was resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer and gently agitated at 4°C for 1 hour. The nuclear fraction was prepared by centrifugation (16 000g, 5 minutes) from which the supernatant was used. The DAPAs were performed as described in <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112450339">12</xref>
</sup>. Cytoplasmic or nuclear protein extracts, 80 µg, were incubated with 35 pmol of double-stranded (ds), 5′-biotin-labeled oligonucleotides (MWG, AG, Ebersberg, Germany) for each of the respective 6 SpI-III (CG) elements (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1933719112450339">Table 2</xref>) in 500 µL binding buffer (12 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.9, 4 mmol/L TRIS- HC, 60 mmol/L KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L DTT, 0.5% poly dI-dC) for 1 hour at 4°C to form protein/DNA complexes. These complexes were pulled down using 30 µL of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Active Motif, Rixensart, Belgium). Resins were then washed 5 times in binding buffer. Proteins were recovered from the complex by incubation in loading buffer containing SDS and β-mercaptoethanol, separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting using specific antibodies (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1933719112450339">Table 1</xref>).

Each experiment included a negative control, water replacing the cDNA template. The experiment was carried out with 4 independent tissue cultures isolated from 4 individual patient samples. Expression levels for each individual sample were calculated by the ΔΔC<sub>t</sub> method.<sup>

<title>The Effect of TSA and MG132 on Ubiquitination and Proteasomal Degradation of Gαs Proteins</title>
<p>The lack of correlation of increased Gαs protein levels with a rise in Gαs mRNA expression after TSA treatment implied that other processes could be involved in the observed increase in the expression of Gαs proteins. In human osteosarcoma cells, TSA treatment has been shown to result in the appearance of polyubiquitinated forms of Gαs and accumulation of Gαs proteins due to the inhibition of proteasomal-mediated degradation.<sup>

</sup> Consequently, regulation of the myometrial ubiquitin/proteasome pathway by TSA and its effect on Gαs protein levels was investigated.

Additionally, 6 hours of treatment of myometrial cells with either MG132 or TSA resulted in the accumulation of high-molecular-weight polyubiquitinated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1933719112450339">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting also that TSA inhibits proteasomal activity in these smooth muscle cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have shown that transcriptional complexes consisting of Sp1, Sp3, HDAC1/2, RbAp48, and mSin3A appear to be recruited to 4 of the 6 Sp1-4 <italic>cis</italic> elements within the Gαs promoter. Moreover, disruption of binding of these complexes via mithramycin administration resulted in a substantial decrease in the expression of Gαs proteins in myometrial cell cultures. These events are similar to that observed for the hCG/LH receptor and <italic>RIIα</italic> genes in the human myometrium.<sup>

</sup> Here, Sp1, Sp3, HDAC1/2, and mSin3A complexes not only play an important role in regulating basal expression of these genes, but inhibition of HDAC activity by TSA leads to a substantial increase in both mRNA and protein expression.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112450339">11</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112450339">12</xref>
</sup> This latter effect is in contrast to that observed here for Gαs expression where only an increase in protein expression is seen which is not preceded by elevated mRNA levels (nor activation of a Gαs promoter as measured by an in vitro luciferase assay). Consequently attenuation of HDAC activity by TSA at Sp1-4 binding domains within the <italic>Gαs</italic> gene promoter does not lead to an increase in transcription of the gene.</p>
<p>However, the data presented in this study indicates that the increase in Gαs protein levels observed after TSA treatment arises due to the inhibition of proteasomal activity. Importantly we show that myometrial Gαs protein isoforms are not only ubiquitinated as consequence of TSA treatment but also by the specific proteasomal inhibitor MG132. It is now well evidenced that the ubiquitination of proteins is an essential step that is required for labeling proteins for proteasomal degradation and that the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins is an indicator of proteasome inhibition.<sup>

</sup> With respect to Gαs, pharmacological inhibition of proteasome activity with MG132 in human osteosarcoma cells and Gαs transfected COS-7 results in increased Gαs protein levels and AC activity as well as in the prevention of β-adrenergic receptor-mediated downregulation of Gαs proteins.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112450339">17</xref>
</sup> However, the possibility exists that, since ubiquitination can change protein activity, the observed increase in AC activity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112450339">17</xref>
</sup> might be due to a change in Gαs activity as a result of ubiquitination. In this context increased myometrial Gαs expression is also associated with increased AC activity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112450339">5</xref>
</sup> In contrast to ubiquitination affecting Gαs protein stability and thus its level of expression Kou et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719112450339">25</xref>
</sup> have recently shown that simvastatin treatment of vascular endothelial cells significantly decreases Gαs abundance by specifically inhibiting Gαs translation mediated by Akt/mTOR/eIF4/4EBP.</p>
<p>It is thought that the activity of the proteasome can be inhibited by TSA treatment in at least 2 ways. First, TSA may negatively regulate the expression of the catalytic β-subunits of the proteasome at both mRNA and protein levels<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719112450339">19</xref>
</sup> or second by increased acetylation that may affect stability and maturation of proteasomal subunits.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719112450339">26</xref>
</sup> Additionally, acetylation may directly impair the performance of enzymes of the ubiquitination pathway.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719112450339">26</xref>
</sup> In this present study, the levels of the β1-proteasomal subunit remained unchanged after TSA treatment. Consequently further experiments are required to elucidate the exact mechanism by which TSA causes inhibition of proteasomal activity in myometrial smooth muscle cells.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our data indicates that Gαs proteins are a proteasomal substrate in the human myometrium and thus liable to be degraded via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. Consequently proteasomal activity would also appear to be involved in regulating myometrial Gαs protein expression during pregnancy and parturition.</p>
