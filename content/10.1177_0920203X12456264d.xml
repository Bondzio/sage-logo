<p>Since the 1970s, the history of modern China has been understood as a series of revolutions: the 1911 Revolution, the May Fourth New Culture Movement (1915–1923), the Nanjing Decade (1927–1937), the 1949 Communist Revolution, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (1966–1976). These historical events, although distinct in their own right, are linked together to present a teleology of revolution. The moral of the story is that China’s modernization can only be achieved by drastically transforming its political, socioeconomic, and cultural systems. Challenging this revolutionary historiography, Kent Deng offers an inspiring revisionist account of modern Chinese history. Instead of rebellions and revolutions, he stresses state building as the prime mover of history, beginning from the late-Qing reforms and continuing on to today’s Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</p>
<p>From the perspective of state building, the author Deng gives a different periodization to modern Chinese history. Rather than the usual late Qing, Republican, and Communist periods, he divides modern Chinese history according to economic performance: 1800–1936, 1937–1977, and 1978–2000. This periodization shows that modern China has experienced a mega cycle of relative prosperity (until 1936), poverty (1937–1977), and prosperity again (post-1978). Embedded in this mega cycle is a condemnation of Mao Zedong’s reckless policies that caused tremendous destruction, poverty, and waste. According to Kent Deng, just the Cultural Revolution alone cost RMB 800 billion, ‘equivalent to China’s 10 years’ total GDP at the 1953 level or the total capital stock of the state-owned enterprises in 1979’ (p. 94).</p>
<p>By contrast, Deng sees in the Kuomintang – the arch-rival of Mao’s CCP – a more effective and responsible government when it ruled China briefly during the Nanjing Decade. More importantly, the author views Deng Xiaoping’s reforms (1979–1997) as the most important event since 1800. In contrast to Mao’s recklessness, he finds Deng Xiaoping a Western-educated reformer who truly understood the Western market economy. He describes Deng Xiaoping’s reforms as ‘spectacularly successful’ because they transformed China from ‘a mismanaged, closed, rural and poverty-stricken economy’ of Mao’s era to ‘a large, open and fast modernizing one’ of today (p. 157).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the author’s claim of offering a revisionist account, his interpretation of modern Chinese history is not entirely new. Much of Deng’s critique of the teleology of revolution has appeared in many historical writings since Li Zehou’s call to ‘bid farewell to revolution’ in 1992. Nor is his positive assessment of the Nanjing Decade astounding after numerous new studies of the Republican period. Even the wholesale condemnation of Mao Zedong is not fresh anymore in view of countless publications on the disasters of the Great Leap Forward and the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. More significantly, despite Deng’s claim to negate the teleology of revolution, his mode of thinking is still very much a product of the revolutionary historiography. In his historical account, while he successfully deconstructs the telos of Mao’s socialist revolution, he creates a new telos of Deng Xiaoping’s state capitalism that allegedly brings a happy ending to the 150 years of China’s modernization.</p>
<p>In terms of political theory, Kent Deng’s argument about state builders is problematic. He believes that state builders are always prime movers because a ‘worthy state and state-builders lead to good governance; good governance in turn determines good performance in the economy; this good economic performance can be measured by the material well-being of the masses’ (p. 11). But the problem is that although the effectiveness of state builders is measured by the material well-being of the masses, the masses do not have a voice in both policymaking and policy implementation. They are simply passive players whose only role is to wait for the benevolence of state builders, if it ever comes.</p>
<p>Perhaps realizing that he gives an impression of supporting authoritarianism, Kent Deng ends his book by briefly discussing the problems of a one-party state. To address the problem, he highlights the danger of ‘the power asymmetry in the hands of a tiny minority in society’ and the possibility of causing ‘unilateral changes irrelevant to China’s indigenous socio-economic characteristics’ (p. 158). Still, the solution he recommends is disappointingly shallow. Rather than offering new thoughts on making the Chinese political field more pluralistic, he lays hope in the self-rectification of the CCP that promises, as early as in 2007, to introduce ‘democracy, rule of law, liberty, human rights, equality, and fraternity’ (p. 162). It does not occur to Deng that without any mechanism to check the power of state builders, it is highly unlikely they will share power.</p>
