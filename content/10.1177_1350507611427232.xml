<abstract>
<p>This article uses a Foucauldian conceptualization of processes of subjectification to examine the everyday learning of a manager in and through their talk about work. A Foucauldian poststructuralist approach draws attention to the discursive mechanisms whereby people are turned into and turn themselves into subjects. This process is theorized by Foucault as the interplay of technologies of power with technologies of the self (Rose, 1996, 1999a). This perspective provides an account of subjectivity as integrally interrelated with power and knowledge, thereby challenging a prevailing view in much of the organizational learning and workplace learning literature of subjectivity as autonomous and essential. A Foucauldian perspective enables power to be introduced into accounts of everyday learning at work but in a way that avoids reproducing a top-down and monolithic view of power. Importantly, it provides the analytic space for re-presenting workplace learners as active in the ongoing negotiation of identity, rather than only acted on by top down forces.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is a growing body of literature in the fields of workplace learning and organizational learning that uses identity as a lens for conceptualizing the everyday learning that takes place in and through workplace practices (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350507611427232">Billett et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1350507611427232">Gherardi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1350507611427232">Wenger, 1998</xref>). This literature directs attention to knowledge production as situated and learning as a social rather than an individual activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350507611427232">Gherardi, 2009</xref>). This view is articulated in what has come to be known as a community of practice perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1350507611427232">Wenger, 1998</xref>). From this perspective workplace learning can be understood as the “who” workers learn to “be” at work. While a community of practice conceptualization of workplace learning has become a powerful discourse in both the organizational learning and workplace learning literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350507611427232">Contu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350507611427232">Gee et al., 1996</xref>), there are other ways of theorizing everyday learning in and through practice.</p>
<p>This article draws on a Foucauldian conceptualization of processes of subjectification for rethinking everyday learning at work. Everyday learning is understood here as the ongoing identity work that takes place in and through participating in workplace practices (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1350507611427232">Scheeres and Solomon, 2006</xref>). Much of this identity work is often unconscious and therefore goes unnamed and unnoticed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350507611427232">Eraut, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350507611427232">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1350507611427232">Suchman, 1995</xref>). It is argued in this article that a Foucauldian approach, which draws attention to the discursive mechanisms whereby workers take up particular identifications as well as the ongoing negotiation and renegotiation of identity/ies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350507611427232">Hall, 1996</xref>), enables the ongoing identity work that takes place in workplaces to come into view. Discourse is understood in this article as the combined language and social practices that contribute to the construction of knowledges, identities and experience.</p>
<p>In the first part of the article the Foucauldian concept of processes of subjectification is introduced. Next, the contribution of this approach is discussed in terms of what it enables when analysing learning at work. The embodiment of discourse is introduced as a key concept for thinking about and analysing everyday learning at work. A case study is then provided of the embodiment of discourse by a senior manager in a public sector organization in Australia. In the final section of the article the contribution of a discursive approach to the organizational learning literature is discussed.</p>

<title>Processes of subjectification</title>
<p>A sovereign view of power, where power is understood as being top-down and a thing that individuals or groups possess, has dominated the way power tends to be understood in modern times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350507611427232">Foucault, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1350507611427232">1998</xref>). In a sovereign view the interrelationships between power, knowledge and subjectivity are overlooked. This enables binary divisions such as power—knowledge, power—freedom, truth—ideology and subjectivity—objectivity to appear seemingly natural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350507611427232">Dean, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1350507611427232">Ransom, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1350507611427232">Rose, 1999a</xref>). Foucault, however, disrupts many of the taken for granted binaries of modernist thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350507611427232">Flax, 1990</xref>). For example, he conceptualizes power and knowledge as inextricably entwined rather than separable elements:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Knowledge and power are integrated with one another, and there is no point in dreaming of a time when knowledge will cease to depend on power; this is just a way of reviving humanism in a utopian guise. It is not possible for power to be exercised without knowledge, it is impossible for knowledge not to engender power. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350507611427232">Foucault, 1980</xref>: 52)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This unsettles a common understanding of knowledge where “the truth” is understood as being intrinsically opposed to power and therefore plays a liberating role, and that subjects are able to resist repression by speaking “the truth” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350507611427232">Dreyfus and Rabinow, 1982</xref>). Instead, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1350507611427232">Foucault (1998</xref>: 86) suggests that an understanding of power as separable from knowledge actually supports domination as it makes the exercise of disciplinary power less visible: <italic>‘power is tolerable only on a condition that it mask a substantial part of itself. Its success is proportional to its ability to hide its own mechanism’</italic>.</p>
<p>Foucault’s later work focuses on the ways people are turned into subjects and turn themselves into subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1350507611427232">1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350507611427232">1988</xref>). These processes of subjectification are theorized as the interplay of technologies of power with technologies of the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1350507611427232">Rose, 1999a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1350507611427232">b</xref>). For example, it is through expertise, including the knowledges produced by the social sciences, that the “ideal types” against which individuals self-regulate are constructed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1350507611427232">Patton, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350507611427232">Rose, 1996</xref>). Put simply, technologies of power can be understood as the ways people are turned into subjects and technologies of the self as the ways people turn themselves into subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350507611427232">Danaher et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>By drawing attention to interrelationships between power, knowledge and subjectivity, Foucault is able to propose an alternative perspective on power—it is multi-formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350507611427232">1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1350507611427232">1998</xref>). Power not only constrains (and is oppressive) but also enables (and is productive). Power operates through the construction of “new” capacities and ways of being rather than through constraining preexisting ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1350507611427232">Patton, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350507611427232">Rose, 1996</xref>). In reconceptualizing power as multi-formed, Foucault is able to disrupt a common sense understanding in the social sciences of subjectivity as autonomous and essential. Instead, he proposes that it is through the exercise of power that particular modes of subjectivity are produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1350507611427232">Foucault, 1982</xref>). A Foucauldian perspective directs attention to the historical and social contingency of subjectivity and the part played by practices, including the practices of the workplace, in the shaping of particular modes of subjectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350507611427232">Du Gay, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350507611427232">Rose, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>This is a very different view of power, knowledge and subjectivity from that provided in much of the organizational learning literature where: (1) power tends to be conceived as top-down and only taking the form of oppression; (2) knowledge is thought of as the means for overcoming oppression; and (3) subjectivity is understood as autonomous and separate from the social.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1350507611427232">1</xref></sup> A top-down (or sovereign) view of power is evident in an ongoing debate in the organizational learning literature around whether learning at work is <bold>either</bold> empowering <bold>or</bold> disempowering. For example, in much of the mainstream organizational learning literature learning is viewed (uncritically) as the means for ongoing development and enhancement of both individuals and organizations and is thus understood as necessarily empowering (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350507611427232">Cross, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1350507611427232">Leslie et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1350507611427232">Senge, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1350507611427232">Watkins and Marsick, 1993</xref>). This view is evident in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1350507611427232">Watkins and Marsick’s (1993</xref>: 192) claim that common elements of the Learning Organization are: <italic>systems thinking, decentralization, continuous learning</italic>, and <italic>empowerment</italic>; and that learning organizations incorporate: <italic>‘organization-wide cultural change programs that measurably change the skill and innovation base in the organization, that alter bureaucratic and hierarchical relationships, and that create collegial, problem solving teams aligned around a globally understood mission’</italic>.</p>
<p>In contrast, in much of the critical literature on organizational learning (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350507611427232">Casey, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350507611427232">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350507611427232">Coopey, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350507611427232">Coopey and Burgoyne, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1350507611427232">Snell and Chak, 1998</xref>), power tends to be understood as suppressing an “authentic”, “autonomous” subjectivity of the worker through a mechanism of false consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1350507611427232">Miller and Rose, 1995</xref>). This literature works to reproduce a sovereign view of power where workplace learners are re-presented as cultural puppets, acted on by top-down managerial forces. For example, in an analysis of power in the Learning Organization literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350507611427232">Coopey (1996</xref>: 365) concluded that:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Finally, it is likely that senior managers within enterprises where the principles of a learning organization are put into practice will be able to bolster and safeguard their prerogatives by articulating aspects of the ideology implicit in the literature of the Learning Organization</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, the organizational learning (OL) literature tends to reinforce a view of identity as unified and fixed. For example, the notion of “becoming” and the concept of movement from partial to full participation in the community of practice literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350507611427232">Lave and Wenger, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1350507611427232">Wenger, 1998</xref>) suggests an arrival point in terms of occupational identity. While there may be transition throughout the shift from peripheral to full participation, one eventually becomes a hairdresser, a teacher or an engineer, with the implication that learning stops at this point. This literature also works to produce a notion of “the novice” and “the expert” as seemingly natural categories, thereby reproducing the power relations implicit in these differing subject positions.</p>
<p>A Foucauldian focus on discourse, however, draws attention to the interrelationship between language, power, social institutions and subjectivity rather than understanding them as separable units of analysis. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1350507611427232">Weedon (1987)</xref> points to the mechanisms whereby the meanings and values embedded in discourses become interiorized and then reproduced through the actions of individuals. She describes this process in the following way:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>language, in the form of socially and historically specific discourses, cannot have any social and political effectivity except in and through the actions of the individuals who become its bearers by taking up the forms of subjectivity and the meanings and values it proposes and acting upon them. The individual is both the site for a range of possible forms of subjectivity and, at any particular moment of thought and speech, a subject, subjected to a regime of meaning of a particular discourse and enabled to act accordingly</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1350507611427232">Weedon, 1987</xref>: 34)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The above quote highlights the political <bold>effects</bold> of language. Rather than simply reflecting reality, language works to construct particular versions of social reality and particular ways of being as seemingly natural. The embodiment of discourse by individuals, outlined by Weedon above, is a key concept used in the analysis of everyday learning undertaken in this article.</p>
<p>In order to better understand poststructuralist accounts of processes associated with the discursive shaping of identity, it is useful to clarify the distinctions between subject positions, subjectivity and identity. Subject positions, made available through the circulation of discourses, provide identity categories and when people identify with and take up subject positions they take up an identity related to that subject position. Thus, subject positions structure subjectivity (our sense of ourselves). The embodiment of discourse is understood in this article as the take up of a particular subject position by an individual, in other words their identification as a worker, a learner, a manager and so on.</p>
<p>However, a poststructuralist account also draws attention to the contested nature of subjectivity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350507611427232">Rose (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1350507611427232">2000)</xref> refers to this as the subjectivity wars and argues that there are always other discourses in circulation that produce other subject positions and other ways of being. It is in this sense that identity is not fixed but rather in process, as identity is always forged in relation to other subject positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350507611427232">Hall, 1996</xref>). Thus, rather than presupposing a unique, fixed and coherent essence that makes individuals who they are, subjectivity can be understood as precarious and contradictory, <italic>‘constantly being reconstituted in discourse each time we think or speak’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1350507611427232">Weedon, 1987</xref>: 33). The notion of discursive contest opens up space for the analysis of resistance in terms of the failure to take up particular modes of subjectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1350507611427232">Ransom, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, a focus on discourse enables the complex connections between the social and the individual to be made visible by foregrounding the discursive mechanisms whereby the social is interiorized and then understood as coming from within. In other words a discursive approach provides an analytic lens for moving between the macro (social) and the micro (individual).</p>

<title>The implications for studying everyday learning at work</title>
<p>In providing an analytical tool for moving between the social and the individual, a discursive approach enables analyses of everyday learning at work that can move beyond the individual-social dichotomy that has prevailed in much of the organizational learning literature to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1350507611427232">Fenwick, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350507611427232">Gherardi, 2009</xref>). Theories of learning underpinning the organizational learning literature can be loosely grouped into two broad areas where learning is theorized as <bold>either</bold> an individual (cognitive) activity, for example where learning is understood as a process of rational reflection on experience; <bold>or</bold> as social, where everyday learning takes place in and through practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350507611427232">Fenwick, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1350507611427232">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1350507611427232">2008</xref>). The former view is articulated in an experiential learning discourse, which underpins seminal organizational learning texts such as <italic>Organizational Learning II</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507611427232">Argyris and Schön, 1996</xref>) and <italic>The Fifth Discipline</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1350507611427232">Senge, 1992</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507611427232">Argyris and Schön (1996</xref>: 16) claim that:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Organizational learning occurs when individuals within an organization experience a problematic situation and inquire into it on the organization’s behalf. They experience a surprising mismatch between expected and actual results of action and respond to that mismatch through a process of thought and further action that leads them to modify their images of organization or their understandings of organizational phenomena and to restructure their activities so as to bring outcomes and expectations into line, thereby changing organizational theory-in-use</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The latter view is articulated in a community of practice perspective (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1350507611427232">Wenger, 1998</xref>), which has been taken up in the organizational learning literature in more recent times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350507611427232">Corradi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1350507611427232">Gherardi, 2006</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1350507611427232">Wenger (1998</xref>: 45) says:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Being alive as human beings means that we are constantly engaged in the pursuit of enterprises of all kinds, from ensuring our physical survival to seeking the most lofty pleasures. As we define these enterprises and engage in their pursuit together, we interact with each other and with the world and we tune our relations with each other and with the world accordingly. In other words, we learn</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Over time, this collective learning results in practices that reflect both the pursuit of our enterprises and the attendant social relations. These practices are thus the property of a kind of community created over time by the sustained pursuit of a shared enterprise. It makes sense, therefore, to call these kinds of communities <bold>communities of practice</bold>. (Wenger’s emphasis)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This article draws on and contributes to broader learning literature where Foucauldian concepts have been used in an effort to move beyond the individual-social dichotomy of the social sciences to theorize learning (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350507611427232">Chappell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350507611427232">Edwards et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350507611427232">Fejes and Nicoll, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1350507611427232">Iedema and Scheeres, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1350507611427232">Usher and Solomon, 1999</xref>). These authors understand and conceptualize learning as identity work and propose that identity is discursively constructed. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350507611427232">Edwards and Usher (2000</xref>: 40, 41) propose that worker identities are constructed through language in the following way:
<disp-quote>
<p>Through narratives, selves and worlds are simultaneously and interactively made … For instance an employee may tell their own individual stories, but the narrative is itself sedimented in the narrative practices of the workplace and, beyond that, in the narratives of the wider culture and practices in which these are located. Individuals live these stories; through them they construct others and are interactively constructed by them, as active, meaningful, knowable subjects acting in meaningful and knowable ways.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A focus on discourse when examining learning at work enables an analysis of the discourses in circulation in workplaces, the subject positions these discourses make available to workers and the positioning and position taking by workers in their talk about work. Furthermore, as workplaces potentially provide a site for the circulation of multiple discourses and multiple positionings, this view opens up space for an analysis of discursive contest and resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1350507611427232">Ransom, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1350507611427232">Weedon, 1987</xref>).</p>

<title>Data set and analysis</title>
<p>Using the embodiment of discourse as an analytic theme, a close-up study is provided of the discourses that a senior manager in a large Australian public sector organization drew on when talking about work. Interview data obtained during an Australian Research Council funded project examining the significance of everyday learning in the workplace is used in the analysis. This research project involved a group of academics working in collaboration with a professional development unit from a post-secondary education institution in Australia, referred to as PSE in this article, to co-research everyday learning. The cross-institutional research team worked closely with four workgroups in the organization: a group of payroll clerks, a group of senior managers, a group of trade teachers and a group of business teachers, to study the everyday learning in each of these groups. The project was conducted in two stages. The first stage involved undertaking interviews with individual workgroup members from each of the participating workgroups with a focus on how they learnt at work. The second stage involved an intervention where a learning issue was identified by each workgroup and explored in a series of group interviews.</p>
<p>The focus in this article is on Beryl, a member of the senior managers’ workgroup. This group formed part of the senior executive at a metropolitan PSE college and were responsible for planning and programme offering at this college. A number of interviews and meetings were conducted with Beryl, sometimes individually and sometimes with other members of her workgroup, over a duration of approximately 18 months. During the interviews Beryl, and other workgroup members, spoke about their work and changes that had taken place in their workgroup. Transcripts of the interviews and meetings were produced for analysis by the researchers.</p>
<p>Rather than undertaking an interpretive analysis of the interview texts, where Beryl’s talk is understood as simply reflecting a preexisting organizational reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350507611427232">Du Gay, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1350507611427232">Garrick, 2000</xref>), the interview texts have been analysed with a focus on Beryl’s take up of particular subject positions when talking about work, as well as her resistance to her positioning as a workplace learner by the researchers. This enables an exploration of the embodiment of particular discourses by Beryl, <bold>as well as</bold> an analysis of the ongoing negotiation of identity in and through her talk. Hence the focus on interview scripts from one research participant rather than the entire work group. Furthermore, this reading of the interview texts draws attention to the context in which the interview data was collected. The aim of the research project was to produce knowledge about everyday learning at work, thus the research subjects were necessarily positioned by the researchers as “the workplace learner”.</p>
<p>An in-depth analysis of the discourses made available to managers in the managerial and organizational literature is precluded in this article due to space constraints. However, “classic” organizational texts, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1350507611427232">Morgan’s (1997)</xref> <italic>Images of Organization</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1350507611427232">Perrow’s (1972)</xref> <italic>Complex Organisations</italic> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350507611427232">Law’s (1994)</xref> <italic>Organizing Modernity</italic>, have guided the identification of managerial discourses referred to in the analysis below.</p>

<sec id="section5-1350507611427232">
<title>The embodiment of a discourse of rational management</title>
<p>One subject position that Beryl took up in the interviews was that of “the rational manager”. I will argue that this subject position was made available through the circulation of a rational management discourse in the senior managers’ workgroup. A rational management discourse is understood in this article as a way of thinking, speaking and acting that is associated with the notion of order and control to be achieved through the implementation of “rational” and “objective” managerial techniques. I propose that in taking up the subject position of “the rational manager”, and the meanings and values associated with that mode of subjectivity, that Beryl was able to know and understand herself in this way. In other words, this was one way that Beryl had learned to “be” at work.</p>
<p>The senior managers’ workgroup was responsible for overall direction of programmes at a metropolitan PSE college in Australia. Beryl’s work included collecting and analysing labour market data, gathering political and industry “intelligence” and working with faculty staff. Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, for someone engaged in the workplace practices of forecasting and planning, Beryl conveyed an impression of certainty and control. (At times) Beryl’s managerial world was one where objectivity reigned and this worldview was evident in the language she used to talk about work. For example, Beryl spoke about needing to achieve <italic>‘project definition’</italic>, developing <italic>‘business plans’</italic>, undertaking <italic>‘analysis’</italic> and defining <italic>‘measurables’</italic>, which in turn enabled ‘<italic>verification’</italic> of work.</p>
<p>It is in this sense that Beryl can be understood as active in the ongoing discursive construction of her<bold>self</bold> as an objective manager using scientific methods in order to perform her work. For example, when talking about the tools and techniques used for determining the programmes that the college offered she stressed the way these tools enabled the workgroup managers to achieve agreement:
<disp-quote>
<p>Some of the disagreement isn’t there any longer in relation to the shifting profiles<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1350507611427232">2</xref></sup> because it is dependant on us agreeing with ourselves and not taking a position of ownership over our own faculties because the profile only works if you’re quite <bold>hardheaded</bold> about the <bold>appropriate</bold> profile directions to move in <bold>based on research</bold>, rather than trying to protect territory. I think there were quite a lot of disputations over that and <bold>its sorted itself out</bold>. [author’s emphasis]</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Through an appeal to rational methods, scientific analysis and decision making <italic>based on research</italic>, Beryl was able to construct her<bold>self</bold> in the above quote as one immune from the infection of irrationality and emotion. For example, Beryl describes herself as <italic>‘hardheaded’</italic>, suggesting one who is able to make decisions that involve going beyond personal interest. It seemed this was an important way to “be” in the senior managers’ workgroup.</p>

<sec id="section6-1350507611427232">
<title>Resisting positions</title>
<p>Subject positions provide positions of alignment but also positions of resistance (in relation to other competing discourses). Thus, rather than locating power in a single source, for example in the contemporary privileging of a communities of practice discourse in workplaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350507611427232">Contu and Willmott, 2003</xref>), there were a plurality of forces in play with Beryl’s subjectivity never approaching a fixed constitution. For example, throughout the project the researchers attempted to introduce a discourse of workplace learning in the senior managers’ workgroup. This discourse is articulated in a communities of practice perspective where workplaces are understood as sites of knowledge production and <bold>all</bold> workers (including managers) are positioned as workplace learners. However, the introduction of this discourse created tension and there was ongoing struggle between the researchers and the senior managers in terms of being positioned as “the learner”. For example, at the outset of the project it was difficult to recruit the senior managers and they were slow in making themselves available to be interviewed. In addition, throughout the project the senior managers often questioned the relevance of the research findings and how this knowledge might possibly contribute to their workgroup, thereby calling into question the authority of the knowledge produced by the academics.</p>
<p>While the senior managers (at times) drew on a contemporary managerial discourse of organizational learning, where workplaces are understood as sites for the ongoing development of individuals and organizations, rather than understanding themselves as learners they drew on this discourse as a way of positioning themselves as superior to other groups in the college. It is in this sense that they can be said to have appropriated an organizational learning discourse and used it for their own purposes. For example, John said:
<disp-quote>
<p>From an organization culture perspective [the senior managers] would be more advanced down the line of organizational learning than other sections. I think there are different levels of development across the institute and this whole notion of organizational learning, organizational sustainability all of that sort of stuff, we’re fairly down the track. But that tends to be in this room mainly, or in our offices when we’re talking together. When we then go and present to the broader institute domain, we then become the teacher … The term I use quite a lot is ‘maintaining the ascendance’. I use ascendance as a metaphor because we just simply cannot afford, if we get knocked off, then the institute, the whole structure, there’s questions on the whole way of the organization structure and its development. So we can’t afford in a more public forum to be seen to be small ‘L’ players, capital ‘L’ players.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1350507611427232">3</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>John’s comments draw attention to the tensions for the senior managers in being positioned by the researchers as ‘the learner’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507611427232">Boud and Solomon, 2003</xref>). Being ‘the learner’ created tension in terms of maintaining their position at the top of the organizational hierarchy. For the senior managers, ‘the learner’ was understood as a novice, and this position had little appeal. This suggests a less than seamless union between a discourse of workplace learning (as understood and articulated by the researchers) and other managerial discourses in circulation in the workplace and draws attention to the concept of discursive contest. For example, when Beryl was asked if she thought of herself as a learner, she replied:
<disp-quote>
<p>Well I do but I wouldn’t present myself as a learner because that would suggest that you didn’t know what you were doing. You’ve always got to present with some kind of approach that’s got a professionalism about it. So there’s that tension between learner driver that doesn’t quite know what they’re doing and the old hand.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Beryl points to a tension around being both “the learner” and “the professional”. Thus, learning is not always understood as <bold>necessarily</bold> empowering within the context of the workplace, and not <bold>all</bold> workers understand themselves as workplace learners. This is a view often overlooked in the organizational learning literature where it tends to be taken for granted that workers will automatically take up the position of “the workplace learner” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1350507611427232">Harman, 2008</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section7-1350507611427232">
<title>“The intelligentsia”</title>
<p>Beryl was active in constructing the senior managers as “the knowers” in this workplace, and the lower levels of the organization as “the learners”, thus renegotiating being positioned by the researchers as “the workplace learner”. For example, Beryl understood and named herself as part of “the intelligentsia”:
<disp-quote>
<p>it’s quite an exciting group to work with because people are very talented. We call ourselves the intelligentsia of the organization, the brains trust of the organization.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The senior managers are understood and positioned by Beryl in the above text as the knowledge producers and knowledge keepers in the organization. Furthermore, in other sections of the interview Beryl described the senior managers as <italic>‘exciting’, ‘innovative’</italic>, and <italic>‘the agents of change’</italic>. Thus, in Beryl’s discursive construction of this workplace, the senior managers provide a distinct contrast to other sections of the organization:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think that [PSE] is just very slow in terms of accepting change really—down at the bottom level.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It seemed the problem parts of the organization (at least for Beryl) were at the lower levels and by implication this was the section of the organization where learning interventions might best be implemented.</p>
<p>At one meeting the senior managers took up an anthropological discourse to talk about their workplace and spoke about the other sections of the institute as <italic>‘tribes’</italic> and <italic>‘clans’</italic>. When the interviewer asked where the senior managers fitted in this description, that is, what tribe they belonged to, Beryl replied:
<disp-quote>
<p>We’ve left those behind—we’ve left our past</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This again points to the distancing work performed by Beryl in relation to other sections of the organization, and this was evident in both what she said and what she did not say at the interviews. Beryl spoke little about her past in the organization. She had commenced work in the organization as a teacher but, in contrast to many of the other research participants, there was no mention by Beryl of the disciplinary area in which she had taught or her life as a teacher. Furthermore, she spoke about the teachers in the faculty she liaised with as a distinct group, separate from and different to who she was. For example, when describing how the senior managers decided on the direction of the programme Beryl said:
<disp-quote>
<p>I do like to deal directly with people but what I found was that the stories, particularly from the teaching section were already so clouded and overlaid with stories that may not even be pertinent to what the issue is, I’d then come back and try to seek more objective advice if that’s possible.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One reading of Beryl’s construction of her<bold>self</bold> as different from “the teachers” is that teaching had little authority in the senior managers’ workgroup and that not all knowledge was able to count in this workplace. This is given voice in the above quote in Beryl’s description of the teachers’ accounts as <italic>‘clouded and overlaid with stories’</italic> compared with the <italic>‘more objective advice’</italic> available from the senior managers. Beryl constructed the teachers’ knowledge as subjective, irrational (and by implication irrelevant) in comparison with the <italic>objective advice</italic> from senior managers.</p>
<p>It could be said that the seemingly cohesive and unified identity of “the intelligentsia” was produced through a politics of exclusion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350507611427232">Hall (1996</xref>: 5) describes the way unification is achieved through discounting other positions in the following way:
<disp-quote>
<p>So the ‘unities’ which identities proclaim are, in fact, constructed within the play of power and exclusion, and are the result, not of a natural and inevitable or primordial totality but of the naturalized, overdetermined process of ‘closure’.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The above account provides an introduction only to an exploration of Beryl’s embodiment of this managerial discourse. A key point, however, is that the circulation of a discourse of rational management in the senior managers’ workgroup, with its associated values of impartial, rational management through objective techniques, worked to produce a seemingly natural and unified identity for Beryl as a “knower” and member of “the intelligentsia”. Furthermore, in understanding her<bold>self</bold> in this way, the existing hierarchical power relations in this workplace appeared normal and natural and thus not open to question. Using the language of objectivity, and scientific tools and techniques, Beryl was able to construct her<bold>self</bold> as transcendent from the contagion of power and organizational politics. And arguably in taking-up the position of “the rational manager” Beryl was in a much stronger position to govern as politics and power had essentially been erased.</p>

<sec id="section8-1350507611427232">
<title>Intersecting discourses</title>
<p>While Beryl identified as a member of “the intelligentsia”, a rational management discourse was not the only discourse in circulation in this workgroup. A Foucauldian reading of the interview transcripts suggests that Beryl’s identity was less fixed than the unified view taken for granted in much of the organizational learning literature. Beryl took up multiple subject positions when talking about work indicating the circulation of multiple discourses, including a political discourse. A political discourse is understood in this article as a way of thinking, speaking and acting that recognizes workplaces as sites of struggle and differential relations of power.</p>
<sec id="section9-1350507611427232">
<title>The embodiment of a political discourse</title>
<p>The circulation of a political discourse in the workplace provided another subject position for Beryl to take up, that of “the political strategist”. For example, in contrast to the language of rationality and objectivity described in the previous section, at other times Beryl used the language of power and politics to talk about work. For instance, Beryl considered that skills in lobbying were a way of demonstrating competence in her position and that a senior manager needed to be able to <italic>‘work via influence rather than direction’</italic>. Beryl even occasionally used political metaphors to describe the way the senior managers operated:
<disp-quote>
<p>There are lots of situations where we work it out before what we’re going to do and then go in with a line, and we all toe the party line, even though we don’t agree or mightn’t be sure, but we’re going to take a hard line about something in the face of opposition.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, there is talk about disagreement and uncertainty among the senior managers, providing a much messier representation of the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350507611427232">Law, 1994</xref>) than the rational, objective view that Beryl had previously constructed. At times Beryl’s talk about work incorporated the language of complexity and uncertainty rather than certainty and control:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s shifting ground all the time … In this unit in particular, we got on top of what we thought were some of our key goals, but there’s more coming in with the tide and it’s driven by external factors … It’s creating complexity in the job … and not quite knowing which way to go. Whether we jump in and become a leader with some of the new initiatives or sit back and watch what’s happening. And over all is that we’re supposed to be making sure that there aren’t any waves made between now and the election. Is that right John?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the above text, there appears to be little time for the reflective, rational practices that Beryl had previously gone to great lengths to construct. Instead we hear of <italic>‘complexity’, ‘shifting ground’</italic> and <italic>‘not quite knowing which way to go’</italic>. Beryl seemed to take up contradictory positions as earlier she had constructed herself as “the rational manager” and outside of organizational politics.</p>
<p>There were many instances where Beryl embodied and performed the subject position of “the political strategist”. For example:
<disp-quote>
<p>work isn’t routine and the work does have a political element. And I guess John plays quite a role in that and he’s quite a good tutor in terms of how we <bold>manage</bold> the political. The job that we do is usually more than just research and the presentation of the findings of the research. It really is how you <bold>manage</bold> that through the politics of the organization itself, or further out through the organization. [author’s emphasis]</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In strategically referring to John (her manager) as her tutor in the political domain (John was sitting next to Beryl at the time), it appeared Beryl had learnt to negotiate the political in her own workplace. Indeed, when John retired part-way through the research project, he appointed Beryl as the new director of the senior managers’ workgroup. However, while acknowledging a political element within this workplace, for Beryl, this was yet another element of organizational life to be known and managed.</p>

<sec id="section10-1350507611427232">
<title>A more complicated subject</title>
<p>The above analysis has drawn attention to Beryl’s embodiment of a discourse of rational management and the ongoing activation of this discourse through Beryl’s language and social practices. In other words, “the rational, objective manager” was one way that Beryl had learned to be at work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1350507611427232">Weedon (1987)</xref> points out that it is through the embodiment of a particular discourse, in other words through actively taking up a particular speaking position and the meanings and values that are attached to that position, that existing power relations are able to be reproduced. At the moment one takes up a position, other position taking possibilities are excluded. Thus, the assumption of a particular mode of subjectivity is at the expense of other competing forms and it is in this sense that discourse is an instrument of power.</p>
<p>However, rather than understanding Beryl’s identity as fixed and unified, the analysis draws attention to the circulation of multiple discourses in the senior managers’ workgroup and discursive contest. These other discourses made other subject positions available and when these subject positions were taken-up they provided other ways of “being” for Beryl. For example, Beryl at times took up the subject position of “the political strategist” and activated this discourse when talking about work. Furthermore, a discourse of organizational learning was also in circulation in the senior managers’ workgroup.</p>
<p>The analysis also points to the failure to take up particular subject positions and resistance to positioning. For example, when a discourse of workplace learning was introduced by the researchers from the ARC project into the workgroup the subject position of “the workplace learner” was (at times) resisted by Beryl. This suggests that the subject position of “the workplace learner” might not always be a position that appeals to <bold>all</bold> workers. Furthermore, it may be a position that sometimes has appeal, and sometimes not, to the same worker. While this requires further exploration in ongoing research, a focus on discourse and position taking enables this type of analytic work to be undertaken.</p>
<p>The analytic focus on embodiment and the discursive mechanisms whereby the social becomes interiorized and understood as coming from within has enabled the ongoing identity work undertaken by Beryl to come into view. Beryl had learnt to “be” different types of manager in this particular workplace, and not others, and this was intricately interrelated with the privileging of particular discourses in her workplace.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1350507611427232">
<title>Re-thinking everyday learning at work</title>
<p>In conclusion, a Foucauldian conceptualization of processes of subjectification enables an exploration of the ways discourses and their associated meanings and values become embodied, thereby providing space for new ways of thinking about and representing everyday learning at work. Importantly, this approach enables the concept of productive power to be introduced into accounts of everyday learning at work. Through foregrounding the discursive mechanisms whereby workers come to know and understand themselves and their relation to the world in particular ways (and not others), a taken-for-granted assumption in much of the learning literature of learning as <italic>always</italic> empowering is able to be disrupted. However, the representation of power in the above analysis does not reproduce a top-down, sovereign view of power where power is <italic>only</italic> understood as taking the form of oppression.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1350507611427232">4</xref></sup> Rather it draws attention to the complexities of power as Beryl was active in her own self regulation through taking up particular subject positions.</p>
<p>While this theme has been explored previously in the organizational literature, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350507611427232">Deetz (1998)</xref> has written about strategized subordination in work organizations where workers, in taking up a subordinate position for their own strategic purposes such as career progression or an increase in pay, are complicit in their own regulation, the analysis in this article extends Deetz analysis of power relations in workplaces in two ways. First, by pointing to the ways managers are also complicit in their own self-regulation and thus subject to power. Second, while Deetz has foregrounded the regulating aspects of discourse and the complex relationships with authority that workers enter into in order to understand themelves as autonomous, his analysis does not pay sufficient attention to the ways subject positions (produced by discourses) also provide positions of resistance (in relation to other discourses), and the spaces for manoeuvre within structure. After reading <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350507611427232">Deetz (1998)</xref> one is left with an almost monolithic sense of power possessed by management and it is difficult to imagine how managerial discourses might be resisted or contested. The view presented in this article, however, of the circulation of multiple and often competing discourses in workplaces enables discourse to be understood as an instrument of power but also as a point of resistance (to other discourses). While an analysis of resistance to managerial discourses was not a focus of this article, this is a potential theme to be examined in ongoing research through an exploration of the take up and failure to take up particular modes of subjectivity at work.</p>
<p>In summary, a different representation of identity has been provided in this article where identity is understood as always in process and never wholly determined. Subject positions provide positions of alignment but also positions of resistance (in relation to other competing discourses). Thus, rather than locating power in a single source, there were a plurality of forces in play with Beryl’s identity never approaching a fixed constitution. A Foucauldian analytic framework enables an analysis of the complexities of power associated with everyday learning through examining the ways discourses regulate but also the spaces that still remain open for other ways of being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1350507611427232">Foucault, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1350507611427232">Ransom, 1997</xref>). When identities are understood as discursively produced, rather than fixed and essential, then the “who” workers learn to be at work is potentially open to ongoing redefinition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1350507611427232">Weedon, 1987</xref>).</p>
