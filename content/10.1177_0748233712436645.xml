<abstract>
<p>The present study was conducted to detect placental and breast milk (BM) transfer of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) between biological compartments in healthy lactating mothers. The study explores the effect of parity, breast-feeding and urban/rural residence on body burden of OCP residues. The study included 38 healthy participants submitted to cesarean delivery. Sociodemographic data and specimens of maternal and umbilical sera, adipose tissue (Adp T) and BM were collected. Specimens were analyzed to detect OCP residues. The lindane in BM, o,p′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) in maternal serum (MS) and total dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and o,p′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene in umbilical serum were the only detected residues in significantly higher frequencies and/or means in the primigravidae than multigravidae. There was a high risk of detecting o,p′-DDD (odds ratio = 8.3) in umbilical serum of the mothers with o,p′-DDD detected in the MS. Total DDT was detected in about 65% of specimens of BM, MS and Adp T and in about 40% of the umbilical serum specimens. There was only a significant positive correlation between total DDT residues in the BM and Adp T. Total DDT residues in umbilical serum and Adp T were significantly higher in the urban than in the rural mothers. The detection of some OCPs in maternal biological compartments suggests their potential placental and BM transfer to her child during pregnancy and lactation, respectively. Furthermore, it might reflect the persistence or recent use of these pesticides in the environment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The general population can be exposed to low levels of pesticides in the environment (air, water, foods, articles, etc.). Such exposure comes about in three ways: vector control for public health and other nonagricultural purposes, environmental residues and food residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748233712436645">WRI, 1994</xref>). A number of long-persistent organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), which have been banned or severely restricted, are still marketed and used in many countries. The Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) initially identified 12 POPs for Annex A (elimination) or Annex B (restriction). Of these, nine are pesticides including aldrin, chlordane, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), mirex and toxaphene. These 12 POPs coined the name ‘Dirty Dozen’ by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). All of them are classified under Annex A with specific exemptions except DDT (Annex B). Use of DDT is restricted to disease vector control especially malaria or as an intermediate in the production of dicofol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748233712436645">Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the framework of the Africa Stockpiles Program, huge quantities of pesticidal POPs have been completely or partially destroyed in a number of African countries (e.g. Egypt, Namibia, Niger, Senegal, Seychelles, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia). Among issues of top priorities are to find alternative noncombustion technologies for disposing obsolete pesticides and to use alternative control measures for management of mosquitoes and other vector-borne diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748233712436645">Mansour, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Generally, POPs may enter human body mainly via dietary exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748233712436645">Safe, 1998</xref>). Repeated small exposures may result in the accumulation and eventual clinical toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748233712436645">Ellenhorn et al., 1997</xref>). The toxic and carcinogenic effects on human health have become a top concern worldwide. The chemical stability and resistance to metabolism of POPs are responsible for their persistence in humans and wildlife, while their high lipophilicity governs their accumulation and storage in the lipid fraction of tissues. Levels of adipose tissue (Adp T) have been used as an indicator of human exposure to OCP compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233712436645">Johnson-Restrepo et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Breast milk (BM) monitoring is currently one of the most reliable methods in estimating the body burden of POPs and evaluating the toxic potential of contaminants on infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233712436645">Hooper and McDonald, 2000</xref>). The mammary gland is an excellent natural dose device, concentrating lipophilic compounds. BM can be obtained more easily than blood through noninvasive maneuver. Maternal serum (MS) and umbilical cord serum (US) are also useful matrices to assess maternal body burdens, for example, concentrations of p,p′-DDT and its main metabolite p,p′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p′-DDE) in human serum have been employed as a biomarker for the assessment of exposure to OCPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748233712436645">Voorspoels et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748233712436645">Waliszewski et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In a previous manuscript by the authors, the results of body burden of 10 OCP residues in biological compartments (MS, US, Adp T and BM) of healthy mothers were published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748233712436645">Sharaf et al., 2008</xref>). The aim of the present study was to find the effect of parity, breast-feeding and urban/rural residence on body burden of OCP residues in healthy lactating mothers to detect placental and BM transfer of OCP residues.</p>

<title>Subjects and methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0748233712436645">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>The present study was designed as a cross-sectional study. The participants were healthy pregnant women hospitalized for childbirth and submitted to elective caesarian section. They were recruited from the Obstetrics Hospital of Cairo University (Kasr El-Eini) Hospitals. Informed consent was obtained from the hospitalized participants before delivery. The total number of the participants was 58 mothers of low social class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748233712436645">Goldthorpe, 2007</xref>). The mean age was 24.3 ± 4.5 years (range: 20–35). All participants were nonsmokers. Of them, 20 mothers were dropped out due to refusal to continue or failure to express the BM specimens. Therefore, the number of the participants became 38. Exclusion criteria comprised systemic and infectious diseases and occupations related to spraying or manufacturing of OCPs.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0748233712436645" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Sociodemographic data were collected using an interview questionnaire. The data encompassed age, residence, occupation, parity, number of previously breast-fed children, smoking, social class, etc.</p>
<p>The collected samples included about 5 ml of maternal blood, umbilical cord blood, tiny pepper-sized piece of Adp T and BM. The former three samples were obtained in the obstetric surgical ward, while BM samples were collected 10–15 days after childbirth at the time of removing the surgical sutures. All the samples were transferred to the laboratories in National Research Center. The samples of maternal and cord bloods were collected in glass centrifuge tubes. After centrifugation, MS and US were stored at −18°C. The pepper-sized Adp T specimens were frozen immediately and stored at −18°C. The BM specimens were collected after feeding the child, as the last portion of BM contains more fat. The participants were asked to express at least 5 ml of BM manually into solvent-washed, screw-capped wide-orifice glass bottles, frozen immediately and stored at −18°C.</p>
<sec id="section5-0748233712436645">
<title>Laboratory analysis</title>
<p>The AOAC method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748233712436645">AOAC, 1984</xref>) was employed to extract fat. The procedure of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748233712436645">Tanabe et al. (1984)</xref> was followed for the analyses of OCPs such as lindane, heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, dieldrin, endrin, o,p′-DDE, o,p′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (o,p′-DDD), p,p′-DDD, o,p′-DDT and p,p′-DDT. Residues of pesticides were extracted from different specimens (BM, MS, US and Adp T) by different solvents following the methods of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748233712436645">Manual of Analytical Methods (1971</xref>) and Tanabe et al. (1984). A Hewlet-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph with 63Ni electron capture detector was used. Limit of quantification was defined by Food and Drug Administration, as the lowest level of residue that can be quantified by a given method, which ranged from 0.003 to 0.017 μg/g. The techniques for analysis and the detected levels (frequencies, means, medians, range and maximum) of OCP residues in these biological specimens were depicted in the authors’ publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748233712436645">Sharaf et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Data entry and statistical analysis were done using SPSS 14. The total DDT in the studied samples is calculated as the sum of the levels of the detected DDT analogues (o,p′-DDD, o,p′-DDE, p,p′-DDT, p,p′-DDE and p,p′-DDD). Comparisons of means were done using <italic>t</italic> test for parametric data. Mann-Whitney test was used for nonparametric data. Correlation coefficients were calculated for the detected OCP residues in the four specimens.</p>

<sec id="section6-0748233712436645">
<title>Results</title>
<p>There were no significant differences between the mean age of the urban and rural mothers (23.8 ± 3.6 vs. 25.2 ± 5.9 years, respectively). The percentage of primigravidae was not significantly different between urban and rural mothers (30.4% vs.6.7%, respectively, <italic>p</italic> = 0.114)</p>
<p>The lindane in BM, o,p′-DDD in MS and o,p′-DDE in US were the only detected OCP residues showing significantly different frequencies and/or means between the primigravidae and the multigravidae, being higher in the primigravidae, especially for the former two OCP residues (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). All other pesticide residues in the four biological specimens did not show significant differences between primigravidae and multigravidae. The mean of total MS DDT showed significantly higher levels in the primigravidae than in the multigravidae (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0748233712436645">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>OCPs are still persistent in the environment according to many studies in Egypt. High levels of DDT and hexachlorohexane have been detected in soil, water, milk and fish samples in some Egyptian locations. Accurate information concerning the types and amounts of Egyptian household pesticide use, or numbers of poisoning or contamination incidents is unavailable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748233712436645">Mansour, 2008</xref>). Water samples from River Nile at the south of Cairo contain many OCPs, which amounted to 0.00005 ppm as total organochlorine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748233712436645">Abou-Arab et al., 1995</xref>). It was reported that the main OCP residues in vegetables and fruits were HCB, lindane, hepatochlor and its epoxide, DDT and its derivatives, aldrin and dieldrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748233712436645">Abou-Arab, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748233712436645">Abou-Arab et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>As a consequence of environmental exposure, OCPs accumulate in lipid-rich tissues such as maternal Adp T and in partition to maternal blood serum and umbilical cord blood serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748233712436645">Waliszewski et al., 2001</xref>). The determination of levels of lipophilic environmental pollutants in human tissues, such as adipose or blood serum, can reflect the magnitude of local environmental pollution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748233712436645">Waliszewski et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In lactating mothers, milk components and their precursors pass during synthesis through a membrane that separates the blood flowing in capillaries from the alveolar epithelial cell of the breast. However, during this process, certain environmental chemicals present in the blood can also pass through the membrane and become incorporated into BM at the concentrations comparable to the levels of chemicals in other fatty compartments in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748233712436645">Skaare et al., 1988</xref>). For many of these long-lived chemicals, lactation is the primary means of excretion. Lipid-soluble chemicals are transported from Adp T stores to the lipids in BM and then eliminated from the body during breast-feeding. This finding may explain the significant positive correlation between the level of total DDT in the BM and Adp T in our results.</p>
<p>Therefore, during a single lactation period or after several children and lactation periods, the concentration of a persistent chemical tends to decrease, assuming only background exposures to that chemical. This process of decreasing levels of chemicals during the breast-feeding period is known as ‘depuration’. The half-life of total polychlorinated biphenyls and DDT in human milk has been estimated to be approximately 6 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748233712436645">Massart et al., 2005</xref>). Our results agrees with the overt role of BM and placental transfer in the excretion of some OCPs as seen from higher levels and frequencies of lindane in BM and some DDT derivative residues in the primigravidae than the lactating multigravidae who practiced lactation for their previous children and show significant negative correlations between the parity and detected levels of lindane in BM and o,p′-DDE in US. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748233712436645">Soliman et al. (2003</xref>) found a correlation between the length of breast-feeding and levels of pesticide residues. In contrary, no significant relationship was found between the number of childbirths (primigravidae and multigravidae) and the levels of analyzed pesticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748233712436645">Cok et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748233712436645">Tadevosyan et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748233712436645">Soliman et al. (2003</xref>) noted that younger age and shorter duration of breast-feeding were significant predictors of higher levels of serum DDE levels. They suggested that lactating women reduce their body burden of OCPs through BM transfer, which would imply exposure to children. This finding can clarify the significant higher levels of o,p′-DDE in US in the primigravidae than in the multigravidae.</p>
<p>Our findings may also be supported by other studies from India, Croatia and the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748233712436645">Laden et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748233712436645">Nair et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748233712436645">Rogan et al., 1986</xref>), in which primigravidae showed 1.2 and 2.3 times more DDT and hexachlorocyclohexane residues, respectively, in BM than did multigravidae, suggesting bioconcentration and storage of pesticides in the breasts of primiparous mothers due to accumulated exposure over the woman’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0748233712436645">Yakushiji, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>The potential exposure from contaminated foods, such as milk, other dairy products and fish, the lack of mechanization in agriculture, improper pesticide application and deficient methods of protection against hazards associated with the use of chemicals in agriculture increase the chances of human exposure to pesticides in Egypt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748233712436645">Mansour, 2004</xref>). According to our results, the total DDT was detected in about two thirds of the studied participants in their BM, MS and Adp T (68.4%, 68.4%, and 65.8% respectively) and in more than one third of the studied participants in their US. The percentage of overweight and obese women was 33.2 and 46.6, respectively, in Egypt in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748233712436645">IASO, 2010</xref>). Because OCPs are stored in Adp Ts, heavier weight is expected to be a predictor of high serum OCP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748233712436645">Bagga et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there is no correlation between total DTT residue in MS and US, in our results, there were significant higher proportions of detected o,p′-DDD in the US samples with o,p′-DDD detected in MS. However, the o,p′-DDD was detected in US of 16.7% of the participants with negative o,p′-DDD in MS. The OR was markedly high, suggesting that the detection of o,p′-DDD in MS carries a high risk to be excreted through umbilical cord to reach their fetus. Moreover, the o,p′-DDT and o,p′-DDE appeared in the US of 37.5% participants with detected o,p′-DDD in their serum but not found in the serum of the participants with negative o,p′-DDD in MS. The studies carried by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233712436645">Samra and Selim (2009</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748233712436645">Whyatt et al. (2005</xref>) showed significant positive correlation coefficients between OCPs in MS (heptachlor, endrin, hephachlor epoxide, dieldrin and DDT) and OCPs in US. The results of these previous studies indicate that absorbed OCPs cross the placental barrier and reach a balanced state between mother and fetus. It is indicated that the concentration for mother and fetus depends on the lipid content in the compartments and liposolubility of the pesticide. Therefore, OCPs would normally pass through the placental barrier via passive diffusion. Metabolism in the fetus of accumulated residues is low due to the poor detoxification mechanisms of the developing fetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748233712436645">Herrero-Mercado et al., 2011</xref>). Our results can suggest this hypothesis of transfer. The o,p′-isomer of DDT and its metabolites are found in the present study at higher levels than p,p′-isomers. This may be because the commercial DDT product contains higher levels of o,p′-DDT than the p,p′-DDT. However, the p,p′-isomers have longer half-lives than o,p′-isomers.</p>
<p>Total DDT residues in US and Adp T and o,p′-DDT in Adp T were significantly higher in the urban than in the rural mothers in our results. This could possibly be due to some differences in dietary patterns between urban and rural people. The availability of greenhouse farm products is more common in urban areas. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748233712436645">Mansour et al. (2009</xref>) found that the greenhouse cucumber contained the highest value of total pesticide residues (1.016 mg/kg), followed by organic (0.442 mg/kg) and then conventional (0.415 mg/kg) cucumber. Residues of some OCPs, such as HCB and heptachlor, were found in potato tuber samples (conventional and organic) collected from Giza, exceeding their minimal risk levels (MRLs). In our results, only p,p′-DDD in MS was significantly higher in the rural than urban mothers. The increase in serum triglyceride concentration can cause the redistribution of OCPs stored in Adp T to the blood compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748233712436645">Herrero-Mercado et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The detection of some OCPs in Adp T and blood of the mothers reflects their potential placental and BM transfer to her child during pregnancy and lactation, respectively. Furthermore, it reflects the persistence or recent use of OCPs in the environment.</p>
