<p>For a number of years it has been a scholarly commonplace that the concept of “religion” is a product of early modern Western culture. Numerous theorists have worked to excavate the intellectual and cultural history of this term, its particularly Protestant provenance, and the effects of this notion as it has been exported from the West through circuits of conquest and colonialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2050303213476114">King, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2050303213476114">Masuzawa, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2050303213476114">Smith, 1998</xref>). “Religion” is a social construction, and one of a very peculiar kind. The cultural and religious overlay that has given shape to this concept has also deeply affected the scholarly study of religion, sometimes in profoundly distorting fashion, and this recognition has led some to question the legitimacy of religious studies as a separate academic enterprise and to advocate, instead, that the study of religion be repositioned within the broader frame of cultural studies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2050303213476114">Fitzgerald, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2050303213476114">McCutcheon, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Regardless of the optimal institutional setting for this inquiry, recognizing that the concept of religion is socially constructed surely in no way lessens the concept’s cultural reality. Acknowledging religion’s particular social and intellectual history only heightens the need to investigate the ways in which various cultural forces and agents have deployed this concept to produce potent material effects. Cultural theory of various kinds helps to illuminate these dynamics. Many forms of cultural theory (gender studies, post-colonial theory, critical race studies, political theory, and more) are reflected in other entries in this volume. Here I want to focus on the critical resources offered by a few additional types of cultural theory that can help to illuminate the concrete ways in which religion is given shape in the modern world. Then I will briefly consider the turn to religion by a number of important recent cultural theorists in furtherance of other constructive projects. Critical scholarship on religion has much to contribute to such endeavors.</p>
<p>The notion of religion emerged in European intellectual circles in a period of major social change. The modern nation state, new capitalist social structures, economic markets, and circuits of trade, and a range of new technological and scientific practices and institutions all took shape in the early modern period, and in the midst of this reordering of society, cultural and political theorists of various stripes turned their attention to the challenge posed by various forms of religious piety. The passions and allegiances that could be commanded by religious authorities appeared to threaten the emerging new social order, and by the Enlightenment, liberal social theorists invoked a number of different strategies in their efforts to contain religion within socially adaptive bounds. The modern notion of religion thus assumed prominence at the very time the phenomenon was to be contained—some thinkers denounced religion as a primitive and irrational anachronism that would inevitably fade in the face of social progress, rationalization, and secularization; others worked to delimit the appropriate social role of religion in ways that would conform to the interests of the new political and economic order. This containment of religion played a central role in the production of the secular realm, a public sphere under the newly “rational” control of capitalism and new forms of public (and scientific) reason.</p>
<p>Modern religion was delineated as an essentially private, interior, and voluntary phenomenon, one focused predominantly on transcendent concerns and offering little direct interference with the smooth operations of the nation state, new economic markets, and scientific rationality. Within those bounds, religion could serve socially adaptive functions as a source of private values and motivations that aligned with the demands of the modern social structure.</p>
<p>Cultural theorists of various types have raised a range of critical questions about these dynamics and their continued cultural legacy. Cultural studies positions religion within a broad network of social discourses and institutions and explores that network using an array of methodological tools (gender theory, literary and communications studies, economic theory, and various other types of critical social theory). Media studies, for example, explores both the ways in which religious actors have deployed new communications technologies and also the ways that religion and media have been mutually transformed in this encounter. Various forms of cultural theory provide invaluable resources for the critical study of religion, and that study, in turn, can expand and deepen those theoretical perspectives. To illustrate these dynamics, let me focus briefly on two disparate forms of cultural theory—legal theory and science studies—both of which speak directly to the critical study of religion.</p>
<p>Legal theory has long served as a prime site for exploring the modern constuction of religion and its boundaries. Religion is not simply a product of the scholar’s study—it is written into the founding texts of modern liberal political organization. Thus, for example, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution grants religion special status in American law, and courts have long been a particularly important site for demarcating what counts as “religion” and what religion’s particular social status might entail. There is a lengthy and complex tradition of case law seeking to determine whether particular phenonema might or might not count as religion, and even more case law has been devoted to the effort to clarify which aspects of religion receive protection under the First Amendment. Despite some important exceptions during the latter half of the 20th century, the dominant standard has been that religious belief receives expansive protection, while religious action or behavior can be restricted in many circumstances.</p>
<p>A number of important dynamics are visible here. First, of course, we see the courts actively engaged in demarcating certain forms of belief and practice as religion—this demarcation has important social effects, because phenomena designated as religion receive a distinctive social status and their practitioners receive a particular set of social protections on that basis. In <italic>The Impossibility of Religious Freedom</italic>, Winnifred Fallers Sullivan points out that by the early years of this century the terms “religion” or “religious” appeared more than 14,000 times in state and federal statues and regulations in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2050303213476114">Sullivan, 2005</xref>: 10; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2050303213476114">Sullivan et al., 2011</xref>). Religion is thus a substantial preoccupation of the American government both through the courts and through its regulatory branches.</p>
<p>At the same time, though, positioning belief as the centrally protected aspect of religion demonstrates the importance of a particular set of norms in defining the core of appropriately modern “religion”—the very notion of constitutionally protected religious freedom is deeply shaped by a Protestant perspective. The aspects of religion most readily recognized and protected by American courts are those parts that are internal, private, and voluntary—matters of individual belief. Religious behavior, on the other hand—those aspects of religion that are, in Sullivan’s words, “public, coercive, communal, oral, and enacted”—can be subject to legal regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2050303213476114">Sullivan, 2005</xref>: 8).</p>
<p>Sullivan takes us further, though, in her analysis of these dynamics. She underscores the peculiarly paradoxical nature of the rhetoric of religious freedom. An ideology of religious freedom has long been a central component of the modern liberal nation state. But the state cannot grant special protections for religion unless the state can first define religion, and the power to define religion keeps the government in authority over religion—the rhetoric of religious freedom is an illusory double-bind. At the same time, Sullivan argues, religion has become so amorphous, individualistic, and mobile in contemporary culture that it has become indistinguishable from other forms of value and deep commitment. Sullivan concludes that abandoning the illusion that the state can give special protection to religion would end discrimination against those who do not identify as religious and against those whose religions are disfavored or unacknowledged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2050303213476114">Sullivan, 2005</xref>: 8).</p>
<p>Sullivan’s approach to issues of religious freedom demonstrates the value of serious critical inquiry both in challenging the pieties and ideologies of modern liberalism and also in illuminating the dynamics through which religion is constructed and transformed in contemporary culture. Like other important critical scholars (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2050303213476114">Hamilton, 2005</xref>), Sullivan seeks to move religion from a privileged social and political status into parity with other forms of belief and practice. At the same time, though, her work also illustrates the inevitable inter-implication of the legal and the religious in various historical and cultural contexts. The modern liberal attempt to define a secular public sphere and to relegate religion elsewhere (into the psyche or some other private realm) has always been a pious fiction, and the critical study of religion makes that fiction manifest. The secular is always inextricably intertwined with the religious, and that relation is particularly complex because the religious is always in motion (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2050303213476114">Calhoun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2050303213476114">Jakobsen and Pellegrini, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2050303213476114">Warner et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This theme of the illusory nature of the secular leads toward consideration of other modern illusions, and many of those illusions have been vividly illuminated in the field of science studies. The modern, Bruno Latour explains, has been constituted by a distinctive mode of boundary drawing and attempts at purification—a separation first of nature and culture and then a broader series of cognate bifurcations—fact/value, body/mind, secular/religious, and on and on. But Latour’s central insight is that we have never been modern. This ideology of bifurcation and purification has served as a mystifying ruse masking the undifferentiated cultural realities always in play. In fact, the ideology of purification has actually provided cover for the rampant proliferation of hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2050303213476114">Latour, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Other important scholars of science studies have followed Latour’s path in challenging the binary logics through which modern notions of science and scientific rationality have been formulated, particularly as such rationality has been defined in opposition to other forms of knowledge. Scientific rationality has become a central component of the ideological self-understanding of modernity, but despite its importance, the basic notion of “science” has remained extremely amorphous, and it has commonly been given greater clarity through juxtaposition to other forms of knowledge, most notably religion (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2050303213476114">Dixon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2050303213476114">Lindberg, 1992</xref>: 1–2).</p>
<p>Many strands of the religion/science debate have been devoted to differentiating the two (either as separate or opposing domains). But a number of important scholars have worked to map various alignments between these different modes of thought and practice and to demonstrate the inextricably intertwined histories of modern religion and modern science—both arise in the same cultural juncture, each is defined in differentiation to the other, and each is concerned in multiple ways with the regulation of modern subjectivity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2050303213476114">Brooke, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2050303213476114">Richardson and Wildman, 1996</xref>). As Barbara Herrnstein Smith has stated it, the construction of a rigid opposition between religion and science “requires the representation of each as a monolith and the definition of each in artificially broad, artificially narrow, or otherwise strained ways”—a rhetorical gesture that masks “the extensive historical overlaps and continuities between the two” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2050303213476114">Smith, 2009</xref>: 131–132; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2050303213476114">Smith, 2005</xref>: 108–129). Smith seeks both to challenge the cognitive and epistemological privilege often claimed for science and to place various forms of knowledge—including both science and religion—in more wholistic or organic relation with one another. Like legal theory, science studies offers important insights into the complex material forces at work in the social construction of religion, and the critical study of religion can also illuminate the construction of other foundational social institutions and practices, including science.</p>
<p>Cultural theory offers invaluable resources for the critical study of religion, but the study of religion also holds enormous value for social and cultural theorists, as evidenced by the turn to religion in recent cultural theory. For much of the 20th century, many forms of critical cultural theory were rather averse to the study of religion, both because religion seemed an anachronistic survival and also because religion was framed as a private and other-worldly preoccupation that could have little relevance to more pressing material realities. But in recent decades, religion has become an important concern of a range of cultural theorists—Levinas, Derrida, Foucault, Vattimo, Agamben, Hardt and Negri, Kristeva, Badiou, Žižek, Eagleton, and many more. This new preoccupation with religion has produced substantial attention both in religious studies and in cultural theory more broadly.</p>
<p>One of the major themes of postmodernism was a rejection of the major Western master narratives, including the metanarrative of secularization. If the foundational narratives of Marxism, Freudianism, and positivistic scientism all falter, a conceptual space is reopened for exploring the operations and effects of religion and even for speaking theologically. As Gianni Vattimo has stated it, “disenchantment has also produced a radical disenchantment with the idea of disenchantment itself; or, in other words … demythification has finally turned against itself … recognizing that even the ideal of the elimination of myth is a myth” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2050303213476114">Vattimo, 1999</xref>: 28–29).</p>
<p>Recent cultural theorists have invoked and deployed religion in a wide variety of ways. Many important thinkers have turned to religion as a potential resource for gesturing toward the absolute or universal, toward alterity, and for reengaging the ethical. As Amy Hollywood has explained, in the closing decades of the 20th century critical thought and neo-liberal politics challenged earlier unifying narratives in ways that seemed to many theorists to offer only “the depoliticizing particularisms of liberal-democratic multiculturalism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2050303213476114">Hollywood, 2009</xref>: 869). Difference and particularity have been major themes of critical thought over the past half century, but too heavy an inflection on those themes can become politically immobilizing and fragmenting. Many came to fear that postmodernism and poststructuralism led only to political quietism and moral relativism.</p>
<p>In response, a range of critical theorists have turned to theological themes and thinkers in the search for tools to promote ethical and political reengagement (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2050303213476114">Agamben, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2050303213476114">Badiou, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2050303213476114">de Vries, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2050303213476114">Eagleton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2050303213476114">Kristeva, 2009</xref>). As Terry Eagleton explains, “reason alone can face down a barbarous irrationalism, but … to do so it must draw upon forces and sources of faith which run deeper than itself” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2050303213476114">Eagleton, 2009</xref>: 161). Religion, he asserts, “has proved far and away the most powerful, tenacious, universal symbolic form humanity has yet to come up with,” and theology—particularly in the mode of what Eagleton styles a “tragic humanism”—offers potent resources for critical reflection on modernity, “a process of self-dispossession and radical remaking” through which humanity might come into a better future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2050303213476114">Eagleton, 2009</xref>: 165, 168).</p>
<p>For many theorists, religion has been appealing because of its ability to mobilize rather mystifying aspects of affect and social energy. But religion has also had an appeal because of important theological traditions of reflection on the dynamic of immanence and transcendence, traditions that might offer productive responses to the impasse of difference and particularity. Although the modern notion of religion has stressed religion’s transcendence (in order to neutralize the potency of religion as a political force), religious actors and institutions have rarely complied, and many religious traditions have long explored the relation between the immanent and the transcendent, the particular and the universal. Recognizing the richness of theology as a theoretical and conceptual storehouse, a number of important cultural theorists have moved to rearticulate core religious ideas and to redefine religious symbols in the context of contemporary ethics and politics.</p>
<p>Gianni Vattimo, for example, has sought to reenergize a cultural sense of the sacred both to clarify the nature of late modern culture and to harness key religious principles as a force for progressive political engagement. In a series of texts seeking to locate the sacred immanently with the human world, Vattimo has engaged in an active re-interpretation of key Christian concepts in the search for an antifoundational, postmetaphysical religious ethic (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2050303213476114">Vattimo, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2050303213476114">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2050303213476114">Vattimo and Rorty, 2007</xref>). Vattimo sees this task as offering new human possibilities, not a static circling of the illusions of a transcendent Other, but a movement toward “alterity pure and simple, forever beckoning us toward a horizon of salvation, promising not the tranquility of a value finally attained, but an interminable negotiation of the self” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2050303213476114">Vattimo, 2004</xref>: 69–70).</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, Bruno Latour seeks to reframe the predominant modern understanding of religion (and science). Although religion has often been portrayed as the realm of the transcendent, Latour asserts, it has actually always been the business of religion to effect immediate change, to generate new affective and social states in the present moment. And while science has often been cast as pragmatic and tangible, science as actually practiced has been a business of indirection and mediation. Thus, Latour asserts:
<disp-quote>
<p>… it is science that reaches the invisible world of beyond, [it is science that] is spiritual, miraculous, soul-fulfilling, and uplifting; it is religion which should be qualified as being local, objective, visible, mundane, un-miraculous, repetitive, obstinate, and sturdy … Religion does not even attempt to race for knowledge of the beyond, but attempts to break all habits of thought that direct our attention to the far away—to the absent, to the over-world—in order to bring attention back to the incarnate … Science does not <italic>directly</italic> grasp anything accurately, but slowly gains its accuracy, its validity, its condition of truth by the long, risky, and painful detour through mediations: of experiments, not experience; laboratories, not common sense; theories, not visibility. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2050303213476114">Latour, 2010</xref>: 111)</p></disp-quote>Vattimo and Latour are eager to reframe religion and religious truth claims as deeply immanent, and like them Slavoj Žižek has sought to reformulate a version of Christian themes that is profoundly immanent and mobilizing for progressive politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2050303213476114">Žižek, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2050303213476114">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2050303213476114">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2050303213476114">Žižek and Milbank, 2009</xref>). Other thinkers seek similar objectives but attempt to maintain a place for the idiom of transcendence in their deployment of religion. Overly transcendent religion can be world-denying and apolitical, but a sense of transcendence can also serve to challenge the human status quo, to offer a vantagepoint from which to imagine a different human order. We can see vivid examples of this effort in the work of the French feminist theorist Luce Irigaray and the British philosopher Grace Jantzen. Both have worked to reenvision the nature of the divine not as a stable metaphysical entity but—in keeping with Vattimo’s metaphor—as an horizon pulling human imagination forward. In this context Jantzen invokes Irigaray's notion of a “sensible transcendental” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2050303213476114">Irigaray, 1993: 32–33</xref>). Janzten explains that this formulation aims to signal “a transcendence [that] is wholly immanent, not in opposition to the [world] but as the projected horizon for … (embodied) [human] becoming” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2050303213476114">Janzten, 1999</xref>: 271). Janzten seeks to reconfigure the notion of transcendence and to stress its immanent relation to the world of human becoming. This reconfiguration of a sensible transcendental offers Jantzen a mobile horizon for human possibility and flourishing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2050303213476114">Janzten, 1999</xref>: 271–272).</p>
<p>In related ways, numerous other critical cultural theorists have turned to religion, recognizing religion’s potency as a medium of cultural critique and seeking to redeploy the unifying and mobilizing aspects of religion to the cause of social transformation. But religion’s new prominence in cultural theory is not without its hazards, and scholars who have focused sustained critical attention on religion have much to contribute to these constructive endeavors—in maintaining a clear historical focus on the social construction of the phenomenon (particularly its Protestant Christian contours and bias), in confronting the sentimentalism and mystification that can sometimes appear in the recourse to religion, and in underscoring the constitutive role of the modern notion of religion in the very liberal modernity that critics seek to challenge. Critical scholarship on religion can deepen—and reframe—these conversations in extremely productive ways.</p>
