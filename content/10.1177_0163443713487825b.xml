<p>‘The big companies with so much power within their grasp should consider well how they use it and not abuse it or they will lose it’ (p. 45). These are the words of a labourer from Illinois, printed in the readers’ letters section of a radio magazine in the 1920s, warning of the financial power networks and chains were beginning to show in American radio. This is an example of the critical voice of the radio listener; a voice which, as Elena Razlogova argues, played a fundamental part in the development of American broadcasting, inspiring changes in technology, genres and institutions. By focusing on the early development of radio in America, Razlogova shows how listeners, by writing letters, sending telegrams, or writing to readers’ columns in fan magazines, defied corporate interests. They also took to bootlegging and piracy (pp. 11–55), collaborated with writers of serial drama (pp.75–98) and participated in local music shows, helping to reinvent local radio in the late 1940s and 1950s (pp.132–51). In <italic>The Listener’s Voice</italic> Razlogova thus allows us to rethink past audiences’ engagement in media (radio) production.</p>
<p>The book, however, is not only a feast exploring past audience engagement or participation in radio – a valuable achievement in itself – but also aims to use radio as a lens for exploring the moral economy that Americans have imagined. She does this by applying the concept of reciprocity. Reciprocity, she claims is a requirement in media innovation, and thus suggests that today’s discussions of a shared and free internet that embraces cooperation and collaboration, or our love/hate relationship with piracy and hackers, have much in common with the moral economy of early radio. In so doing, Razlogova offers an interesting perspective which really demonstrates the (obvious but often neglected in media studies) relevance of history to the present.</p>
<p><italic>The Listener’s Voice</italic> should be of interest to any radio or broadcast historian but the historical evidence also provides much thought with regard to the contemporary media landscape. Having said that, one weakness of the book is also that this connection between past and present is mainly discussed in the preface and epilogue, which means that at points the analysis feels a little thin. For example Razlogova writes that ‘studying this history helps us make moral and political judgments in the present’ (p. 159) and this is stated after discussing and commenting on contemporary phenomena such as WikiLeaks, TV piracy, copy shops, open-access, file sharing, free software, etc. The analysis here merely offers connections and parallels and perhaps an eight-page epilogue only allows for scratching the surface. This is a shame since the book provides food for thought on the development of our time’s giants, such as Google and Facebook, the commercialization of the internet, and audience interaction and participation.</p>
<p>Razlogova organizes the book into seven chapters (enclosed by a preface and epilogue), driving the narrative forward chronologically. <italic>The Listener’s Voice</italic> reads well and offers specific case studies on areas of early radio, providing a rich flavour that demonstrates the meticulous research undertaken. The chapters are well written and the use of historical evidence is quite ‘dense’, which means that, if one has to be picky, each chapter could have benefited from subheadings and a little signposting. In Chapter 1, Razlogova analyses boxing fans and prizefight radio, and provides a good illustration of early manufacturing and copyright issues. She argues that corporations were less enthused by public participation in engineering and programme design, which led to the development of two competing radio sounds; ‘one rational, individualist, clear, and corporate; another emotional, public, noisy, and populist’ (p. 23). In this, prizefight radio offered a populist, noisy and shared sound, in which listener expectation and collective input and entitlement was key. In Chapter 2 Razlogova identifies early anti-corporate reactions among listeners by analysing readers’ letters published between 1926 and 1929. She shows how listeners on reader pages debated radio legislation and, in particular, the growth of the networks, suggesting that listeners clearly made connections to radio’s political economy (as the opening quote in this review shows). The chapter also examines particularly poignant letters from immigrants to broadcasters, defending and supporting independent stations with their local flavour against the national and formatted sounds of corporate stations.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 examines the fan magazine in more detail, suggesting that it offered a space for listener debate and commentary. In the 1930s, once the industry became dominated by the networks and the production process became more complex, the fan magazines and their ‘listener columns’ would come to provide an increasingly important space for audience participation, ‘staging a primitive democracy of reader criticism’ (p. 68). This would shape commentary on network output and performance. Consequently Chapters 2 and 3 show the value and importance to any broadcast historian of the surrounding media context, such as fan magazines, as a rich source for the audience’s interaction and perception of not just individual programmes but the industry itself. In Chapter 4 and Chapter 7 the book touches on more familiar grounds: the relationship between listeners and serial dramas such as soap operas, and the ‘reinvention’ of music radio in the late 1940s and 1950s (the rise of local DJs). But the strength lies in the detailed examination of these developments, for example how disc jockeys offered listeners a sense of ownership and control by allowing them to provide programme content, with the result that listeners began to favour local independent stations.</p>
<p>In Chapter 5 the focus is the introduction – and impact – of systematic and scientific approaches to ‘measure’ radio and culture (such as the Princeton Radio Research Project).What Razlogova suggests is that once social scientists, ratings and audience research (surveys and polls) began to enter the system (in network radio in particular) this became the main method(s) to measure culture, leading to less listener interactivity and cooperation. As ratings went up less attention was paid to listener responses. This, she argues, steered listeners away from formulaic and standardized networks, to local, independent stations which offered reciprocity.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 focuses on <italic>Gang Busters</italic> – a true-crime show depicting real-life crimes. The show was based on ordinary people’s stories but often interpreted in more simplistic terms, leaving out broader issues such as poverty and racism. Razlogova provides an interesting analysis of reactions to the programme, in particular by immediate family members of the victims or the criminals portrayed in the show, demonstrating how connections were made between media representation and social injustice.</p>
<p><italic>The Listener’s Voice</italic> is a valuable contribution to the field and to scholarship on early American radio. Razlogova’s in-depth focus on the listener makes for an enjoyable read, with plentiful detail on radio’s early audience. By bringing together interesting case studies and fresh perspectives, the book allows us to rethink the past audience’s engagement and contribution to media production, innovation and development. In doing so, the lasting impact of the book is a useful reminder of how early radio’s moral economies are perhaps not so different from contemporary expectations of media reciprocity.</p>
