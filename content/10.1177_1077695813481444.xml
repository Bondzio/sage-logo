<title>Counterpoint</title>
<p>Journalism education is so seldom treated seriously in any significant detail outside of scholarly books and journals that <italic>Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Educator</italic> is pretty much compelled to pay attention when someone such as Stephen B. Shepard, founding dean of the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism, does so. In <italic>Deadlines and Disruption</italic>, Shepard devotes sixty-eight pages to journalism education generally and the founding of the CUNY program specifically.</p>
<p>Shepard should be a particularly insightful thinker and writer on journalism education. He was senior editor at <italic>Newsweek</italic>, editor-in-chief of <italic>BusinessWeek</italic> from 1984 to 2005, founding codirector of the Knight-Bagehot Fellowships in Economics and Business Journalism at Columbia University, and, from 1992 to 1994, president of the American Society of Magazine Editors.</p>
<p>Shepard devotes the first 185 pages of his book to his own career and, to a much lesser extent, his life. By any standard, he had a very successful and satisfying career and, at least to him, an engaging one. We should all be so lucky. However, Shepard never quite can hold the reader in describing any of his friends, coworkers, relatives, or even stories he worked on. It’s all so bland, sometimes general, and occasionally predictable that the typical reader probably will fail to remember anything in the first 185 pages other than this: half his Jewish family changed their names from Shapiro to Shepard, Stephen has two engineering degrees, and his second wife is a former coworker related to Maury Povich. Shepard is neither famous nor interesting, and one wonders if, while writing it, he had a Max Schumacher moment (“I’m tired of pretending to write this book about my maverick days in the great early years of television. Every goddamned executive fired from a network in the last years has written this dumb book about the great early years of television. And nobody wants a dumb, damn book about the early days of television.”) about magazines.</p>
<p>CUNY chancellor Matt Goldstein told Shepard early on, “I don’t want just another journalism school,” but as one reads through the sixty-eight-page J-school narrative, one is never convinced that CUNY ended up with anything very special by the time it opened in August 2006. Other J-schools also were heavily into “new media” and convergence by then, and other J-schools had long required, or essentially required, journalism students to complete internships. Other J-schools also already had specializations available, if not required, in areas such as urban journalism, business journalism, health/medical journalism, religion journalism, and others. CUNY may have been early, even first, with “entrepreneurial journalism,” but when one takes out skills of a successful freelancer (a topic that is addressed in some way in many programs, even if it flies under the radar) and media management (taught in J-schools for decades), one is left primarily with possible business models for journalism start-ups (both inside and outside existing media companies). More on that below.</p>
<p>Shepard repeatedly promises us that the new school would be rigorous, and he brags a lot about his faculty. Student applicants had to sit for the Graduate Record Examination, “two writing tests, a grammar test, and a news I.D. test.” But Shepard never tells us the minimum GRE score required, nor even what the writing and grammar tests consist of. The “news I.D. test,” for prospective graduate students, mind you, sounds like a joke; two sample questions are, “What is Darfur? Who is John Roberts?”</p>
<p>The last forty-seven pages of main text are devoted to “The Quest for New Business Models.” Shepard doesn’t say much, if anything, that those following nonprofit journalism organizations, hyperlocal journalism, citizen journalism, and so on won’t already know. But I like how Shepard summarized hyperlocal’s economics: “I soon realized that these same few examples [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Baristanet.com">Baristanet.com</ext-link>, Batavian, West Seattle Blog] are cited over and over in reports on the subject, partly because there are so few other successful examples. Like outstanding schools built by charismatic principals in low-income neighborhoods, these websites are admirable but hard to replicate and sustain. And even these worthy outposts, with input from neighbors, are like community bulletin boards, with little emphasis on civic issues. Watchdog journalism? I’m sad to say there isn’t much.”</p>
<p>But I’m sad to say that Shepard also writes that raw video, posted on Facebook, of Mohamed Bouazizi’s self-immolation is “journalism,” even if I <italic>might</italic> grant that hundreds of real-time, edited (“curated”) tweets about “Arab Spring” protests cumulatively qualify.</p>
