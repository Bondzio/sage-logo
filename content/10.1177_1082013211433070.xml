<abstract>
<p>Sensory characteristics play a key role in determining consumers’ acceptance of functional foods. In this context, the aim of the present work was to apply a combination of sensory and consumer methodologies to the development of chocolate milk desserts enriched with resistant starch. Chocolate milk desserts containing modified waxy maize starch were formulated with six different concentrations of two types of resistant starch (which are part of insoluble dietary fiber). The desserts were evaluated by trained assessors using Quantitative Descriptive Analysis. Moreover, consumers scored their overall liking and willingness to purchase and answered an open-ended question. Resistant starch caused significant changes in the sensory characteristics of the desserts and a significant decrease in consumers’ overall liking and willingness to purchase. Consumer data was analyzed applying survival analysis on overall liking scores, considering the risk on consumers liking and willing to purchase the functional products less than their regular counterparts. The proposed methodologies proved to be useful to develop functional foods taking into account consumers’ perception, which could increase their success in the market.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1082013211433070" sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>One key aspect to support the development of functional foods is to better understand consumers’ perception for this type of food product and to identify the determinants of consumers’ acceptance for functional foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1082013211433070">van Kleef et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Consumers can only be expected to consider consuming functional foods if they are perceived as healthier than their conventional counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1082013211433070">Urala and Lähteenmäki, 2003</xref>). However, consumers’ acceptance of functional foods does not depend only on their interest in health. In order to gain the health benefits derived from functional foods consumption, consumers need to include them as part of their usual diet for a relatively long period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013211433070">Sarubin, 2000</xref>), and consequently the sensory properties of functional foods should not discourage sustained consumption. The addition of many functional ingredients results in the appearance of off-flavors that decreases the sensory quality of the product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1082013211433070">Urala and Lähteenmäki, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been reported that functional food consumers are committed to the health benefits of these products and might be willing to have a food product with an unpleasant taste since they consider it as a marker of the health benefit of the product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1082013211433070">Baixauli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1082013211433070">Juttelstad, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013211433070">Reineccius, 2000</xref>). However, several authors have stressed that consumers are hardly willing to compromise on the taste of functional foods for eventual health benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013211433070">Ares et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013211433070">Cardello and Schutz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013211433070">Gilbert, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1082013211433070">Tuorila and Cardelo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1082013211433070">Verbeke, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013211433070">Hilliam (2003)</xref> indicated that one of the challenges faced by the functional food industry is developing functional foods with an acceptable taste to the average consumer. Therefore, during the development of functional foods, it is extremely important to rely on methodologies that enable the identification of consumers’ sensory and hedonic perception of the products.</p>
<p>Survival analysis has been developed to evaluate time until an event of interest, taking into account the presence of censored data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013211433070">Gómez, 2002</xref>). Censored data occurs whenever a time of interest cannot be exactly observed and it is only known to have occurred during a certain interval of time. Survival analysis methodology has been applied to shelf life estimation of food products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013211433070">Gámbaro et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1082013211433070">Giménez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013211433070">Hough et al., 2003</xref>). Time has been replaced by intensity of a sensory defect, in order to determine how high it can be, before a consumer rejects the product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1082013211433070">Giménez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1082013211433070">Hough et al., 2004</xref>). When changes in formulation cause complex changes in the sensory characteristics of a product, time could also be replaced by percentage of a certain ingredient and, in case of functional foods, by the percentage of functional ingredient added to the product. Therefore, survival analysis could be used to estimate the maximum concentration of a functional ingredient that could be added to a food product, based on the risk of consumers liking the product less than the regular product. Alternatively, the risk could be focused on consumers’ willingness to purchase. By applying this methodology, functional products could be developed based on the percentage of consumers that would be less willing to purchase a functional product than its conventional counterpart.</p>
<p>In the present work, survival analysis is used during the development of chocolate milk desserts enriched with resistant starch. Resistant starch (RS) has recently gained attention as a functional food ingredient due to its potential health benefits and functional properties in foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013211433070">Sajilata et al., 2006</xref>). RS is part of insoluble dietary fiber and could be defined as the sum of starch and starch degradation products not absorbed in the small intestine of healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013211433070">Asp and Björck, 1992</xref>). Some ingredients (source of RS) are now available and marketed by a number of companies, which offer a number of advantages over other sources of insoluble fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013211433070">Sajilata et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Milk desserts are dairy products widely consumed worldwide by several groups of consumers on almost daily basis. For this reason, milk puddings could be regarded as an interesting alternative for the development of fiber-enriched functional foods. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013211433070">Ares et al<italic>.</italic> (2009)</xref> evaluated the addition of RS to vanilla milk desserts and concluded that vanilla flavor was not able to mask the off-flavors caused by the addition of this functional ingredient.</p>
<p>The aim of the present work was to:

<sec id="sec2-1082013211433070" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
<sec id="sec3-1082013211433070"><title>Chocolate milk desserts</title>
<p>Chocolate milk desserts were prepared in tap water using 12% commercial powdered skimmed milk, 11% commercial sugar (ANCAP, Bella Unión, Uruguay), 10% sweetened powdered cacao (Nestlé, Uruguay), 2.4% modified cooked up tapioca starch (National Frigex, National Starch &amp; Chemical, Trombudo Central, Brazil), 0.1% sodium tripolyphosphate and different concentrations of RS. The rest of the formulation consisted of water up to 100%.</p>
<p>Two types of RS were considered: Hi-Maize 260 and Novelose 480 HA (National Starch &amp; Chemical, Trombudo Central, Brazil). For each type of RS, six milk desserts were formulated containing increasing concentrations of the functional ingredient: 0%, 3%, 6%, 9%, 12% and 15%. These concentrations corresponded to 0%, 8%, 16%, 24%, 32% and 41% of the daily recommended fiber intake for Hi-Maize 260 and 0%, 9.5%, 19%, 28.5%, 38% and 47.5% for Novelose 480. These values were calculated considering a recommended daily intake of fiber of 25 g and a portion of milk dessert of 100 g.</p>
<p>Desserts were prepared by mixing the solid ingredients with water and poured into a Thermomix TM 31 (Vorwerk Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V., México D.F., México). The dispersion was heated at 90 °C for 5 min under strong agitation (1100 rpm) with a 3 blade agitator impeller. The desserts were placed in glass containers, cooled to room temperature (25 °C) and then stored refrigerated (4–5 °C) for 24 h prior to their evaluation.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1082013211433070"><title>Trained assessors’ panel</title>
<p>The sensory panel consisted of eight trained assessors with previous experience in the evaluation of milk desserts. The assessors aged from 25 to 45 years, had a minimum of 200 h of experience in evaluating different food products and 30 h of experience in evaluating milk desserts.</p>
<p>In order to generate sensory descriptors, five samples of chocolate milk desserts with different composition, widely differing in their sensory characteristics were presented to assessors. These samples included a regular chocolate milk dessert and four samples formulated with different RS concentrations (6% and 13% of Hi-Maize and 9% and 15% of Novelose). First, the assessors were asked to generate their individual descriptors using a modified grid method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013211433070">Damasio and Costell, 1991</xref>). By open discussion with the panel leader, assessors agreed on the best descriptors to fully describe the samples, their definitions and how to evaluate them. The final list of descriptors used for the sensory profile of chocolate milk desserts and their definition is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013211433070">Table 1</xref>.

<p>Then, assessors were trained in the evaluation of the abovementioned attributes using the six desserts used in the descriptors generation stage. In the first session, assessors were asked to score the 12 descriptors of the samples using 10-cm unstructured scales. Through open discussion with the panel leader, assessors agreed on the scores for each of the samples. In successive sessions, the assessors received three of the five samples, coded with three-digit numbers. Assessors were asked to evaluate the attributes and to score them according to the consensus score. A variation in the scale of ± 1 cm was considered acceptable. A total of six 15 min sessions were used to train the panel.</p>
<p>Thirty grams of desserts were served in 60 mL odorless plastic containers at 10 °C, codified with three-digit random numbers. A balanced complete block design was carried out for duplicate evaluation of the samples. Unstructured 10-cm-long scales anchored with ‘low’ and ‘high’ were used to describe attribute intensity. The testing was carried out in a sensory laboratory that was designed in accordance with ISO 8589 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1082013211433070">ISO, 1988</xref>). Evaluations were performed under artificial daylight type illumination, temperature control (between 22 and 24 °C) and air circulation.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1082013211433070"><title>Consumer study</title>
<p>Fifty milk dessert consumers, ages ranging between 30 and 65, were recruited from the city of Montevideo (Uruguay) based on their interest in participating. Participants were 30% male and 70% female and were regular milk dessert consumers as they consumed this product at least once a week.</p>
<p>Consumers were told that they were going to try regular chocolate milk desserts and chocolate milk desserts enriched with fiber. Consumers were also explained about the benefits of fiber consumption, by explaining the connection between fiber consumption and the reduction of risk of colon cancer.</p>
<p>Evaluations were carried out in two sessions, one corresponding to each type of RS. All consumers participated in both sessions, which took place with one week of difference.</p>
<p>In each session, the six samples were presented to consumers following a balanced complete block design. Twenty grams of desserts were served in 60 mL odorless plastic containers at 10 °C, codified with three-digit random numbers and the term ‘regular chocolate milk dessert’ or ‘chocolate milk dessert enriched with fiber’. Moreover, for each of the milk desserts enriched with fiber, the percentage of recommended daily intake that corresponded to 100 g of dessert was included in the label. Thus, during the evaluation, consumers knew if they were trying a regular chocolate milk dessert or one enriched with fiber. This was done in order to take into account consumers’ perception of health-related issues when evaluating their liking and willingness to purchase.</p>
<p>For each sample, consumers had to indicate their overall liking using a 9-point hedonic scale. Consumers were also asked to rate their willingness to purchase two packages containing 110 g at 24 Uruguay pesos (10% higher than the regular price in Uruguayan market), using a 9-point structured scale labelled on the left with ‘I would definitively not buy it’ and on the right with ‘I would definitively buy it’.</p>
<p>Moreover, an open-ended question was used to gather information about consumers’ perception of the sensory characteristics of the milk desserts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013211433070">Ares et al<italic>.</italic>, 2010b</xref>). Consumers were also asked to provide up to four words to describe each of the desserts in terms of sensory characteristics.</p>
<p>Mineral water was available for rinsing the mouth between samples. The testing was carried out in a sensory laboratory under the same conditions as the trained assessors’ panel evaluations.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1082013211433070"><title>Data analysis</title>
<sec id="sec7-1082013211433070"><title>Analysis of variance</title>
<p>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) on sensory data was carried out considering type of RS, concentration and their interaction as fixed sources of variation and assessor and repetition as random sources of variation. Overall liking data was analyzed using ANOVA, considering type of RS, concentration and their interaction as fixed sources of variation and consumer as random source of variation. Mean ratings and honest significant differences were calculated using Tukey’s test which were considered significant when <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05.</p>
<p>ANOVA was performed using R language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013211433070">R Development Core Team, 2007</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1082013211433070"><title>Survival analysis</title>
<p>Survival analysis methodology was used to determine the maximum RS concentration that could be added to the chocolate milk desserts based on the risk of consumers’ liking or willing to purchase the functional product less than the regular chocolate milk dessert.</p>
<p>The advantage of using survival analysis to estimate the maximum RS concentration to be added to the desserts is that it takes into account the existence of censored data. Because of the discrete nature of RS concentrations tested by consumers, the exact concentration at which a consumer likes the functional less than the regular one can never be observed exactly, hence the censored nature of the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013211433070">Hough et al<italic>.</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In this methodology the survival function <italic>S</italic>(<italic>h</italic>) illustrate the percentage of consumers that like a product with <italic>h</italic>% of RS equal or more than the regular product. The likelihood function, which is used to estimate the survival function, is the joint probability of the given observations of the n consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1082013211433070">Klein and Moeschberger, 1997</xref>). A parametric model can be used to estimate the survival function and other quantities of interest.</p>
<p>The rejection function estimates the probability that a consumer likes a product with h% of RS less than the regular product. Choosing a Weibull distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013211433070">Hough et al<italic>.</italic>, 2003</xref>), the rejection function is given by:

 is the survival function of the smallest extreme value distribution and µ and σ are the model’s parameters.</p>
<p>The parameters of the model are obtained by maximizing the likelihood function, which is a mathematical expression that describes the joint probability of obtaining the data actually observed on the subjects in the study as a function of the unknown parameters of the model being considered. Once the likelihood function has been established for a given model, specialized software can be used to estimate the parameters (µ and σ) that maximize the likelihood function for the given experimental data.</p>
<p>In order to apply survival analysis to overall liking and willingness to purchase scores, a data transformation was performed. If the overall liking (or willingness to purchase) score of a consumer for a functional dessert was lower than the score of the regular dessert, then the rating was transformed to the word ‘no,’ indicating that the consumer liked the product less than the regular one (or was less willing to purchase it). In contrast, if a consumer’s score for a functional sample was equal or higher than the overall liking (or willingness to purchase) score of the regular sample, it was replaced by the word ‘yes,’ indicating that the consumer liked the product more than or equal to the regular dessert (or was equally or more willing to buy it). Survival analysis was performed on transformed data, calculating the probability of a consumer liking (or willing to purchase) the functional product less than the regular dessert, as a function of RS concentration.</p>
<p>Calculations were performed using procedures from S-PLUS 8.0 statistical software (Insightful Corp., Seattle, Washington, USA).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1082013211433070"><title>Open ended question</title>
<p>The elicited terms in the open-ended question were qualitatively analyzed. First, a search for recurrent terms was performed. Terms with similar meaning were grouped into different categories. This classification was performed independently by three of the researchers who authored the study, considering personal interpretation of the meaning of the words and word synonymy as determined by a Spanish dictionary. After individually evaluating the data, a meeting of the researchers was undertaken in order to check the agreement between their classifications. The final categories and their names were determined by consensus between the three researchers considering their three independent classifications and discussion between them. Frequency of mention of each category was determined by counting the number of consumers that used it. Categories mentioned by more than 10% of the consumers were considered.</p>
<p>A multiple factor analysis (MFA) was performed considering the number of mentions of each of the terms as active variables and overall liking scores as supplementary variable. This analysis was performed using FactoMineR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013211433070">Husson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1082013211433070">Lê et al., 2008</xref>) in R language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013211433070">R Development Core Team, 2007</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec>

<p>The addition of both types of RS caused a significant decrease in gloss, chocolate flavor and sweetness, whereas, lumpiness, manual and oral thickness, adhesiveness, roughness, floury taste and aftertaste significantly increased. Thus, the addition of RS caused a significant decrease in the intensity of the sensory attributes that are characteristic of a chocolate milk dessert, and a significant increase in the intensity of sensory characteristics that are not typical in this type of product, such as gumminess, roughness and floury taste. These changes could be explained considering the physicochemical characteristics of RS. Firstly, the increase in thickness caused by the addition of RS could be explained by an increase in the rigidity of starch gel due to decrease in the amount of water in the formulation due to its replacement by RS. This increase in rigidity also explains the increase in gumminess and decrease in creaminess since a structure that is harder to break up is usually perceived as less creamy and gummier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1082013211433070">Janssen et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, RS is a type of starch that is packed in granular form and is relatively dehydrated. These granules are perceived in mouth when the dessert is tasted and therefore are responsible for perceived roughness and visual lumpiness. On the other hand, the increase in floury taste could be attributed to the characteristic flavor of starches, which was described by assessors as typical of flour or ‘cereally’ flavor.</p>
<p>These sensory changes are in agreement with results reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013211433070">Ares et al<italic>.</italic> (2009)</xref>. However, it is interesting to take into account that these authors reported significant changes in the sensory characteristics of desserts when only 1% of Hi-maize was added. In the present work, slight changes in the sensory characteristics of the desserts occurred when 3% of RS was added. These differences could be explained considering differences in the formulation of the desserts, particularly the higher thickness of the regular dessert and chocolate flavor, which is a more efficient masker of the floury taste of RS than vanilla flavor.</p>
<p>Moreover, according to ANOVA, type of RS also had a significant effect (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) on the sensory characteristics of desserts. The addition of Novelose caused smaller sensory changes to the desserts, particularly at high concentrations (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1082013211433070">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1082013211433070">3</xref>). This suggests that Novelose is a better option to develop functional milk desserts enriched with insoluble fiber. This could be explained considering the structure of these functional ingredients. Hi-maize corresponds to RS - RS2, that is, RS that occurs in granular form which is resistant to the attack of digestive enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013211433070">Asp and Björck, 1992</xref>). Meanwhile, Novelose is composed of RS - RS3, corresponding to retrograded high amylase corn starch. RS3 is formed during usual food processing by cooking and then cooling. After starch gelatinizes, the granular structure is disrupted and then, when it is cooled down, amylose and amylopectin recrystallize, forming a new compact structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1082013211433070">Laurentin and Edwards, 2005</xref>). Thus, Hi-maize is composed of more compact granules than Novelose. These differences in the structure of both types of RS explain why desserts with Hi-maize were rougher, thicker and had a more intense floury taste than those with Novelose.</p></sec>

<p>Consumers gave lower overall liking and willingness to purchase scores for milk desserts enriched with RS despite the fact that they were aware of the potential positive effect that they might have on their health. Thus, consumers’ awareness of fiber enrichment was not enough for fulfilling their sensory and hedonic expectations, leading to a decrease in their willingness to purchase. These results are similar to those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1082013211433070">Sabbe et al. (2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1082013211433070">2009b</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1082013211433070">Tuorila and Cardello (2002)</xref> working on off-flavors in juice and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013211433070">Ares et al. (2010a)</xref> for the addition of antioxidant extracts to chocolate milk desserts. These authors also reported a decrease on willingness to consume, despite the presence of convincing health claims. Therefore, results sum up to those that indicate the consumers are hardly willing to compromise sensory characteristics of functional foods for eventual or long-term health benefits, stressing the importance of considering consumers’ perception during the development of functional foods.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1082013211433070">Table 4</xref>, the addition of both types of RS up to a concentration of 6% did not cause significant changes in overall liking, suggesting that chocolate milk desserts containing up to this concentration could be developed. Results are more encouraging than those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013211433070">Ares et al. (2009)</xref> when working with RS enrichment of vanilla milk desserts. According to these authors the addition of 1.4% of RS caused a significant decrease in consumers’ overall liking. This suggests that chocolate flavor was a good alternative to mask the sensory changes caused by the addition of RS.</p>
<p>When willingness to purchase scores were considered, no significant changes were observed when Hi-maize concentration was lower than 12% and when Novelose concentration was lower than 15% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1082013211433070">Table 4</xref>). Therefore, consumers’ willingness to purchase scores were less sensitive to the addition of RS to the milk desserts. This indicates that although consumers liked the functional products less than the regular milk dessert, they would buy them, probably due to the positive effect on their health that they would have. Regarding differences between the two types of RS, the effect of type of RS, the interaction between type of RS and concentration were not significant to overall liking and willingness to purchase, suggesting that differences in the sensory characteristics of desserts enriched with Hi-maize and Novelose did not affect consumers’ hedonic response.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec13-1082013211433070"><title>Survival analysis</title>
<p>Survival analysis methodology was used to estimate the maximum RS concentration that could be added to the desserts based on consumers’ overall liking and willingness to purchase scores, particularly on the percentage of consumers who decreased their overall liking and willingness to purchase scores with respect to the regular chocolate milk dessert.</p>
<p>Since there are no statistical tests to compare the goodness of fit of different parametric models used for interval-censored data, visual assessment of how parametric models adjust to the non-parametric estimation was used to choose the most adequate model. The following distributions were considered: smallest extreme value, normal, logistic, Weibull, lognormal and log-logistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013211433070">Hough et al<italic>.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Weibull distribution showed the best fit and therefore was chosen.</p>
<p>The maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the Weibull distribution were calculated and used to graph the percentage of consumers decreasing their overall liking and willingness to purchase scores with respect to the regular dessert vs. RS concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013211433070">Figure 1</xref>).

</fig></p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013211433070">Figure 1</xref>, as RS concentration increased, so did the percentage of consumers liking or willing to purchase the product less than the regular chocolate milk desserts, as expected. This is in agreement with average overall liking and willingness to purchase scores, confirming that consumers were not willing to accept samples with large modifications in their sensory characteristics despite being aware of their potential positive impact on their health.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1082013211433070">Giménez et al. (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013211433070">Hough et al. (2003)</xref> considered 25% and 50% rejection (to consume as criteria) to estimate sensory shelf life. In this case, a decrease in liking instead of rejection to consume was considered. Therefore, 25% implies that 25% of the consumers liked the functional product less than the regular one rather than rejecting the product. Considering that, traditionally, functional products are limited to a small proportion of the population and are not considered mainstream products, this criterion seems reasonable.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1082013211433070">Table 5</xref>, considering 25% of the consumers scoring their overall liking and willingness to purchase lower than the regular dessert, the maximum RS concentration that could be added to chocolate dairy desserts was estimated.

<p>The consideration of the percentage of consumers decreasing their overall liking or willingness to purchase scores consists of an interesting methodology for functional food development, enabling the selection of maximum concentration of functional ingredient to be added to the product. Thus, only 25% would be less willing to consume a chocolate milk dessert containing 4% of RS with respect to the regular milk dessert.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec14-1082013211433070"><title>Open-ended question</title>
<p>Multiple factor analysis (MFA) was carried out to visualize the relationships between the terms and the evaluated milk desserts.

For both types of RS, desserts with 9–15% of RS were sorted together in the first dimension of MFA; whereas desserts with 0–6% were close to each other in the representation, suggesting that they were considered similar in terms of their sensory characteristics.</p>
<p>Desserts enriched with 9–15% of Hi-maize or Novelose were described by consumers using words related to the negative sensory changes caused by the addition of the functional ingredient. Consumers used words such as thick, not very sweet, bitter, rough, aftertaste, and bad taste to describe this group of desserts (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013211433070">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1082013211433070">3</xref>).

<p>These results are in agreement with results from the trained assessors’ panel and suggest that consumers clearly perceived changes in the sensory characteristics of the desserts when RS was added to the desserts in a concentration higher than 6%, indicating that the maximum RS concentration of RS to be considered during the development of functional milk desserts corresponds to this limit.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec15-1082013211433070" sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>The addition of two types of RS, Hi-maize and Novelose, to chocolate milk desserts led to significant changes in the sensory characteristics and significant decrease in consumers’ overall liking and willingness to purchase. Considering consumers’ perception of the desserts, the maximum concentration of both types of RS that could be added is 6%. The concentration that causes only 25% of the consumers like the functional product less than the regular dessert was just 4%.</p>
<p>The use of an open-ended question enabled the identification of consumers’ perception of the sensory and hedonic characteristics of the desserts, and particularly the identification of liked and disliked samples, as well as the sensory attributes that characterize these groups. Using this technique, the concentration at which consumers clearly perceived negative changes in the sensory characteristics of the desserts due to the addition of RS were identified.</p>
<p>The application of survival analysis and open-ended questions during the development of functional products could help the identification of products that are liked by consumers and which have a higher probability of success when launched in the market place.</p>
<p>Moreover, survival analysis proved to be a useful methodology to develop functional foods taking into account the risks of decreasing consumers’ liking or willingness to purchase when compared to the corresponding regular product.</p></sec>
