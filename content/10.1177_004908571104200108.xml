<title>Background</title>
<p>The immediate context of the seminar, organised at the North-Eastern Hill University (NEHU) Campus, Shillong on 9–10 June 2011, was the continuing extra-judicial killings of innocents in Manipur in the name of fighting insurgency. Development of a kind is apparently going on in the state side by side with such killings. This has serious implications for democratic governance.</p>
<p>The broader context of the seminar may be briefly spelt out. While per capita development expenditure in the region is reported to be higher than in the rest of the country, the issue of persisting conflict, hidden and explicit, indicates a disconnect between development expenditure and the improvement of human happiness. It would appear that neither economic development by itself nor ethnic mobilisation alone is adequate to address the causes of social discontent. Field experience in the region leads one to believe that people of the region are not only keen to have development but also want their dignity and self-respect to be preserved. State violence in the name of national security and counter violence by non-state actors have inflicted immense suffering on the ordinary people of the state, especially women and children, costing a huge price in terms of the protection of their human, legal and social rights. Moreover, development projects such as the building of a large number of dams, especially in the state of Arunachal Pradesh, has led to massive displacement with neglect of relief and rehabilitation. There are other aspects of development in the region which cause concern.</p>

<sec id="section2-004908571104200108">
<title>Objectives</title>
<p>The objectives of the seminar were to (<italic>i</italic>) assess the development, violence and governance issues in the region; (<italic>ii</italic>) focus on the role of state institutions especially the security agencies; (<italic>iii</italic>) identify public policy issues that arise; (<italic>iv</italic>) formulate policy recommendations and suggestions; and (<italic>v</italic>) publish the proceedings.</p>
<p>In all 35 scholars, activists and others were invited to participate in the seminar, which was intended to last three days. However, only 20 were present, the others pleading, on various grounds, their inability to attend. Hence, the length of the seminar was reduced from three days to two days. Written and oral presentations were made by the participants. A publication has been brought out containing some of the written presentations. A more comprehensive volume will emerge in due course after all the participants make their written presentations available.</p>
<p>Dr KS Subramanian, ICSSR Senior Fellow at the Council for Social Development, New Delhi, the lead organiser of the seminar was ably assisted by Dr C. J. Thomas, Deputy Director, ICSSR North Eastern Regional Centre, Shillong and his staff.</p>
<p>Dr Subramanian, on the basis of the findings of the seminar, will work on and produce a book on conflict resolution in the North-East with an analysis of the challenges faced by central and state governments in meeting and resolving the various open and hidden conflicts in the region, latest by the end of 2012. The book will make a series of recommendations for action by central and states agencies responsible for development and humane governance in the region.</p>
<p>Tentatively, the book will consist of 10 case studies on conflict resolution and governance in the North-East including the ULFA, Bodo, Karbi Anglong and NC Hills cases in Assam; Nagaland; Manipur; Meghalaya; Tripura; Sikkim; Mizoram; dams in Arunachal Pradesh; minorities; land and Naga–Manipuri conflict. The book would also include an assessment of the impunity enjoyed by politicians and others for the violence in Assam and an analysis of the role of the land question in promoting conflicts in the region. Further, in the case of Manipur, apart from a study of the issue of Armed Forces Specials Power Act (AFSPA), the emerging conflict between the Manipuris and the Nagas within the state of Manipur will also be made.</p>

<title>Day 1: Inaugural Session, 9 June 2011</title>
<p>The seminar was inaugurated by Prof. A. N. Rai, Vice-Chancellor, NEHU, Shillong. Professor T. B. Subba gave the welcome address.</p>
<p><bold>Introductory Address:</bold> Dr Subramanian mentioned his long experience in the North-East and in the Government of India (GoI) and brought out the inadequacy and limitations of the existing policy mechanisms at the top to deal with conflict situations including in the North-East. He drew attention to the absence of adequate mechanisms for policy making at the highest level which has been brought out in the paper he has circulated to the participants in the seminar. He called for far-reaching reforms in the political, police and policy systems in the GoI and the North-Eastern states to deal with conflicts and bring peace. The structure of the security agencies especially the central agencies needed change. The lack of accountability of the intelligence agencies, noted even by the Vice President of India recently, needed attention. He also noted that the inclusion of academicians in report writing in the IB is essential to give them necessary objectivity. Policing, according to him, although is judged as a social service, has been connected with the question of national security in the North-East. He also touched upon the apathy of the administration regarding the issue of human rights. He cited his own experience of Manipur where extra-judicial killings are carried out on the ground that those killed were anyway underground people who did not deserve the judicial process. This, he considers a very disturbing fact. He ended his talk by hoping that the conference might generate some very useful insights into the problems so that the way forward could be found.</p>
<p><bold>Keynote address:</bold> The keynote address was delivered by Subir Bhaumik, former BBC correspondent on the North-East, who drew from his experiences and revealed the dual nature of development that can reduce conflict, on the one hand, but can exacerbate it, on the other. This he asserted depended on the inclusive nature of development. Understanding conflict in its context is very important in order to address it, something that had obviously not been done given the durable nature of conflict in the North-East. This he attributed to the character and handling of the issues by the GoI that focuses on reactive response that added to the conflict. Also the demographic factor is important as exemplified in the case of the relations of the tribal population of Tripura with the Bengali population, most of whom were immigrants.</p>
<p>Bhaumik compared the attitude of the GoI to the teachings of Kautilya who proposed the use of the tools of <italic>sam, dan, dandh</italic> and <italic>bedh</italic>. The point he tries to make was that Kautilya had formulated these tools keeping in mind the context of dealing with the enemy but the tragedy is that the GoI is using it against its own people, in this case the population of the North-East. These are best exemplified in the culture of secret killings that encourage a culture of impunity and conflict, something that Dr Subramanian had also touched upon.</p>
<p>The variable treatment of the government that favours one insurgent group over another was also brought to light. Historical reordering of polity, according to him, is the main cause of continued conflict in the region. In this respect he discussed about the special federal relationship that the GoI is contemplating with the NSCN and the claim by the Nagas of having a unique identity. The second point he made was by suggesting that uniqueness is a claim that can be made by many of the groups in the South Asian region that has a history of more than 5,000 years. Regional aspirations and multiplicity of identity is a fact that, however, has to be accepted and addressed through voluntary association. He dismissed the idea of secession by many groups as mere rhetoric and a bargaining tool. The lack of understanding of the power of ethnicity by the GoI to him is a grave problem as no equitable and just settlement can be arrived at without careful consideration of the genuine aspirations.</p>
<p>Bhaumik brought to the attention the fact that the Naga movement was not the first violent movement in the history of the North-East. It was the communist movement in Tripura with its links also in Manipur. Then the Naga movement took a violent turn in the 1950s, after which the Naga-type movement spread due to the failure of governance. He cited the case of the <italic>Mautam</italic> famine, associated with bamboo flowering in Mizoram (which was part of Assam at that time) that was mishandled by the apathy of the Government of Assam and GoI. This forced the Mizos to take up arms. The emergence of UNLF and other outfits in Manipur emerged in the 1960s when the people saw that the Indian system gives nothing. The Union Ministry for the Development of the North-Eastern Region (DoNER), he revealed, admitted that the backwardness of the region began after independence. Again policy issues like the Look East Policy that aims at development of the region will not succeed unless changes happen in Burma, he contended. He also touched upon the AFSPA that has outlived its utility and become a symbol of oppression and cruelty. In conclusion, Bhaumik stated that without re-examination, reordering of polity and establishing the rule of law, the conflicts in North-East will not end.</p>
<p><bold>Technical Session I: Development, Insurgency and Human Rights</bold></p>
<p><bold>Chairman:</bold> Professor L. Gassah, Dean School of Social Sciences, NEHU, Shillong</p>
<p><bold>Topic and speaker:</bold> <italic>Violence, Identity Politics and National Building with Special Reference to North-East India</italic>; K. C. Baral, Director, English and Foreign Languages Department (EFL), NEHU, Shillong</p>
<p>Baral stated his aim of attempting a theorisation of the concept of violence. He started by establishing a relationship between violence and nation by providing the example of the birth of India as a nation on the backdrop of the violence of partition leading to the Babri Masjid demolition and anti-Sikh riots due to Mrs Indira Gandhi’s assassination. The concept of violence, according to Baral, is problematic because of the complexity and multiplicity of sources of violence: violence used in communal, regional movements and counter violence by the state. This generates the need to introduce a discourse on violence. This he began by identifying violence as a means of achieving certain goals driven by a common idea and leading to expression of suppressed instincts. The justification of the ends, however, remains debatable. Violence also is a manifestation of power and in its instrumental character is ingrained the questions of how and why it happens. The answers emanate from psychological and social causes. Baral also said that automatic branding of people on the basis of identity was wrong.</p>
<p>On the issue of violence, he pointed out that there are also cases of ethnic violence between the groups, viz., Garo–Rabha, Naga–Meitei, Naga–Kuki conflicts etc. Fighting within one’s own community is another dimension that needs to be considered. Violence becomes a tool to dominate the weaker groups. Identity politics, according to him, is the main reason for conflict in India in general and North-East in particular. Baral also tried bringing about an understanding of the concept of violence by looking at its hierarchical structure: macro level represented by issues of territoriality, economic interest and the micro level is seen in the relationship between different neighbouring groups based on identity. Baral identified the government, militants and church as the three structures of institutions in North-East that demands affiliation. This makes the context of violence very different from what is reported in the mainstream. Apart from the three main structures the state has created multiple institutions in the North-East India, that is, <italic>dorbar</italic>, district councils, etc., the failures of which gives insurgents the scope to operate.</p>
<p><bold>Topic and speaker:</bold> <italic>An Analytical Overview of Response to Development in North-East</italic>; Pradip Phanjoubam, Editor, <italic>Imphal Free Press</italic>, Imphal</p>
<p>Phanjoubam talked about the systematic belittling of the states of North-East as one of the main causes that has created frictions in the region. He traced this situation as having its antecedents in the early stages of national-building process when India was very insecure about the unity of the country. Hence, this arrangement of centre-dominance of state was justified as given in Article 3 of the Constitution. He gave the example of AFSPA in which the state has the power to call for its imposition but not its removal. The case of Omar Abdullah, his pleading for the removal of the Act falling on deaf ears, is a prime example of centre-dominance structure. Pradip is of the opinion that since India is much more confident than before, this feature of centre-dominance should be discarded. There is an attitude of mistrust towards the North-East and all development projects, whether that be of roads or the Look East Policy, have always been security centric. Also, local events have always been viewed being subjective and anti-national. The skewed relationship and dependence on the centre has prevented the politicians to act with courage, freedom and take a sure-footed approach. The relaxation on the entry of the foreigners to the region is a welcome sign but more has to be done.</p>
<p><bold>Topic and speaker:</bold> <italic>Paradox of Security-centric Approach to Development</italic>; Prasenjit Biswas, Professor of Philosophy, NEHU</p>
<p>Prasenjit described India’s North-East as being a theatre of million mutinies. He blamed the Indian state as being bloody that has mingled security and development through militarisation of the region. He compared India’s North-East with Guantanamo Bay where rights are curtailed and questioned as to whether the Indian state’s relation to North-East is a symptom of a strong or a failed Indian state. The introduction of a counter-insurgency programme in Mizoram University is a dangerous precedent. The states of the region are helpless with no control over administration and have surrendered democratic institutions in the name of the Indian Constitution. The Indian state, Prasenjit claims, is plagued by contradictions. Development in the region is security centric and the policies have not been able to take care of people’s needs, address the problems of depletion of rivers, damming of rivers, export of minerals etc. When care is not taken to consider the voices of the people it erodes the legitimacy of the Indian state.</p>
<p><bold>Technical Session II: Development, Environment and Conflict</bold></p>
<p><bold>Chairman:</bold> T. B. Subba, Professor of Anthropology, NEHU</p>
<p><bold>Topic and speaker:</bold> <italic>Dams and Conflicts in North-East India</italic>; Niraj Vagholikar, ‘Kalpvriksh’ NGO</p>
<p>North-East India, according to Niraj Vagholikar, is the future power house for India. The development of power security through dams is thought to provide scope for export of power and local and regional distribution. However, because of the natural fragility and cultural sensitivity of the area, many conflicts have emerged over the years. The issues of conflict are related to the significance of the displacement of a population that is very small (the population of the Mishmi people is only 10,000) and are culturally linked with the area. There are also demographic implications due to the large-scale migration of labourers and the exclusive nature of the Environmental Impact Assessment committee that excludes social scientists thereby giving preference to technocrats.</p>
<p><bold>Topic and speaker:</bold> <italic>Auditing of Peace Process in Nagaland</italic>; Sajal Nag, Professor of History, Silchar University</p>
<p>Since 2007, Sajal Nag informed the seminar participants, Naga civil society has taken on the process of auditing the peace process that was started in 1997 with the proclamation of ceasefire between the Naga insurgents and the GoI. The Naga struggle post 1997 has entered the third phase, the preceding ones being 1947–60 and 1960–75. The years preceding 1997 is important, according to Nag, because of (<italic>i</italic>) the internal events like the political turmoil in the Soviet Union, Bangladesh and Burma and (<italic>ii</italic>) the pressure applied by the civil society on the government and the NSCN to come together for discussions. As the peace process was not bringing any tangible results the Nagas started the audit to identify ceasefire violations (2007 clashes in Zunebhoto, 2009 PLA–UNLF–NSCN clash among others); reconciliation with the rest of India; factional clashes that previously had occurred outside the region are now rampant within; spoilers of peace process; and lack of transparency that leads to misinformation and lack of integration. He also discussed other issues like the Naga movement creating the conflicts between Dimasa–Hmar, Karbi–Naga, etc.; Dimapur emerging as a hotbed of extortion; emergence of autonomy movement, eastern Nagaland, demand for alternative arrangement of the Manipuri Naga; emergence of new outfits like MNRF, NNC, UNPC, ZUF and HTF; questions of non-Nagas within Nagalim and status of Naga–non-Naga mixed descendants. Significantly, Nag reported that the support for the various outfits has decreased from more than 60 per cent to about 30 per cent. The peace period, according to Nag, has actually been the period when factionalism–fragmentation takes place and its use as a pretext by the government to delay peace process is a cause of worry for the Nagas.</p>
<p><bold>Topic and speaker:</bold> <italic>AFSPA—Time to Repeal</italic>; Bablu Loitongbam, Director of NGO ‘Human Rights Alert’, Manipur</p>
<p>Bablu Loitongbam contends for the fact that there can be no national security in absence of basic human security that is much more than basic needs. Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) according to him is totally undemocratic. It was first introduced in the Naga Hills in the 1950s and it reached Kashmir in the 1990s. It is a law that the UN had rejected and could only be used during the state of emergency. However, there are basic human rights that cannot be done away with even during war and this is what the AFSPA violates according to Loitongbam. He revealed that when it was brought to Racial Discrimination Committee of the UN, it had been branded as a racist law and the UN Human Rights Commission (HRC) sent three letters to the Indian government that were not replied to. The law, he argues, does not resonate with India’s thrust to project itself as a democracy.</p>
<p><bold>Technical Session III: Civil Society, Impunity and Rebel Groups</bold></p>
<p><bold>Chairman:</bold> B. C. Kar, Centre for English and Foreign Language (CEFL), NEHU</p>
<p><bold>Topic and speakers:</bold> <italic>Governance in North-East India</italic>; Nanigopal Mahanta, Political Scientist, Guwahati University</p>
<p>In his talk, Nanigopal Mahanta tried to discuss the role of civil society in peace building in the context of Assam. He defined the civil society organisations as voluntary bodies organised for certain aims. According to Mahanta, whilst not neglecting the role of the state, civil society organisations are required in the context of North-East to prevent violent conflict, bring the rival communities/parties to negotiation, monitor post-conflict resolution and formation of social capital. These bodies in the context of conflict resolution in Assam can be divided into three types of groups, viz., sympathetic to ULFA, selected by ULFA to talk to the government and independent initiatives like that of Hiren Gohain. Many processions were organised to appeal to the militants to shun violence, influence the government to start unconditional dialogue with the militants.</p>
<p><bold>Topic and speakers:</bold> <italic>Secret Killings</italic>; Subir Bhaumik, Eminent former BBC journalist</p>
<p>Subir Bhaumik strongly criticised the culture of secret killings that has been brought by the Indian state to the region for it does not achieve its goals but leads to a trust deficit. He gave the examples of operation Bluebird in Oinam and other similar incidents. The post-1990 period has seen the spurt in the new culture of special operations and secret killings that was first seen in West Bengal. The divisiveness of the rebel movements again provided the Indian state the opportunity to find adequate collaborators. Bhaumik identified three types of special operations: The first type involves the use of surrendered militants to kill the leader of a group or his family. The killing of Arabinda Rajkhowa’s brother is a prime example.</p>
<p><bold>Topic and speaker:</bold> <italic>Dilemmas of Development in the Tribal Areas of NE</italic>; H. Srikant, Sociologist, NEHU</p>
<p>According to H. Srikant, the intra-ethnic conflict in North-East has not been discussed properly and although the constitutional provisions have been able to protect tribals from non-tribals/outsiders, it had failed to protect land relations. He raised the issue of whether the land relations are egalitarian or not, in view of emerging extreme class differentiations. He raised this issue in the context of Meghalaya whose results, he insisted, would reflect the conditions in different parts of the North-East as well.</p>

<title>Day 2: 10 June 2011</title>
<p><bold>Technical Session IV: Conflict and Governance in North-East</bold></p>
<p><bold>Chairman:</bold> K. S. Subramanian</p>
<p><bold>Topic and speaker</bold>: <italic>Impunity in Assam</italic>; Monirul Hussain, Professor, Political Science, Guwahati University</p>
<p>The question of impunity, asserted Monirul Hussain, was linked to human dignity, rights and justice. In this context, it involved a crime against humanity. Hussain raised two important questions regarding impunity in the context of violence: how and why violence is used. This he tried to explain in the context of the culture of impunity that has been practiced in Assam. In the beginning he stressed on the distinction between the identities of <italic>Ahomiya</italic> and <italic>Assamese</italic>, the former being a linguistic identity the other being a political one. Since the time of the British when Sylhet was included as a part of British Assam, the <italic>Ahomiya</italic> had harboured a minority syndrome due to the influx of a large Bengali population who were culturally different. Even though they attained a majority, it was a precarious one and apprehensions about the future haunted them. Even after independence when the state of Assam was created the majority was still precarious and this led to riots against the Bengalis in Goalpara and Kamrup (the former had earlier been contemplated to be given to East Pakistan because of the Bengali majority). The affected Bengalis were part of the more than 300,000 who had arrived from East Bengal. The riot perpetrators were never punished. During the 1960s the movements for installation of <italic>Ahomiya</italic> as the official language of the state alienated the Bengalis and the tribals. Riots ensued against the Bengalis and again the perpetrators got no punishment. By 1980 the movement had consolidated and was joined by the movement against foreigners. In the violence of North Kamrup more than 70 per cent to 80 per cent of the victims were non-<italic>Ahomiya</italic>. Violence was not limited only to the non-<italic>Ahomiya</italic> group but also against moderate <italic>Ahomiya</italic>.</p>
<p><bold>Topic and speaker:</bold> …, <italic>Policing and Rule of Law in the North-East</italic>; E. N. Rammohan, Former DG, BSF</p>
<p>E. N. Rammohan began by discussing about the structure of the Indian police that had been retained and continued even after the British had left. The structure was immensely flawed and even the British had criticised it as being intensely corrupt. He then analysed the approach being taken by the GoI in dealing with Naga insurgency. India during the 1950s had no experience in dealing with internal insurgency and the only body that had some experience was the Madhya Pradesh armed forces that had battled the dacoits. Hence, it was left to the armed forces to deal with the insurgency and this, Rammohan considers, was a very grave blunder as it creates many problems. First is the moral question of using the armed forces to fight its own people, and second is the lack of training or understanding of the armed forces to deal with internal problems. The GoI enacted many Acts like the Assam Disturbed Areas Act that was more for the protection of the armed forces than the common people. The situation in the Naga Hills and the Naga-inhabited areas of Manipur, in Rammohan’s opinion, is a failure of the executive and the judiciary.</p>
<p><bold>Technical Session V: Gender, Development and Human Security</bold></p>
<p><bold>Chairman:</bold> T. B. Subba, Department of Anthropology, NEHU</p>
<p><bold>Topic and speaker:</bold> …, <italic>Rights of the Displaced</italic>; Gulshan Parveen, Ph.D. candidate, JNU, New Delhi</p>
<p>According to Gulshan Parveen, the issue of internally displace persons (IDPs) is problematic because of the context and the consequences. This is because becoming an IDP has within it the elements of being uprooted leading to a crisis of identity and the claim to citizenship subsequently becoming shaky. Policies thus become very important but the politico-economic nexus in India makes it very difficult to redress the problems. Pre-fixed ideas are not possible in the case of dealing with the IDPs as their problems have to be understood in the social and political context in which they live. She identified the three actors that have to be taken into consideration in order to recognise their problems, viz., the state, civil society and themselves. The neglect of any one of these is going to create conflicts. She gave the example of the building of the Narmada dam that was done without the consent of the people and that led to the destruction of the symbols and meanings that the people had given to the surrounding environment. Policies should be formulated on a needs-based approach.</p>
<p><bold>Topic and speaker:</bold> <italic>Conflict, Development and Justice: A Gendered Perspective</italic>; Sukalpa Bhattacharjee, Department of English, NEHU</p>
<p>In looking at the issues of conflict, development and justice, Sukalpa has tried to view them from the post-development perspective. The post-development perspective has been in social sciences since the 1990s and is a critique of mainstream theory. She argues that the subject of development is dead. Development itself has become a political discourse. The division of the world into first, second and third world, the first two on the basis of economic status and the last on the basis of colonial legacy, speaks of the bias that is present in the classification itself. Development loses it human face and the formation of community of consumers reinforces the distinction of <italic>us</italic> versus <italic>them</italic>.</p>
<p><bold>Topic and speaker:</bold> <italic>Recalling Iroquois Confederacy</italic>; Vijayalakshmi Brara, Social Activist, Manipur</p>
<p>According to Vijayalakshmi Brara, there is much discussion on conflict generation and implications but not much on consensus. She proposes a North-East confederacy in the model of the Iroquois Confederacy of America. It is not the North-East experience in India that is important but it is India’s experience in North-East that is important. On the eve of independence Ambedkar and Rev. Nicholls Roy had wanted to adopt the policy of nurture in relation to the communities of North-East and allow them to develop on their own. However, the nurturing concept got ignored and they were left on their own. This made it difficult for the communities of the region to get identified to a pan-Indian identity. The different scheduled acts also did not achieve the desired results.</p>
<p><bold>Topic and speaker:</bold> <italic>Challenges of Living the Human Life in North-East: Development and Human Security in a Conflict Scenario</italic>; Ivy Dhar, Political Scientist, Ambedkar University, New Delhi</p>
<p>Ivy Dhar started by emphasising the multiple nature of social identity that the state always wants to merge into one. She insisted that income is not of the utmost importance but ignoring normative issues like affection and participation can create conflict. Because of the border land location, North-East has suffered from lack of development and occurrence of conflicts due to separatist movements, political reorganisations. The issues of migration, questions of state sovereignty and identity of the ethnic groups are other issues that have plagued the region for a long time. The pumping of funds, she maintains, is not going to solve the issue as human needs are varied.</p>
<p><bold>Technical Session VI: Conflict Resolution in the North-East</bold></p>
<p><bold>Chairman:</bold> Rajesh Deb, Department of Political Science, Delhi University</p>
<p><bold>Topic and speaker:</bold> <italic>Conflicts, Human Rights and Peace Initiative in Nagaland</italic>; Lanusashi Longkumer, Political Scientist, Nagaland University</p>
<p>Lanusashi Longkumer discussed psychological warfare that has been inflicted on the Naga people and linked it as an attack on their human rights. He stated that the scar of colonial legacy has persisted in nation building under neo-colonial forces. He then gave an account of the struggle of the Nagas. The Nagas’ first confrontation with colonial forces started with the Anglo-Naga war in 1832. After the confrontation, intrusion started and although state control was established, local institutions were allowed to function. After the British left, the Naga Hills was given scheduled area status. Since the Nagas were culturally, ethnically, racially different from the mainland, they refused to merge with India. In reply the Indian government passed many Acts like the Disturbed Area Act and others. Aerial bombardment was done to contain the uprising.</p>
<p><bold>Topic and speaker:</bold> <italic>Human Rights Issues in North-East India</italic>; K. Debbarma, Political Scientist, NEHU</p>
<p>According to K. Debbarma, the concept of human rights is linked to the idea of the human beings not being divisible, rights being universal and interdependent irrespective of origin. Human rights were declared in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Debbarma then discussed the application and status of human rights in the North-East situation. First, he discussed the nature of the armed forces, which are trained to fight at the border, leading to problems in dealing with the civilians resulting in human rights violations. Violations also occur in cases of conflict between armed non-state bodies and the state, during ethnic conflicts leading to the displacement of people (for example, Karbi–Dimasa, Bodo–Muslim), neglect of the refugees, custodial deaths and inadequate capacity for prisoners, crime against women (including witch hunting), absence of special care for HIV+ children and human trafficking (insurgency-hit areas are very prone).</p>
<p><bold>Topic and speaker:</bold> <italic>Indian Armed Violence Assessment (IAVA)</italic>; Sonal Marwah, an activist with NGO ‘Small Arms Survey’</p>
<p>Sonal Marwah first enlightened the others about the activities of the ‘Small Arms Survey’, an NGO based in Geneva, Switzerland who initiated the Indian armed violence assessment. She then highlighted the fact that in terms of fatalities due to violence India is much worse than Brazil, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. There were some other interesting findings that came out of her study. The study found that the most number of deaths had occurred not due to terrorism but due to homicide. In 2005, 3,378 deaths were attributed to terrorism but 32,719 deaths were attributed to homicide due to different reasons. There was also a high spatial variation with less than 10 cases reported in Nagaland and 111 cases reported in the Pondicherry. Pockets of violence were identified in UP, Bihar and Jharkhand.</p>
<p><bold>Topic and speaker:</bold> <italic>Media in Insurgency-ravaged North-East</italic>; Anirban Ray</p>
<p>Anirban Ray described journalism in North-East India as barefoot and not elite. The technological developments that have reached other parts of the country have not permeated to the region. Apart from it Ray mentioned the practical difficulties of reporting in the region. The ethnic diversity and insurgency create a lot of problem for journalists. He revealed that he himself had got threats from the HNLC to leave the area within 48 hours. Then there is the case of Parag Das of Guwahati whose death did not generate any heat as was seen in the Daniel Pearl case. He also reported that people in India have heard more about Pearl than Das. During ambush and hit operations journalists become unarmed combatants.</p>
<p><bold>Panel Discussion: Governance, Development and Conflict</bold></p>
<p><bold>Chairman:</bold> Professor D. R. Syiemlieh, Pro-Vice Chancellor, NEHU, Shillong</p>
<p><bold>Speakers:</bold> K. S. Subramanian</p>
<p>Subramanian talked about the prevalence of counter-insurgency structure in the North-East that needs to be dismantled. The police structure that has not changed since 1861 has more of a paramilitary nature. Although the responsibility of the senior officers is to prevent atrocities by the juniors, this has not happened and, according to the National Human Rights Commission, 75,000 cases of human rights violations mostly against the police are recorded every year. Sixty per cent of all the arrests made were either illegal or unnecessary. Wrongful arrests and torture are mounting. The police, Subramanian complained, are operating largely outside the legal structure which has led to impunity and extra-judicial killings. There is an in-built protection in the law for the police. The Acts and laws governing the police are also highly flawed and give low priority to investigation, prevention of crime but more on public order maintenance, security of the state and intelligence collection. Police training needs to be improved to make police respect and protect human rights.</p>
<p><bold>Speaker:</bold> Subir Bhaumik</p>
<p>According to Subir Bhaumik, in North-East the problem is not the police but the whole security establishment that has come up due to militarisation which needs to be dismantled. For conflict resolution in the North-East, Bhaumik formulated five ways:</p>
<list id="list1-004908571104200108" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>First, the security architecture needs to be dismantled. This security architecture has evolved with strong vested interests. This requires not just the reduction of the forces but to identify the deployment needs. Deployment should be on a needs basis.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Second, there should be a change in polity. The Special Federal Relationship arrangement should be used to change the polity. This should be first used in North-East on an experimental basis and later to the whole of the country. India can become a collection of republics. This would allow all nationalities to express themselves fully.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Third, draconian laws such as Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) and Disturbed Area Act should be done away with. The army should be called as the last resort and used discreetly.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fourth, the region should be viewed as a region of opportunity and not as a liability. The opening of the Stilwell road that could bring tangible benefits to the region and has been approved by the Chinese and Burmese governments has been opposed by the Indian government. The fear psychosis towards the neighbours has to be shed away.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lastly, just as Tamil Nadu is very important in dealing with Sri Lanka, West Bengal should also be given importance while discussing about the North-East.</p></list-item>

<title>Conclusion and Recommendations</title>
<p>A large number of students, scholars, activists and others took part in the discussions vigorously and actively. A number of dissenting points of view were expressed on a variety of issues posed by the main speakers. For reasons of time and space it has not been possible to bring these details into this presentation.</p>
<p>Post-seminar discussions led to the conclusion that the seminar organiser, Dr K. S. Subramanian, will write a follow-up book containing case studies on conflict situation and government response in the North-East. It was decided that a team of research officers will go to the field and collect data on 10 conflict situations in the region: ULFA; Bodo; North Cachar–Karbi Anglong; Mizoram, Manipur, Tripura, Nagaland, Naga–Manipuri conflict; land; and dams in Arunachal Pradesh. The work will be preceded by a one-day brainstorming session at the ICSSR-NERC Shillong on a date to be decided in consultation with the scholars concerned. The project will take anything up to a year to complete from the date of its initiation.</p>
<p>The recommendations arising from the discussions at the seminar are set out as follows.</p>
<list id="list2-004908571104200108" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Development is a complex and dual process with negative and positive consequences especially for the poor people. Those in authority need to appreciate this and keep the interests of the poor in mind while formulating development policies and programmes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Conflict and violence arise when development policies are not corrected for their negative implications.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Conflict-information systems in government, mainly controlled by the police, are not always reliable in their interpretation of the causes and nature of conflict and violence. There is a need to induct academics and others into the conflict-information systems of the government such as intelligence agencies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The Maoist insurgency in the Central Tribal Districts of India is portrayed as a national security threat by intelligence agencies while the national Planning Commission takes a development approach to the problem. The Union Home Ministry depends mainly on police sources for information on conflict situations, which creates a crisis of information in government at the highest level.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There is a need to reinterpret the concept of national security to include the concept of human security in it. Excessive concern with national security in the North-Eastern states leads to neglect of human security concerns especially of women and children. This has caused immense harm to the ordinary indigenous communities who inhabit this region. The constitutional protections provided for them are not always available to them. Unmitigated influx of market forces into tribal cultures uproots people from their lands and makes them subjects of involuntary displacement.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Governance in the North-East needs to be democratised and people’s participation in development and governance envisaged in the Constitution needs to be made a reality.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The whole security establishment that has come up due to militarisation in the North-East needs to be dismantled. Conflict resolution in the region should be dealt with in several ways.<list id="list3-004908571104200108" list-type="roman-lower">
<list-item><p>The security architecture in the North-East has evolved on the basis of strong vested interests. This calls for not just the reduction of the forces but the identification of the genuine deployment needs. Deployment should be needs based.</p></list-item>
