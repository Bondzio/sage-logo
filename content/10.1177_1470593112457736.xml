<abstract>
<p>Based on an ethnographic study of American garages, we develop a model of the roles that liminal spaces perform in the management of possessions and their meanings. We find that the garage serves as a transitional space that links the useful and useless, female and male, clean and dirty, sacred and profane, and past, present, and future. We also propose that the garage can be a de facto museum and prosthetic memory device, as well as a link across generations of the family. Based on these findings, we offer a model of liminal household spaces and their dynamic role in making and managing meanings of everyday life.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It was likely quite purposeful that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1470593112457736">van Gennep (1960</xref>) chose the metaphors of spatial movement, doorways, and passages in describing the processes of liminality and transformation. Both individuals and groups may ‘pass through’ stages of transformation, construction, and deconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470593112457736">Cody et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470593112457736">Curasi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1470593112457736">Schau and Thompson, 2010</xref>). As has been extensively documented within marketing research – as well as the social sciences generally – possessions are almost always part and parcel of these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470593112457736">Fischer and Gainer, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1470593112457736">Schouten, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the actual physical thresholds and sites of liminality remain virtually unexplored in the marketing literature (for exceptions, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470593112457736">McCracken, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470593112457736">Nippert-Eng, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1470593112457736">Roselin, 1991</xref>). There is perhaps as much, or even more, to be learned about transformation and liminality through the <italic>places</italic> in which these processes occur, as there is about the people and possessions undergoing the transitions. For example, why are certain specific areas <italic>deemed suitable</italic> for self, familial, or group transformations, while others are not? Why are certain specific spaces and places <italic>needed</italic> for liminal processes to be enacted and liminal possessions to be stored? What are the social and cultural <italic>characteristics</italic> attached to the places where liminal and transformative events occur?</p>
<p>In this paper we explore the American garage as such a liminal space and consider its meanings and purposes beyond serving its traditional role as a sheltered area to park vehicles. Most American single-family homes have a garage whose primary designated use is to house the family’s means of transportation, usually an automobile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470593112457736">Gallagher, 2006</xref>). Throughout their development in the United States, garages were used for a variety of other purposes; among these are home-based construction projects, food storage, seasonal possession storage, pre-disposal storage, and pet habitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470593112457736">Arnold and Lang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1470593112457736">Twitchell, 2006</xref>). Arnold and Lang’s (2007) study in southern California, for example, found that the majority of the large (2–3 car) garages there could no longer fit a car, because they had effectively been transformed into liminal storage areas. These findings suggest that the garage is a significant site of liminal consumption activity, serving as a way station of sorts between the home and the outside world.</p>
<p>Although the home and its meanings have been extensively studied (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470593112457736">Gallagher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470593112457736">Marcus, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1470593112457736">Miller, 2008</xref>), the garage area has not. In research conducted to date, the garage is commonly designated to be a ‘male territory’ in the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470593112457736">Breese, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1470593112457736">Twitchell, 2006</xref>), ‘a man cave’. Thus, it would also seem to play an important potential role as a culturally gendered space. Further, although usually attached to the house, the garage is nonetheless viewed as being neither ‘inside’ nor ‘outside’ – even its positioning on the residential property is deemed liminal. Although other areas of the home have been previously identified as having liminal qualities, for example the attic and basement, we argue that the garage has <italic>unique</italic> characteristics that set it apart from other liminal household spaces. We propose that in North America the garage has become an <italic>essential place</italic> in which a <italic>specific set</italic> of liminal activities occur and <italic>specific types</italic> of liminal possessions are stored.</p>
<p>Prior marketing research on spatial liminality is remarkably limited. For example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470593112457736">McCracken (1986</xref>) proposed that personal items full of memories, such as infant’s clothes, may be stored in attics in order to desacralize them in preparation for discarding. Yet he does not offer documentation of this process nor describe why a special place is required for this transformation to occur. As another example, the transfer of an intended gift from the store in which it was purchased to the gift-givers’ home, where it is wrapped and personalized for the recipient, may also be considered a transformative spatial process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470593112457736">Hendry, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1470593112457736">Sherry Jr, 1983</xref>). Similarly, the transfer of food from the supermarket to the consumer’s kitchen, where it is transformed into the family dinner or even a holiday feast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470593112457736">Makekar, 2002</xref>) is a liminal spatial transformation.</p>
<p>Contrasting with McCracken’s example of the attic, in both these latter transformations, goods become sacralized – transformed from profane commodities to sacred objects – by bringing them directly into the active, sacred portions of the household. Taken together, these examples suggest that liminal spaces and places may be intrinsic to the processes of sacralization and desacralization. Additional research indicates that depleted household items generally are desacralized prior to disposal and that these processes often require a specific area for enactment (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470593112457736">Gregson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470593112457736">Gregson and Crew, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the social sciences, several studies have identified liminality in locales such as resorts, hotels, camping trips, road trips, airports, and railroad stations and found a heightened sense of personal mobility and identity flux for individuals in these settings (e.g. Pritchard and Morgan, 2000). In particular, Pritchard and Morgan (2005: 762) have delved deeply into the hotel as a ‘liminal site of transitions and transgressions’.</p>
<p>Others have examined the liminality of space and place in terms of gendered power relations, contested boundaries, social hierarchies, and age stratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470593112457736">Lefebvre, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1470593112457736">Spain, 1992</xref>). Examples of such spaces include the suburban ‘gated community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470593112457736">Low, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470593112457736">McKenzie, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1470593112457736">Monterescu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1470593112457736">Teyssot, 1999</xref>) and the 9/11 Ground Zero area as sites representing contested social, political, and religious agendas and ideologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470593112457736">Diken and Lausten, 2005</xref>). Although most of these studies are about liminal places that facilitate rites of passage for people, our focus is on a particular liminal place that we anticipated would facilitate rites of passage for both consumers and their possessions.</p>

<title>Liminality in marketing research</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1470593112457736">van Gennep (1960</xref>), liminality is a multi-step passageway from one’s (or a group’s) current status, role, or condition to another state. First, one must separate from the current role or status, pass through an ambiguous phase, termed liminal, liminoid, or transitional, and then re-emerge or re-integrate into another role or status. Liminal processes are not unique to the social sciences. Biological examples might include a caterpillar constructing a cocoon and then emerging some months later as a butterfly; or the sperm and egg uniting within a woman’s uterus, forming an embryo and fetus, and eventually emerging as a baby. Consumer behavior examples could include, for instance, an alcohol and drug-addicted person entering a rehabilitation facility and emerging 28 days later in a clean and sober state. The liminal sites of transformation in these examples are the cocoon, uterus, and detox facility.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1470593112457736">Turner’s (1969)</xref> perspective on liminality holds that during a liminal state, people’s normal routines are disrupted. Often a state of anti-structure holds, characterized by communitas, equality, anonymity, and simplicity. Although this perspective has been widely employed in marketing research, it has also been challenged as being a romanticized view of what are often tumultuous times for the individual and group (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1470593112457736">Schouten and McAlexander, 1995</xref>). We propose that Turner’s model can be usefully supplemented by incorporating more explicit awareness of the mixed states through which both persons and goods may pass and the multi-directionality of these passages.</p>
<p>States of liminality and the transformations which occur within them may be either permanent and unidirectional or temporary and cyclical. Halloween, Mountain Man gatherings, and Burning Man festivals are among the cyclical liminal occasions that have been studied within marketing research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470593112457736">Belk and Costa, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470593112457736">Kozinets, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1470593112457736">Schouten and McAlexander, 1995</xref>), while weddings, funerals, moving to new homes, and childbirth are among the unidirectional liminal events examined (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470593112457736">Arnould and Price, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470593112457736">Fischer and Gainer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1470593112457736">Marcoux, 2001a</xref>).</p>
<p>In some instances individuals may cycle through transformative processes repeatedly, returning to former states again and again. For instance a recovering drug addict/alcoholic can (and frequently does) become an active drug and alcohol consumer once again – returning to his/her previous state. Similarly, dieters may repeatedly lose and gain weight across numerous cycles, often never reaching a state of equilibrium. Thus it is important to conceptualize liminality as a <italic>diverse set</italic> of processes which may include both permanent and impermanent (cycling) changes in status.</p>
<p>Another weakness in the Turner model is that some attempted transformations may result in failure, postponement, or revision by the individual. For example a person may intend to compete as a professional athlete, purchase the necessary equipment, and obtain appropriate training, yet fail to ‘make the cut’. In such cases the attempted transition to the sought-after state is never achieved. Others may buy exercise equipment, but not find the opportunity to use it. However, the equipment may be kept and stored ‘just in case’ the opportunity arises for its use in the future. In other instances, materials may be purchased for a household construction project which is then postponed due to unforeseen events. Months later, the project may (or may not) be undertaken and completed. During the intermediate time period, the materials have an ‘indeterminate’, liminal status. They may or may not be used. They may or may not be useful.</p>
<p>Possessions may also undergo liminal transformations by being ‘moved’ from one use or application to another. Gardening supplies originally used for a backyard tomato garden may be re-tasked for a kitchen herb display. In all these instances, spatial movements and storage are usually required. We propose that the current conceptualization of liminality as <italic>something that only happens to people and is only unidirectional</italic> can create researcher myopia with respect to objects-in-transit from one status to another, the places used to enact that transition, and the sometimes repetitive or temporary nature of liminal state changes.</p>
<p>A further shortcoming within current marketing research on liminality is the focus on only highly significant rites of passage, such as weddings, funerals, births, graduations, and entry to college. The possessions examined in these inquiries tend to be highly significant to self identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470593112457736">Mick and DeMoss, 1990</xref>). Conversely, many household items that are acquired, used, and discarded have minimal relevance to individual (or family) role performance or connection to the core self: e.g. dog food, garden hose, a dozen eggs, light bulbs, roasted chicken, deodorant, shaving cream, laundry detergent, kitty litter, AA batteries, gasoline, and ant spray. Yet they too display liminal transition characteristics from useful food, deodorizer, or cleaning compound to ‘trash’ and often require storage in specific areas while making this transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1470593112457736">Rathje and Murphy, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1470593112457736">Thompson, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>Other objects may pass into and out of the household changing their status from ‘clean’ to ‘dirty’ and vice versa multiple times. For example clean clothes may become soiled and sweaty when worn to mow the lawn or play sports, cats and dogs may ‘pick up’ mud, fleas, and ticks while outside and have to be transformed back into a clean state before re-entering the house. Clean shoes may become dirty or muddy when worn in rain or snow and have to be washed off before being brought inside the house. Furniture inside the house may become irrevocably damaged or worn and have to be transferred outside for disposal. Because these are <italic>object and</italic> <italic>spatial transitions</italic>
<underline>,</underline> they are not visible to marketing research using traditional liminality theory. We believe the field can benefit by expanding its view beyond people going through liminal phases and recognizing that all matter and spaces themselves pass through transitions. </p>
<sec id="section3-1470593112457736">
<title>Liminal possessions in liminal places</title>
<p>What are the types of activities and objects typically found in liminal places? Person-centered transition research may provide some clues as to their composition. For instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1470593112457736">Schau et al. (2009</xref>) learned that newly retired persons typically enter a period of <italic>identity renaissance</italic> during which they may revive projects that had been ‘shelved’ or ‘postponed’ during their lives as workers. Retirees may also initiate novel activities in which ‘entirely new life projects are launched’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1470593112457736">Schau et al., 2009</xref>: 256). Thus, activities which once were abandoned may be revisited, now that the time and resources are available, and experimentation with novel forms of self-expression may be undertaken. As will be described below, we found that both novel and postponed projects often are ‘stored’ in the garage.</p>
<p>Other researchers learned that when passing through liminal transitions, consumers may choose to retain certain possessions connected to the roles they are departing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470593112457736">Kleine et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1470593112457736">Young, 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1470593112457736">Roster (2001</xref>: 427) proposes that these possessions may experience ‘continued storage without use or clear intent of future use, [or they may experience] neglect, concealment, and hierarchical downgrades.’ As we will show, the garage can serve as a key site for the transformation from wanted to unwanted status.</p>
<p>A final set of marketing research studies related to spatial liminality is based upon Douglas’s (1966) brilliant metaphorical thesis regarding the cultural labels of ‘clean’ and ‘dirty’. In Douglas’ view, dirty=disordered=unstructured, while its oppositional social category is clean=orderly=structured. Persons, animals, places, foods, activities, indeed all aspects of the cultural and natural worlds, have been designated as ‘clean’ or ‘dirty’ by various groups, individuals, or even entire societies at different times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470593112457736">Bradshaw and Canniford, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470593112457736">Douglas, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470593112457736">Kaufmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1470593112457736">Shove, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1470593112457736">Smith, 2007</xref>). In Douglas’s (1966) terms, dirt is ‘matter out of place.’ She notes:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Shoes are not dirty in themselves, but it is dirty to place them on the dining table; food is not dirty in itself, but it is dirty to leave cooking utensils in the bedroom, or food bespattered on clothing; similarly bathroom equipment in the drawing room; clothing lying on chairs; out-door things in-doors; upstairs things downstairs; under-clothing appearing where over-clothing should be, and so on. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470593112457736">Douglas, 1966</xref>: 35–6).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thus, collections of possessions may be labeled by their owners, or by observers, as ‘clean’ or ‘dirty’, depending upon whether they are seen as ordered or chaotic, in their correct place or out of place, useful or useless (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470593112457736">Belk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470593112457736">Ger and Yenicioglu, 2004</xref>). Further, desirable and valuable items may become soiled by coming into contact with sources of chaos/disorder such as mud, sewage, insects, animals, and other contaminants. In such cases, a purification process may be required to restore the object to its ‘clean’ status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470593112457736">Kaufmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470593112457736">Laemans and Meulders, 1999</xref>). Although clearly related to liminal and transitional states, this line of theorization has not yet been employed in marketing research on liminal spaces.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Ninety-six in-depth interviews were conducted with home owners by graduate students trained in interpretive research techniques; the interviews were conducted as part of a research project undertaken for course credit. Both interviewers and interviewees were ethnically, religiously, economically, and generationally diverse, but all had lived in the United States for at least 10 years. Typically, the interviewers chose to interview persons who were already known to them, either as friends, relatives, colleagues, or work associates. This provided access to discussion of personal possessions and their meanings which likely would not have been shared with a stranger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470593112457736">Arnold and Lang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470593112457736">Coulter and Ligas, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470593112457736">Curasi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1470593112457736">Roster, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Those being interviewed gave permission for the interviewer to visit them at home and also agreed to photographs being taken of their garages. Interviews were conducted in the homeowner’s garage, and the homeowner was simply asked to ‘take the interviewer through’ the garage and ‘tell about’ the items in it. The interviewer took notes and/or tape recorded each interview. The resulting transcripts were discussed with the supervising researchers and interpretive reports were written by each interviewer. Interviews ranged from 45 minutes to 1.5 hours. An additional researcher was invited to join the interpretive team after the interviews were conducted based on extensive personal expertise in field interview analysis.</p>
<p>Analysis was iterative and hermeneutic, starting first within each researcher and then spanning across the research team. Themes developed were iterative, cycling between close analysis of the verbal and visual (photographic) texts and the extant marketing and social science literatures. The photographs were discussed both among the team members and with the individuals who had conducted the interviews in order to gain greater interpretive insight. Several interesting theoretical anomalies emerged during this process, but we concentrate here on spatial liminality.</p>

<title>What can place tell us about possession liminality? Confirmation and disconfirmation of current theorization</title>
<sec id="section6-1470593112457736">
<title>Role transition and possession liminality</title>
<p>The participants provided ample documentation that role transitions often led not to the discarding of possessions used in their former roles, but rather to consigning them to the limbo of the garage. As found in earlier research, the most common and distinctive of these was the arrival of the empty nest stage of a married couple’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470593112457736">Hogg et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1470593112457736">Schau et al., 2009</xref>). Located in many of our respondents’ garages was evidence that the shedding of prior parental role possessions did not occur, even many years after the departure of children from the household. The most vivid and emotional of these examples concerned parents’ maintenance of their children’s toys and apparel in the garage.</p>
<p>Marina, for example, interviewed her father and found that he still kept in the garage magnets we used to collect when I was younger [which were] stuck all over his toolbox … [and] my congratulatory stickers from every year in high school … He is proud to showcase and cherish [them]. </p>
<p>Another example is provided by an immigrant family from India: </p>
<p>There were a few items in the Patel’s garage that were strictly sentimental: a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle doll sat on the shelf filled with toy cars and Christmas holiday ornaments made by the children.</p>
<p>In the Otokiti garage ‘each kid had his/her own corner’ created by their mother: </p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In Christine’s [now in college] corner are her My Little Pony dolls and an EZ Bake oven … In Nathan’s corner I saw dumbbells and exercise gloves … basketballs, footballs, and kneepads … [a] Nintendo Entertainment system … [and] two Sega Genesis Systems. </p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We interpret these as shrines to their children’s (now grown) former selves, for the parents who maintain them. Perhaps the most deeply felt time period of the parental role is when one’s children are young and ‘in their formative years’. The parents above clearly cherished these times and have set up de facto museums commemorating them. In essence, these liminal spaces-and-places are preserving <italic>both</italic> the parents’ and child’s former lives.</p>
<p>This is a key theoretical clue, we propose, for the necessity of having a storage space for such mixed-state objects – still tied to the homeowner through contagious magic, but no longer playing a role in his/her life. Such objects <italic>stand outside</italic> of traditional structured possession systems – not fully alive and not fully dead; they possess a <italic>hybrid</italic> set of traits and thus must be kept in a similarly mixed-state space.</p>
<p>In keeping with this interpretation, another participant, Mr. Ludlow, who still keeps his grown son’s go-kart in the garage because ‘it’s a really good memory’, declared that the garage itself was ‘full of memories … All the children being raised in it’. Mr So, a Korean immigrant </p>
<disp-quote>
<p>wanted me to see his two children’s fishing poles … They were from the [family’s] annual camping trips to the Delaware Water Gap … although [the family] stopped going there almost 10 years ago. </p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In these cases the objects were links not only to departed children, but to the family’s experiences involving these objects. It may also be the case that these objects have become romantically reinterpreted in the storage process – something <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470593112457736">Gregson and Crew (2003</xref>: 147) term ‘imagined history making,’ a process that is colored by both family history and nostalgia.</p>
<p>As alluded to by one respondent above, garages are not only the de facto museums of such family histories, they also may <italic>themselves</italic> serve as spatial artifacts of family events and activities. That is, the space itself echoes with the sounds and images of former family times spent there – in essence, garages are inhabited by ghosts of the family’s past. These ‘ghosts’ may be present both in the objects stored in the garage and in the memories family members have of projects undertaken in the garage.</p>
<p>Garage shrines were also maintained to past roles as wives and husbands. A Latina widow keeps building materials in her garage ‘from the original construction of the house in the 1970s’ because this is ‘stuff her [deceased] husband had in the garage and it is not mine to throw out.’ She also keeps</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>a number of tools and instruments that were part of my husband’s driveway paving business … as a memory of my husband  …Now that he’s passed, they belong to [our] children.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Storing possessions such as these may serve as a way of keeping the spirit of the deceased spouse near – but not in – the house. It also may serve as a subconscious testament that the surviving spouse is not yet ready to fully abandon his/her status of ‘being married’.</p>
<p>This use of spatial liminality suggests that consumers may desire to physically preserve evidence of cherished former roles, yet not keep these fully present within their current lives. The physical spaces in which these symbolic possessions are stored seem to act as a ‘time capsule’ of personal past history, kept out of sight, but not out of reach or thought. Just as children need transitional objects to remind them of mother when first leaving home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470593112457736">Gulerce, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1470593112457736">Winnicott, 1953</xref>), we may well need transitional objects as adults when we are separated from those we love. Without them, the <italic>tangibilit</italic>y of the loved one is lost.</p>
<p>Yet because it would be unseemly to display such items in the Goffmanesque front stage of the home’s public spaces, we keep them tucked away in the more private backstage places of the home, including the garage. As we argued above, such items are mixed in status – alive in memory, though the owner is absent. In a similar way, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470593112457736">Attfield (2000</xref>) found that garments that no longer fit or have gone out of fashion may be ‘kept as souvenirs, imbued with memories of youth, of significant persons, occasions, and rites of passage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470593112457736">Attfield, 2000</xref>: 145–6).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1470593112457736">
<title>Hoped-for future transfer of possessions as liminality</title>
<p>The findings above dovetail into a second liminal aspect of the garage space. Several different informants stated that they were storing children’s items of sentimental value, e.g. bicycles, strollers, baby clothes, sports equipment, in the garage in order <italic>to transfer</italic> them to close relatives, e.g. grandchildren, nieces and nephews, or even to friends or strangers whom they believed could use the items at some future point. These objects were deemed to possess <italic>potential</italic> functionality, thus throwing them away would be a wasteful act. In these cases, the object was seen as having a mixed-state character suitable for the liminal space of the garage – its prior utility was exhausted, but it possessed valuable amounts of potential utility.</p>
<p>But we believe that there is more than thrift and utility at work here. Often objects are stored in the hope that a son or daughter would have a child and the item could then be given to him/her. In these cases, the mixed state of the object is its diachronic intergenerational status; the object is literally suspended between two generations of family use – one generation being too ‘old’ to use it, the next generation being too ‘young’. While in some cases the hope of intergenerational passage may not be realistic, it may satisfy the older generation’s <italic>need to</italic> <italic>believe</italic> that certain possessions will stay in the family and continue to accumulate layers of emotional meaning (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470593112457736">Curasi et al., 2005</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470593112457736">McCracken, 1988</xref> on ‘Lois Roget’). In storing such objects, it is hoped not only that the owner can later enact a caring and giving role by transferring these things to loved ones, but that in the process they can also transfer some of the associations, love, and meanings attached to their original use and user. </p>
<p>Such intergenerational legacies thus may exist not only in actual transfers, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470593112457736">Marcoux (2001b</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470593112457736">Curasi et al. (2005</xref>) find, but more symbolically in the imagined or <italic>potential</italic> transfers that their retention, curation, and storage allows. In cases such as these, the garage serves as a space for influencing – or even creating – a future desired by the possessing generation. Items stored within it are intended to <italic>cause or facilitate</italic> the hoped for transference of meanings. But even if it does not occur, the potential for such transfers renders the storage of the objects in question as an act of love and caring.</p>
<p>For example Isabel Olan</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>had clothes left [and stored] in the garage from Daniella, her last child and only girl … She showed me Daniella’s first Christmas dress … She was saving this particular dress until Daniella had a daughter of her own. </p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There is ‘magical thinking’ at work here – Isabel believes that if she saves the dress, a granddaughter will be born to wear it. If the dress is discarded, the granddaughter may not be born. Keeping it is an act of faith and a sign of hope.</p>
<p>We found that the diachronic transfer of possessions stored in the garage extended across three generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470593112457736">Curasi et al., 2005</xref>). </p>
<disp-quote>
<p>As we continued to look around the garage … he showed me some old furniture he had … I asked him why he had it and he shared that they were from his grandparents’ house … He couldn’t get rid of them, because they were still good and maybe someone in the family could use them. (Drew Myers) </p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our mobile society we might expect that such three-generation transfers would be few, but our data suggest otherwise. As small as the traces of grandparents residing in furniture in the garage may be, they are tangible testimony that their lives meant something; that they had counted.</p>

<title>Memorials to self-history</title>
<p>A third type of liminality stored in garages represented the owner’s past or prior self. The garage served as a storage bin memorializing the consumer’s childhood or young adulthood – typically two time periods looked upon with fond nostalgia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470593112457736">Holbrook, 1993</xref>). Interestingly, both positively and negatively coded ‘self-I-used-to-be’ items were kept in the garage. The positive items brought recollections of happier times; the negative items symbolized triumph over adversity.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Mrs. Bass smiled a lot when talking about her bowling days; especially the time she beat her rival and bowled over 200. She showed me her trophies and talked about how her shoes always matched her outfits.</p>
<p>[My father keeps] his military uniform from the Polish Army [in the garage] … The uniform is buried beneath a pile of old clothes that [he] never wears … He was a member of the Polish Solidarity Opposition Movement [in the 1980s] … He was put in a military jail for 3 months and went through quite a lot … Even though [the uniform] brings back painful memories … my father will never get rid of it. (Petrusinski)</p>
<p>She took out a relatively large box that contained items from around the world … Wine bottles from Spain, France, and Italy, Belgian beer, a Spanish fan, a Hawaiian lei, and ticket stubs for the Louvre, Eiffel Tower, the Alhambra, the Coliseum These were all things she brought home … before having kids. (Sardina)</p>
<p>This is the lamp I got from a garage sale in Detroit … I got it for just $15 … It has been 9 years since we first came here [to the US], and I still have the lamp, because it reminds me of the days when we had to shop at garage sales. (Modhukar)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The items described above and stored in the garage are place-markers for personal life trajectories and life narratives. Most commonly, these narratives presented episodes that were especially emotional in the individual’s life – in both good and bad ways. Sardina, for example, ‘gave up’ her freedom of being a single woman with the ability to travel and act spontaneously and impulsively in order to become a wife and mother. By keeping these earlier life mementoes stored in a semi-private, semi-secret area of her family home, she seems to not want to give up that part of herself completely. Perhaps she ventures into the garage from time to time and gazes at them, thinking ‘that used to be me’. For Mudhukar, the inexpensive lamp (which ironically has moved from one garage to another) seems to represent a base point against which his economic progress can be measured favorably. By keeping it under his control in the garage, he essentially has ‘gained power’ over his earlier, lower income status.</p>
<p>These feelings and memories will likely be lost upon the archivist’s death, but for the time being they remain as tangible memorials of lives well lived. In keeping with our contention that such objects are stored in the garage because they represent mixed-status meanings, we interpret them as representing the individual’s former selves – they were alive in the past, but at present are dormant – for better or worse. Here in the garage they serve as the ‘read’ pages of their owners’ lives, while the rest of the book remains unwritten.</p>

<title>Preparing for future events</title>
<p>The future is inherently liminal; it is hazy, uncertain, unpredictable (perhaps that is both the beauty and terror of it!) As alluded to earlier, our informants’ garages often were stocked with things being kept there for ‘possible’ or ‘potential’ use in the future. We learned that there are a variety of anticipated futures, necessitating the storage of items in the garage. Some involved the expectation of future hospitality, e.g. uninvited guests arriving at the door; some were contingencies for future home repairs and emergencies e.g. batteries and bottled water; some items were the ingredients for creating future selves, and others were projects postponed or currently ‘stalled’, awaiting another chance at completion. The first excerpt below comes from a 60-year-old Indian immigrant who maintains his customary future-directed food ways in his new country, despite living in the US for over 25 years.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>You’ll see a huge stock of tomato cans, soda, rice, toilet paper and other dry goods kept in our garage. I like to purchase in bulk, because things are much cheaper. In India, grains are stored almost a year in advance. (Mahajan)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Mr Mahajan’s ‘stash’ of foodstuffs represents a hedge against the future. What if food should unexpectedly become scarce or extremely expensive, as it sometimes did in India? In his case, he is creating a <italic>hedge fund</italic> in his garage against potential negative, cyclical events. Other participants described objects in their garage as <italic>postponed projects</italic>, waiting for an opportune time: </p>
<disp-quote>
<p>This was the first push mower that I had. It doesn’t work [now], and all these years I was hoping to get around to fixing it; I just don’t have the time right now. (Davis) </p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Others, however, mark sadly lost opportunities. </p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Rich showed me was his orange and white mountain bike covered in dust … Rich told me, ‘It was $120 and I haven’t used it more than 2 or 3 times since I got it in 2007…I can’t leave Kathy [his very ill, disabled wife] alone, not even to take a bike ride.’ (Ramond) </p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Other garaged items seemed to await their owners’ having the time available to install them around the house.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>[Gesturing toward a stack of items in the corner], most of these things are new, some not even out of their packaging – almost all have to do with a project yet to be started or maybe to be completed – a sensor light to be installed near the front door … spray paint for the front step railings, a gutter cleaning tool. (St Pierre)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Notably, these are maintenance and repair projects that the consumer may be consciously or unconsciously avoiding, but by at least having the items ‘on hand’, pangs of guilt may be assuaged. On the other hand, viewing the items sitting unused and even unopened may serve as a visible reminder of the future tasks that <italic>should</italic> be completed. At a deeper, mixed-state level, these objects represent the potential for increasing order and structure in the household, once they are used. Yet at present they are a part of its clutter and disorder. Because of this mixed set of statuses, we propose, they are kept in the garage.</p>
<p>The garage also stores equipment that was originally intended to create a future self that may now be unattainable.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>She intended to set up a training room for herself in the garage [to] pursue her career as a soccer player … to be a part of the USA Women’s Team … [But] the last year of college she was in a horrible car accident … [Now] she hopes in the future she will be able to use [the training equipment in the garage] … and maybe coach soccer at a school. (Abdeldayem)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this instance, both the consumer and the objects have been re-tasked, yet this re-tasking remains a future potentiality, not currently in action. Thus, the equipment is kept in a liminal place.</p>
<p>Others amassed or held onto items that seemed likely to ‘come in handy’ in some future circumstance. In these instances, again, we propose it is the mixed status of being both ‘useful’ and ‘not-useful’ that makes it appropriate for them to be stored in the garage.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>There are many items in the garage left over from household projects, like extra floor tiles, wallpaper, chicken wire, and carpeting … What if I need it someday? (Deisher)</p>
<p>He walked over to a small box filled with canned foods, Twinkies, flashlights, batteries and a radio…Ever since Y2K, he has kept a survival kit … inside his garage. (Sardian)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These examples differ from the earlier one of Mr Mahajan’s long-term food and domestic supplies storage, because in these cases there is no definite use pattern imagined for them; rather their maintenance is based entirely on contingency. These latter findings suggest that liminal spaces may be intrinsically required by consumers for goods they view as resting in a kind of suspended animation; they are ‘sleeping’ until an opportunity arises and there is the will or need to use them. If the need or opportunity never arises, the goods may become fully ‘not-useful’ and then become candidates for discarding. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470593112457736">Cwerner and Metcalfe (2003</xref>) put it,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Rather than any absolute decision being made, the objects become increasingly marginalized. They are taken out of the way as they move out of use and out of the daily routines of life, out of sight and into the metaphorical recesses of the mind. Finally, objects might be displaced, moved out of the main sites of daily life as their usefulness and their place have yet to be determined. (2003: 236)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>What we believe this signals on a deeper level of human thought is that we often harbor hopes (and fears) for the future. Because humans are uniquely capable among animals of <italic>anticipating </italic>future events, we are uniquely saddled with the responsibility for preparing for those contingencies. Liminal spaces such as the garage may serve consumers simultaneously as ‘hedge funds’ and ‘investment stores’ for all the good fortune and bad fortune scenarios they can conjure up. By investigating these places, we come much closer to learning what people believe their future lives may hold – perhaps even seeing into those corners that are hard to acknowledge consciously. The metaphor of marginality is also apt. For the time being these objects are marginal to the lives of those who live in the adjacent house. They are not a part of their everyday lives, but are stored just on the edge of consciousness.</p>

<title>Spatial liminality and gendered territoriality</title>
<p>In focusing on the liminal spatial site of the garage we also encountered unanticipated principles governing the use of this space. One of two emergent themes holding promise is the presence of <italic>gendered territorial struggles </italic>within the household. Although there have been studies of female and feminine consumption (de <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470593112457736">Grazia, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470593112457736">Kirkham, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1470593112457736">Scanlon, 2000</xref>) and male and masculine consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470593112457736">Fischer and Gainer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470593112457736">Forty, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470593112457736">Holt and Thompson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1470593112457736">Tuncay and Otnes, 2008</xref>), there are few studies in which gendered place or space issues are addressed (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470593112457736">Duncan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1470593112457736">Morley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1470593112457736">Pink, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1470593112457736">Spain, 1992</xref>). In the present study, we learned that patterns of male and female territoriality exist in many households, with the garage serving as a primary site for gender struggles over storage, production, and control. In general, the garage was reported to be a male/masculine area, but this was often disputed by female family members. In one interview, for example, (addressing the husband/father): </p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Is the stuff in here mostly yours?</p>
<p>Yeah its mine … You need a certain amount of stuff to be self-sufficient as far as maintaining your vehicles and providing maintenance for your own things … and your home … [But] it seems that everything my wife finds in the house that she doesn’t want ends up in here … Then I either throw it out or give it to someone.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The wife of this same informant reported,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>This [the garage] is his area … it’s his zone … Usually the garage is the place for the tools and the cars and the stuff for the man … He kind of lets me control the rest of the house and take care of that, decorating and stuff. He [husband] spends more time in the garage than I do, because … he usually has a project … I go into the garage to get pots and pans. I usually don’t spend time there. (Rene &amp; Jack)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Another interviewer reported:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>He [the husband/father] has a storage freezer [in the garage] where he puts all the deer meat from when he goes hunting. He tries to eat venison at least once a week … He keeps it in the freezer to make sure it doesn’t go bad, and so his wife won’t throw it out, which she has done in the past when he put it in the refrigerator inside the house. (Santos)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The wife/mother’s policing of the house and requiring that certain objects – which she deems to be ‘dirty’, ‘wild’, or ‘disordered’ – be kept in the garage was fairly frequent among our respondents:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Larry talked about his martial arts punching bag … Unfortunately, Larry’s wife thinks there is not enough space inside the house to [use] the bag without breaking furniture or damaging the floor … The bag is next to the laundry room door, and Larry has been trying to sneak it inside. (Petrusinski)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The men-of-the-house, however, often met this challenge by turning the garage into a site for illicit/forbidden/hedonic activities:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>[He] put the 25 year old fridge in the garage, where it is now filled with beer he brews himself. (Ofri)</p>
<p>My uncle bought this [small refrigerator] specifically for the garage and keeps beer and Pepsi in there, so he can keep his drinking habits out of the view of his wife. (Santos)</p>
<p>[My father’s] garage has several themes which include the Philadelphia Eagles, Phillies and Corvettes … There are framed posters, Phillies and Eagles carpets, a Corvette lamp, Corvette clock. (Lauriello)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>However, there were exceptions to this territoriality pattern: In some cases, the woman was more competent than the man in tool use and exercised greater control of garage space:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>My husband has a box full of tools he doesn’t know how to use. I use them more than he does, so we could say the toolbox [in the garage] is mine. (Colleen and Mike)</p>
<p>Near the stored furniture [were] items such as children’s toys, bags of clothing and other odds and ends … It was his wife’s area … [things] she had picked up at yard sales and thrift stores for their grandchildren. (Myers)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the material above suggests, gendered contests over liminal spaces may be a fundamental aspect of privatized homes. Yet this aspect of daily life lies virtually unexplored by marketing researchers. We propose that it is in the spatially liminal aspects of these male–female demarcations that some of the most fruitful inquiries may be directed. For example, where do the cultural ‘rules’ categorizing home areas as male or female arise? Do they shift over the family life cycle? As women become more versed in mechanical and construction skills, do they invade formerly ‘male’ areas, such as the garage? What does the relative distribution of space within the garage tell us about power relationships within the family? What types of events may stimulate conflicts over this space?</p>

<title>Liminality between clean and dirty</title>
<p>We found that the garage is in some respects a liminal space between the <italic>inside </italic>cleanliness and purity of the home and the <italic>outside</italic> dirtiness, disorder, and chaos of the yard and larger world. The garage may also serve as a liminal way-station between ‘clean’ and ‘dirty’ in other ways. For example garbage and other forms of debris may be stored there prior to final disposition. Objects, animals, and persons soiled with mud, sweat, toxic chemicals, and feces are often required to ‘pass through’ a cleaning process in the garage prior to entering the house proper. Animals associated with dirt or pollution may be kept in the garage. Tools, equipment, and chemical supplies used ‘outside’ to maintain the lawn or to service dirty machinery – e.g. cars, lawn mowers – are typically kept in the garage to avoid bringing their ‘disorder’ into the house.</p>
<p>Items that have no ‘regular’ place in the house – and are therefore chaotic or disordered – are often placed in the garage until a suitable spot is found for them (which may never occur). Unwanted gifts, failed production efforts, and items needing repair or refurbishment are also stored there, because they are similarly ‘disordered’. Items selected to be donated to charity or given away to strangers are often stored in the garage, which serves as a <italic>halfway house</italic>. Or if the item is to be ‘trashed’, the garage may serve as a <italic>hospice</italic> as the object passes from a ‘living’ possession to a ‘dead’ piece of junk. We examine each of these roles below.</p>
<sec id="section12-1470593112457736">
<title>Hospice</title>
<p>The garage may serve as a hospice when it becomes the temporary resting area for items on their way to final disposition, i.e. possession ‘death’. In these cases, we propose that the consumer feels the emotional need to let the object pass through a transformation from useful to not-useful prior to ultimately ‘letting it go.’ Perhaps time is needed to review the life of the object, appreciating the services it provided, until finally acknowledging that it has been appropriately mourned. In some, instances, as shown below, this mourning/disposing process may be undertaken periodically and with little regret.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I do what I call ‘surveying with extreme prejudice’ from time to time. I look at things lying around [the garage] that I haven’t used for awhile or maybe someone left here … and I’ll lay them at the bottom of the driveway. (Hannon)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In other cases, the owner may be hoping that someone else may ‘do the dirty work’ of removing the unwanted item:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>All of the NASCAR items were given to my father by a good friend … [but] my father does not like NASCAR and would like to get rid of the stuff … They are now right next to the garage door and my father said, ‘Hopefully somebody steals them soon. (Petrusinski)</p>

<title>A place for dirty but useful objects</title>
<p>The garage – with its liminal status between inside and outside – also serves as an appropriate place for ‘dirty/chaotic’ items that are considered intrinsically valuable or that have potential utility remaining:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>How do you decide which items you will put in the garage?</p>
<p>Well [we put in] things that <italic>don’t belong in the house</italic> like a gas can, beach chairs … the vacuum cleaner, his power tools, a trash can and a recycling can. (LaCoste) </p>
<p>We put things in the garage that are <italic>going to be used outside </italic>… Rakes and shovels … bikes, skateboards. (Ludlow)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Here the respondents seem to have a clear set of rules for placing certain things inside the house, while others are stored in the garage. The rules appear to be: items that collect or accumulate dirt (vacuum cleaners), or are placed in dirt (beach chairs, shovels), or are used on dirt (e.g. bikes) are not to be stored in the house. Items that have potentially dangerous chemicals/oils (e.g. power tools, gas cans) are associated with another kind of ‘dirt’, i.e. poison, and are also often kept out of the household.</p>
<p>Further, because of its liminal location between order and chaos, the garage may experience polluting seepage from the ‘outside’, which has to be periodically cleansed:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I have to clean [the garage], because it’s connected to the family room. So I have to sweep it … keep it clean … take out birds’ and hornets’ nests … Many insects come in, so I have to keep the windows clean. (Ludlow)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Further, when items inside the home become ‘disordered’, they are moved to the garage. Anything that clutters my house gets removed, and it gets thrown out here [garage]. (Summerville)</p>
<p>The garage may serve as a burial ground for items that for various reasons cannot be fully discarded, but are not wanted by the family:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>So what’s stored on the bottom in there [a cabinet in the garage] is a wedding gift. Aunt Millicent and Uncle Lee gave that to us as a wedding gift. [‘When was that?’] Thirty years ago. (Samsel)</p>
<p>The pig lived in the house for about 7 to 8 years; then my wife got new floors. Pee Wee [the pig] was scratching up the floors, so she decided to put him in the garage … He spent the better part of his life there. (Nycz)</p>

<sec id="section14-1470593112457736">
<title>Wilderness and chaos</title>
<p>In some extreme cases, the garage may become so defiled by dirt and disorder that it loses its liminal status (between clean and dirty) and descends fully into a state of chaos. In these instances, we found that unwanted items simply are taken out of the house and cast into the wilderness of the garage. The garage space becomes equated with a lawless, chaotic territory where ‘anything goes’ both literally and figuratively:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I wanted the garage to be real nice, not the way you see it … but I started piling things around the car. (Husband whose garage is now completely full of trash)</p>
<p>When we first started putting stuff in the garage, we had some order, but now we just throw stuff in there and there’s no order. (Davis)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In these cases it is only the hidden nature of things in the garage and its physical separation from the household interior that keeps the family from descending into a state of deviant disorder as judged by neighbors and even clinicians (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470593112457736">Coulter and Ligas, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470593112457736">Frost and Steketee, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Conceptual model</title>
<sec id="section16-1470593112457736">
<title>Liminality as a mixed-state, dynamic phenomenon</title>
<p>We now put forward a conceptual model grounded in these empirical findings. We propose that Turner’s conception of liminality – as a transitional movement from one status to another – is a special case of Douglas’s (1966) model of dirt as ‘matter out of place.’ Douglas made a key observation in her analysis of the Jewish dietary laws put forward in Deuteronomy and Leviticus. She noted that the foods forbidden to Jews were those that <italic>combined aspects from two different categories</italic>, creating uncertainty and categorical ‘chaos.’ Consider the rules regarding dietary consumption:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>These are the living things which ye may eat among all the beasts of the earth. Whatsoever has a cloven hoof and cheweth the cud, that may ye eat … Ye shall not eat of them that chew only the cud or of them that only have a cloven hoof. The camel, because he cheweth the cud but hath not a cloven hoof, he is unclean to you … And the swine, because he hath a cloven-hoof, but cheweth not the cud, he is unclean unto you. Of that flesh ye shall not eat. (Deuteronomy 11:2, 3, 7)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Similarly, Leviticus forbids the eating of creatures (such as squid and crabs) which dwell in the sea, but do not have scales. Thus, entities which display mixed characteristics and which therefore resist categorization into clear or ‘clean’ groups present a problem to the human mind, according to Douglas, and this calls out for cultural resolution. In the case of the spatial area represented by the American garage, items are stored here and activities are conducted here that are somehow intermediate or mixed in their cultural status, leading to difficulty in classifying them. Because they <italic>combine</italic> elements of order and disorder, structure and anti-structure, and cleanliness and dirtiness, they must be kept in a spatial area which exhibits these same mixed-statuses. The nature and functions of the garage as a liminal space are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470593112457736">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>We now more fully develop this model of liminality using the findings of the present study. We start with one of the emergent findings – the gendered nature of the garage. Men are culturally viewed as having traits that are both civilized and wild; they engage in administrative and intellectual pursuits, but they also engage in risky and physically violent behaviors (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470593112457736">Belk and Costa, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470593112457736">Holt and Thompson, 2004</xref>). Therefore they often are seen as being closer to nature than culture. But men in domestic contexts, such as families, necessarily take on certain aspects of culture as well. As a result, men may be culturally classified as ‘mixed-state beings’; they then are seen as belonging appropriately to the liminal realm of the garage.</p>
<p>Here they are free to engage in their more disordered activities, e.g. fixing cars, drinking alcohol, working with power tools, hitting punching bags, and storing deer meat. The garage provides them with an intermediate space between clean (the house proper) and dirty (the yard, outside world). It is in the garage that ‘men can be men’, most strongly separating themselves from the civilized, orderly, clean, and structured (feminine) domain of the house, while still ‘being with’ the family.</p>
<p>Items used in the past, but no longer currently useful, also possess a mixed status between being valuable and being worthless. They once had functional value, but no longer do; yet some of their original value may still linger, hence they are not discarded, at least not until it is determined that their utility has been completely depleted. By contrast, items that are believed to have completely discharged their value are removed from the garage and discarded – unless the garage itself has become equated with complete chaos/dirt/disorder, in which case they may be effectively buried there.</p>
<p>Items intended for future use are stored in the garage, because they also exhibit a mixed state – they have potential value, but it has yet to be proven or accessed. Thus they are stored in the garage in the hope that their value can be shifted from potential to active status. Items such as insecticides, cleaning chemicals, and garden tools are kept in the garage because they are partially dirty, yet used to maintain order and cleanliness or to produce useful foods for the family. For example roach spray kills the fully-dirty roach, thus preserving the cleanliness of the home. Yet to kill the roach, the insecticide must, itself, contain pollution and impurity. Similarly, the garden hoe is used to cultivate dirt – transforming its nutrients into ‘pure’ food (e.g. tomatoes) or ‘pure’ beauty (e.g. roses) – but becomes soiled in the process of enacting the transformation of ‘dirt’ to ‘order’. Similarly, tools such as hammers, paint brushes, and screwdrivers are used to create or restore order in the household, but ‘lose’ their purity in the process. Thus they must be stored in the garage.</p>
<p>Useful items from the home that become soiled in the outside world (i.e. which have become partially disordered, e.g. muddy shoes) must be left to reside in the garage until they can be cleaned, i.e. have their dirt/disorder removed), and then brought into the house once restored to their clean state. Items so thoroughly soiled or depleted that their ability to become ‘clean’ or useful is completely destroyed are removed from the garage and relegated to the outside world of chaos and disorder (e.g. they are taken to the dump, set outside the garage to be picked up as garbage, and so forth).</p>
<p>In this formulation it is implicit that the house itself is the sanctum sanctorum – the sacred space that should not be defiled. As objects that once resided in this sacred space lose their sacred status they shift to a liminal category of meaning and are placed in a correspondingly liminal space. They thus become suspended in both space and time as they move from one category of meaning to another.</p>
<p>The physical properties of the garage itself communicate its role as a liminal space. First, it is usually connected to or nearby the house, but separated by a sturdy door – usually one that locks, so that a definite boundary is established between the garage and the house. Yet the garage also possesses a second strong door, often one that locks, to separate it from the outside world. In this way potential intruders – both human and animal – are blocked from entering the house; the garage serves as a physical ‘buffer zone’ between danger and safety, between wild and tame, between inside and outside.</p>
<p>In keeping with this interpretation, the floor and walls of the garage are usually less ‘precious’ and ‘delicate’ than those of the house. They are rougher, often unfinished and unpainted; they may become stained, nicked, or dirtied without large concern on the part of the family. The garage floor is often hard and functional (usually concrete) and permitted to become stained. Conversely, the fully inside walls and floors of the home proper are softer, more finely finished, and covered with more expensive materials. The colors used inside the home are also more consciously chosen and applied. The colors found in the garage are usually bland, irrelevant to the family’s tastes, and often chosen for their durability and ability to withstand stains.</p>
<p>Lighting in the garage is usually dimmer than in the house and light fixtures are uncovered and chosen for utility. Most garages are either unheated/uncooled or only partially heated/cooled. Their temperature is permitted to vary more with the changes of the season, i.e. outside, whereas temperatures inside the home are maintained within a much narrower range – usually varying only 10 to 20 degrees across the course of a year. Thus the temperature of the garage is intermediate between that of outdoors and indoors.</p>
<p>The garage might almost be thought of as a purposely semi-civilized space – an atavistic remnant of the time when humans lived in rough shelters or caves together with their animals, un-refrigerated foodstuffs subject to spoilage, weapons, firewood, debris from hunts, scraps from earlier meals, scraps from the production of stone and metal tools, ceramic vessels, and so forth. Perhaps the garage and similar liminal spaces are Neolithic remnants that have survived into the modern day, because humans <italic>require</italic> a place to engage in primitive activities, because men <italic>require</italic> a space in which to engage in violent and dirty forms of production, and because we now accumulate so many things over the course of our long lives that are neither fully here or there, useful or useless, wanted or unwanted, clean or dirty, inside or outside, that liminal spaces are as much a necessity of ‘civilized’ life as they were at our species’ origins.</p>
<p>Turner implicitly understood this, as did Douglas. What they did not fully theorize, however, is that over the course of our contemporary lives, objects now have the probability of passing through multiple valenced states and require a suitable place in which to make these transitions. Because humans are <italic>capable of comprehending </italic>such changes and mixtures of states and status, rather than just perceiving themselves and their objects in polarized terms, they feel more emotionally comfortable having places where these mixed- and shifting-state objects (and selves) can reside. This, we propose, is the cultural essence of the garage and other liminal areas in Western societies. We hypothesize that similar liminal spaces will be present in or around all places of human habitation.</p>
<p>Additional studies are required to confirm, disconfirm or transform this proposal. For example the spaces of the attic and cellar or basement also serve as storage locales in many cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470593112457736">Bachelard, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470593112457736">Korosec-Serfaty, 1984</xref>), but because these spaces occupy separate levels within the habitable sacred space of the home, they are less liminal than the garages we have studied here. We believe that homes in other affluent cultures – those in which objects are collected over a lifetime and passed across generations – also must have liminal spaces, although the location of these spaces may well differ from that of the American garage (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470593112457736">Daniels, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470593112457736">Houston, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, we propose that a fully functional theory of socio-cultural liminality must necessarily combine the dynamic properties inherent in the Turner model with the pure and intermediate states proposed in the Douglas model. The model we put forward conceptualizes liminal objects and places in terms of their perceived functional utility, their perceived emotional value, their perceived purity, and their sacredness.</p>
