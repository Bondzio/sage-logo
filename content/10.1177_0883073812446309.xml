<abstract>
<p>We present a 4-year-old Honduran boy with mild neurodevelopmental delays, growth delays, dysmorphic features, and small genitalia. Chromosome analysis initially revealed a single X chromosome and a marker chromosome derived from the short arm of chromosome 9 which was consistent with Turner syndrome as only 1 sex chromosome could be identified. However, on further analysis, he was found to have an unbalanced translocation involving the short arm of chromosome 9 and the long arm of the Y chromosome. The translocation resulted in partial trisomy 9p and partial monosomy Yq. The patient’s clinical features are felt to be the result of partial trisomy 9p. In addition, partial monosomy Yq is associated with male infertility. Testing of the patient’s parents was normal, indicating this was a de novo translocation. Additional evaluations of this child and his parents allowed an accurate assessment of his diagnosis, long-term prognosis, and chance of recurrence.</p>

<p>Unbalanced chromosome translocations can be associated with a variety of clinical features depending on the size of the imbalances and which chromosomes are involved. Chromosome translocations involving the long arm of the Y chromosome and the short arm of chromosome 9 are uncommon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812446309">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812446309"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812446309"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812446309">4</xref></sup> There has been 1 previous report known to the authors of an individual with an unbalanced translocation resulting in partial trisomy 9p and partial monosomy Yq.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812446309">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Trisomy 9p is relatively common with greater than 150 reports of partial/complete trisomy 9p.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812446309">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812446309">6</xref></sup> Characteristic clinical features include growth delays, intellectual disability, and microcephaly.

<p>We describe a patient with an unbalanced Y;9 chromosome translocation resulting in partial trisomy 9p and partial monosomy Yq. The patient’s clinical features, including mild to moderate neurodevelopmental delays, are felt to be primarily due to partial trisomy 9p.</p>
<sec id="section1-0883073812446309">
<title>Case Report</title>
<p>Our patient is a 4-year-old Honduran boy with a history of neurodevelopmental delays. He was born at term to a 14-year-old gravida 1, para 0, abortus 0 mother after an uncomplicated pregnancy. His birth weight was 2.9 kg (15th percentile). There were no complications during labor or delivery.</p>
<p>Psychomotor development has always been delayed with language development more significantly affected than motor development. He walked at 18 months and spoke his first words at 4 years. He now uses single words. He currently runs and jumps without obvious motor abnormalities. He is not toilet trained. The past medical history is significant for swallowing problems and possible hearing loss. He is the only child of his parents. He has a maternal cousin with speech and motor delays. There is no family history of intellectual disability, recurrent miscarriages, genetic syndromes, or consanguinity.</p>
<p>The patient had a weight of 11.8 kg (less than 3rd percentile, 50th percentile for a 19-month-old), height of 91 cm (less than 3rd percentile, 50th percentile for a 2.5-year-old) and head circumference of 48.5 cm (3rd percentile). Physical examination revealed unfurled helices, arched eyebrows, long palpebral fissures, deep-set eyes, epicanthal folds, downturned corners of the mouth with an open mouth expression, and dental caries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812446309">Figures 1A</xref> and B). In addition, he had fifth finger clinodactyly and small genitalia with testes descended bilaterally. He was alert with normal behavior and mood. Cranial nerves II-VI, XI, and XII were intact. He had mild generalized facial hypotonia and was tentative with swallowing water. He had relatively normal muscle bulk, strength, and tone with no evidence of asymmetry. Gait was normal. There was no ataxia or abnormal movements. Deep tendon reflexes were within normal limits in all limbs. Babinski reflex was negative bilaterally. Exteroceptive sensation was normal.</p>

</fig>
<p>A renal ultrasound performed because of small genitalia was normal. Owing to concerns for possible Williams syndrome, he had a cardiac evaluation with an electrocardiogram that was normal. Neurodevelopmental testing using the Developmental Assessment of Young Children (DAYC) revealed a general quotient of 62 (mild to moderate mixed delays with cognition 50, communication 55, adaptive behavior 80, and physical development 86).</p>
<p>Cytogenetic analysis initially revealed a karyotype of 46,X,+mar.ish der (9). This result was consistent with monosomy X and a marker chromosome derived from the short arm of chromosome 9. Our patient was not felt to have clinical features of Turner syndrome as he was phenotypically male. As a result, further cytogenetic analyses were performed. Fluorescent in situ hybridization studies identified 1 X chromosome and 1 copy of the <italic>SRY</italic> gene, indicating the presence of a male sexual constitution. Additional fluorescent in situ hybridization studies specific for chromosome 9 revealed that the marker chromosome was derived from the short arm of chromosome 9, indicating that the patient has partial trisomy 9p. A fluorescent in situ hybridization probe specific for Yq12 revealed a deletion consistent with partial monosomy Yq. The karyotype was revised after further analysis to 46,X,der(Y)t(Y;9)(q11.21;p13.3). This result was consistent with the presence of a derivative Y chromosome from an unbalanced translocation involving the long arm of the Y chromosome and the short arm of chromosome 9 that led to the loss of Yq11.21qter and trisomy for 9p13.3pter.</p>
<p>High-resolution chromosome analysis was normal for the patient’s parents. Interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization studies on the patient’s father revealed a normal pattern for chromosomes Y and 9.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A chromosome abnormality was suspected in our patient because of neurodevelopmental delays, growth delays, and dysmorphic features. Our patient’s initial karyotype revealed monosomy X along with a marker chromosome from the short arm of chromosome 9. As our patient has a male phenotype without clinical features of Turner syndrome, additional cytogenetic studies were performed and identified Y chromosome material with partial monosomy for Yq along with extra material from chromosome 9 consistent with partial trisomy 9p. This demonstrates the importance of comparing the results of cytogenetic studies with the clinical features of the patient. If there is uncertainty about the cytogenetic results or a discrepancy between the results and the clinical phenotype, additional testing such as fluorescent in situ hybridization studies should be performed. Chromosomal microarray analysis should also be considered as it has been shown to be useful in the identification of marker chromosomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812446309">9</xref></sup> However, developing countries are at a disadvantage in obtaining the most sophisticated genetic testing.</p>
<p>Unbalanced chromosome translocations involving Yq and 9p rarely have been reported. Three cases were associated with sex reversal because of partial monosomy of distal 9p resulting in deletion of the <italic>DMRT1</italic> gene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812446309">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812446309"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812446309">3</xref></sup> Two of the cases also had interstitial duplications of 9p resulting in clinical features of partial trisomy 9p.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812446309">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812446309">3</xref></sup> Our patient had partial trisomy 9p without deletion of distal 9p. Although he has small genitalia, he does not exhibit impaired sexual differentiation as seen with the cases associated with loss of distal 9p.</p>
<p>Typical manifestations of trisomy 9p include intellectual disability, growth delays, and dysmorphic facial features, but presentations vary depending on the size of the trisomic segments involved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812446309">6</xref></sup> A previous case of trisomy 9p and partial monosomy Yq was reported with clinical features attributed to trisomy 9p.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812446309">4</xref></sup> We feel that our patient’s clinical features, including neurodevelopmental delays (language&gt;motor), growth delays, and dysmorphic features (deep-set eyes, downturned corners of the mouth, clinodactyly), are primarily due to partial trisomy 9p.</p>
<p>Partial monosomy Yq is most consistently associated with infertility due to impaired spermatogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812446309">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812446309">8</xref></sup> Short stature and small gonads have also been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812446309">8</xref></sup> Our patient’s growth delays are most likely related to partial trisomy 9p but may also be influenced by partial monosomy Yq. In addition, he has small genitalia that may be related to partial monosomy Yq.</p>
<p>When an individual is found to have an unbalanced chromosome translocation, genetic counseling of the family is important to accurately discuss recurrence risks. Our patient is unlikely to father children as the majority of males are infertile.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812446309">8</xref></sup> If the patient’s unbalanced Y;9 translocation was inherited, his unaffected father would be expected to carry a balanced Y;9 translocation. This would confer certain gender-specific outcomes for his offspring, including unbalanced translocations associated with neurodevelopmental delays and dysmorphism. In our case, testing of the patient’s parents was normal, which indicates a low chance for the family to have another child with a Y;9 translocation. Normal chromosomal testing of the parents allowed an accurate assessment of the final diagnosis, long-term prognosis, and detailed genetic counseling to this family with regard to the chance of recurrence.</p>
