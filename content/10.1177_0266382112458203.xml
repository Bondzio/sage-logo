<abstract>
<p>The number of integrated services or tools designed to characterize value and enhance the output of legal practitioners’ workflow is growing, not least because information service providers need to differentiate between themselves and their nearest competitors. In addition, legal services are under pressure to provide a more efficient and speedy service to clients. Legal citation tools and checkers are one of the aids rapidly increasing in sophisticated functionality. This article briefly reviews some of the major citation tools available, and focuses on one in particular, LexisCheck, as an example of a tool that brings together most of the desired functionality of a true citation checker.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The legal services market is subject to as much flux as any other kind of business in the modern economy – alternative business structures, alternative fee arrangements, mergers and acquisitions, improved or restructured practice management – all aimed at driving for efficiencies in the market. Transformative technology is also playing a significant role, presenting the information industry – both providers and consumers – with a wealth of opportunities for those willing to embrace change.</p>
<p>For information providers to the legal services market, part of the response to this trend has been a profusion of tools released by major information providers in recent years, most aimed at simplifying or increasing the speed of access to relevant legal information, as well as helping to make legal research more comprehensive and ensure its accuracy. Some providers are also developing integrated tools that enhance lawyers’ output during the document drafting or review process.</p>
<p>Almost all legal information providers, from LexisNexis, Westlaw, Thomson Reuters, Bloomberg BNA, and PLC, to name the major players, have released or improved tools in recent years to support the need for efficiency and workflow collaboration tools, especially designed to speed up the drafting or review process for lawyers. One of the tools most commonly offered is a citation analysis tool or checker. LexisNexis, Westlaw, Bloomberg BNA, Wolters Kluwer and Justis all supply some form of legal citation tool. Others like MicroSystems are working on similar tools with varying capabilities, such as EagleEye, an ‘agreement checker’.</p>
<p>This article highlights one of the specific tools in the market for enhancing the drafting and review tasks lawyers frequently undertake as an essential part of their jobs. Citation checkers are used in managing legal citations, as opposed to bibliographic management or article citation tools such as EndNote, RefWorks or Reference Manager.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0266382112458203">
<title>Why citation tools?</title>
<p>As much of a lawyer’s work is based on precedent, citation tools are particularly important for the legal profession. These precedents, often decided in court cases or laid down in legislation, are frequently referenced in legal writing to support points of law being made in the documents or agreements. All lawyers and PSLs (Professional Support Lawyers) use legal citations, and for them it is important to know whether a citation is accurate and reliable. Citation tools, to varying degrees, will identify or check legal citation references for accuracy in spelling or format, and depending on sophistication, also give status information as to whether the citations are still ‘good law’ or not. Thus a citation tool helps to simultaneously address two of the top strategic concerns of law firms – risk management (covering the concern that good law is being cited), and cost efficiency (as a result of the time saved in using a citation checker rather than a manual process).</p>
<p>Some citation tools or checkers will automatically work over external documents (such as LexisCheck and Westlaw’s BriefTools or WestCheck), but most work within the proprietary database to which they are linked and will check a single citation within a search box, or a Table of Authorities or other list created manually.</p>
<p>

<p>To be of any significant use to lawyers, citation tools, however basic, should include the following essential features:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>ability to identify a legal citation either in a document or in a separate search field;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>ability to show discrepancy in what is cited and what the citation might be (i.e. ‘spell-check’ a citation);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>ability to link to full text of cited references;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>legal status indicator of citation references.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Anything else, such as a status indicator, automatic scan of documents or ‘auto-correct’ insertion of text (see comparative table of features below) can be considered a competitive advantage for a provider.</p>
<p>Most citation tools are available as software downloads. Unique amongst them, Lexis®Check requires a technical installation. Lexis retains this feature partly in response to security concerns of law firms and to ensure that the actual document in draft or review does not leave the client environment; only the citations are recorded and cross-checked in the LexisLibrary content.</p>
<p>Whilst the capabilities of these named citation tools are similar in many respects, they also have significant differences. Indeed Bloomberg referred to BCite when it was renamed and relaunched in mid-2011 as ‘one of only three major US legal citators’. Whilst the other two citators were not named, the geographical perspective of tools is important, as apart from the Justis offering, LexisCheck appears to be the first citation checker developed completely from a UK/European law perspective, rather than a ‘UK conversion’ of an existing US service such as KeyCite. Hence the difference between it and Shepard’s citation service from the same company. The main tools available in the UK, in addition to LexisCheck, are KeyCite on Westlaw, JustCite on Justis and GlobalCite on LoisLaw Connect.</p>
<p>Other rudimentary citators, such as Fastcase, CiteIt and even Google Scholar exist, which enable automatic location of other cases in their (or third party) databases. While these may not be comprehensive citators, they do make it easy to locate cases that cite your case, and perhaps find additional cases at no charge.</p>

<sec id="section3-0266382112458203">
<title>KeyCite/BriefTools/WestCheck/Justcite/GlobalCite/EagleEye/Citrus</title>
<p>The features provided by the major players in the general legal citation sphere are summarized below.</p>
<sec id="section4-0266382112458203">
<title>KeyCite</title>
<p>
<italic>KeyCite</italic> is West Group’s citation research service available through its Westlaw legal database. It tells you whether case, legislation or regulation references are ‘good law’. KeyCite provides links to other cases, administrative decisions and secondary sources within Westlaw that mention or discuss the cited references. It is available in the Westlaw UK service to work over UK and EU content.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0266382112458203">
<title>BriefTools</title>
<p>
<italic>BriefTools</italic> is a citation checking software application controlled from within MS Word or Corel WordPerfect and works with WestlawNext to verify good law. It is available at this time only via the Westlaw.com (i.e. US) service. BriefTools allows the status of cited cases, statutes, regulations, to be viewed instantly and linked to the full text documents on Westlaw. It also monitors the status of citations within your document. One can manually insert KeyCite status flags and create links from the full text documents on Westlaw (LexisCheck inserts status indicators automatically when you check citations).</p>
<p>Tables of Authorities are achieved using a separate tool – WestCite Advisor, but all these tools are available in the West Solutions Toolbar. (In LexisCheck, these different functionalities are integrated into the one tool.)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0266382112458203">
<title>WestCheck</title>
<p>
<italic>WestCheck</italic> is a web-based application also from the Westlaw US stable, that automatically extracts citations and quotations from word processing documents and checks them for accuracy against KeyCite and WestlawNext (the next generation service) or Westlaw Classic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0266382112458203">
<title>JustCite</title>
<p>
<italic>JustCite</italic> is a citation searching tool from Justis Publishing. It enables searching across a variety of online legal databases, including LexisLibrary, Westlaw, Lawtel, BAILLI, and others including both paid for and free. It markets itself as ‘one tool to search them all’, and shows the relationship between legal documents by answering such questions as which cases have interpreted particular legislative provisions, and how have subsequent cases dealt with a cited case or links to journal articles about a case.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0266382112458203">
<title>GlobalCite</title>
<p>
<italic>GlobalCite</italic> is software that runs across Wolters Kluwer’s LoisLaw Connect database to identify where cases or legislation have been cited. It aids in determining whether retrieved case law or legislation is still good law, and is available as a pop-up button whenever a user retrieves the full text of a case, statute, act or regulation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0266382112458203">
<title>EagleEye</title>
<p>The <italic>EagleEye</italic> agreement checker automates the review of defined terms, inconsistent phrases, references and punctuations in legal agreements to ensure completeness, accuracy, consistency and lack of ambiguity. In this regard, it is more of a ‘terms and phrases’ checker than a citation checker. According to the provider, MicroSystems, it improves the transactional document drafting and review process, reducing the risk of human error. EagleEye functionality integrates into the MS Word ribbon.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0266382112458203">
<title>Citrus</title>
<p>
<italic>Citrus</italic> legal citation software, by CorrectCite, works with Microsoft Word (2003, 2007, 2010) to format and correct citations as you work on your legal writing. It will also create Tables of Authority and Tables of Contents. It works on US Bluebook legal citations, but does not check the status of citations it finds.</p>

<title>LexisCheck</title>
<p>Whilst this article is not intended as a rigorous and deep comparative analysis of the tools available, it explores the features of LexisCheck in some depth below, as this tool appears to include most of the desired functionality required for citation checking and drafting. It also provides for automatic scanning of a complete document, rather than requiring manual insertions to check case or legislation citations. This feature is essential to its mission of enhancing lawyers’ efficiency and speeding up the workflow process. LexisCheck is, in fact, the result of a partnership with Osborne Clarke, ensuring that the product was designed by lawyers, for lawyers.</p>
<sec id="section12-0266382112458203">
<title>Key features – citation checking</title>
<p>LexisCheck automates the process of checking citations as part of the document drafting or review process. It simplifies the practice of law in eliminating the tedious task of manual checking of citations.</p>
<p>The software automatically locates and validates legal references in documents being worked on to check these have not been superseded by later judgments or legislation. It uses the latest technology combined with Lexis®Library content to automatically find legal citations and show you their current legal status through a simple ‘traffic-light system’. These status indicators are similar to the US Shepard’s signals. The application thus automatically validates all legal references against the content source Lexis®Library, to ensure they have not been superseded by more recent judgments or legislation. It highlights and directly links to further information on citations that require lawyer review in newly drafted documents, both in web and PDF, archived client files and web content, and can be used also for know-how, third party documents, and web content. Law firms use LexisCheck to highlight changes in documents that may require a review of a client’s situation – and to ensure that the basis of their advice is sound. LexisNexis launched version 4.0 of LexisCheck in July 2011, which extended the checker from Word and Web documents to PDF documents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0266382112458203">
<title>Key features – document management and review</title>
<p>In addition, because LexisCheck appears directly in the toolbar of whatever application you are in – MS Word, Adobe Reader &amp; Acrobat, and Internet Explorer, it, along with its nearest rival, BriefTools, is more of a document review tool than any of the other competitor citators which can only be used if you are signed in to the provider’s online platform. LexisCheck will work independently of a subscription to the Lexis online research product; however, for a subscriber, an added benefit is the ability to link seamlessly to the Lexis®Library database.</p>
<p>LexisCheck is available in two forms – LexisCheck <italic>Desktop</italic> and LexisCheck <italic>Monitor</italic>. Whilst Desktop is a one-click application at the user level that appears as a toolbar while you draft documents in Word, scan PDF documents or search the Web (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266382112458203">Figure 1</xref>), LexisCheck Monitor integrates seamlessly with either Interwoven or MS SharePoint document management systems to keep the document bank up to date with changes in the law.</p>
<fig id="fig1-0266382112458203" position="float">
<label>Figure 1.</label>
<caption>
<p>Toolbar buttons in MS Word.</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0266382112458203-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In brief, Monitor works with your document management system:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>to analyze and monitor internal documents for changes in the law;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>to alert you when your documents are affected by changes, and showing the impact of these changes.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>It will actively monitor any documents you choose, meaning that different groups or individuals can monitor different sets of documents and receive individual alerts. Like Desktop, Monitor works in Word and Web documents, as well as any PDF documents contained in a document management system.</p>
<p>Due to the way PDF documents open on the Web, LexisCheck cannot directly process a PDF document attachment on the web, as it treats the open attachment as viewed through a web page. It can however process any case and legislation citations found on the open web. PDF documents on the web need to be saved locally and opened via Adobe Reader to be processed by LexisCheck.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0266382112458203">
<title>Key features – simplicity</title>
<p>The simplicity of the tool in comparison with others is attractive. Its integration within a Word, Web or PDF toolbar, means it requires very little training. One simply clicks on the LexisCheck button and follows the prompts. This makes it ideally suited to speedy use – users do not need to be expert searchers of Lexis®Library to be able to use LexisCheck to review references. In fact, one of the ‘tips’ for lawyers needing to hurriedly find a reference to law is that LexisCheck can be a ‘short-cut’ means to searching for a case or legislation on LexisLibrary. Simply open up a Word document and type in as much of the case name or legislation you can remember.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0266382112458203">
<title>Key features – technical</title>
<p>The one major difference between LexisCheck and the other major tools (KeyCite, JustCite and BCite) is, as mentioned previously, that it is application software that does need to be installed, rather than available as a web download or integrated button within a research database. As an ‘external’ application, LexisCheck is fully compatible with desktops from XP up to and including Windows 7, as well as offering integration with document management systems such as Interwoven. Full SharePoint compatibility is anticipated during the course of 2012.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0266382112458203">
<title>LexisCheck – advantages</title>
<p>LexisCheck helps speed up the process and ensure the highest degree of accuracy whether advising clients on the law or on the strength of their legal case, performing complex legal research or negotiating a settlement with opposing counsel. LexisCheck analyzes and monitors internal documents for changes in the law and alerts information professionals when their documents are affected by changes. This means legal professionals can confidently draft, reuse and review work to meet clients’ needs more effectively and create new documents quickly. In essence, it acts like a sophisticated ‘spell-check’ for legal professionals. According to LexisNexis, the application is more useful for professionals than real-time news alerts of changes in a statute. ‘Professionals need not remember to bookmark or save the changes and refer back to it when they need it. LexisCheck alerts them to the changes while they are on a particular document and immediately informs them about the changes in content, saving them time’.</p>
<p>One of the advantages for PDF integration (currently only available with LexisCheck) is the way it has lent itself to the work preferences of the Bar. Barristers have found this capability to be beneficial in the following tasks:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Quickly reviewing their (or opposing counsel’s) skeleton arguments to ensure cited law is accurate.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Using the in-built legal ‘spell-check’ functionality to correctly cite the relevant authorities.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Ensuring accuracy when submitting documents to court, in order to avoid the potential embarrassment of referencing out of date law.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Rapidly identifying citations and assist in creating a Table of Authorities.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Creating court bundles by using LexisCheck to instantly provide links to the correct content.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>For technical authors or writers of books on the law, the tools mean they can ensure swiftly that their writing is accurate and up to date</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0266382112458203">
<title>Differences between LexisCheck and other citation checkers for UK law</title>
<p>With the Westlaw applications for checking citations, one needs to toggle between several tools to get the full range of checks such as status, accuracy, spell-check and monitoring available in LexisCheck. This requires many more manual clicks and operations to reach the same goal. BriefTools provides citation-checking and file retrieving capabilities in your document. CiteAdvisor identifies citations in your legal document, suggests the correct citation format if necessary, and creates a formatted Table of Authorities. WestCheck verifies and checks citations extracted from your legal document or citations in a list you create manually.</p>
<p>BriefTools and WestCheck are only available on US Westlaw. When drafting or reviewing documents with BriefTools, flags for case and legislation citation status and links to full-text on Westlaw is a manual process. LexisCheck does this automatically. To see status indicators in your document you simply run the LexisCheck process with one hit of a button and they are all shown automatically in a pane that ‘sits’ on top of your document. Nothing is inserted in the document until the lawyer has verified it.</p>
<p>The ‘Monitor’ feature is also automatic in LexisCheck upon installation of the product, though this capability is available as an ‘add-on’ subscription.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0266382112458203">
<title>Benefits of citation tools for lawyers and for professional support or information specialists</title>
<p>There are many benefits of using citation tools. For the simple reason that the principles of law are based on precedent, and that the law changes, one common benefit of all these citation tools is that they show a researcher the history of their cited cases or legislation. Citation tools help with a lawyer’s professional responsibility to be thorough in their research and ensure that the authorities they cite are still ‘good law’ in order to avoid the professional embarrassment of citing out of date references. Some tools, like LexisCheck, which works directly and automatically within your own documents on Word, Web or PDF, take the hard work out of the tedious and manual process of updating citations, carrying out the process in minutes, thus making lawyers more efficient and freeing them up for more valuable work. In the context of the Legal Services Act and alternative fee structures, this is a compelling reason to use citation tools.</p>
<p>Citation tools are great practice management aids. In addition to increasing productivity, by dramatically reducing the time it takes to check legal references, lawyers (especially trainees or those one or two year qualified) are able to expand their legal research capabilities by illustrating the importance of checking citations. Good training that becomes habitual through continued use.</p>
<p>Most important of all in terms of practice management is that citation tools help manage risk for the law firm, ensuring the accuracy of any documentation sent to a client or created for internal use.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0266382112458203">
<title>Conclusion and possible future direction</title>
<p>The environmental and regulatory change pressures on law firms posed by the Legal Services Act 2007 mean that they are seeking to be as efficient as possible in providing client services, and that they wish to do so with reduced risk exposure. Any tools that can help to facilitate these goals will find a receptive welcome. Information providers are moving more and more into technology applications that deliver tools right into the work processes of lawyers and associates, professional support lawyers and information professionals. Developments range from enhanced citation tools such as here described and other ‘killer apps’, to partnerships with web and search engine development companies, e.g. LexisNexis with Microsoft.
