<abstract>
<p>It is well established that incumbents win reelection at high rates. But we know less about the ways in which institutional variation affects the incumbency advantage. Using data from more than 4,000 cities, evidence in this article indicates that institutions generating low-participation environments increase the proportion of city council incumbents who run for reelection and the proportion who win. These low-turnout environments are shown to have spending patterns that benefit particular subgroups in the population who have good reason to participate even when the costs are high.</p>

<p>Current office holders at all levels of government seek and win reelection at high rates. City councilors, like their counterparts in state legislatures and in Congress, benefit from this incumbency advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078087412463536">Trounstine 2011</xref>). This may be a sign of a healthy democracy. Constituents, pleased with the experience and performance of their representatives, reward elected officials with additional terms of office. But an alternative possibility exists. In some cases, incumbents may be advantaged in securing reelection because they benefit from institutional rules that insulate their power. In these contexts, constituents may lack meaningful representation.</p>
<p>In this article, city council elections are used to investigate the relationship between institutions, reelection, and responsiveness. The analyses reveal that certain institutions create low-turnout environments and are associated with increased reelection rates for city councilors and decreased responsiveness to the general electorate. The article begins by reviewing a small slice of the vast literature on institutions and incumbency. Institutions that may affect the probability of reelection are discussed, with a focus on those that decrease participation in elections. Next, the data are described, and the analyses presented. The results show that low-turnout institutions are associated with an increase in the proportion of city council incumbents who run for reelection and the proportion who win. Cities with low-turnout environments have spending patterns that benefit particular subgroups in the population who have good reason to overcome high participation costs. These findings indicate that incumbents can benefit from institutional structures that enhance the probability of reelection regardless of their performance as representatives.</p>
<sec id="section1-1078087412463536">
<title>Exogenous Influences on Incumbency</title>
<p>It has long been established in the turnout literature that institutions that lower the costs of voting increase turnout. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078087412463536">Rosenstone and Wolfinger (1978)</xref> showed that early deadlines for registration and limited registration office hours decreased turnout in the 1972 presidential election by about 9 percentage points. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078087412463536">Wolfinger, Highton, and Mullin (2005)</xref> showed that mailing sample ballots and polling locations increased voter turnout significantly. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078087412463536">Z. L. Hajnal and Lewis (2003)</xref> provided evidence that in cities in which elections are held concurrently with elections for higher level government offices, turnout is about 40 percentage points higher compared with off-cycle elections.</p>
<p>Thus, partially as a result of the institutions governing elections, some communities are likely to have higher voter participation than others. As Converse (1966) described for individual voters, turnout might be thought of as comprising two components, the “normal” level of participation and the “current” level of participation. While particular elections will witness contextual factors (e.g., weather) that influence participation rates, these may be considered variations from the community’s relatively stable, underlying turnout predisposition. The institutions governing elections should largely affect the “normal” component of aggregate turnout. A community’s turnout predisposition is referred to here as its turnout environment.</p>
<p>The turnout environment should affect incumbents’ opportunities as well as policy outcomes. The top panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078087412463536">Figure 1</xref> summarizes expectations about these basic relationships. Institutions affect turnout, which in turn affects incumbent safety and policy outcomes. Although it is clearly the case that many of these factors are endogenously related (e.g., policy outcomes are also likely to affect the incumbency advantage and vice versa), this article seeks to isolate and test the stylized version of reality captured by the pathways in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078087412463536">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Expected relationships between institutions, incumbency, and policy</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1078087412463536-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>The bottom panel of the figure describes the specific relationships that are tested. As explained in more detail below, not mailing polling locations to voters, requiring registration at least a month before elections, and holding nonconcurrent elections should all create low-turnout environments. These low-turnout environments enhance the incumbency advantage and produce policy that is beneficial to subgroups with a strong fiduciary interest in local politics because they are likely to participate even when voting is onerous.</p>
<p>There are two reasons why variations in the turnout environment should affect incumbents’ reelection chances. First, the makeup of the electorate may differ significantly in high-turnout versus low-turnout elections. Research shows that individuals are more likely to vote as they age, earn more money, and achieve more education (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078087412463536">Leighley and Nagler 1992</xref>). Younger, poorer, and less educated individuals turn out less frequently. As turnout rates increase, lower probability voters may make up a larger proportion of the electorate. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078087412463536">Z. Hajnal (2010)</xref> shows that compared with high-turnout municipal elections, low-turnout elections tend to produce electorates that are Whiter, wealthier, older, and better educated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, scholars have shown that low-probability voters tend to have weaker attachments to candidates and parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078087412463536">Burnham 1965</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078087412463536">Dunne, Reed, and Wilbanks (1995)</xref> showed that as the costs of voting increase, those who stand to benefit the least from an election outcome drop out of the electorate more rapidly than those who stand to benefit the most. The Dunne et al. model assumes that the benefits of a particular election outcome are disproportionately distributed across the population such that the benefit function of the election outcome is convex (e.g., those who gain the most are a smaller proportion of the population than those who gain the least), while the costs of the outcome are independently and more evenly distributed. Voters only vote when the benefits they receive (or the losses they incur) exceed the costs of voting. This implies that higher voting costs disproportionately affect net losers, shifting the median voter toward the net gainers. When voting is more onerous (and turnout lower), benefiters will make up a larger share of the electorate. If high-probability voters are more likely to have stronger attachments to the current governing coalition or are more likely to benefit from and support the status quo, then higher turnout could negatively affect incumbent reelection. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078087412463536">Hansford and Gomez (2010)</xref> provided evidence that this is the case in presidential elections; higher turnout decreases vote shares for incumbent candidates and parties.</p>
<p>The second reason that incumbency advantage could be affected by turnout is related to the first. There may be a limit to the number of constituents any elected official can reach and be responsive to, and these well-attended constituents could make up a larger share of the electorate where turnout is low. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078087412463536">DeNardo (1980)</xref> argued and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078087412463536">Hansford and Gomez (2010)</xref> demonstrated that as turnout increases, the electorate contains a higher proportion of unreliable and unpredictable voters. If these voters are less likely to have a connection to the incumbent, then high turnout will negatively affect the likelihood that incumbents will both run for and win reelection to office. We ought to see an effect for running as well as winning because incumbents are strategic. They are unlikely to run for office if they know there is a high probability that they will lose the election. Instead they will “strategically retire” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078087412463536">Carson 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078087412463536">Stone et al. 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Variations in turnout environments should also be associated with identifiably different policy patterns. When the costs of voting are high, the median voter may have preferences that differ substantially from the median resident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078087412463536">Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003</xref>). As explained above, in low-turnout environments, those who stand to benefit the most from election outcomes are likely to make up a larger share of the electorate, and policy is likely to be tilted toward their interests. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078087412463536">Berry and Gersen (2010)</xref> provide evidence of this effect in school board policy—showing that in nonconcurrent (e.g., low turnout) elections, teacher unions win higher pay for teachers. We might expect that as voting becomes more onerous in municipal elections, policy will be more favorable for groups that have a consistent fiduciary interest in participating—for example, municipal employees and homeowners. If municipal employees behave like other bureaucrats, we can expect that they will seek to maximize their total compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078087412463536">Niskanen 1971</xref>), thus increasing the share of budget spent on payroll and retirement benefits. Homeowners might seek to minimize the share of tax revenue that is funded by the property tax. Other types of taxes (such as sales or licensing taxes) tend to be less visible and may be more widely shared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078087412463536">Oates 2001</xref>). Thus, if low-turnout environments are overpopulated by these highly interested subgroups, we should expect to see higher municipal payroll expenditures and lower property tax burdens.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1078087412463536">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The institutions governing elections and affecting voter participation vary significantly across states and localities. Many local elections have low-turnout environments. Only 9 states require registrars to mail voters the location of their polling place for local elections,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1078087412463536">2</xref></sup> and in 21 states, voters must register at least 30 days before any election.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1078087412463536">3</xref></sup> This means that in many localities, it is incumbent upon constituents to remember to register early enough and to figure out when and where to vote prior to the election. This could be a high hurdle for local races as only about 8% are held concurrently with state or federal elections. It comes as no surprise then to find that the median turnout in local elections is 27% of eligible voters, falling below 1% in some places.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1078087412463536">4</xref></sup> Scholars have found that institutions associated with lower turnout have differential effects on various subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078087412463536">Brians 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078087412463536">Wolfinger, Highton, and Mullin 2005</xref>). This means that varying turnout levels may be associated with differences in the composition of local electorates, support for the incumbent, and policy outcomes.</p>

<title>Data on Low-turnout Environments</title>
<p>We know from previous research that local legislators who win election to office are very likely to win reelection (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078087412463536">Krebs 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078087412463536">Wolman, Page, and Reavley 1990</xref>). The local incumbency effect is probably produced by a variety of factors. Serving in office may provide candidates with experience and expertise that is valued by voters. Particularly if incumbents are responsive to constituents’ preferences, they ought to have little trouble keeping their jobs. Risk-averse challengers are likely to time their runs when incumbents are weak or retiring, adding to the incumbency advantage. However, there may also be exogenous, systemic factors that affect voters’ ability to evaluate candidates and their likelihood of turning out to vote regardless of incumbents’ actions in office. If some institutional settings make it harder for residents to cast a vote, then we should see a measurable increase in incumbency advantage in these low-turnout environments. However, it is difficult to evaluate this prediction empirically because turnout in particular elections is likely to be affected by the presence or absence of incumbents on the ballot—and we might worry that weaker incumbents will seek to change institutions in such a way as to enhance their advantage in the next election. To minimize this problem, we can use the subordinate status of cities with regard to state laws to analyze the effect of institutions that affect turnout (mailing of polling locations and registration timing) on incumbent reelection. City councilors are affected by these institutions, but the state legislature, not city officials, decide what the law will be. In the analyses below, state-level institutional variables are supplemented with a locally determined institution, concurrency of elections.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1078087412463536">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The data used come primarily from the International City County Manager’s Association (ICMA). The ICMA conducts periodic assessments of local governments by mailing a survey to city clerks in all U.S. cities with more than 2,500 residents. They have a response rate of about 63%.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1078087412463536">6</xref></sup> As is often the case with local politics data, the ICMA data are imperfect in a variety of ways. Most importantly for this article, the datasets do not include information about candidates for local offices and only include turnout data in one survey year (1986). But they provide the best data available for studying large numbers of cities. Scholars have shown that ICMA respondents are fairly representative of the national urban population and provide relatively accurate measures of local structure and conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078087412463536">Trebbi, Aghion, and Alesina, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078087412463536">Z. L. Hajnal, Lewis, and Louch 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Using surveys from 1986, 1992, 1996, and 2001, a dataset was generated with complete data for 4,393 unique municipalities and a total of 11,813 observations. Each year contains approximately 3,000 observations, and many cities are not represented in all years. The ICMA data include information on institutional features of city government. These data were merged with census data to control for city level demographics. Census data from 1990 were used for the 1986 observations and 2000 census data for the 2001 observations. Values were linearly interpolated for 1992 and 1996. Additional data were merged in from the 1987, 1992, 1997, and 2002 Census of Governments files regarding city expenditures. Finally, data on state-level institutions that govern local elections were added. States that required polling place mailings were identified by evaluating statutes for states that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078087412463536">Wolfinger, Highton, and Mullin (2005)</xref> coded as having sent mailings for the 2000 presidential election.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1078087412463536">7</xref></sup> The coding of this variable is constant for all years of the data. Registration deadlines were gathered from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078087412463536">Brians (1997)</xref> and the Federal Election Assistance Commission.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1078087412463536">8</xref></sup> This variable changes over time for some states (but is constant across cities within states).</p>

<title>The Incumbency Advantage in Low-turnout Elections</title>
<p>To evaluate the factors that contribute to incumbent success, the proportion of city councilors that run for reelection and the proportion that run and win were analyzed. The proportion of winners conditional on the proportion running was not estimated for two reasons—one theoretical and one practical. The theoretical reason is that given that the institutions of interest in this article are typically in place before any candidate decides to enter the race, we should see most of their effect operate through selection. That is, knowing that elections will be harder to win and governing more difficult in high-turnout environments, weaker incumbents should be more likely to step down in these places leaving the pool of candidates who do enter the race to be very likely to win. The second reason for not estimating the conditional effect is that the data are city level. The lack of individual councilor data limits the ability to estimate the effect of the institutions on winning conditional on the candidate’s decision to run. However, these data do allow an estimation of the total proportion of the council that wins reelection. The lack of individual level data also precludes the analyses from including candidate and race specific factors that may affect incumbents’ decision to run and their probability of winning (such as candidate experience and incumbent performance). This is a significant limitation of the data but impossible to remedy as candidate-level data do not exist for large numbers of cities. As a rough solution, the analyses include proxies for such factors at the level of the city council. The specific variables used are discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p>First, the effect of low-turnout environments on incumbents’ propensity to run for reelection is analyzed. The dependent variable is the proportion of the council <italic>running</italic> for reelection reported by the ICMA.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1078087412463536">9</xref></sup> To measure the turnout environment, two state-level institutions—no requirement for the mailing of <italic>polling place locations</italic> and <italic>registration</italic> required 30 days or more before the election—and one local-level institution—<italic>nonconcurrent elections</italic> (elections not held in November of even numbered years)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1078087412463536">10</xref></sup>—are used. When voters are less likely to participate, we should see more incumbents running and winning.</p>
<p>The regressions include a number of control variables that might affect incumbents’ decisions to run and their ability to get reelected, and which could be correlated with the institutions affecting the turnout environment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078087412463536">Oliver (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078087412463536">Oliver and Ha (2007)</xref> found that constituents are more likely to be interested and knowledgeable about local politics in smaller communities where voters are more likely to know and support challengers to office. The natural log of city’s total <italic>population</italic> is included to account for this. A variable measuring the proportion of the city council elected by <italic>districts</italic> (as opposed to at-large) is included. This accounts for the lower cost of campaigns and lower levels of competitiveness in district elections as well as the ability for incumbents to provide targeted benefits in districted cities, creating a personal vote connection with their constituents. District councilors also typically represent smaller constituencies than at-large councilors, and so may benefit from increased name recognition. The regressions control for per capita <italic>council size</italic> to account for the possibility of increased competitiveness in smaller legislatures or decreased capacity to be responsive when an official represents larger numbers of constituents.</p>
<p>A dummy variable noting whether elections are <italic>partisan</italic> is included. Although parties play a diminished role at the local level today, in some cases parties provide organizational and financial support to candidates as well as resources for mobilizing voters. So, partisan elections may have a positive effect on incumbent reelection rates. However, because voters tend have less information about challengers in nonpartisan cities, they may be more likely to rely on incumbency as a cue for experience. The percentage of city budget spent on <italic>central staff</italic> (which includes councilors’ salaries) captures the possibility that more professionalized legislatures are more attractive to office holders and so increase the probability of seeking reelection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1078087412463536">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>To capture the possibility that incumbents are more likely to run when they have more power, a dummy variable noting whether the city has a <italic>council-manager</italic> or mayor-council structure is included. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078087412463536">Oliver and Ha (2007)</xref> argued that council-manager structures tend to create low-information political arenas that might lead incumbents to fare better in these cities. However, councilors in these cities tend to have fewer opportunities to influence city policy because of the power of the city manager, and so may be less interested in running for reelection. Two proxies for candidate quality are included—the proportion of the council that identifies as <italic>business managers</italic> and <italic>professionals</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1078087412463536">12</xref></sup> Both are expected to be positive. As a proxy for councilors with low opportunity costs, the proportion that is <italic>retired</italic> is included. These councilors should be more likely than professionally employed members to seek reelection.</p>
<p>Research on the federal incumbency advantage has found that economic downturns can hurt incumbents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078087412463536">Brady, Buckley, and Rivers 1999</xref>). This is controlled for by the proportion of people in the city who are <italic>unemployed</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1078087412463536">13</xref></sup> In addition, certain types of voters are more likely to have high levels of information about candidates, have a larger stake in local elections, and turn out to vote, potentially putting more pressure on incumbents to be responsive. The proportion of housing units occupied by <italic>homeowners</italic> and the proportion of the population that is <italic>college graduates</italic> is used to represent this population. <italic>Median household</italic> income is also included.</p>
<p>For an incumbent to represent her constituents, she must be able to build a cohesive coalition. This might be harder in more heterogeneous places. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078087412463536">Oliver and Ha (2007)</xref> find that more diverse cities engender increased interest in local campaigns. This is captured with a measure of the racial <italic>diversity</italic> of the population. The measure is a Herfindahl index (one-sum of the squared proportions) of the African American, Latino, Asian American, other non-White, and White populations in a city. It is expected that fewer incumbents will run and win in more diverse cities. Finally, the intercept is allowed to vary in cities that have <italic>staggered council terms</italic> and <italic>term limits</italic> for city councilors. In such places, some incumbents are legally prohibited from seeking reelection in any particular year. Both coefficients are expected to be negative.</p>
<p>Because the state-level institutions are collinear with state fixed effects, the importance of state influence is handled by including a measure of each state’s <italic>home rule score</italic> collected and calculated by Jack Walker (available in the “Diffusion of Public Policy” dataset). This score measures each state’s innovation with regard to granting municipal home rule. Higher scores indicate later adoption of home rule. This is used as a proxy for the permissiveness of state law with regard to municipal governance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1078087412463536">14</xref></sup> Fixed effects for survey years (<italic>1992, 1996</italic>, and <italic>2001</italic> with <italic>1986</italic> as the reference category) are included, and robust standard errors clustered by city are presented.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1078087412463536">15</xref></sup> Summary statistics for all variables are shown in Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1078087412463536">Table A1</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078087412463536">Table 1</xref> shows the results of these analyses for the proportion of incumbents running for and winning reelection.</p>

<p>The results are clear: When institutions discourage participation, more incumbents run for reelection. These differences are meaningful. In cities where registrars are not required to mail polling locations and when local elections are not concurrent with national elections, the proportion of incumbents running is about 2 percentage points higher. It is close to 1 point higher when voters must register a month before election day. As the second set of columns in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078087412463536">Table 1</xref> reveals, estimating an identical model where the dependent variable is the proportion of the council <italic>winning</italic> reelection produces similar results. Not mailing polling locations increases the proportion winning by more than 2 percentage points. Requiring registration a month before the election and holding nonconcurrent elections increase the proportion winning by about 1 point. Cumulatively, these results offer support for the hypothesis that in cities where constituents are not encouraged to participate, incumbents are more insulated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1078087412463536">16</xref></sup></p>

<title>Institutions, Turnout, and Incumbency Advantage</title>
<p>If a smaller and more predictable electorate is part of the reason that incumbents run and win more frequently when local registrars do not mail poll locations, registration closes further from election day, and local elections are not held concurrently with national elections, then these institutions should also negatively affect local-level turnout. In turn we should see a negative association between turnout and reelection.</p>
<p>Because the ICMA has only collected turnout data in one year of its survey (1986), these analyses can neither conclusively sort out the mechanism that leads to the relationship between turnout and reelection nor properly determine the direction of causality. However, the data do provide evidence that there are cross-sectional relationships among institutions, turnout, and reelection that are consistent with the theory.</p>
<p>State- and local-level institutions that decrease barriers to participation increase turnout. The dependent variables for this analysis are <italic>turnout of eligible voters</italic> and <italic>turnout of registered voters</italic> in the most recent municipal election as reported by the 1986 ICMA. Two different dependent variables are used because there are different theoretical expectations for the institutions. <italic>Polling location</italic> notices are mailed to registered voters, not eligible voters, so the effect of mailings on turnout of registered voters is estimated. However, longer <italic>registration</italic> deadlines should be important for decreasing participation among those eligible to vote, so the effect of this institution is estimated on turnout of eligible voters. It is possible that <italic>nonconcurrent</italic> elections affect participation at both stages of the voting process, so its effect is included in both models. The controls are similar to those used in the previous section, including local institutions and socioeconomic characteristics. Robust standard errors are presented. The results displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1078087412463536">Table 2</xref> indicate that institutions that increase the costs of participation have a significant, negative effect on local-level turnout.</p>

<title>The Turnout Environment and Municipal Policy</title>
<p>Institutions that create a low-turnout environment may allow incumbents to win reelection without being responsive to the general public. When the costs of voting are high, elections are likely to produce a median voter whose preferences differ from the preferences of the median resident because the benefits of participation and ability to bear the costs of voting are distributed unequally. At least two types of interests might be advantaged in low-turnout municipal environments: municipal employees and homeowners. Because of their fiduciary interest in election outcomes, we should expect that these groups will be less likely to drop out of the electorate even when hurdles are high. Thus, we can expect that policy will be more likely to favor their interests when institutions generate lower turnout elections.</p>

<p>As expected, in low-turnout environments, the proportion of the budget spent on payroll is higher and the proportion of taxes from property taxes is lower. In cities where polling locations are not mailed the proportion of the budget spent on payroll and retirement is about 4.5 percentage points higher, and the proportion of tax revenues funded by property taxes is about 6.5 points lower. Similarly, in jurisdictions where registration is required further from election day and in those where elections are not held concurrently with other levels of government, there is evidence that payroll spending is higher and property taxes are lower.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1078087412463536">22</xref></sup> In sum, these results indicate that in low-turnout environments, certain subpopulations may be better represented by government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1078087412463536">23</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Gaining deeper knowledge of the factors that affect the incumbency advantage contributes to our understanding of representative democracy. There is a tremendous amount of evidence that incumbents gain experience over time, that they work hard to learn what their constituents want and to take actions in office that faithfully represent their voters. However, some political environments undoubtedly encourage these behaviors more than others. When institutions tend to dampen the baseline level of participation, representatives may have less incentive to use responsiveness as a strategy for reelection.</p>
<p>Not mailing of polling place locations, holding nonconcurrent elections, and establishing registration deadlines farther from election day tend to decrease voter turnout. Cities that have these institutions in place tend to see more incumbents run for and win reelection. These institutions are also associated with policy outcomes favoring highly interested subgroups that are likely to turn out to vote even when the costs of participating are high. The higher reelection rates combined with the narrower focus of policy suggests that low-turnout environments may create less incentive for elected officials to be responsive to a broad base of constituents.</p>
<p>This article has made use of the subordinate nature of cities with respect to election law to avoid the endogenous nature of turnout and election outcomes. But we still cannot be sure that low-turnout institutions <italic>cause</italic> higher reelection rates and narrower policy outcomes. The principle problem is that using state-level institutions to designate the turnout environment precludes the analyses from accounting for factors that might affect both the state’s propensity to encourage voters to turn out and incumbents to seek reelection. It is possible, perhaps even likely, that the political culture in some states and cities increases both participation and turnover of elected officials. If this is the case, then constituents living in more democratic places may be more likely to encounter responsive elected officials. In addition, the results presented here cannot help us to know exactly why incumbents are more likely to run for and win in low-turnout environments and how different laws may affect that environment in different ways. For instance, not mailing polling locations may have the largest effect on people without access to the alternative sources of information like the Internet or newspaper, while nonconcurrent elections may be most likely to drive down turnout among those with inflexible work schedules. These differences in participation might meaningfully affect incumbents’ decisions and policy choices. Finally, it is possible that institutions that enhance participation may be correlated with (because of something like political culture) or causally related to (because of a more challenging electoral environment) the performance of incumbents. If this is the case, the reason that incumbents might win more frequently in such settings is that they are doing a better job of representing their constituents. Figuring out these relationships will take access to much better local elections data than is currently available.</p>
<p>However, even without providing evidence of causality or untangling the direct effects of institutions, this article has identified election laws that might make responsive democracy less likely—a failure to provide information to voters about their voting location, decoupling local elections from national election timing, and making it harder to register. Such laws are also associated with policy that advantages highly interested subpopulations. Until we dissect the many elements that contribute to the incumbency advantage at all levels of government, we will never be able to fully evaluate the success of our system. In the meantime, if we want to increase the health of local democracy, the policy prescriptions are clear.</p>

<p>Of course, the reverse is also possible. Low-turnout elections are likely to be populated by voters who have a great stake in municipal policy outcomes—parents of school-age children, homeowners, long-term residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078087412463536">Fischel 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078087412463536">Z. Hajnal 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078087412463536">Oliver and Ha 2007</xref>). These voters may be more supportive of challengers if they are unhappy with the status quo. Thus, turnout could have a positive relationship with reelection, particularly if incumbents are unresponsive to these highly interested subgroups. While this is a plausible scenario, the data I present below suggest that incumbents and highly interested subgroups tend to benefit (not suffer) from low turnout.</p></fn>

<p>The states that require mailing of polling place locations are California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maryland, New Jersey, Nevada, and New York. Colorado and Maryland require mailings for some municipalities but not others. Oregon elections are all cast by mail, and registered voters are mailed ballots to their home. Some or all municipalities in these states are coded as requiring mailings depending on state law. Arizona requires mailings in federal and state elections but makes the mailing optional in local elections. Delaware, Alabama, Georgia, and Washington mail registration cards to voters that list their precinct number and in some cases their polling place; however, no notification of a coming election is mailed to voters in these states. These states are coded as not mailing polling place locations.</p></fn>

<p>These figures are from the International City County Managers Association survey conducted in 1986.

<p>See Footnote 2 for additional detail about the coding. It would clearly be preferable to have this variable change over time. While it is possible to locate current state constitutional language, codes, and statutes governing elections, it is extremely time consuming and in some cases impossible to determine dates of enactment and/or the language governing elections in prior years. As a result, I am forced to test my hypotheses cross-sectionally.</p></fn>

<p>Unfortunately the ICMA reports only the proportion of the whole council running for and winning reelection even in cities with staggered council terms or term limits where only a portion of the council seat are up for election in a given year. This means that for many of my cities, I systematically underestimate the proportion of the council seeking and winning reelection. To deal with this problem, I include dummy indicators for cities with term limits and staggered councils in my models. In alternate analyses, I estimate the effects of contestability only for cities with nonstaggered elections and without term limits, and the patterns are essentially the same as those presented with a loss of significance but not substantive impact on the key independent variables. I also estimated the number of seats available in staggered elections by deflating the total number of council seats by one-third or one-half and using this as the denominator for the proportion of councilors seeking and winning reelection. These results are also very similar to those presented. All alternate specifications are available from the author.</p></fn>

<p>Adding a measure of the salaries paid to city councilors is positive and significant, but because of missing data, reduces the number of cases significantly. The addition of the variable does not change the conclusions presented.</p></fn>

<p>The ICMA lists the occupation of city councilors in nine categories: lawyers, professionals, business managers, business employees, farmers, homemakers, teachers, clergy, and retirees. At the city level, there is no clear way to measure candidate quality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078087412463536">Lieske (1989)</xref> offered evidence that college degrees and occupational prestige are strongly associated with candidate success in Cincinnati, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078087412463536">Bridges (1997)</xref> showed that successful coalitions in the Southwest were dominated by prominent members of the business community.

<p>A better measure would be change in unemployment. However, because I interpolate values between the decennial censuses, this measure equates to a constant for each city and additionally requires that drop one year of my data. For these reasons, I choose to include the level of unemployment instead.</p></fn>

<label>14.</label>
<p>Adding controls for Daniel Elazar’s coding of state political culture (individualistic, moralistic, and traditional) affects the results very little. The coefficient on registration deadlines becomes insignificant, but the effect sizes remain the same across all models. Adding census region fixed effects results in insignificant coefficients on polling location mailings in all models because the institution is highly correlated with location (e.g., polling locations are not mailed in the Midwest at all and in only one state in the South).</p></fn>

<label>16.</label>
<p>A number of other interesting relationships emerge from these estimations. Many of the control variables work as expected. For instance, larger cities are likely to see more incumbents running for reelection and winning. Incumbents appear to benefit from mayor-council systems and district elections as well as more professionalized city councils. Retirees are more likely to run for reelection and businessmen, and professionals are more likely to win.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn17-1078087412463536">
<label>17.</label>
<p>There are also significant interactions between the state institutions and concurrency. For example, concurrent elections have a more powerful effect on turnout when polling locations are mailed.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn18-1078087412463536">
<label>18.</label>
<p>It is interesting to note that the relationship between the institutional effect on turnout and incumbency advantage seems to differ across institutions. That is, running the two-stage model for each institution one at a time reveals that although nonconcurrent elections have the most powerful effect on turnout, they have the smallest overall effect on incumbency advantage. This could be explained if concurrency produces multiple, countervailing effects. For instance, given that concurrent elections decrease constituents’ knowledge and engagement of local issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078087412463536">Oliver and Ha 2007</xref>), voters may be more likely to use incumbency as a heuristic in these settings. Alternatively, it could be that the incumbents who choose to run knowing that they will face a more activated electorate are simply of higher quality and so more likely to win. This argument suggests another possible reason for the relationship between low-turnout environments and an incumbency effect. High-turnout environments may limit the number of low-quality candidates who run for office. This could mean that in high-turnout environments, a greater proportion of the apparent incumbency effect would be the result of selection. So we might expect a smaller pure incumbency effect (e.g., stripped of selection) when elections have high turnout. Ideally, one would test this proposition with a regression discontinuity, but these data are insufficient for such an analysis.</p></fn>

<p>Although economists have shown that most property taxes are passed on directly to renters, homeowners are more likely to dislike the property tax. According to survey data commissioned by the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations in 1994, when asked to identify the least fair tax (with the choices being federal income tax, federal social security tax, state income tax, state sales tax, and local property tax), approximately 36% of homeowners identified the property tax as the least fair, whereas only 23% of renters did. A two sample <italic>t</italic> test indicates that these differences are significant at the .035 level (results available from the author). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078087412463536">Fischel (2001)</xref> provided substantial evidence that homeowners are the most active participants in local democracy and policy making.</p></fn>

<p>Both predictions are referencing proportions (of expenditure and revenue). To satisfy the preferences of public employees and homeowners at the same time, a city would either need to decrease spending on other areas and/or increase their revenues from other sources.</p></fn>

<p>Replacing the registration variable with a measure designating states that allow registration within 10 days of elections produces much larger and more robust results.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn23-1078087412463536">
<label>23.</label>
<p>An alternative story is that individuals who support high spending on public employees and low property tax rates seek out communities that provide these policy options. Then, because everyone is happy with the policies offered by incumbents, we see high reelection rates. While this seems like a truly plausible account, it seems less reasonable to argue that these same people also try to sort themselves into communities where polling locations are not mailed, registration is difficult, and elections are nonconcurrent. The fact that state legislatures (not local officials) select registration and voter information laws as well as designate concurrency in many places suggests that there remains a significant exogenous affect of institutions on turnout, incumbency, and policy outcomes even in the presence of endogenous sorting. That said, this research design and these data cannot rule out the possibility that these institutions actually encourage responsiveness on the part of incumbents, meaning that low turnover and low turnout are actually the result of satisfaction with incumbent performance.</p></fn>
