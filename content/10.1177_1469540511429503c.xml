<sec id="sec1-1469540511429503c"><title>David Marshall (ed.) <italic>Understanding Children as Consumers</italic>, London: SAGE, 2010; 280 pp. £79.00. ISBN 9781847879264</title>
<p>This book makes a significant contribution to the important area of children in consumer and marketing studies. It has been noted for some time now that consumer theories tend to exclude and ignore children. <italic>Understanding Children as Consumers</italic> is therefore a welcome contribution to the development and strengthening of research focused on children in consumer society. This book’s strong point is that it brings together and covers different theoretical approaches to the study of children and consumption during the past 30 years, while also suggesting how studies can be conducted today, and what kind of research is needed for the future.</p>
<p>Editor David Marshall brings together well-established researchers in the area, from ten different countries, in over 14 chapters. The book is divided into four parts.</p>
<p>The main argument presented is that we need to look critically at children as active consumers by trying to uncover their notions of what it means to be a consumer, i.e. by getting children’s points of views on marketing and consumption. This is done to be able to question and investigate children’s vulnerability and competence as well as to re-think children as consumers. To accomplish this, the book presents different approaches to conducting research with children, covering various theories and methods. The main theoretical perspective presented and drawn upon in the book is that of psychological behaviorism and consumer socialization. Jean Piaget’s age-based developmental stages as well as Deborah Roedder-John’s expansion of Piaget’s stages into consumer socialization are presented in a lively manner in Chapter 1, then extended and also drawn upon in other chapters. Also represented, but to a lesser extent, are historical perspectives, as well as cultural consumer and economic socialization theories.</p>
<p>It is perhaps a pity that the book draws less on the areas of child studies, childhood sociology and media studies, where notions of vulnerability and competence have been investigated and discussed from both a theoretical and an ethnographic angle for quite some time. Child studies investigates and questions what it means to be a child; and because notions of the child are important to how research is conducted, a broader discussion of the interconnection and differences between child studies and the main theories used in the book would have been of help to the reader. This is not overlooked altogether, however, as Teresa Davis argues, in an elaborate and interesting way, that different understandings of children affect the methodological design and results of research. Important child-related concepts – such as cool, cute, savvy, competent, being, becoming, incompetent, subject and passive – are also explored and defined throughout the book, not least through children’s own consumer voices.</p>
<p>The book strongly reinforces the possibilities of learning for the reader. Each chapter consists of a clear aim, vignettes, further readings and issues for future research. The inclusion of intriguing vignettes is an interesting innovation, although it is not always clear that they contribute substantially to the arguments. In some of the chapters, the connection between the vignettes and the text is rather indistinct. Likewise, the discussion questions at the end of each chapter are somewhat over-explicit, while the presentation of the chapter aims at the beginning of each chapter is excellent.</p>
<p>Another of the book’s strong points is that it can be used not only by students studying or scholars researching children and consumption, but also in the study of consumerism and marketing in general. The book points to the fact that children can no longer be treated as marginalized figures in the marketing, commerce and management research. This is because children’s consumption is always contextualized, taking place within larger frameworks of policy-making, politics and across generations.</p>
<p>Overall, the book shows – as Marshall argues – that we are not dealing with a simplistic situation in which children are <italic>either</italic> vulnerable <italic>or</italic> competent, but that the truth might lie somewhere in the middle. Research in media and child studies has also proved this point, and as suggested by childhood sociologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469540511429503c">Alan Prout (2005)</xref>, future research on children should focus on what is found in between the dichotomies, for example, the <italic>in-between</italic> of vulnerability and competence or of adults and children. <italic>Understanding Children as Consumers</italic> contributes to and strengthens this notion once again, and this time from a consumption perspective.</p>
<p>However, the expected next step is to push the limits set out in the book and become a bit more critical and provocative. Brian Young’s chapter on advertising and obesity is an excellent example of how taken-for-granted notions of correlations between age, advertising and obesity can be challenged. His question of why it matters at what age children understand advertising strategies gives shape to a new and more critical approach. He argues that the at-what-age question is important to, for example, lawmakers, but not necessarily to children. Furthermore, other parts of the book demonstrate that the at-what-age question needs to develop into what-do-children-do questions.</p>
<p>If children are to be taken seriously and be reconsidered as consumers – which is one objective of the book – such an advancement is crucial. The most significant contribution of <italic>Understanding Children as Consumers</italic> is the book’s endeavour to begin with the children. What I am arguing though is that when or at what age children understand or do not understand advertising provides us with incomplete knowledge about children as human beings situated in society at large. If we wish to understand children as consumers – vulnerable, competent or not – we need to look at how, when and where they make sense of the consumer cultures they live in based on their actions rather than their age. To accomplish this we need a more questioning approach than the book supplies today.</p>
