<abstract>
<p>April 2012 marked the 130th anniversary of the death of Charles Darwin. One of many significant contributions he made to science was the subsidence theory of atoll formation, which he penned on 12 April 1836 during the voyage of the <italic>Beagle</italic> through the Pacific. Darwin’s elegant theory, founded on the premise of a subsiding volcano and the corresponding upward growth of coral reef, was astonishing for the time considering the absence of an underpinning awareness of plate tectonics. His theory has endured until modern times in spite of a number of opposing ideas and permutations and has an enviable longevity amongst paradigms in geomorphology. Darwin frequently alluded to the generally circular morphology of the atoll shape, yet the reality is that many atolls are neither circular nor elliptical, instead possessing irregular morphologies. In particular, many exhibit major arcuate ‘bight-like’ structures (ABLS) in their plan form. These departures from the circular form are indicative of geomorphological processes that cannot be ignored. ABLS are the morphological expression of large submarine failures that are common on the slopes of volcanic edifices. Such failures can occur during any stage of atoll formation and are a valuable addition to Darwin’s theory because they indicate the instability of the volcanic foundations. Moreover, ABLS have fundamental implications for hazard research in the context of oceanic islands. Not only does our extension to the theory explain the diversity of atoll shape, but it also provides a mechanism for identifying a vast number of potential local tsunamigenic sources, which is critical for advancing modern understanding of tsunami hazards in oceanic environments.</p>

<p>Coral atolls, dispersed widely throughout the warm waters of the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans, are amongst the world’s most impressive biogenic landforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683612463101">Nunn, 2010</xref>). The existence of these zoogeomorphic constructions, sometimes stretching for hundreds of kilometres in length around shallow central lagoons, is owed entirely to hermatypic coral colonies in the photic zone building carbonate frameworks upon the skeletal remains of older generations beneath.</p>
<p>Since April 2012 marked the 130th anniversary of the death of Charles Darwin, it is fitting to remark upon one of his most significant contributions to science: the ‘subsidence theory of atoll formation’. Originally penned as a journal entry on 12 April 1836 while visiting the Keeling Islands on the voyage of HMS <italic>Beagle</italic>, Darwin formally published his ideas on atolls in <italic>The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs</italic> in 1842 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683612463101">Darwin, 1839</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683612463101">1842</xref>). Darwin’s elegant theory was founded on the premise of a subsiding volcanic island and the corresponding upward growth of fringing and barrier coral reefs keeping pace with rising relative sea levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683612463101">Figure 1</xref>). That Darwin was willing to accept the possibility of volcanic islands subsiding was remarkable, considering the absence of an underpinning awareness of plate tectonics in the mid-19th century. His theory subsequently encountered opposing ideas that emphasised various alternative mechanisms for atoll formation, such as reef outward growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683612463101">Murray, 1880</xref>), changes in Quaternary sea levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683612463101">Daly, 1918</xref>), influences of antecedent platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959683612463101">Hoffmeister and Ladd, 1944</xref>) and subaerial karstic weathering during periods of emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683612463101">MacNeil, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683612463101">Purdy, 1974</xref>). In spite of this, Darwin’s fundamental ideas are still generally accepted, being supported by reef core dating evidence that illustrates how many mid-ocean atolls have indeed subsided over geological timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683612463101">Nunn, 1994</xref>). Consequently, Darwin’s subsidence theory of atoll formation has endured to modern times and thus commands an enviable longevity amongst paradigms in geomorphology.</p>

<p>In his writings, Darwin frequently alluded to the generally circular morphology of the atoll shape, revealed for example by statements such as ‘Thus we have traced the history of these great rings of coral-rock,…’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683612463101">Darwin, 1845</xref>: 479). Yet, the reality is that many atolls are neither circular nor elliptical, but instead possess irregular morphologies. This was demonstrated nearly half a century ago in the benchmark study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683612463101">Stoddart (1965)</xref>, in which 94 out of the 99 atolls examined were shown to display polygonal rather than circular shapes. Notably, many atolls exhibit major <italic>arcuate ‘bight-like’ structures</italic> (ABLS) in their plan form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683612463101">Figure 2</xref>). These departures from circular or elliptical forms are indicative of geomorphological processes that cannot be ignored. ABLS are the morphological expression of large submarine failures that are now known to be common on the slopes of volcanic edifices.</p>

</fig>
<p>The importance of submarine landslides is well established, especially in the context of actively growing volcanoes experiencing collapse of unbutressed flanks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959683612463101">Holcomb and Searle (1991)</xref> proposed that giant landslides help explain the ‘stellate’ shapes of many oceanic volcanoes. This prompted their further suggestion that high sea cliffs on such islands may not be the product of marine erosion as previously supposed, but should instead be reinterpreted as eroded landslide headwalls. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683612463101">Nunn (2009)</xref> developed a model to illustrate how a volcanic island can completely ‘vanish’ as a result of successive flank collapses. The most comprehensive treatment of this topic, however, is presented in the review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683612463101">Keating and McGuire (2000)</xref>. Altogether they identified 23 processes that contribute to volcanic edifice collapse, many involving structural weaknesses and unstable submarine deposits. Importantly, the authors pointed out that multiple destabilisation processes normally operate simultaneously, rather than alone, to cause submarine failures.</p>
<p>Of particular relevance to atoll ABLS formation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683612463101">Keating and McGuire (2000)</xref> drew attention to Johnston Atoll in the Northern Line Islands (16°44′N 169°32′W), the shape of which is in part the result of landsliding on its southern margin. Keating’s groundbreaking undersea observations using side-scan sonar on Johnston, Mururoa (21°50′S 138°53′W), and other atolls and guyots elsewhere in the Pacific, indicate that karstic weathering and fracturing during periods of emergence help to weaken the limestone cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683612463101">Keating, 1998</xref>). In addition, glacially controlled Quaternary low sea-level stands may prompt slumping on precipitous fore-reef slopes, owing to a reduction in their buoyant support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683612463101">Ford and Williams, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Supporting evidence of a failure-origin for ABLS can also be found on atolls that have risen above sea level and now exist as limestone islands. Such places are excellent locations for investigation, since observation of their subaerial features clearly presents fewer challenges than undersea exploration of contemporary atolls or sunken guyots. One example that has received attention is the high limestone island of Niue (19°03′S 169°52′W) in the central South Pacific. The early Niue atoll probably first emerged above sea level during the mid Pleistocene (0.5 Ma), when its Miocene-age volcanic foundation began ascending the bulge of a lithospheric flexure associated with plate subduction at the nearby Tonga-Kermadec Trench to the west (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683612463101">Nunn and Britton, 2004</xref>). Around the modern coastline, two major bights (Alofi Bight and Avatele Bight) sculpt the outline of the south and west of the island, while the adjacent offshore submarine topography exhibits lobate structures of mass movement deposits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959683612463101">Hill, 1996</xref>). Also cut into the coastal cliffs are a series of impressive fault-guided chasms, likely to be tension cracks that formed within the limestone cap in response to the submarine slumping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683612463101">Schofield, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683612463101">Terry, 2004</xref>). Slumping may have been assisted by the presence of an unstable ‘greasy’ geological boundary between the carbonate rocks and underlying volcano (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959683612463101">Terry and Nunn, 2003</xref>). This can develop when an early subaerial phase of a volcanic island in a tropical latitude allows deep chemical weathering to produce weak volcanic clay regolith, upon which the coral reefs subsequently grow during subsidence. This type of junction has been traced beneath the coral limestone on Christmas Island (10°29′S 105°38′E) in the Indian Ocean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683612463101">Barrie, 1967</xref>).</p>
<p>Against this background of slope instability, the present correspondence seeks to ‘reshape’ Darwin’s subsidence theory of atoll formation, in order to foster a greater appreciation of how atoll ABLS have fundamental implications for tsunami hazard research in the context of oceanic islands.</p>
<p>In our view, the best way to do this is to use the iconic and immediately recognisable illustration of Darwin’s subsidence theory, but modifying it to incorporate ABLS and landslides to highlight the inherent instability of the volcanic foundations beneath atolls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683612463101">Figure 3</xref>). Not only does our extension to the theory explain the diversity of atoll shape, but it also provides a mechanism for identifying a vast number of potential local (and regional) tsunamigenic sources, which is critical for advancing modern understanding of tsunami hazards in oceanic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683612463101">Goff, 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>In the Pacific region it has long been accepted that island nations are exposed to tsunamis from numerous Pacific Ring of Fire sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683612463101">Goff et al., 2011</xref>). Unfortunately, however, most tsunami hazard assessments, probabilistic or otherwise, have tended to focus almost exclusively on subduction zone sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683612463101">Goff, 2011</xref>). Subduction zones are only one of a suite of potential tsunamigenic sources, albeit the most commonly recorded in historic time (63%), with landslide and volcanic-related (e.g. flank collapse) events representing 14% of the total (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683612463101">Gusiakov, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The lack of recognition within the tsunami research community of the potential significance of atolls as tsunamigenic sources (e.g. sector collapse, flank collapse) is worrying. It could be argued that since atoll-related sources appear to represent only a modest fraction (14% landslide/volcanic) of historic events, there is a far greater need for researchers to focus their attention on subduction zones. There are, however, two main ripostes against this argument. First, atolls are volcanic in origin and since there is an acknowledged suite of volcanic-related tsunamigenic sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683612463101">Keating and McGuire, 2000</xref>), we would do well to determine how important these are for the tropical islands of the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions as opposed to ignoring the issue. Second, it seems probable that many local and regional tsunamis from volcanic-related sources have not been recorded in historical data bases. For example, many significant local (and regional?) events have gone largely unrecorded simply because they have either not been associated with a major earthquake or because the inundation may have only affected currently unpopulated areas.</p>
<p>A 2010 event on Mangaia, Cook Islands, is indicative of the importance of ABLS as well as the need for a better understanding of atoll-related tsunami hazards. The south coast of Mangaia has a cliffed and arcuate shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683612463101">Figure 4</xref>) that previous researchers identified as a site of probable large submarine slope failures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959683612463101">Summerhayes, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683612463101">Wood and Hay, 1970</xref>). The tsunamigenic implications of this instability, however, were only recently established. On 13 April 2010, a local tsunami with a maximum inundation of 100 m inland and a runup of 12 m a.s.l. struck the uninhabited south coast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683612463101">Goff, 2011</xref>). This event was most likely caused by a small submarine slope failure associated with the geomorphologically distinct ABLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683612463101">Figure 4a</xref>). The tsunami went unreported and unrecognised at the time, but subsequent research revealed that it was only the most recent of an unknown number of previous inundations, with personal accounts from fishermen recalling at least two similar events over the past 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683612463101">Goff, 2011</xref>). Further work has also identified a series of similar events on the adjacent islands of Mauke and Atiu (J Goff, unpublished data, 2011), none of which is as yet documented in any historical tsunami database.</p>

</fig>
<p>In the light of such evidence it is surprising that so little attention has been given to the hazard and risk associated with atoll-related tsunamigenic sources. The recognition of ABLS offers researchers a previously neglected opportunity to identify potential local and regional tsunamigenic sources throughout the Asia-Pacific region. To put this in context, a study of megaclasts in coastal Tonga led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683612463101">Frohlich et al. (2009)</xref> to conclude that ‘small (&lt;1 km<sup>3</sup>) submarine slope failures sometimes generate locally large tsunamis’. Overall, the Pacific Ocean alone has more than 10<sup>4</sup> seamounts/atolls taller than 1 km. Although smaller seamounts/atolls are more common, the smallest of these may still be capable of generating submarine slope failures of several cubic kilometres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959683612463101">Holcomb and Searle, 1991</xref>), considerably larger than those identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683612463101">Frohlich et al. (2009)</xref>. Other studies have also shown that moderate to large (10–100 km<sup>3</sup>) submarine slope failures could be responsible for some of the largest identified tsunamis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683612463101">Tappin et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>On balance, it seems reasonable to suggest that with the vast number of seamounts/atolls within Oceania alone, our current historical data bases grossly under-represent the significance of atoll-related tsunamigenic sources. A reshaping of Darwin’s subsidence theory of atoll formation hopefully provides new impetus for the scientific community to address this shortcoming. This may finally allow a more comprehensive tsunami hazard and risk assessment across the tropical Asia-Pacific region to be carried out.</p>
