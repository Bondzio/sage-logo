<abstract>
<p>In the late nineteenth century, Dublin was being choked by a ring of independent suburbs. Unable to expand either its territory or the number of ratepayers, and prevented from finding space for new housing, the city could neither improve its finances nor tackle its chronic slum problem. A prolonged campaign by the nationalist city to annex the unionist townships met with fierce resistance. The energy invested by both sides in this dispute reveals much about the complex relationship between civil society and urban government, and about that relationship’s role in expressing popular identities. Irish independence in 1922 transformed the dynamics of this struggle, producing some unexpected results. Understanding Dublin’s competing councils informs the debate on the role of civil society in the urban environment, and contributes to wider discussions of national identity, the failure of the Union of 1800, and the emergence of Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State.</p>

<p>Irish historiography has sidelined urban history. The complexities of city life did not fit easily into the Catholic, Gaelic, and rural identity sanctioned by the new Irish state following independence in 1922. Until very recently, few historians have considered the connection between Irish cities and Westminster during the century of their shared United Kingdom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144212449144">2</xref></sup> This article argues that existing theories on the relationship between cities and national identity do not explain the development of Dublin’s unique cluster of self-governing townships. Examination of the Irish urban scene helps to refine the current understanding of this relationship. An analysis of the behavior of local councils and national government at key moments will demonstrate how questions of national identity played a crucial, if unspoken, role in Dublin’s evolution.</p>
<p>At the end of the nineteenth century, Dublin was being choked by a ring of independent suburbs. Unable to expand either its territory or the number of ratepayers, and prevented from finding space for new housing, the city could neither improve its finances nor tackle its chronic slum problem. A prolonged campaign by the nationalist city to annex the unionist townships met with fierce resistance. The energy invested by both sides in this dispute reveals much about the complex role of the city and suburbs in expressing Irish and British national identities.</p>
<sec id="section1-0096144212449144">
<title>Evolution</title>
<p>Following the Act of Union of 1800, Dublin had joined Edinburgh as a “deposed capital” within the expanded United Kingdom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144212449144">3</xref></sup> The city maintained a strong sense of its own importance, however; to nationalists it was the once and future capital of Ireland, for unionists it was the second city of the empire. Since the seventeenth century the Penal Laws had effectively barred Roman Catholics from political life. These restrictions were gradually eroded, but it was not until Catholic Emancipation in 1829 that the ban on Catholics holding public office was lifted. In Ireland, municipal and national politics were inseparable. Deep religious differences within the population meant that Dublin’s political evolution was unlike its sister cities in the United Kingdom. As Mary Daly wrote in <italic>Dublin, the Deposed Capital</italic>: “The municipal reform movement in Ireland had been in existence from approximately 1810, but in the 1820s it was largely taken over by the [movement] for Catholic Emancipation. The success of this campaign brought political polarization on denominational lines.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144212449144">4</xref></sup> In 1840, alarmed Protestant councillors fought the introduction of the Irish Municipal Reform Act, arguing that the very foundations of Irish Protestantism were at stake.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144212449144">5</xref></sup> The passing of the 1840 act allowed Dublin’s Catholic majority to dislodge the Protestant oligarchy. From the 1860s, a gentleman’s agreement meant that the office of Lord Mayor alternated between Catholic and Protestant candidates. This arrangement did not survive the growing pressure among nationalists for Irish Home Rule and by 1882 the rotation of civic offices had finished.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144212449144">6</xref></sup> “Catholic” had become shorthand for “nationalist,” supporting limited independence for Ireland; “Protestant” was understood to mean “unionist,” in favor of maintaining the link with Great Britain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144212449144">7</xref></sup> Sitting in City Hall, only a few hundred yards from the pre-Union Irish parliament house, the reformed and predominantly Catholic Municipal Council saw itself as the voice of nationalism and a sort of Home Rule government-in-waiting. Unionist members on the council became increasingly isolated as the nationalist majority barred them from serving as Lord Mayor or High Sheriff. This petty revenge for the Penal Laws was to remain in force until Ireland regained her own parliament. Thus, Dublin’s municipal government and civic offices involved more than politics, they became zones of contested identity.</p>
<p>The city’s history had produced unusual demographic and administrative results. Like most of Ireland, the majority of Dubliners were Roman Catholic and nationalist, but while the national population figure was steadily decreasing, Dublin’s population grew.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144212449144">8</xref></sup> The Municipal Council consisted of sixty members; by the late 1890s it was strongly nationalist, with only seven councillors representing unionist opinion. Situated inside a ring formed by the Royal and Grand Canals, Dublin’s predominant social profile was lower-middle and working-class, the latter including a large unskilled population surviving on casual employment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0096144212449144">9</xref></sup> The physical environment was also poor. Gloomy workhouses, hospitals, prisons, and military barracks dotted the map of the city, with industrial works and markets for vegetables, fish, and cattle adding to the noise and smell. Since the late 1840s, property developers had established independent townships beyond the canals. These self-governing suburbs provided broad avenues of high-quality houses where the city’s elite, mainly Protestant and unionist, could live in comfort and political tranquillity. Socioeconomic factors had a role in this migration from the impoverished city to the airy suburbs, but religion, politics, and nationality played a major part. While non-Catholics (primarily Anglicans/Episcopalians and Presbyterians) accounted for less than 20 percent of the population inside the city boundaries, across the suburbs they were at almost 40 percent; in Rathmines non-Catholics actually exceeded 50 percent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0096144212449144">10</xref></sup> Suburban voters regularly elected councils with unionist majorities, while Dublin unionists struggled to win one in ten of the Municipal Council seats.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0096144212449144">11</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section2-0096144212449144">
<title>Social Geography</title>
<p>The suburbs looked and felt quite different to the city, with each township having its distinctive identity. The district of Pembroke lay southeast of the centre along the scenic shore of Dublin Bay. It was named after its landlords the Herbert family, Earls of Pembroke. Through their local agent, the Herberts carefully controlled life in the township, influencing council decisions, providing or withholding finance, encouraging suitable social developments, and receiving support in parliamentary elections.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0096144212449144">12</xref></sup> Pembroke had equal numbers of Protestant and Catholic residents but the property-based franchise produced a solidly unionist council. Retired army officers, officials from Dublin Castle, and former colonial administrators enjoyed the facilities of this prestigious township. Rathmines, due south of the city, was strongly unionist and had a Protestant majority. It behaved more like a town in the English Home Counties than any southern, or even northern Irish town. Developed for the commercial aristocracy, its councillors were the “fit and proper persons” described in E. P. Hennock’s work on English urban government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0096144212449144">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>To the west, industrial Kilmainham housed skilled railway workers and coach-builders, often English or Scottish families from a Dissenting tradition. They elected radical labor councillors. Drumcondra township on the northside was a speculative development of red-brick terraces built for respectable white-collar workers, largely Catholic and moderately nationalist. To the northeast, Clontarf, with its semirural villas, was dominated by a branch of the Guinness family. These successful brewers had been recently ennobled for their philanthropy and their support for the Primrose League. Through popular entertainments and lectures, this association attracted members from across the social classes in support of Tory principles—“the maintenance of [the Protestant] religion, of the estates of the realm and of the Imperial ascendancy of Great Britain.” It was effectively the “tea and sandwiches” wing of the Conservative Party.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0096144212449144">14</xref></sup> Beyond Pembroke lay two independent coastal townships. Blackrock had a moderate nationalist majority, who struggled with a determined unionist minority. Next was the large commercial port of Kingstown, finely balanced between nationalists and unionists. Local pride and political compromise occupied much of this council’s time. Finally, a series of picturesque seaside districts offered affluent suburbanites a convenient summer retreat; their local councils reflected the unionist politics of these seasonal migrants. Thus, the overcrowded and impoverished nationalist city was encircled by successful self-governing, and generally unionist, districts. Inside the ring of canals, Dublin projected its Irishness while outside the surrounding townships emphasized their Britishness. Within a ten-mile radius, eight town halls represented their different communities. As will be seen, the social and political tensions created by such proximity had a profound impact on Dublin’s development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0096144212449144">
<title>Annexation</title>
<p>In 1883 parliament appointed a commission, under William A. Exham Q.C., to investigate the region’s disputed local administration. Commissioners interviewed city and township councillors, ratepayers, businessmen, engineers, and clergy of all denominations. They found that Dublin was indeed trapped in its cramped conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0096144212449144">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0096144212449144">15</xref></sup> Finances, housing, and drainage would all benefit from the economies of scale brought about by an expanded municipality. The city should incorporate all its immediate neighbors, they advised, while to the south, Kingstown township should annex some smaller coastal districts. The House of Commons accepted the recommendations but township supporters in the House of Lords diluted them; the Exham Commission report was ultimately shelved. Conservative peers were unwilling to hand their fellow unionists over to the Catholic and nationalist administration in Dublin City Hall.</p>

</fig>
<p>Yet radical reform came in 1898 when Gerald Balfour, Chief Secretary for Ireland, introduced the Local Government (Ireland) Act. The act had many novel elements: It was the first case of English legislation being transferred wholesale to Ireland; all previous laws had been specifically tailored to fit Irish requirements. It was part of a series of so-called constructive unionist laws aimed (rather belatedly) at bringing the benefits of the Union of 1800 to Ireland.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0096144212449144">16</xref></sup> Speaking in the Commons, Balfour stressed that logic and efficiency were at the core of the bill. There were to be no overlapping boundaries and no unviable administrative units.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0096144212449144">17</xref></sup> The first question came from Edward Carson, MP, Unionist member for Dublin University and future founder of Northern Ireland. “What happens in the case of the townships?” he asked. The Chief Secretary reassured him that they were not in danger.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0096144212449144">18</xref></sup> Balfour made no reply, however, when a nationalist member asked if the recommendations of the Exham Commission were to be incorporated into the legislation. Despite the aim of administrative efficiency, parliament had once again maintained the status quo. The independence of the unionist townships was safe, for the moment.</p>
<p>The new legislation widened the local franchise enormously, making urban government even more significant in people’s daily lives. A lower property threshold meant that workers, women, and lodgers qualified for the vote; in some city wards, the electorate grew by 400 percent. This greatly strengthened the mandate of all local authorities, regardless of political hue. The city and townships, now renamed Urban District Councils (UDCs), gained new financial and administrative powers. Responsibility for the construction and maintenance of roads and bridges passed to the councils, as did the operation of asylums and the enforcement of a growing body of sanitary regulations. Under the new act councils decided on the level of local taxation (known as the local rates). This single payment replaced a bewildering array of individual charges for street cleaning, lighting, bridge maintenance, hospitals, and library services under the old system. Establishing councils on a sound representative basis, with added responsibilities, further increased their importance in the lives of their communities. More voters and wider powers meant a greater connection between communities and their councils. Having financial and policy control over education, housing and health meant that councils inevitably came to represent their communities’ values and identities. At a time when Irish and British-unionist identities were diverging and crystallizing, this made local town halls important purveyors of nationalism.</p>
<p>Soon after the introduction of the 1898 Act, the Municipal Council finally had some success in the campaign to expand its territory, when the Dublin Boundaries Act (1900) was passed. During the committee hearings on the legislation Kilmainham and Drumcondra councils, labor and nationalist respectively, negotiated terms and were incorporated into the city. The unionist councils of Clontarf, Rathmines, and Pembroke observed these developments with great anxiety. As the voice of the unionist establishment, the <italic>Irish Times</italic> defended the three remaining townships whose identity was threatened by “predatory patriots.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0096144212449144">19</xref></sup> A strong class identity was also evident in this coverage:
<disp-quote>
<p>The ratepayers [in Clontarf, Rathmines, and Pembroke] are chiefly the professional and businessmen of Dublin, together with shopkeepers of the higher class . . . the great majority is, of course, Unionist in politics. In the area within the authority of the Corporation [Municipal Council] it is different. Here all power is in the hands of the Nationalists. . . . We cannot think that there is any sound reason for asking the Unionist townships to place themselves under the heel of a hostile majority.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0096144212449144">20</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Successive governments had attempted to regularize the administration of the Dublin region but had been thwarted by unionist defenders in the House of Lords. Urban reform and modern notions of municipal government demanded that some mechanism be found to allow Dublin to prosper and expand as Belfast, Glasgow, or any other British city had done. The clash of national identities, often obscured behind technical or financial arguments, continued to block the unification of the city and suburbs. In an effort to form a consensus, parliament took the unusual decision to establish a joint committee of the Commons and Lords to investigate the 1900 boundary bill. Edward Carson again joined the debate, protesting at this procedural innovation. He claimed that the government was attempting to stifle the Lords, just as they had tried (and failed) to coerce them over earlier Dublin boundary legislation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0096144212449144">21</xref></sup> Sir Ughtred K. Shuttleworth, a Liberal with experience in the Admiralty and India, was appointed as committee chairman.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0096144212449144">22</xref></sup> Throughout the hearings, he struggled to keep the suburban witnesses to the matter at hand, repeatedly interrupting evidence of past grievances or allegations of Dublin’s historical maladministration. He would not allow discussion of political matters. Unfortunately, unionists believed that “political matters” meant any policy not in line with British national identity, while nationalists regarded all expressions of Britishness as political. In response to the townships’ attacks, Dublin Municipal Council defended its financial reputation and pointed to recent improvements in its operations.</p>
<p>Shuttleworth’s attempts to avoid politics were destined to fail—in Dublin, even the drains were politicized. Much of the evidence dealt with the region’s sewerage system, or systems. The city was finalizing a major treatment plant beyond Dublin port. The removal of this major nuisance from the River Liffey, however, merely focused attention on the untreated sewage that Rathmines and Pembroke discharged on nearby Sandymount strand. An unfortunate tidal flow drew this out into the bay and carried it upriver into the city on the incoming tide. Clearly, this would not endear the unionists to Dubliners, many of whom worked on the Liffey and all of whom crossed it daily. Meanwhile, Clontarf’s overburdened network of sewers poured onto the northern shore of the bay. A major investment was planned to improve that district’s sewers and carry the outflow further offshore. Logic and economics showed that both the Clontarf and Rathmines-Pembroke systems should be joined to the new Dublin network, but the suburbs were determined to remain independent of the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0096144212449144">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Shuttleworth committee recommended, and parliament agreed, that owing to the enormous cost of improvements required in Clontarf, and the small population to be burdened with the repayments, the district should be amalgamated with Dublin city. The new city boundaries were also to encompass Kilmainham and Drumcondra, subject to their demands regarding tax levels and working-class housing being met. In response to the complaint that suburban residents enjoyed municipal facilities without paying for them, the committee ordered that Rathmines and Pembroke contribute annually to the city’s revenue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0096144212449144">24</xref></sup> A single drainage board was established for the entire region. Despite this rationalization of administration, however, Rathmines and Pembroke remained politically independent.</p>
<p>The negotiated entry of Kilmainham and Drumcondra into the city created a problem for the southern districts’ resistance. In exchange for their compliance, the northern and western councils had won valuable concessions for their ratepayers; unionists could no longer defend the principle of inviolable suburban independence. Counsel for Rathmines, however, presented the negotiations as merely a ploy to squeeze the remaining suburbs into the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0096144212449144">25</xref></sup> There was evidently something different about Clontarf, Rathmines, and Pembroke. This difference is illustrated by the comments of a witness appearing for Pembroke who caused a stir by blaming the city’s slum and sanitation problems on the liquor trade. He and his colleagues in the temperance movement counted thirteen publicans on the Municipal Council. Temperance was a respectable middle-class political platform in many British cities but was practically unknown as a force in Dublin. Its appearance in the suburbs illustrates a difference in social values between the UDCs and the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0096144212449144">26</xref></sup> Later in the committee hearings, however, the city’s counsel went to the heart of the matter when he remarked that resistant suburbs presented the case as if it were “Savoy and Nice, or the Philippines being handed over the United States. . . . It was not a case of the townships being governed as a Crown colony under annexation. The rule would be mutual.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0096144212449144">27</xref></sup> Clearly, resistance to annexation did not rest on a general principle of suburban self-government but rather on <italic>unionist</italic> self-government. Beneath the technical arguments and broad criticisms lay the question of national identity.</p>
<p>Despite Shuttleworth’s efforts to keep politics out of the proceedings, the result of his investigation recognized the social and political reality on the ground. Negotiation had brought in the two suburbs with nationalist or labor identities. Despite its opposition, unionist Clontarf was annexed for sound organizational reasons. The district was also geographically isolated between the expanded municipal boundary and the sea. Administrative logic had produced a cost-effective regional solution to the drainage problem. Rathmines and Pembroke were forced to give up money and some infrastructural control, thus proving the city’s fundamental argument. Significantly, however, these prestigious suburbs retained their local councils. By sacrificing Clontarf, Shuttleworth had saved the southside from annexation for another generation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0096144212449144">28</xref></sup> Once again, a great deal of energy and expense had been expended on resisting an apparently logical consequence of urban growth and government legislation. In preserving the independence of the southern suburbs, the joint committee tacitly acknowledged the importance of these local councils as expressions of their residents’ British and middle-class identity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0096144212449144">
<title>Expressions of Identity</title>
<p>In the late Victorian and Edwardian eras, the political power of the British crown declined, but its symbolic importance increased. Royal visits to cities in the United Kingdom were populist, rather than political, events. Dublin’s unionist township councils felt that this should be the case. Municipal nationalists, however, resented the popular enjoyment of such festivities, fearing any consolidation of royalist sentiment and confusion of nationalist aspirations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0096144212449144">29</xref></sup> Large crowds, drawn by a combination of curiosity, spectacle, celebrity, loyalty, affection, and fun, turned out in the city and suburbs for all royal visits. For the nationalist politicians, the nub of the problem was the question of whether to present a “traditional Irish welcome,” the formal address to the sovereign. This quandary recurred throughout the period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0096144212449144">30</xref></sup> Presenting an address might create the impression that nationalists had lost their enthusiasm for Home Rule, or it might allow unionist newspapers to make such a claim. At the same time, councillors were reluctant to deliver a personal insult to a distinguished visitor by refusing to offer a welcome.</p>
<p>After an absence of thirty-nine years, Queen Victoria visited Ireland in April 1900. There was intense discussion in the press over the correct nationalist reception of the revered empress. At the time of the visit, public concern was raised over the ethics and conduct of the Boer War, in which many Irish soldiers were engaged. In March 1900 the Municipal Council had passed a motion criticizing the war and praising the enemy’s resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0096144212449144">31</xref></sup> Nine days later, a special meeting of the Municipal Council approved the text of a “hearty welcome” for the royal visit. They acknowledged that the queen came among them “above and apart from all political questions” and assured her of a <italic>Céad Míle Fáilte</italic> (a hundred thousand welcomes) on any subsequent visits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0096144212449144">32</xref></sup> Politics were never far away however. At the next meeting, Councillor Timothy Harrington, MP, a senior nationalist and opponent of the original address, claimed that the unionist press had misrepresented the Council’s action as an abandonment of the call for Home Rule.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0096144212449144">33</xref></sup> Nationalist public opinion was stirred up and many councillors stepped back from their initial position. The council adopted Harrington’s amendment that
<disp-quote>
<p>this Council, assembled on the centenary of the Act of Union, hereby declares that this Act was obtained by fraud and shameful corruption; that the people of this country can never give to the system of government so established their loyal support; and that, so far as the vast body of the people are concerned, there will be neither contentment nor loyalty in this country until our National Parliament is restored.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0096144212449144">34</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite some heated exchanges Blackrock Council, with its strong unionist minority, voted to present an address of welcome. In their welcome the councillors expressed the hope that a royal residence might be established in near Dublin; modesty apparently prevented them from explicitly suggesting Blackrock. Reflecting a loyal attitude toward the war, they pointed out that many local inhabitants were among the brave Irishmen fighting in South Africa. The unsuccessful opponents of this address condemned it as “the action of the loyal minority and their National Associates.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0096144212449144">35</xref></sup> It was customary for the queen to confer a knighthood on the civic dignitary presenting a loyal address. Referring to this, and the political capital which unionists could make from the event, the opponents claimed that the visit was being commandeered for “selfish and ulterior motives.” Ireland, they insisted, could only give a genuine welcome when she had regained her self-government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0096144212449144">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is noteworthy that opponents of a royal welcome in both the city and Blackrock made a distinction between loyalty to the crown and acceptance of the constitutional arrangement of the United Kingdom. Nationalists on local councils and in parliament campaigned for the repeal of the Act of Union of 1800 and the introduction of Home Rule, which they envisaged as legislative independence or dominion status. They did not seek independence from the crown or the establishment of a republic outside the empire. By withholding a royal welcome, or by offering a half-hearted one, they hoped to draw attention to their demands. Expressions of regret at their inability to offer a full and proper greeting indicate a tacit acceptance of Victoria as their queen. No such finesse was required in Kingstown, Pembroke, or Rathmines. Each of these councils resolved unanimously to present a wholehearted declaration of loyalty and welcome.</p>
<p>When Victoria died in January 1901, unionist Councillor Andrew Beattie failed to have a resolution of condolence to the royal family adopted by the Municipal Council.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0096144212449144">37</xref></sup> This was a startling development. Resolutions of condolence were a constant feature of council business and were the standard response to the death of a major public figure. Councils also expressed sympathy over deaths nearer home, sending copies of the resolution to the families of deceased councillors and prominent locals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0096144212449144">38</xref></sup> Apart from the social niceties involved in such exchanges, it is clear that death and condolences transcended political divisions. Councillors who resolutely opposed each other in the chamber would be the first to propose a resolution of sympathy to their bereaved opponent. While the wording of Beattie’s motion was distinctly loyal, it was nonetheless addressed to a bereaved family. It was most unusual for such sentiments to be the cause of a division, let alone to be voted down. All the remaining suburban councils passed resolutions of condolence. Pembroke took the opportunity to assure the new King Edward VII of their devotion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0096144212449144">39</xref></sup> Unfortunately, his coronation raised another problem for nationalists, or more precisely for Roman Catholics. As head of the Anglican Church, the king was to swear that he did not subscribe to a range of Roman Catholic beliefs and practices. The Municipal Council protested that they “deprecate and resent the insult offered to Roman Catholics by the terms of the Oath taken by the King.” The Protestant members of the council were keen to avoid a divisive religious debate, but their compromise wording for the protest was rejected.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0096144212449144">40</xref></sup> On this occasion the issue faded away; however, the coronation oath would arise as a more substantial controversy at the end of the decade.</p>
<p>Edward VII was personally popular with Irish nationalists who saw him as a gregarious sporting man, but the Municipal and Blackrock Councils declined to congratulate him on his coronation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0096144212449144">41</xref></sup> City Hall banned street decorations celebrating the occasion and, in a fractious debate, the Lord Mayor Tim Harrington MP adhered to nationalist policy by refusing to attend the coronation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0096144212449144">42</xref></sup> Interestingly, when he arrived in person in July 1903, the king was greeted by addresses from every council. The Municipal Council held two special meetings on the question. The first ended in disarray while the second rejected a wording that called for Home Rule, choosing instead to offer the King a “hearty welcome to the Capital City of [his] Kingdom of Ireland.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0096144212449144">43</xref></sup> Insulting a guest to his face was evidently a step too far. Blackrock Council, still finely balanced between nationalists and unionists, had a comfortable majority in favor of an address, though a reference to Home Rule was rejected by a smaller margin.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0096144212449144">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Elsewhere, things were much simpler. In Kingstown, the motion for an address was carried almost unanimously. As usual, arrangements for a royal welcome in Rathmines and Pembroke were undisputed. Edward’s 1903 visit was generally viewed as a popular and diplomatic success and hence the 1904 royal tour, primarily to the races and to stay at some country houses, was less contentious. Throughout this period, the unionist boroughs presented illuminated scrolls to a succession of senior and junior royals. They regularly decorated their townships in patriotic colours and granted council workers the day off for the big event. For the visit of Victoria in 1900, and Edward in 1903, ceremonial gates were built by the townships on the city boundary. To the casual observer it might appear that the ancient city was welcoming the royal party when actually, beyond the temporary gateways, the city fathers were debating the level of subtlety with which they should snub the monarch.</p>
<p>During 1907 an International Exhibition was held at Herbert Park, in Pembroke District. In July the exhibition hosted a visit by the King and Queen. This reopened the debate on addresses of welcome. The Municipal Council passed a resolution in favor of Home Rule on July 1 and resolved not to present an address of welcome.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0096144212449144">45</xref></sup> Once again Blackrock Council’s nationalists failed to block a motion in favor of an address, the text of which repeated the call for a royal residence in the vicinity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0096144212449144">46</xref></sup> A similar attempt to block Kingstown’s address with a Home Rule motion was easily defeated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0096144212449144">47</xref></sup> Pembroke, at the heart of the action, made a point of resolving that the entire council be involved in drafting the address. This was presented in person and council was deeply gratified to receive a personal reply from the king.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0096144212449144">48</xref></sup> Despite the hardening nationalist attitude in the city, the 1907 visit was regarded as a third success, so it is unsurprising that there was genuine regret at Edward VII’s death in May 1910. On this occasion, every council passed a motion of condolence; in Blackrock an ardent nationalist even proposed the vote. The only discordant note was in the Municipal Council, where the seven Sinn Féin members opposed a fulsome tribute to the late king. This new party, founded in 1905, out-flanked the established nationalists of the Irish Parliamentary Party with a radical blend of Gaelic activism and a rejection of all things British. Presented in Irish historiography as a movement of national independence, it should be noted that Sinn Féin had much in common with earlier municipal reform movements in Britain and North America. Like other reform movements, its immediate aim was to fight corruption and waste on the Municipal Council and to oppose the complacent establishment (in the case of Dublin, a clique of publicans and builders). Party members, in this early period, tended to be younger, teetotal, white-collar, and middle class.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0096144212449144">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>With a royal death came a coronation and the delicate matter of the oath. Protests against its anti-Catholic wording were louder and more widespread than on the accession of Edward VII. Irish Catholic opinion was deeply offended by George V’s sworn statement that “the invocation or adoration of the Virgin Mary or any other saint, and the Sacrifice of the Mass as they are now used in the Church of Rome, are Superstitious and Idolatrous.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0096144212449144">50</xref></sup> A motion of protest was tabled for the Municipal Council meeting of May 25, 1910. Only nationalist councillors turned up. Six unionist members sent a telegram explaining that, as the motion for discussion “practically advocates the entire abolition of the Coronation Oath,” it only could involve them and others in an acrimonious debate. They therefore decided to absent themselves from the meeting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0096144212449144">51</xref></sup> The unionists’ plan to avoid a fight was a novel ploy, but it merely attracted additional publicity for the nationalist motion. Confrontation was unavoidable. Invoking an ancient right granted by royal charter, the council resolved to present a petition against the oath at the Bar of the House of Commons. Sinn Féin’s abstentionist amendment that “we do not think it dignified to now beg at the Bar of the English Parliament in the matter of the blasphemous declaration taken by the English King on his accession” was ruled out of order.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0096144212449144">52</xref></sup> Following its unanimity over the condolences for King Edward, Blackrock Council held a special meeting on the oath. Unionist and nationalist members agreed to a sensitively worded resolution seeking the urgent removal of “that part of the King’s coronation oath which is so offensive and hurtful to his Catholic subjects.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0096144212449144">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>Away from such dramatic crises, national identity was also marked out symbolically in the built environment. The city’s street furniture typically carried the shamrock motif, by the 1890s the standard symbol of Irishness. In contrast, Rathmines’s lamp standards avoided such iconography, while Pembroke’s electricity junction boxes displayed a large earl’s coronet—unremarkable in Britain perhaps but a clear statement on a Dublin street corner.</p>

</fig>
<p>Since the mid-nineteenth century, nationalist city councillors had changed selected street names to reflect the nationalist sympathies of their electorate. Thus Great Britain Street was renamed Parnell Street, after the renowned but flawed parliamentary leader, and Carlisle Bridge forgot its viceregal patron and remembered Daniel O’Connell, the midcentury nationalist leader and the city’s first Catholic Lord Mayor since 1690. The council’s social and ceremonial functions were also used to symbolize Irish nationalist identity. The Gaelic League corresponded regularly with the Municipal Council. Officially nonpolitical, the league promoted the use of the Irish language and staged Gaelic cultural events. Its successful lobbying resulted in Municipal stationery, and signage on streets, offices, and dustcarts being presented in both Irish and English. At the same time the Gaelic Athletic Association, with a more evidently political slant, drew large crowds to traditional Irish field sports. City councillors cooperated with both organizations, sending delegations to congresses and attending gala-days in their municipal robes.</p>
<p>The Gaelic League wrote to the UDCs too. They invited councillors to pageants, and lobbied for Irish language classes in the councils’ technical colleges. Pembroke and Kingstown’s initial cooperation soon faded as the League’s nationalist agenda became apparent. Rathmines, however, remained aloof from such “Irishry.” An account of life in Dublin at the time gives an idea of the difference between the atmosphere in Rathmines and the city.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Crossing over the Portobello Bridge [into Rathmines] you found yourself in another world, and sensed an indefinably different atmosphere from that of the city you had just left. The first thing that brought it home to you was the sprinkling of Union Jacks flying from numbers of the shops, and sometimes even from the tall towers of the conspicuous Town Hall . . . there were, at all times, a few on display. The typical Rathminesian . . . was a remarkable type. He had developed a most peculiar accent which, immediately he opened his mouth, revealed his venue . . . it was what the “Rathmines Johnny” . . . thought was a good-class English accent. [He] was terrifically, indeed embarrassingly loyal to King and Empire, on certain aspects of which, its army and navy for example, and its world-wide conquests, he was intensely interested and extremely well-informed. After that, his big interest was the delectable “loyal burgh” of Rathmines. As for Ireland, for the greater part of it at all events, his interest was nil.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0096144212449144">54</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It should be noted that this “Rathmines Johnny” could usually trace his Dublin-born ancestry back for many generations. A decade later, a female “Rathminesian” appeared on the Dublin stage. In a brief scene during “The Plough and the Stars,” Seán O’Casey’s iconic play of tenement life during the 1916 Easter Rising, an unnamed “woman from Rathmines” finds herself lost amid the slums as the fighting continues all around:
<disp-quote>
<p>(A fashionably dressed, middle-aged, stout woman comes hurriedly in, and makes for the group. She is almost fainting from fear.)</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<speaker>THE WOMAN:</speaker>
<p>For Gawd’s sake, will one of you kind men show any safe way for me to get to Wrathmines? . . .

Oh, isn’t this awful? . . . I’m so different from others. . . . Wasn’t it an awful thing for me to leave my friend’s house? Wasn’t it an idiotic thing to do? . . . I haven’t the slightest idea where I am.</p>

</speech>
<p>O’Casey’s stage directions, along with the woman’s accent, smart clothes, and political naïveté, clearly mark her out as “other” in the decrepit inner city. When the play was first staged in 1926 at Dublin’s Abbey Theatre, audiences could readily identify the character and laugh at the response from Peter, a tenement-dweller. By this time, however, the Irish Free State had been established, turning the question of annexation and nationality on its head.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0096144212449144">
<title>Civil Society, Councils, and Identity</title>
<p>The heated dispute over annexation, and the distinctive atmospheres in the city and suburbs, had a deeper significance. Why did parliament arrange a complicated compromise to maintain suburban independence? The relationship between civil society and local councils is central to the explanation. Civil society exists, according to Richard Rodger and Robert Colls, “in the area between family and the state, or the individual and the state; in non-state institutions which organise citizens for political participation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0096144212449144">56</xref></sup> Rodger and Colls argue that “urban association was an important element in class formation, cultural hegemony and ethnic inclusion and exclusion.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0096144212449144">57</xref></sup> In Victorian civil society, therefore, class relations played a significant role; the middle and upper classes dispensed assistance to the deserving poor through charitable and benevolent institutions. In theory, members of such bodies came into contact with a wider social milieu than in their usual ethnic or religious networks, thus helping to unite a diverse class or population. Such theories, however, do not explain the situation in Dublin city and suburbs; here two civil societies are evident. Comparing the entries for charity and welfare organizations across the Dublin region, listed in Thom’s Street Directory and Official Guide for 1900 and 1914, shows an interesting trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0096144212449144">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>More than two hundred charities operated in the region; their names and choice of patrons indicate much about the polarized cultural and national identity of their members.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0096144212449144">58</xref></sup> In 1900, Protestant groups accounted for 45 percent of the total; 16 percent were Catholic and 33 percent were nondenominational. A fifth of all charities had royal or noble patrons. By 1914 the Protestant figure dropped to 37 percent; 20 percent were Catholic and 40 percent nondenominational. The number of royal and noble patrons had halved. Given the strong denominational identity of most of these charities, it is unlikely that members moved from Protestant organizations to Catholic ones. The trend suggests that Protestant/unionist civil society was contracting, as was identification with the crown. This had repercussions for local politics in the city and suburban councils.</p>
<p>Two theories on civil society are useful in analyzing this trend. Discussing urban government in Canada, Norton Long argued that the ideal city government linked grassroots communities to the wider state, but the council and state must be “instrumentally and ethically articulated.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0096144212449144">59</xref></sup> In other words, the two are bound together as the hand and arm are joined by the wrist, in a firm yet flexible joint. The flexibility of these links is important as it allows for some independence of movement within limits set by the state. There is a legal connection (Long’s instrumental link) through which the council gets its authority from central government. Long says, however, that there must also be an ethical link, a broad sense of shared purpose and identity. Consideration of this ethical link is important when the theory is applied to Dublin’s urban governments.</p>
<p>The second theory is presented by Graeme Morton, in an article on Scottish municipal government. Morton proposes that the city council is crucial to the success of civil society, stating that civil society “succeeds because of self-administration from the municipality.” The elected members in the council chamber represent the values and aspirations of their voting neighbors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0096144212449144">60</xref></sup> Morton argues that an exchange occurs; the state engages and empowers civil society by involving it in council activities (community representatives on the likes of education and library committees or police boards), and in return civil society legitimizes the state. This model works well in Edinburgh, but calls for further consideration when applied to the situation in Dublin—the United Kingdom’s other deposed capital.</p>
<p>Viewing Dublin’s diverse cluster of councils through this theoretical lens reveals social and political relationships in a fresh light. Unlike the position in most British cities, the absence of an overarching “Greater Dublin Council” representing a common ethical vision meant that civil society could not bind the populace together. This absence hampered social integration between the city and suburbs. By the same token, this fractured civil society meant that such an overarching municipal authority could not emerge; as illustrated by the anti-annexation campaign. Instead, a sort of proto-apartheid of separate townships emerged, each with its own elected council exercising its own powers and representing its own discrete civil society.</p>
<p>Long’s theory of “ethical articulation” proposes that the city and state should operate in harmony, but Dublin Municipal Council was increasingly at odds with the state’s ethos. The gap is best symbolized by the dispute over the coronation oath. As head of state and church, the king symbolized the United Kingdom’s Protestant (or in the case of the oath, anti-Catholic) values. At a time of growing identification between Irish nationalism and Roman Catholicism, this was deeply offensive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0096144212449144">61</xref></sup> Under these circumstances, Morton’s exchange between civil society and state could not occur. The state continued to enshrine and empower Dublin’s two civil societies, but nationalist civil society declined to legitimize the state in return. City councillors refused invitations to state functions, choosing instead to attend Gaelic League rallies and to rename streets after Irish nationalist heroes. Although bound to the state by legislation, the expanded remit of municipal government was used to undermine Dublin’s already tenuous ethical articulation with the United Kingdom. The municipality could no longer form a supple joint linking its Catholic, nationalist, and increasingly Gaelic civil society to the UK state.</p>
<p>As the two national identities in the city and the southern suburbs grew more distinct, the annexation question became more critical. Theoretically, each civil society succeeded because of its municipality, and each municipality or local council formed a flexible joint between its community’s ethos and that of the state. Thus, if Dublin expanded to govern the southern townships, it would sever the link between the suburban unionist, Protestant, and middle-class civil society and the British state with which it identified. Much more than local loyalty was at stake. Unionist civil society could not succeed through a nationalist municipality. These civil societies were not just separate; they were in competition with one another through their local councils. In energetically defending their townships, the suburban unionists were, consciously or unconsciously, defending their national identity.</p>
<p>Tracing the evolution of Dublin’s local councils into the period of the revolution, and the early years of independence, supports this analysis. During the Irish War of Independence (1919-1920) the underground revolutionary parliament established a Department of Local Government. Through this body the nascent Irish state claimed the allegiance of all local councils. Dublin’s Municipal Council could now attach itself to a state whose values it shared, one with which it was truly ethically articulated. While wartime conditions tested these new administrative links, the inconvenience was outweighed by the legitimacy that nationalist civil society conferred the new state through the Municipal Council. Rathmines and Pembroke district councils did not reply to the putative claim on their allegiance.</p>
<p>In 1925, within a few years of the establishment of the Irish Free State, the new government set about abolishing selected district councils. Curiously, it chose to dissolve Dublin Municipal Council, while leaving the councils for Rathmines and Pembroke in place. Particular political realities connected to the bitter civil war (1922-1923) contributed to the decision to shut down City Hall, but the survival of the southern townships is revealing. At a time of tremendous social and political upheaval, their reassuring continuity comforted suburban unionists and allowed their civil society to regard the new dispensation with less suspicion. This implicit recognition of the gap between the national identities of the new state and the old suburbs underscores the importance of cities, even mini-cities like Rathmines and Pembroke, as purveyors of nationalism. The Irish government set up yet another commission to look into local administration in the region. In 1929, after a period of adjustment, the Greater Dublin Act finally amalgamated the populations of Rathmines and Pembroke with that of the city.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>What does Dublin’s unusual cluster of councils add to the debate about cities and nationalisms? The importance of local government grew dramatically in this period. City and township councils profoundly influenced the lives of their local populations. The depth of this relationship fostered a strong shared identity linking the people with their local town hall. Independent councils, with strong electoral mandates, represented neighboring but divergent cultures. Dublin’s annexation dispute was actually a clash of national identities.</p>
<p>The emergence of Dublin’s suburban councils during the nineteenth century was a response to the evolving sense of both British and Irish nationalisms. While the patchwork of local administrations hampered Dublin’s modernization and growth, it also helped reduce communal tensions. Violent sectarianism was far less common than in Belfast or Liverpool. Each community in Dublin had its own civil society, which could succeed through its own municipality. Suburban unionists saw their identity reflected in crown motifs on council stationery, and the illumination of their town halls for military victories and royal occasions. City nationalists felt affirmed by the use of the Irish language on street signs and the honoring of nationalist heroes as Freemen of the City. Unlike the wider municipal elections in Belfast or Liverpool, opposing local candidates in Dublin city and suburbs competed in separate arenas. Both nationalist and unionist voters could feel sure of victory. This analysis of Dublin’s mosaic of councils also contributes to the broader field of Urban History, by testing and refining theories relating to civil society and urban government.</p>
<p>Dublin’s story has implications for Irish history more generally. Cities have not figured significantly in Irish historical research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0096144212449144">62</xref></sup> In the mid-twentieth century, “Dublin was still viewed as somewhat outside mainstream Irish life.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0096144212449144">63</xref></sup> By appreciating urban identities, with their conflicts and compromises, we gain a more nuanced understanding of Ireland’s contested place within the United Kingdom, and of the developing independence movement. Researching the self-governing unionist enclaves can give insights into the establishment of Northern Ireland in 1922.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0096144212449144">64</xref></sup> Placing Dublin in its United Kingdom context reveals the urban challenges that faced central government and the strategies it developed to address them. Seeing Dublin as a city of the United Kingdom can more readily promote fruitful comparisons and contrasts with other British cities, especially Liverpool with its working-class Tory bosses, and the sectarian tensions it shared with Glasgow.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0096144212449144">65</xref></sup> A comparative approach of this kind raises the question of why Dublin failed to develop an Irish version of the Scottish “unionist nationalism” adopted so successfully by Edinburgh.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0096144212449144">66</xref></sup> The annexation struggle, and the unionist defence of suburban “Home Rule,” are significant when considering the failure of the Union, and the emergence of both Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State.</p>

A joint committee had recently investigated Scottish private legislation; this was the first use of such a committee on an Irish bill. Complaints about the cost of private members’ legislation appeared in both the British and Irish press at this time. The waste involved in promoters and opponents attending weeks of committee meetings in the Commons, only to repeat the exercise in the Lords, was forcing a change of procedure.</p></fn>

<p>Harrington was both a municipal councillor and a member of parliament at Westminster. There were typically two nationalist MPs on the Municipal Council during this period and two among the suburban councils. Edward Carson, MP, while not himself a councillor, had a family connection with Pembroke Council and constantly supported suburban unionist interests in parliament. These links with the national arena support the proposition that more than gas and drains were at stake in Dublin’s local politics.</p></fn>

<p>“Loyal” was a nationalist term of abuse for unionists. The expression “National Associates” was used here by hard-line nationalists to pillory their more moderate competitors. In 1905, the far more radical and nationalist Sinn Féin movement would emerge, making the factional differences between nationalists in 1900 appear very minor indeed.</p></fn>

<p>This may stem from the prominence of the Land War in the 1880s, a rural bias in mid-twentieth-century Irish attitudes and ambivalence about the place of the urban in Irish identity. Credit is due to the Royal Irish Academy for the important contribution to Irish urban history made by the Irish Historic Towns Atlas, Vols. I–XX, since 1981. These fascicles are a valuable resource; research is underway for the edition covering nineteenth-century Dublin.</p></fn>

<p><bold>Ciarán Wallace</bold> completed a PhD in 2010 at Trinity College, Dublin. His primary research interests are early-twentieth-century local politics in Dublin city and suburbs, focusing on the role of civil society in political life. He has a broad interest in Irish urban history from the nineteenth century and its place in the United Kingdom framework, and wider international context. His article “Joseph P. Nannetti, Lord Mayor 1906-08: ‘A Rather Mild Sort of Rebel’” is due for publication in early 2011. Ciarán is a member of the Economic &amp; Social History Association of Ireland, and the Dublin City Research Group. He is currently a Government of Ireland Postdoctoral Fellow at the Centre for Contemporary Irish History in Trinity College, Dublin, where he is working on a monograph <italic>Divided City: Dublin and its Unionist Suburbs 1900-1916</italic>.</p>
