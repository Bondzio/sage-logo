<abstract>
<p>In this case report we describe the first non-fatal herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSE) case with natalizumab for multiple sclerosis (MS). A 36-year-old woman, previously treated with immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive drugs for MS, developed acute encephalitis after 6 monthly natalizumab perfusions. Brain imaging demonstrated suggestive bi-temporal lesions. Herpes simplex virus type-1 DNA was detected in cerebrospinal fluid. The patient improved gradually after a 21-day course of intravenous acyclovir, but neuropsychiatric changes remained 5 months later. Our non-fatal case of HSE and other reported cases of herpes infections provide evidence of an increased risk with natalizumab and point to the need for clinicians to maintain awareness.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>We report a non-fatal case of herpes simplex virus type-1 encephalitis (HSE) in a woman with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) during natalizumab therapy. Only one other fatal HSE case with natalizumab is known in the postmarketing experience.</p>

<title>Case report</title>
<p>A 36-year-old woman began monthly intravenous (IV) perfusions with natalizumab in June 2010 and was recruited in an observational TOP survey study. The patient had been diagnosed with RRMS 7 years earlier. She had no other relevant medical history. Before initiating natalizumab, she received immunomodulatory drugs with weekly intra-muscular interferon beta-1-a injections between October 2003 and July 2005, glatiramer acetate between August 2005 and April 2008, and mycophenolate mophetil in October 2009. A relapse, with ocular neuritis and sensory–motor symptoms, occurred in March 2010 and was treated with high doses of IV methylprednisolone for two 3-day courses in March and in April 2010. Owing to insufficient recovery, IV immunoglobulins were administrated for a 5-day course in May 2010.</p>
<p>Nine days after the 6th perfusion of natalizumab in December 2010, she was admitted to the emergency department for a secondary generalized seizure. Two days after, she developed hyperthermia, confusion and a second generalized seizure. Neurological examination confirmed aphasia and acute memory impairment. Brain CT scan showed a vast hypodensity in the right temporal lobe. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed 14 leukocytes/mm<sup>3</sup> with lymphocytic predominance, normal protein and glucose levels. Gram staining was negative for organisms. Empirical antiviral treatment (acyclovir 15 mg/kg every 8 hours) and levetiracetam were started. First brain MRI scans demonstrated left temporal and insular, cortico-subcortical and white matter hypo-intensity on T1, with correspondent hyper-intensity on T2-weighted, diffusion and proton density images and smaller but similar abnormalities in the right temporal lobe. A contrast enhancement (CE) in the left hippocampic region was noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511428082">Figure 1</xref>). Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed theta and delta activities located on the left temporal region (no pseudo-periodic complex). The occurrence of electrical seizure without clinical manifestation in the left temporal lobe was noted during second EEG hyperventilation. CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type-1 was positive. Bacterial culture and PCR for JC virus were negative. MRI scans, repeated 7 days after, showed no change except a decrease in CE. Control CSF samples were still positive for HSV-1 DNA after 5 days with acyclovir treatment, and then became negative after 13 days. IV acyclovir was continued for a 21-day course. Aphasia and confusion improved gradually. However, she kept neuropsychiatric changes over the following 5 months. The final cognitive evaluation confirmed persistent and severe episodic memory defect with anosognosia and mild aphasia. Executive functions were significantly improved. It was decided to resume subcutaneous interferon beta-1-a injection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Natalizumab is approved for the treatment of patients with RRMS who have failed other disease-modifying therapies or who have aggressive disease. This agent contains humanized neutralizing IgG4κ monoclonal antibodies against leukocytes α4 integrins found on lymphocytes and monocytes. It exerts its biologic effect by abrogating movements of mononuclear leucocytes to the CNS. Natalizumab offers targeted and localized immunosuppression and was shown to be dramatically effective in two phase III clinical trials. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511428082">1</xref></sup> Progressive multiple leukoencephalopathy (PML) caused by reactivation of a clinically latent JC polyomavirus is known to occur after 1 year of natalizumab treatment with a frequency of 1–2 per 1000 treated patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511428082">2</xref></sup> Consequently, clinical vigilance and rapid evaluation with MRI scans and CSF analysis are recommended for new neurological complaints that might be early signs of PML. Natalizumab is less clearly linked to an increased risk of other viral infection, although it is suggested that viral reactivation would not be limited to JC virus. Human herpes virus type-6 may be reactivated in patients with MS receiving natalizumab.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511428082">3</xref></sup> In the MS clinical trials, infectious complications others than PML were infrequent, but there was a small excess of herpes infections in patients on natalizumab. Post-marketing reports disclosed one case of fatal HSE, and one non-fatal case of HSV meningitis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511428082">1</xref></sup> but no clinical details are publicly available. Recently, a first case of HSV-2 meningitis was described in a MS patient on monthly natalizumab.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511428082">4</xref></sup> Finally, cutaneous HSV reactivations seem three times more prevalent in MS patients on natalizumab.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511428082">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>HSE is a rare disease in the general population, with an annual incidence of 1–2 cases per 1,000,000 habitants and has not been traditionally associated with immunodeficiency. However, recent studies suggest that some paediatric cases of HSE may be linked to defects in interferon pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511428082">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511428082">7</xref></sup> How natalizumab therapy affects the pathogenesis and prognosis of HSE in humans has not been studied, but the lack of immune response in CNS related to natalizumab might be responsible for a more aggressive form of HSE. However, the positive response to acyclovir in our patient is encouraging. This could emphasize the critical need for early diagnosis. HSV infection has been associated with other monoclonal antibodies. Drugs inducing T-cell depletion such as OKT-3 and alemtuzumab are associated with an increased risk of viral encephalitis after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511428082">8</xref></sup> Cutaneous HSV infections (8%) and one case of viral meningitis were reported in a recent study of alemtuzumab for early MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511428082">9</xref></sup> An association between HSE and anti-TNF-α drugs (infliximab and adalimumab) has been described in three patients with rheumatologic disorders. However, methotrexate and corticosteroids were given in association to two of these three patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511428082">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>We identified the first case (to the best of the authors’ knowledge) of an adult who developed HSE during treatment with natalizumab and significantly improved after receiving acyclovir therapy. These reported cases of severe HSV infections suggest that patients receiving natalizumab may have an increased risk of HSE or HSV meningitis. Additional clinical studies are required to document the strength and mechanisms of this association. As early diagnosis and treatment are the keys to a better prognosis, neurologists should be aware that severe herpes infections may occur during natalizumab treatment. PML should be suspected in a patient on natalizumab presenting a first seizure, but also HSE. Each new case should be reported to local survey administration.</p>
