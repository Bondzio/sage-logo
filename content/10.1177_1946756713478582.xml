<p>Our world may run low on oil, freshwater, farmland, and a host of other necessities of life, but it will never run low on the human capacity to innovate—and this last resource is what can save us, asserts acclaimed transhumanist author and speaker Ramez Naam in <italic>The Infinite Resource</italic>. He surmises that the many environmental and technological challenges confronting our species today are merely temporary, and explains how human ingenuity can create a dynamic pathway forward. He writes,
<disp-quote>
<p>The human mind is the ultimate source of wealth. . . . <italic>If</italic> we make the right choices to empower human minds and encourage innovation, to steer innovation toward the solutions for our planet’s problems, and to embrace the fruits that it offers, then the future will be one of almost unimaginable health, wealth, and well-being. (p. 316)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Our unique human capacity for acquiring knowledge and using it to better our existence has wrought phenomenal improvements in human life since the dawn of our species, but particularly in the last hundred years, according to Naam. For example, life expectancy is twenty years higher worldwide than it was a century ago, and diseases that afflicted tens of millions of people are now all but eradicated. Also, food production has risen faster than population from the 1960s onward. Whereas more than half the world lived on less than $1,000 a year in 1970, less than one-fifth do now. And while only one in four residents of the developing world had electricity in 1970, seven out of ten have it today. In all, we humans have used innovation to meet and overcome a plethora of challenges to our health and well-being.</p>
<p>However, as Naam notes further, some even steeper challenges confront us now: how to continue to elevate the quality of life while curbing resource depletion and damage to Earth’s ecosystems. The supplies of oil and other fossil fuels that power life across the globe appear to have peaked, and prices for a vast number of food products, metals, and woods have risen precipitously. Global fisheries could collapse by 2050, if the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization’s estimates prove correct. And runaway global warming processes spurred on by human greenhouse-gas emissions threatens to unleash a Pandora’s box of droughts, flooding, diseases, and other harms across the globe.</p>
<p>Rising wealth, and consequently rising demand, is behind the rising prices and consumption of these goods. Many well-meaning conservationists thus call for putting a stop to economic growth and for limiting any further rise in resource consumption.</p>
<p>Naam profoundly disagrees. Most of the growth in resource use is taking place in the developing world; its citizens are just beginning to consume protein-rich diets and enjoy the same amenities of modern life enjoyed by people in the affluent nations. To put a stop to this, Naam argues, would mean consigning the developing world indefinitely to the dismal existence of grinding poverty from which its billions of residents have been striving so long to escape.</p>
<p>He tells readers of his own parents’ flight from the poverty, hunger, and rampant ill health of twentieth-century Egypt to build a better life in the United States. The developing worlds’ residents are only asking for the same chance to experience health and dignity. As creative as our species is, Naam argues, surely we can find a sustainable way to help them achieve this. He writes,
<disp-quote>
<p>On a humanitarian basis alone, we have to hope that growth can continue, and do our utmost to find a way to make it continue, while simultaneously dropping our depletion of the world by a tremendous degree (p. 100).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>He finds ample cause for hope in the various forms of renewable energy, many of which are on track to compete with coal and oil in coming years. Other practices are already enabling us to produce more food and material goods with less. Examples include replacing wild fishing with fish farms, implementing new agricultural processes to substantially raise crop output per acre, and using nanotech-constructed materials in building and construction. Naam further endorses a few innovations that, he acknowledges, are less well liked by many in the environmental movement, such as nuclear energy—which could help us wean off fossil fuels—and genetically modified crops—which reduce deforestation by allowing farmers to grow more on existing plots of land.</p>
<p>He calls upon the world community to incentivize innovation and, most importantly, the adoption of more environmentally aware practices. Governments everywhere should up their investments in technology research and development and implement laws such as cap-and-trade initiatives that impose costs on businesses for waste and pollution. All of these measures, he argues, would go far to spur creation of new antipollution technologies; the key is to channel the power of markets by offering people incentives and rewards for creating technologies that make modern life more sustainable. He writes,
<disp-quote>
<p>The market does wonders. We just have to point it in the right direction (p. 210).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Innovation brought us our present well-being, and it is the most powerful resource that we have for tackling our present challenges, Naam assures readers. If we tap into it and direct it, we can attain both an abundance of material comforts and a healthy environment. We do not have to choose one or the other. Knowledge expands the use we can get from our limited resources, and in many cases it replaces scarce resources entirely with new ones that turn out to serve us better. This is our ultimate renewable asset. He writes,
<disp-quote>
<p>Looking around, it’s hard to see any limit on our ability to generate ever more new and useful ideas that increase the comfort, convenience, health, and richness of our lives, even within the confines of finite physical resources. It may be that no such limit on the power of ideas exists. If it does exist, it’s astronomically far from where we are today. (pp. 286-287)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The <italic>Infinite Resource</italic> is a galvanizing call to the human race to live up to its full potential. Naam clearly holds great expectations for humanity’s future, and he makes a compelling case for why his readers ought to do the same.</p>
