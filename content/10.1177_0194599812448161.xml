<p>Don’t be confused by Pryor et al’s commentary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812448161">1</xref></sup> Economic models are not “flawed.” They are the basis for all health care planning. Recall that health care reform was structured around decreasing the growth of health care spending from GDP + 1.5% (the norm) to GDP + 1.0%. Our “trend model,” published in 2002 in <italic>Health Affairs</italic> (a peer-reviewed journal), applied these economic considerations to health care labor and correctly predicted today’s physician shortages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812448161">2</xref></sup> Using a similar model, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has correctly predicted physician demand 8 to 10 years hence for decades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812448161">3</xref></sup> We modified our projections in 2011 to reflect the goals of health care reform (also in a peer-reviewed journal),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812448161">4</xref></sup> and these were used by Kim et al. Can national projections like these be applied to individual specialties? Yes, as a close first approximation.</p>
<p>The failed workforce models of the past, first used by the Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Committee (GMENAC) in 1980 and later by the Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME) and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), were not based on economics, and none were peer reviewed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812448161">3</xref></sup> They assumed that future physicians would do what physicians did at the time, although payment schemes might differ and population would grow. But they ignored economic and technological progress. As a result, physician demand was consistently underpredicted (by about 100,000), and surpluses were projected.</p>
<p>In 2004, COGME jettisoned the older model and, using a variation on ours, projected shortages rather than surpluses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812448161">5</xref></sup> In a frantic response, HRSA commissioned Lewin to construct its 2008 report, quoted by Pryor et al, which cited previous frantic responses to valid projections and concluded that there is not a shortage and never will be. But shortages already existed and they have worsened, as we projected and as confirmed by 6 national panels and reports from 27 state medical and hospital associations and 23 medical specialty societies.</p>
<p>Kim et al’s paper noted that these shortages would further deepen as more women entered medicine. Pryor et al feel that the lesser work output of women is productive for society. True, women who work less are happier, have happier families, experience less burnout, and have more satisfied patients. But they produce less. It might be more “socially productive” if male physicians also worked less, but there would have to be more of them. And don’t expect too many older women to return full time, as graduates from the 1960s did in Kletke’s paper, which was cited by Pryor.</p>
<p>OTO-HNS has a serious workforce problem. Deny it if you wish, but future generations will never forgive you.</p>
