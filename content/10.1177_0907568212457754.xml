<p>Vivian G Paley’s contributions to early childhood pedagogy are well known around the world. She has been publishing her experiences and reflections for many years in books that tell and re-tell stories: children’s stories, stories about children, sometimes adults’ stories, developing and demonstrating a deep understanding of children’s culture and of their relation to the world. And by telling all these ‘small stories’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0907568212457754">Bamberg, 2008</xref>) Vivian Paley continues telling the <italic>STORY</italic> of her life with and for children.</p>
<p><italic>The Boy on the Beach</italic>, her latest book, draws on her experiences as a visitor to early childhood centres, as a sensitive and vigilant observer and as a demonstrator of what can be called her ‘method’. This method can be described as giving children opportunities to tell and play out their imaginative stories by making a ‘story table’ the cultural centre of the classroom. Carefully listening to and reflecting on these stories is at the core of this method, aiming to foster children’s relations with each other by interconnecting their stories.</p>
<p>In contrast to her earlier work, Paley’s perspective has now shifted: having retired, she no longer focuses on her own experiences as a teacher with children in her classroom, but instead on the relations between children, their teachers, and herself as an ‘outsider’. This new perspective enables her to connect children’s and teachers’ stories and interpretations at different times and in different places. <italic>The Boy on the Beach</italic> draws on a correspondence with Yu-Ching Huan, a teacher from Taiwan. It reveals Pailey’s and Huan’s reflections about children’s play and their valuable insights into children’s culture.</p>
<p>The book revolves around children’s (aged 3–6) imaginative play. Paley’s intention, though, is not on simply giving some more examples of how children play and how they deal with their problems in playing – there are indeed ‘thick descriptions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0907568212457754">Geertz, 1987</xref>) about this subject in any of her books. This time Paley tries to go even further than that: in <italic>The Boy on the Beach</italic> she is not only describing the ‘HOWs’ but instead is intending to explore the ‘WHYs’ of play. The examples in this book are examined in order to gain a deeper understanding of children’s play and their story telling. Paley takes her readers on a journey through different situations and contexts of children’s play; on that journey she introduces us to children playing with water and (imagined) fire on the shore, rescuing babies out of water holes, hurricanes in the classroom, a wolf who is mean because everyone thinks he is, and many other situations in which children create ‘common meeting places’ (p. 24) sometimes ‘in the midst of chaos’ (p. 12), as Paley puts it, quoting Virginia Woolf.</p>
<p>Is her effort successful then, we may ask? First and foremost, Paley does not come up with a theoretical model of play or with a simple answer to a complex problem: she is indeed not even intending to do so. But she and her correspondent make some proposals that are certainly worth thinking about: ‘It is all about friendship’ (p. 15) and ‘children become pretend characters in order to be necessary to other children’ (p. 28). Paley and Yu-Ching Huan develop these ideas to a description of the processes of individualization in and by playing together in the group: ‘Is this not the ultimate purpose of play? To identify each individual, as the group is brought together in friendship’ (p. 87).</p>
<p>‘Creative kindness’ (p. 29) is the key idea in this book, comprising, as Paley describes it, the essence of children’s culture inside and outside classrooms. ‘Creative kindness’ embraces children’s ability and inclination to integrate diverse actions and personalities into an imaginative framework that transforms even destructive behaviour into a contribution to an interesting performance. Not surprisingly, this poses the question whether adults’ cultures are still able to establish such common meeting places in play or elsewhere. (While Paley does not suggest an answer in this book, the reader may find that her ‘Story’ as a whole might provide some.) But it seems from her work that as sure as children need adults’ guidance to manage what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0907568212457754">Barbara Rogoff (2003)</xref> called ‘transformation of participation’, adults might sometimes use children’s guidance to manage what might be called transformation of imagination.</p>
<p><italic>The Boy on the Beach</italic> is therefore not (only) a book about some pedagogical methods but a book about children’s contribution to human culture. Readers familiar with her work will certainly appreciate this new chapter of Vivian G Paley’s Story. Other readers will find a fascinating book full of wonderful anecdotes to think about; a book full of deep insights drawing on a wealth of experience in working with children, and simply a book presenting an admirable pedagogical wisdom beyond theoretical frameworks.</p>
