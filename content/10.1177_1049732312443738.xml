<abstract>
<p>Australian mental health services have responded to the problem of depression by adopting an early intervention and recovery orientation. Using qualitative research conducted in Australia with 80 women aged 20 to 75 years, we examine how participants invoked particular metaphors to construct meaning about the gendered experience of depression and recovery. We argue that women’s stories of recovery provide a rich source of interpretive material to consider the everyday metaphors of recovery beyond clinical notions and linear models of personal change. We identified key metaphors women drew on to articulate the struggle of self-transformation through depression and recovery: the immobilizing effect of depression, recovery as a battle to control depression, and recovery as a journey of self-knowledge. Our findings might be useful for mental health professionals in a range of clinical contexts to reflect on the power of language for shaping how women interpret their experiences of recovery from depression.</p>

<p>The global problem of depression has been identified by international agencies and national governments as the third largest cause of disease burden in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312443738">Commonwealth of Australia, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732312443738">World Health Organization, 2000</xref>). Within both quantitative and qualitative social science research, recognition is growing of the gendered nature of depression as a social and individual problem affecting women and men in different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312443738">Blum &amp; Stracuzzi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312443738">Emslie, Ridge, Ziebland, &amp; Hunt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312443738">Everingham, Heading, &amp; Connor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312443738">Horwitz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312443738">Jack, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312443738">Keyes &amp; Goodman, 2006</xref>). An emerging area of exploration for health researchers is how individuals make sense of their experience of depression and find ways to describe their changing sense of (gendered) self in the process of recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312443738">Cardano, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312443738">Dowrick, Kokanovic, Hegarty, Griffiths, &amp; Gunn, 2008</xref>; Emslie, et al.). Qualitative health researchers in a range of areas have also explored how patients or health consumers use a wide range of metaphorical expressions when articulating and constructing their experiences of illness, distress, and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312443738">Aita, McIlvain, Susman, &amp; Crabtree, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312443738">Hall, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article we contribute a sociological and feminist perspective that extends the current literature by examining how women have drawn on metaphors in their everyday narratives to make sense of their experiences of depression and recovery. Through this approach we offer a reflective space for mental health professionals and researchers to critically engage with the language that informs both clinical and lay explanations of depression and recovery. Although depression is widely acknowledged as resulting from a complex interplay of biopsychosocial forces in contemporary Western societies, we see from sociological debates how the conceptualization of emotional or mental distress is shaped predominately by medicalized constructions of “illness” as a pathology of the mind or brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312443738">Rose, 2007</xref>). Critical analysts have identified how biomedical discourses have been underpinned by a range of metaphors, such as the body as a machine and illness as a battle within the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312443738">Emmons, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312443738">Kirmayer, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312443738">Martin 1994</xref>), as well as illness as a disruption to the balance of one’s life/body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312443738">Gibbs &amp; Franks, 2002</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312443738">Lakoff and Johnson (1980)</xref> have famously argued, “Metaphor is principally a way of conceiving of one thing in terms of another, and its primary function is understanding abstract, emotional or other experiences” (p. 36).</p>
<p>A number of feminist researchers have identified women’s metaphorical descriptions of depression; these researchers have analyzed the discursive constitution of a “deficient” feminine self as constituted through biomedical or psy-metaphors that signify neurochemical or psychological deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312443738">Jack, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312443738">Lafrance, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312443738">Lafrance &amp; Stoppard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312443738">McMullen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312443738">Scattolon &amp; Stoppard, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312443738">Schreiber, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312443738">Stavropoulos, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312443738">Stoppard &amp; Gammell, 2003</xref>). Jack, and Lafrance and Stoppard have argued that the effects of a diagnosis of depression works to both legitimate women’s emotional distress (as a medical or personal problem) and “silence the self” through the individualization of blame. Biomedical constructions of depression frequently rely on the notion of chemical imbalances that require rebalancing or fixing. By extension, metaphors of recovery center on fixing the machine or rebalancing biochemistry through “magic bullets” such as antidepressants. In addition, psy-mediated metaphors of recovery assume a linear or stage progression of the self through which personal deficits/problems are solved to recover a “true inner self” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312443738">Keane, 2000</xref>). We acknowledge that there are many clinical definitions and models of recovery that highlight the contested meaning of recovery as cure, cessation of symptoms in relation to diagnostic tools, or the rediscovering of meaning. In this article we explore the complex interplay of how women mobilize biomedical and psy-metaphors to make sense of their experiences and how they create different meanings about their recovering sense of self through mobilizing other metaphorical constructions (such as the journey of self-knowledge that emphasizes relationality).</p>
<p>Feminist research with a Foucauldian focus on power and knowledge explores how medicalized language has shaped clinical and lay notions of mental illness, and thus how we understand, regulate, and experience our mind–body relation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312443738">Blum &amp; Stracuzzi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312443738">Foucault 1980</xref>). We argue that analyzing metaphor can reveal how forms of psy-expertise, pharmaceutical marketing, and health care institutions perpetuate “truths” about the depressed and recovering self that can close off alternative understanding for both women and mental health clinicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312443738">Rose, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732312443738">Teghtsoonian, 2009</xref>). Metaphors of mental illness and individual deficiency can obscure the broader social and gendered context that has contributed to women’s depression (and impeded their recovery).</p>
<p>We have extended this line of poststructuralist thinking to analyze how metaphors of recovery were articulated by Australian women, aged 20 to 75 years, as they spoke to us about transition or transformation of self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312443738">Barker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312443738">Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312443738">McIntosh &amp; McKeganey, 2000</xref>). In particular, we focus on how women recovering from depression negotiate the gendered discourses that govern the performance and articulation of womanhood in advanced liberal societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312443738">Butler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732312443738">Ussher, 1997</xref>). We also want to be cautious in relation to the way depression is at times used as a popular metaphor for women’s disempowerment in advanced liberal societies. Women’s performance of normative femininity through the subject positions of wives, mothers, daughters, and workers is bound up in the experience of depression as an effect of gender inequity. Even though the relations between gender, power, and depression are vital in feminist analyses, without focusing on recovery, resistance, and change there is a danger of closing off other ways of thinking about women’s agency and selfhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312443738">Blum &amp; Stracuzzi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312443738">Crowe, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312443738">Lafrance, 2009</xref>). In our analysis of metaphor we aim to contribute to a more gender-sensitive understanding of recovery from depression for both health researchers and clinicians. Next, we outline the research project and the analytical methods we used to explore the metaphors women drew on to articulate their experience of self in depression and recovery (Lakoff &amp; Johnson).</p>

<title>The Women’s Recovery From Depression Project</title>
<sec id="section2-1049732312443738">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>This qualitative study on women’s recovery from depression was conducted in two eastern states of Australia with 80 women aged 20 to 75 years who self-identified as recovering or recovered from an experience of depression. The sample included women from two Australian cities and two rural areas, resulting in 22 rural and 58 urban participants. In the recruitment notices distributed in community newspapers and health centers, and through email lists and radio interviews, we asked for participants who considered themselves to have recovered from depression. We did not specifically ask for participants who had been diagnosed by a medical professional, although the majority (90%) had seen a general practitioner and subsequently been diagnosed as depressed. Many also self-diagnosed their depression through reading self-help books, women’s magazines, and the Internet, and from talking with friends and family members. Psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, and allied health services were also key sources for self-understanding, with 81% of participants having seen one or more of these clinicians at some point in their recovery.</p>
<p>The age at which participants felt they had first experienced depression also reflects the age noted in statistics on depression that identify young women aged between 18 and 25 as having the highest rates of depression in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312443738">Commonwealth of Australia, 2006</xref>). Within the sample, some women felt they had been depressed for their whole lives; these participants identified the undermining effect of childhood abuse and family disruption on their sense of self. Saturation was reached in the sample, with participants having extensive experience of depression: two thirds experienced depression three or more times, one quarter experienced two to three episodes, and one fifth had suffered depression once in their lives (four were unknown).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Griffith University granted ethical approval for the study. Both authors conducted in-depth interviews with a semistructured format within women’s homes or preferred locations; these interviews were then fully transcribed. In addition, we gave the women a short questionnaire to complete that asked about demographic details such as their age, the types of health care providers consulted, and the number of times they had experienced depression. The women answered a range of questions about their experiences of moving through depression, including what metaphors they used to describe depression and recovery at the time of the interview, as they reflected back over their experiences. We also asked what helped or hindered their recovery, how their sense of self changed in recovery, and what gender issues they felt affected women. Participants—a mix of mothers and nonmothers—came from middle- and working-class backgrounds, and were predominantly Anglo-Celtic and heterosexual. Participants’ diagnoses ranged through mild, moderate, major, bipolar, and postnatal depression. Often there were other issues involved, such as anxiety, eating disorders, panic attacks, and sometimes psychosis.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>In our collaborative analysis of the 80 transcripts, we identified the key metaphors women drew on to describe their experiences of depression and recovery. We began this collaboration during the interview stage, discussing commonalties that were occurring in the women’s accounts. In our narrative summary of each individual transcript, we captured the biographical context of women’s lives. We then deepened our analysis through reading and rereading, and moving between the biographical context and our theoretical understandings, discussing at length and in detail the meanings of the prominent metaphors that women drew on across the sample to articulate their experiences. We used the qualitative software program NVivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312443738">Q<bold>S</bold>R International, 2006</xref>) to pilot a coding framework that incorporated women’s responses to a specific question about what metaphors they used to describe their experiences of depression and recovery. Many women drew on a range of metaphorical expressions to articulate these experiences. We identified three key metaphorical constructions.</p>
<p>We did not assume that women’s stories were a transparent account of their lives; rather, we acknowledged the complexity of each narrative and the multiplicity of subjectivity as embodied, becoming, and relational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732312443738">Ussher, 1997</xref>). In our analysis we also reflexively acknowledge our own role as researchers as we interpreted and wrote a sociological story about our conversations with women during the interview context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312443738">Mauthner &amp; Doucet, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732312443738">Ussher, 1999</xref>). In each interview, women created different points of connection and differentiation as we endeavored to understand how they made sense of their lives through language. Asking women to describe the complexity of their experiences through metaphors was often a turning point in the interviews for new insights or reflections to emerge.</p>
<p>In these research relationships, the second author’s first-hand experiences with depression and recovery positioned her differently from the first author, who had no such previous experience. We acknowledge that all research is partial, and we do not claim to fully represent women’s experiences here; nor do we claim to have discovered some definitive “truth” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312443738">Richardson, 2000</xref>). Next, we present our key findings and analysis of significant metaphors in these women’s accounts of depression and recovery. All participant identifiers have been removed to preserve anonymity.</p>

<title>Findings and Discussion: Metaphors of Depression and Recovery</title>
<p>Women identified a complex range of reasons for their depression, which provided an important context for the analysis of metaphor. Their explanations drew on different metaphors and discursive constructions such as medical-genetic (an inherited chemical imbalance in the brain), psychological (personality, inability to cope), family (histories of childhood abuse), and social (work-life-family pressures, relationship breakdowns, stigma around mental health, and gender discrimination). It was not unusual for a participant to draw on several different discourses and metaphors about depression when questioning or firmly holding on to one explanation in relation to the circumstances of her life.</p>
<p>The majority of women in the study identified the effects of gendered power relations on them as children and/or adults in the spheres of family, work, leisure, and relationships. Many women also connected their depression to the enormous pressure to perform an idealized, self-sacrificing identity and ethic of care as mothers, wives, or workers who valued the needs of others first (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312443738">Lafrance &amp; Stoppard, 2006</xref>). In the following sections we interweave our research findings and discussion to explore the conceptual and empirical dimensions of the three key metaphorical themes: the immobilizing effect of depression, recovery as a battle to control depression, and recovery as a journey of self-knowledge.</p>
<sec id="section6-1049732312443738">
<title>Immobilizing the Self</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A trap. You’re in trap, and it’s just a spiral. The more you try, the more you get stuck in it, and it’s just black, the whole cloud thing, you can’t shift the cloud. You wake up and it’s there. When you go to bed, it’s still there.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this theme we explore the common metaphors that were used by the women to articulate the immobilizing effects of depression on their sense of self, and hence the challenge of moving into recovery. In the quotation above, the participant spoke of spiraling into depression, evoking the loss of control and sense of stasis that characterized many women’s depressive experiences. Participants drew on metaphors such as being trapped in a hole, pit, cave, well, forest, hell, or dark room. Some evoked metaphors of descent or loss of control that precipitated their depression, describing falling, going downhill, crashing, or descending into a state of depression. Depression posed an interpretative challenge to all participants as they endeavored to develop self-knowledge about their feelings, thinking processes, embodied changes in relationships with others, and their interpretations of expert discourses that emphasized etiology as well as psychological/antidepressant treatments. Being immobilized also signified the loss of a sense of identity and direction in their lives, as well as the degree to which their attempts to meet gendered expectations of successful womanhood had failed. This loss of identity and sense of self was clearly captured in the following comment:
<disp-quote>
<p>I couldn’t even find myself. It was like being locked in a dark room and just not being able to identify yourself anymore, so you just weren’t there. I wasn’t there. So I had no compass bearing to go back to myself to.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Many participants also described the experience of depression through related metaphors of an invisible self: blackness or darkness that often covered or weighed them down (in cloud or fog). Other women employed a more morally laden language, describing the feeling of stasis as a form of imbalance or abnormality that signified a deficit or lack of control within themselves. Depression was described in terms of feeling “a little bit crazy,” “off balance,” “something wasn’t right,” of having a “genetic predisposition,” of being “part of my make-up,” “in deficit,” or “not on a level playing field.” One participant spoke of this feeling of deficiency: “I’m already in deficit because my mind’s not working properly and my brain’s not working properly.” The immobilizing metaphors of depression powerfully described women’s embodied feelings of being stuck and lacking agency. Women also drew on biomedical and psy-language and imagery about deficiency and failure located somewhere “within” the self.</p>
<p>Understanding the everyday metaphors mobilized by women to interpret their emotional distress can help mental health professionals critically reflect on the nature of their conversations with patients/consumers. Are medical explanations privileged over a range of meanings women might construct? How might a medical or psychological emphasis on depression as an “internal problem” preclude understanding how women experience the complexity of their emotional lives and gendered constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312443738">Blackman, 2007</xref>)? Paying attention to the metaphorical construction of meaning might enable the coauthoring of different interpretations that could assist women’s recovery through greater self-understanding (about gendered expectations of themselves, for example) rather than self-blame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312443738">Chrisler &amp; Lamont, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312443738">Crowe, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312443738">Schreiber, 1998</xref>). Next, we turn to analyze how recovery was described in women’s stories through the metaphor of a “battle” to overcome depression.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732312443738">
<title>Recovery as a Battle to Control Depression</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’m probably charging a little bit better than I was, say, even two months ago. It’s like the up-hill battle, but it’s like, “Oh, I’m at the top.” I’m tentatively looking around and saying, “I don’t want to go down the other side, but then again, I don’t want to go up another one either.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here we explore the metaphorical theme of how women articulated the difficulty of moving through depression toward recovery. As the quotation above illustrates, recovery from depression was often a battle, and not a straightforward matter, despite the range of treatments and recovery practices employed (particularly medication, therapy, changing work/leisure patterns, seeking social support, and time out from the emotional labor of care). Hence, the challenge of recovery was finding a different way to live with depression’s effects and to change some of the patterns and relationships that enabled it to flourish. This was an extremely difficult undertaking, as evidenced by the number of women who had several recurrences of depression in their lives.</p>
<p>Women battled, worked, fought, and “slipped” as they tried to change aspects of their lives and transform their emotional selves. The battle was often with the normalized expectations of recovery. Women had expectations that they would follow a linear trajectory toward becoming fully recovered. This battle was often as much with themselves, as someone with depression, as it was to overcome the effects of depression on their lives. The battle metaphor was in part related to the difficulty of fitting into clinical notions of recovery as a linear process of moving through stages or phases of improvement toward “normality.”</p>
<p>Our findings raise critical questions about power and language that have been raised by other social researchers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312443738">Blum and Stracuzzi (2004)</xref>. Biomedical constructions of depression as a chemical imbalance encourage women to invest hope primarily in pharmacological treatments that promise to restore normal functioning. Although these women drew on the authority of biomedicine in their use of metaphors, there was also a sense of ambivalence about the possibility of achieving a successful recovery. Elsewhere, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312443738">Fullagar (2009)</xref> examined the complex range of meanings associated with medication use and how beneficial or disruptive it was to women’s recovery. In relation to the use of metaphor, what is important to highlight is how women often described themselves as flawed or weak because they realized they relied on medication to feel normal. A number of older women who had been prescribed antidepressants for many years had been told they would be taking them for the rest of their lives. Women not only battled to control their depression; they also battled with their reliance on medication to help them feel “on a level playing field” with other nondepressed women.</p>
<p>Women’s reliance on medication thus generated fears of dependence and stigma that tended to undermine their wish to recover a self free from depression and therefore not dependent on medication to be normal. One woman, who had stopped taking antidepressant medication and then recommenced it after a subsequent episode of depression, evoked the battle she engaged in to manage her fear that she was unable to control her depression:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think I still get afraid of depression, so it’s probably like a, I don’t know, a monster sort of thing that lurks, a black cloud. I know that’s a pretty regular one that people say, but it’s like that sort of lurking thing because you’re afraid of it. Yeah, you do get worried it will come back and take over your life. I do look at it as like a weakness in myself. I mean, I do look at it like an illness, and yeah, I’m mostly afraid of it because I don’t think I can control it. I can’t help it. I don’t like it.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This participant was trying to battle not only her immediate experience of depression, but also the constructed illness “monster” that lurked within and threatened to overwhelm her again. This metaphor of illness also positions depression as something beyond the woman’s control or agency, rather than as an experience of self to be understood.</p>
<p>For many of the older women who had been on a variety of antidepressants for many years, medication had become very much part of the language of their depressed/recovering identity. For example, one woman who had been taking medication for 34 years described depression as an ongoing “personal war” requiring a prescription that was double the recommended dosage. Having been told by two doctors that she would always need to take medication, the participant considered antidepressants to be an expensive part of her lifelong recovery battle.</p>
<p>The power of biochemical metaphors was evident as women complied with expert advice and were thus valued as “good, responsible women” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312443738">Stoppard, 2000</xref>). In this way brain chemistry is positioned as the problem, not the social norms or the organization of gender relations. Recovery as a battle with depression signified women’s agency and resistance against norms that are deeply gendered (for example, caring for others before oneself). Understanding the gendered language of battle could enable mental health clinicians to better acknowledge and support the emotional transition of self that women negotiate in relation to the demands/desires of others, such as children, partners, bosses, and parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312443738">Lafrance &amp; Stoppard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312443738">Lloyd &amp; Hawe, 2003</xref>). Women identified many everyday actions that were essential in their recovery, such as saying no, creating time and space for relaxation and reflection, and finding pleasurable activities and purpose in life. Next we turn to the metaphor of recovery as a journey of self-knowledge that varied from a quest for an inner psychological truth or a biomedical cure to a more relational construction of the self akin to a state of becoming.</p>

<title>The Journey of Feeling Alive</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Each year there are times when you actually have to hike quite solidly through thick forest, but you might find yourself in an open field for a little while. And then, at some point you are going to have to climb up the other side of the valley to get to the next valley, and you have to work your arse off to do that. At some point you come to a peak. . . . [I am] perpetually surprised at myself, at my capacity. I can push myself so much further than I do, and I’m capable of so much more.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In this metaphorical theme we illustrate how women articulated recovery from depression as an ongoing process of developing self-knowledge in the context of everyday life challenges, past history, and desires for a different future. In the quotation above the participant invoked the metaphor of an undulating journey that is also a transformative experience wherein recovery is experienced as an “aliveness.” A number of women employed transformational metaphors of active movement and even pleasure in overcoming limits as they described their changing sense of self. These metaphors of recovery stood in stark contrast to the death-like stasis of depression: sun shining or climbing, or moving out of the blackness, hole, or pit. Instead of being “weighed down” or “battling to control” both depression and the expectations that contributed to it, one woman emphasized how her depressive symptoms lifted as she developed her knowledge of tactics to help prevent recurrences:
<disp-quote>
<p>Now I can actually say, “Whoa,” and pull up the reins and/or use all the tactics they give you that, when you’re really bad, don’t seem to work. Now I feel that enough of it’s lifted for me to be able to take deep breaths, take time out, go for a walk. All those sorts of things.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Even though recovery metaphors signified hope and change, this certainly did not mean that the movement of self through depression was easy; nor did it mean that it was a linear process. Women often tried many things to “get to the other side” of depression and to feel as if their “head was above water,” or to simply feel “happy” or “normal.” Nevertheless, the self-knowledge that women acquired through these negotiations meant that many recognized that their recovery was not a linear progression of self to an arrival point of cure, but often was a “long, long, slow journey.” Part of the journey involved a sense of mindfulness about the temporal reality of “good” days and “bad” days. This position was typified by one woman who had struggled with depression most of her life. She described recovery:
<disp-quote>
<p>Still feeling shaky, because it is such a long road to come, you can’t say, “Wow! I’m all better!” It’s not like that. It’s not that cut and dried, and it’s hard to see things when they happen over a very long time.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Knowing they had moved through depression and come out the other side with new self-knowledge had given women a felt sense of resilience to pursue their own desires (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312443738">Dowrick et al., 2008</xref>). Participants talked about developing insight and a better understanding of themselves in relation to their immediate, and often broader social world. This sentiment was captured by one woman who said that her journey through depression was “slow and challenging, but very rewarding, and the reward is [that] you’ve dealt with this personal challenge.” For many women, recovery meant developing a sense of their identity as multiple, including feelings of failure and weakness, and significantly also of strength and courage. In describing the emotional experience of transformation, women spoke of recovery as far more complex than a search for a cured or fixed self. The journey of self-knowledge was a process of becoming alive and recognizing oneself as a woman with a range of capacities and desires, someone who could question dominant illness narratives about depression and failure. These metaphors are particularly important in relation to the potential for mental health clinicians to listen for the changes in identity that women begin to articulate as they imagine what recovery might feel like, and how they might make sense of the ups and downs.</p>
<p>Often women described their self-knowledge in relation to greater self-acceptance of who they were, regardless of their previous worries about age, weight, or sexuality/marital status. They expressed this through embodied metaphors. One woman described this as feeling like she “grew into her own skin.” This change in embodied self-knowledge was also expressed through metaphors such as feeling more “in tune” with their body, their sense of self, and their emotions. For many women, this self-knowledge meant the recognition that “taking on” all the emotional labor in a relationship or in their family (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732312443738">Strazdins &amp; Broom, 2004</xref>) was a significant contributor to their depression.</p>
<p>Self-knowledge included refusing to be responsible for everyone’s happiness and acknowledging the limits of their own emotional reserves. Others felt that they now had the capacity to better cope with their own emotions, and had allowed themselves to express emotions such as sadness and anger rather than ignore them. It also meant that women felt they could ask for help when feeling overwhelmed without viewing themselves primarily as “weak” women. One woman spoke of how she felt at “peace” with herself rather than feeling the constant turmoil of trying to “fit into” a particular type of recovery trajectory.</p>
<p>For many women, the transformative experiences of peace, contentment, or calmness also meant finding their identity beyond conventional gender roles (e.g., I am not solely a mother, wife, daughter), and knowing who they wanted to become; for others it was regaining their previous sense of self that had disappeared. For several women, revaluing their identity meant that they resisted devaluing their roles because they were “just” mothers. A renewed feeling of trust or faith in women’s own capacities, abilities, and potential was also a significant shift from the inadequacy and failure felt through depression. Several women also said that they had been able to ignore what people thought of them, and recognized that they were not going to please everyone. Others were able to change their expectations of themselves, recognizing that they didn’t have to be perfect, and had adopted a less punitive, less critical, less judgmental, and kinder relationship with themselves.</p>
<p>Equally, other women became aware of what values they wanted to embrace as part of their lives. This often meant that they had found purpose and meaning through changes in the home or work environment, or through engaging in meaningful and enlivening leisure experiences. These leisure activities (e.g., yoga, art, walking, choir, travel) helped women change how they were feeling. The importance of these everyday activities was expressed succinctly by one woman, who said that she would search for things “that would allow you to experience existence in another way.” For some women, this meant they had developed a deeper spiritual connection with themselves and/or the natural world. Other women had decided that their emotional well-being or “feeling alive” in the present moment was more important than getting stuck on materialistic or career treadmills.</p>
<p>Several women emphasized the importance of the journey in terms of the ongoing process of learning about what worked for them, and of seeking different paths through depression. Often the self-care strategies that worked for women were not initially self-evident. One woman said,
<disp-quote>
<p>It was almost disappointing when you did get better, because it was just like, it’s not a magical cure. There is nothing you can tell the person next to you—“Hey, go do this and you’ll feel better.” And it’s not like that. You don’t notice the change is happening, and it’s not until you look back.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Self-knowledge developed when women created time and space to reflect on the whole range of changes being made in their lives, beyond the immediacy of treatment regimes.</p>
<p>Recovery as a journey of self-knowledge also meant women resisted gender norms and assumptions that had generated conditions for depression to flourish and had impeded recovery (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312443738">Lafrance, 2009</xref>). The changes that women had been able to enact were again reflected in women’s references to freedom as a feeling state in recovery. This was both freedom from their depressed selves and freedom from the expectations about successful femininity that they felt had contributed to depression. One woman discussed this notion, referring to it as “freedom from fear, and that’s fear of the depression, too. Freedom to be who you are, and not live up to other people’s expectations.” Similarly, the metaphors of balance, steady ship, calm, and peace also signaled freedom from fearful and disquieting emotions that had dominated their sense of self. In this way, recovery as a journey of self-knowledge encapsulated a range of transformational metaphors that involved resistance to gender norms and the desire to seek out different experiences and ways of valuing of womanhood.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>We acknowledge two main limitations of the study. Our specific sample was largely Anglo-Celtic, and there is need for more research into the interplay of culture and metaphorical constructions of recovery. In addition, we interviewed women who identified as “recovered” from depression, although the majority of participants did not equate recovery with the total absence of depression in their lives. The metaphors of recovery that we explored were constructed in the interview context as part of women’s reflections on their past experiences; hence, we did not focus specifically on the metaphors they might have used at different times. Interviewing women who were at very different points on the depression–recovery continuum of experience could also reveal a range of other metaphors.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>This research has relevance for mental health practice in a variety of clinical and community settings because it identifies a language of recovery that speaks of women’s desires to move beyond the personal, emotional, and gendered binds of depression. There is a danger that the meanings women create and narrate about their recovery will remain unheard because of the authority invested in clinical knowledge and biomedical discourses that rely on specified treatment regimes and normalized ideas about recovery pathways. Metaphor can be a powerful resource that enables different ways of thinking about issues of health and illness through imaginative leaps and associative connections in the play of language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312443738">Barker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312443738">Frank, 1998</xref>). The growing body of qualitative health research exploring the significance of metaphor, narrative, and discourse opens up possibilities for understanding different ways of knowing how to move through depression.</p>
<p>We aimed our research at making visible both the dominant and the less-well-known metaphors that shaped women’s interpretive relation to depression and recovery in ways that might be useful for mental health professionals who are thinking beyond the language of treatment, compliance, and self-management (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312443738">Lee, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732312443738">White, 2007</xref>). Women’s metaphor of the journey of self-knowledge highlights the importance of understanding recovery from depression as an embodied and emotional experience that is intertwined with their changing identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312443738">Blackman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312443738">Phillips, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Through a Foucauldian feminist interpretation we argue that the insights created by women’s different metaphorical constructions of recovery constitute a form of “subjugated knowledge” that brings into question and exceeds dominant knowledge claims about women’s minds and bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312443738">Foucault, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732312443738">Ussher, 1999</xref>). For many women in our study, recovering from depression involved a significant change in their relationship to self as they overcame feelings of being immobilized or of battling to develop self-knowledge on the journey to becoming “more than” a depressed self. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312443738">Foucault (1988)</xref> highlighted how becoming is an ongoing process of continual self-reflection on the normalized conditions of social life through which one acquires the self-knowledge to transform possibilities for thinking and being.</p>
<p>The social science research on the gendered experience of women’s recovery from depression has begun to examine how language works to mediate self-understanding and broader cultural norms about mental illness and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312443738">Aita et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312443738">Giles &amp; Newbold, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312443738">Lafrance &amp; Stoppard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312443738">McMullen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312443738">McMullen &amp; Herman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312443738">Ridge &amp; Ziebland, 2006</xref>). We have endeavored to further understanding of the gendered construction of identity in the process of recovery by considering how metaphor can work as an interpretive resource for women who are making sense of complex experiences of emotional distress and self-transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312443738">Johnston &amp; Barcan, 2006</xref>). We examined how Australian women mobilized particular metaphors in the context of broader biomedical and psy-discourses that govern “mental disorders” within advanced liberal societies. Acknowledging how individual women negotiate the biopolitical forces shaping contemporary thinking and practice (diagnosis, treatment, policy, and service provision) offers a critical alternative with potentially different ways of thinking and responding to depression.</p>
<p>In our analysis we identified three key metaphors that women drew on to construct narratives about their recovering identities: the immobilizing effects of depression, recovery as a battle to control depression, and recovery as a journey of feeling alive. Being weighed down by gendered expectations that put the needs of others first, along with the emotional burdens of inequities at work, at home, and in accessing leisure time, was a significant contributor to the descent into depression. Biomedical knowledge significantly informed how women thought about themselves as failing or chemically deficient selves. Even though some women found medication and/or a range of therapies helpful, the continued reliance on medication to prevent relapse left many women feeling ambivalent about the possibility of recovery. For women who interpreted recovery as a journey, the experience was less focused on searching for an external or internal cure. Instead the process of recovery was articulated in terms of developing self-knowledge and becoming someone different, as women renegotiated gender relations and norms about who they “should be.” The journey of recovery signified new embodied practices and emotional experiences, such as pleasure, joy, and satisfaction in achievement, that enabled the transformation of women’s subjectivities.</p>
<p>Our findings offer a critical perspective on clinical language, with an emphasis on the treatment of “deficits” (chemical or psychological), while opening up a space for thinking differently about what women identify as helpful in their long-term recovery. This knowledge might be particularly important for health care professionals who are seeking to develop a deeper understanding of the gendered dimension of depression and recovery within the context of a growing public health problem. In this way, our findings complement related work in narrative psychology that emphasizes the important role of language in shaping identity and the cocreation of narratives of depression and recovery that clinicians are engaged in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732312443738">White, 2007</xref>). There are also potential practice implications for professionals that flow from a better understanding of how women speak about the meaning of their recovery as it is intertwined with the narrative of their changing identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312443738">Dowrick, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312443738">Frank, 1998</xref>).</p>
