<sec id="section4-0363546513480614">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Twenty-eight patients were treated with excision of the os trigonum either by an arthroscopic (16 patients) or endoscopic (12 patients) technique. The mean patient age was 29.8 years (range, 17-55 years), and the mean follow-up period was 30 months (range, 18-58 months). Preoperative and postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, and Maryland Foot Score (MFS) were used to analyze the functional results. Duration of surgery, time to return to sports (RTS), and patient satisfaction were evaluated as well. The size of the os trigonum was measured using T1-weighted sagittal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The clinical and MRI results were compared between the 2 groups.</p>

<title>Results:</title>
<p>The VAS score, AOFAS score, and MFS for both the arthroscopic group (preoperative: 6.3, 63.8, and 61.5, respectively; postoperative: 1.2, 89.9, and 89.6, respectively) and endoscopic group (preoperative: 6.7, 64.8, and 62.5, respectively; postoperative: 1.2, 89.9, and 88.4, respectively) improved significantly (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). The mean surgery and RTS times were 39.4 minutes and 7.5 weeks in the arthroscopic group and 34.8 minutes and 8.0 weeks in the endoscopic group, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). All patients were satisfied with the results. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the preoperative and postoperative VAS score, AOFAS score, or MFS (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). The mean size of the os trigonum was 11.1 × 8.8 mm<sup>2</sup> in the arthroscopic group and 12.6 × 10.4 mm<sup>2</sup> in the endoscopic group, and the difference was significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Two patients underwent both arthroscopic and endoscopic procedures because of technical difficulty in removing the large os trigonum arthroscopically.</p>

<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Both arthroscopic and posterior endoscopic excisions of the os trigonum were safe and effective in treating PAIS. The arthroscopic procedure was more demanding, especially in cases of a large os trigonum.

<p>The os trigonum can be a source of pain during forced plantar flexion of the foot, in which position an impingement may occur between the posterior edge of the tibia and the superior surface of the calcaneus, leading to posterior ankle impingement syndrome (PAIS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513480614">18</xref></sup> The os trigonum is a secondary ossification center of the talus lateral to the groove for the flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513480614">6</xref></sup> There is a wide variation in the prevalence of an os trigonum; one study found an os trigonum in 1.7% to 7% of normal foot radiographs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513480614">3</xref></sup> while Burman and Lapidus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513480614">5</xref></sup> reported a 50% prevalence of an os trigonum. When this anatomic anomaly is combined with an overuse or a traumatic event such as a supination trauma, a hyperplantarflexion trauma, dancing on hard surfaces, or pushing beyond anatomic limits, then PAIS may develop; it can be present as an inflammation of posterior ankle soft tissues, as an osseous injury, or as a combination of both.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513480614">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513480614">27</xref></sup> One study suggested that hypertrophic capsulitis and accumulation of inflammatory tissue play a part in the development and persistence of PAIS related to the os trigonum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513480614">11</xref></sup> Athletes who participate in sports that require frequent hyper–plantar flexion of the foot, such as ballet dancing and soccer, are more susceptible to this injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513480614">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513480614">25</xref></sup> Although a lack of consensus remains regarding the definition of PAIS, it is generally accepted as a clinical disorder characterized by posterior ankle pain in forced plantar flexion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513480614">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513480614">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513480614">24</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>When nonoperative treatment fails to decrease the symptoms of PAIS, surgical excision of the os trigonum is the treatment of choice, and the surgical outcome is generally successful.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513480614">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513480614">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513480614">20</xref></sup> One study reported good results with open excision of a symptomatic os trigonum using a lateral approach in 41 patients. However, 4 of 41 patients developed permanent sural nerve sensory loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513480614">1</xref></sup> It was also suggested that the visible scar after open excision might preclude a professional career for a dancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513480614">10</xref></sup> With the introduction of small instruments and precise techniques, arthroscopic surgery of the subtalar joint has expanded its scope and was applied to the treatment of PAIS related to the os trigonum, yielding good results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513480614">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513480614">30</xref></sup> In 1997, Marumoto and Ferkel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513480614">19</xref></sup> first reported good results with minimal complications and a shorter recovery time after arthroscopic excision of the os trigonum in 11 patients using the standard anterolateral and posterolateral portals. All patients reached the maximum recovery level within the first 3 months after surgery, as opposed to open techniques in which the time to full recovery averaged 5 months (range, 1-12 months).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513480614">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513480614">10</xref></sup> The reported disadvantage of subtalar arthroscopic surgery is a difficult learning curve because the technique is very demanding in a tight subtalar joint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513480614">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513480614">30</xref></sup> Marumoto and Ferkel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513480614">19</xref></sup> stated that arthroscopic excision of the os trigonum requires a high degree of dexterity and is not recommended for surgeons who perform arthroscopic surgery only occasionally. In 2000, van Dijk et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513480614">29</xref></sup> introduced a new technique for posterior hindfoot endoscopy for the treatment of various posterior ankle and subtalar lesions. They used a 2-portal technique with the patient in a prone position and reported good results with a quick recovery time. Since then, both arthroscopic and posterior endoscopic techniques have been used for the treatment of PAIS caused by the os trigonum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513480614">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513480614">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513480614">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513480614">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513480614">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513480614">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513480614"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513480614">31</xref></sup> However, there have been no direct comparison studies of the 2 procedures conducted for the treatment of PAIS.</p>
<p>We have been performing excision of the os trigonum using either the subtalar arthroscopic or posterior endoscopic technique for many years, and we wanted to retrospectively compare the results of arthroscopic and posterior endoscopic excisions of the os trigonum with the purpose of clarifying the efficacy and safety of each surgical procedure. Our hypothesis was that both subtalar arthroscopic and posterior endoscopic excisions of the os trigonum would be safe and effective in treating PAIS related to the os trigonum.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>From January 2004 to November 2010, a total of 68 patients underwent excision of a symptomatic os trigonum for PAIS either by the arthroscopic or posterior endoscopic technique. The exclusion criteria for this study were (1) combined lateral ankle instability, (2) combined osteochondral lesion of the talus, (3) combined FHL tendinitis, (4) combined posttraumatic arthritis of the ankle or subtalar joint, and (5) combined local synovitis or inflammatory arthritis of the ankle or subtalar joint. Thirty-eight of the 68 patients were excluded because of the presence of a combined disorder. Two patients were observed for less than 18 months and were excluded as well. The remaining 28 patients, 16 patients with arthroscopic excision and 12 with posterior endoscopic excision, were analyzed in this study, and outcomes were followed for more than 18 months. All 28 patients were amateur athletes. There were 3 dancers: 2 in the arthroscopic group and 1 in the endoscopic group. All patients had posterior impingement pain with forceful passive plantar flexion of the relaxed foot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513480614">10</xref></sup> There were no cases of PAIS related to a hypertrophic trigonal process.</p>
<p>In all cases, surgery was offered when patients failed to respond to nonoperative treatment consisting of rest, ice, anti-inflammatory medication, and avoidance of forced plantar flexion for a minimum of 3 months. Although we often tried 4 to 6 weeks of immobilization with a short-leg splint or cast, we did not use corticosteroid injections. All surgeries were performed by the senior author (J.H.A.), who had completed learning courses for both subtalar arthroscopic surgery and posterior endoscopy and who had performed more than 20 subtalar arthroscopic and posterior endoscopic procedures when the study first began. Selection of the arthroscopic or endoscopic technique was made without any preference; however, it was not randomly performed because true blinding was not possible. We obtained approval from an institutional review board to perform this retrospective cohort study.</p>
<sec id="section8-0363546513480614">
<title>Clinical and Radiological Assessment</title>
<p>Results from the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot scale,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513480614">16</xref></sup> and Maryland Foot Score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513480614">21</xref></sup> (MFS) were recorded before surgery and at the latest follow-up as postoperative outcome measures. The forced hyperplantarflexion test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513480614">10</xref></sup> was evaluated as well. Duration of surgery, time to return to sports (RTS), patient satisfaction, and any complications related to the procedure were analyzed and compared between the arthroscopic and endoscopic groups. Duration of surgery was defined as the start of portal placement to the closure of arthroscopic or endoscopic portals. Time to RTS was defined as patients’ time to initiate the previous sporting activity such as running and jumping in weeks. Patient satisfaction was assessed at the latest follow-up by asking each patient whether he or she would elect the surgery again.</p>
<p>Radiographically, a lateral view of the ankle in full plantar flexion was taken to demonstrate impingement of the os trigonum between the posterior lip of the tibial plafond and the calcaneus. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in all patients to see the signal changes within and around the os trigonum and also to find any combined lesions in the ankle or subtalar joint. The size of the os trigonum was also compared between the 2 groups; the size was measured as the product of the short- and long-axis diameters of the os trigonum on a T1-weighted sagittal MRI scan using the picture archiving communication system (PACS, Maroview 5.4; Infinitt, Seoul, Korea) of the hospital (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513480614">Figure 1</xref>). The image showing the largest os trigonum was selected for the measurement, and the axes were marked by the authors after discussion. Then, one board-certified orthopaedic surgeon measured the size using the PACS internal ruler system. He was blinded to the group and the outcome of the patients.</p>

<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>Surgery was performed with tourniquet control under general or spinal anesthesia. Arthroscopic excision of the os trigonum was performed under noninvasive distraction using the Acufex ankle distractor (Smith &amp; Nephew, Andover, Massachusetts) with the patient in a supine position. It first began with an inspection of the subtalar joint using a 2.7-mm, 30° arthroscope through the anterolateral and posterolateral portals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513480614">Figure 2</xref> and Video Supplement).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513480614">19</xref></sup> An accessory anterolateral portal served as an inflow portal, and the anterolateral and posterolateral portals interchangeably served as viewing and working portals during excision of the os trigonum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513480614">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513480614">19</xref></sup> Posterior endoscopic excision of the os trigonum was performed with the patient in a prone position without distraction. Posteromedial and posterolateral portals were interchangeably used for viewing and working portals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546513480614">Figure 3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513480614">29</xref></sup> A 4.0-mm, 30° arthroscope was used for the endoscopic procedure instead of the 2.7-mm, 30° arthroscope, and the posterior part of the subtalar and ankle joints with surrounding ligament tissues and FHL were viewable.</p>

<p>During both procedures, the os trigonum was initially mobilized from the posterior talus with a Freer elevator and a curette. A motorized shaver was helpful for detaching soft tissues around the os trigonum. After the os trigonum was freed, it was removed with a large grasper. It could sometimes be removed in one piece, especially when the os trigonum was easily movable and was not very large. However, it was usually broken into 2 or more pieces with a small osteotome because of its large size and was removed with a small or large grasper. Sometimes, a microrongeur was used for easy removal of the pieces because it had stronger grasping power. Finally, the FHL tendon was carefully inspected for any sign of tenosynovitis or tendinitis after removal of the os trigonum. However, release of the flexor retinaculum deep into the subtalar joint was not possible with an arthroscopic approach. On the contrary, the posterior endoscopic approach allowed us to address problems in the posterior ankle joint and permitted a more extensive release of the FHL if needed. In both procedures, we used a switching stick to reduce soft tissue trauma as the arthroscope and instruments were repetitively changed from portal to portal. Extra attention was paid as well to avoid scuffing the joint cartilage during the arthroscopic or endoscopic procedure. It was more important in arthroscopic excision because the subtalar joint was usually very tight within a limited working space. The portals were closed with the insertion of a small drain, which was removed at 48 hours after surgery.</p>

<sec id="section10-0363546513480614">
<title>Postoperative Protocol</title>
<p>After surgery, the ankle was immobilized in a slightly plantarflexed position with a short-leg splint. Physical therapy including limited weightbearing, and range of motion exercises started at 48 hours after surgery with the use of ankle boots. The stitches were removed at 2 weeks after surgery, and full weightbearing in ankle boots was allowed thereafter. Activities of daily living and fast walking were allowed at 3 weeks after surgery without the use of ankle boots. A return to previous sports activity such as running and jumping was allowed from 6 weeks after surgery. There was no difference in the postoperative protocol between the 2 groups.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All quantitative variables were presented as the mean ± standard deviation. Comparisons between paired data such as the preoperative and postoperative VAS score, AOFAS score, and MFS were performed by using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Comparisons of the data such as the preoperative and postoperative VAS score, AOFAS score, and MFS; patient age; surgery time; time to RTS; and os trigonum size between the 2 groups were performed by using the Mann-Whitney test. The significance level was defined as <italic>P &lt;</italic> .05. Analysis was performed by a statistician using SPSS software version 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois).</p>

There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the preoperative and postoperative VAS score (<italic>P</italic> = .304 and .923, respectively), AOFAS score (<italic>P</italic> = .889 and .907, respectively), and MFS (<italic>P</italic> = .907 and .5, respectively). All patients reported the disappearance of pain during forced hyper–plantar flexion of the ankle joint at the latest follow-up. The mean surgery time was 39.4 ± 8.6 minutes for the arthroscopic group and 34.8 ± 9.3 minutes for the posterior endoscopic group (<italic>P</italic> = .104). The mean time to RTS was 7.5 ± 1.6 weeks for the arthroscopic group and 8.0 ± 1.8 weeks for the posterior endoscopic group (<italic>P</italic> = .469). All patients were able to return to the same level of sporting activity within 3 months after surgery. The 3 dancers were able to resume the en pointe position and high jumping at 10 weeks after surgery. All patients showed satisfaction by answering that they would elect the surgery again.</p>

<p>The signal changes on MRI were noted within and around the os trigonum in 23 of 28 patients. The mean os trigonum size was 11.1 ± 2.0 × 8.8 ± 1.6 mm<sup>2</sup> in the arthroscopic group and 12.6 ± 2.9 × 10.4 ± 2.5 mm<sup>2</sup> in the endoscopic group; the size was significantly larger in the endoscopic group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Two patients underwent both arthroscopic and posterior endoscopic procedures because of the technical difficulty encountered during the initial arthroscopic excision of the os trigonum. These cases were allocated to the arthroscopic group, and the total time spent during the arthroscopic and posterior endoscopic procedures was taken into account. The sizes of the os trigonum in these 2 cases were 15.0 × 11.6 mm<sup>2</sup> and 12.7 × 10.5 mm<sup>2</sup>, and they were the second and the eighth largest among the 28 cases, respectively.</p>
<p>There were no serious postoperative complications such as a wound problem, vascular injury, or permanent neural complication. However, there were 2 cases of temporary sural nerve dysesthesia: 1 in the arthroscopic group and 1 in the endoscopic group. They were spontaneously resolved within 6 weeks after surgery. Intraoperative complications such as a fracture or instrument breakage did not occur.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Symptoms of PAIS usually improve with nonsurgical management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513480614">11</xref></sup> However, open surgery has traditionally been performed for refractory cases, mostly leading to successful results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513480614">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513480614">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513480614">10</xref></sup> In the current study, all patients failed to respond to nonoperative treatment for 3 months. One study reported typical results of open excision of a symptomatic os trigonum through a posterolateral approach; the mean postoperative AOFAS score was 87.6 points, time to full recovery was 3.8 months for those who were not involved in a workers’ compensation claim, and permanent sural nerve injury occurred in 10% of the patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513480614">1</xref></sup> We do not perform open excision of the os trigonum unless it is combined with a tear or nodular tendinitis of the FHL that requires an open procedure. On the contrary, the results of arthroscopic or endoscopic excision have been more promising, mostly with better and faster recovery without serious complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513480614">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513480614">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513480614">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513480614">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513480614">24</xref></sup> Marumoto and Ferkel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513480614">19</xref></sup> used the standard anterolateral and posterolateral portals for arthroscopic excision of the os trigonum in 11 patients and concluded that arthroscopic excision of a symptomatic os trigonum yielded good results with no complications and a shorter recovery time. However, subtalar arthroscopic surgery requires fine instruments and precise techniques because the surgeon has to maneuver through the tight subtalar joint within a limited space.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513480614">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513480614">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513480614">30</xref></sup> Posterior hindfoot endoscopy was first introduced by van Dijk et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513480614">29</xref></sup> It uses the posteromedial and posterolateral portals at the level of the posterior subtalar joint around the Achilles tendon, and it is performed with the patient in a prone position. The use of a 4.0-mm, 30° arthroscope is different from subtalar arthroscopic surgery in which a smaller (2.7-mm, 30°) arthroscope is usually required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513480614">29</xref></sup> This 2-portal posterior endoscopic approach offers excellent access to the posterior ankle and subtalar compartment because of the use of a larger arthroscope and the relatively ample posterior working space and is increasingly used for the treatment of posterior hindfoot pathological lesions including PAIS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513480614">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513480614">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513480614">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513480614">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513480614">31</xref></sup> The posterior endoscopic approach has the advantage of addressing problems in the posterior ankle joint and a more extensive release of the FHL tendon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513480614">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513480614">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513480614">28</xref></sup> However, it is interesting to note that almost all studies have focused on the advantages of arthroscopic or endoscopic treatment over open excision of the os trigonum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513480614">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513480614">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513480614">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513480614">31</xref></sup> To the authors’ knowledge, no single study has compared the results of arthroscopic and endoscopic treatments for os trigonum syndrome. It might be that the advocates of each technique favored the use of only one technique and did not feel the need to adopt a different one. In this regard, the current study can be considered unique in nature. Although selection of a technique was not randomly performed in this study, we tried to select a technique without any preference. Thus, we believed that we could offer relatively nonbiased comparative results of the 2 techniques. Also, there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of age and preoperative VAS score, AOFAS score, and MFS.</p>
<p>Postoperative functional results were good in our study, and all patients were able to return to the same level of sporting activity within 3 months after surgery. These results compare well with those of other arthroscopic or endoscopic excisions for the same conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513480614">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513480614">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513480614">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513480614">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513480614">24</xref></sup> The fact that the symptom duration of the patients was within 24 months might have contributed as well to the good results in our study. One study reported that the results of open excision with symptoms for 2 years or less before surgery were better than those of patients who had preoperative symptoms for more than 2 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513480614">1</xref></sup> However, we did not analyze the results according to the symptom duration because there were no long-standing cases of more than 2 years’ duration in our study, and also, the number of patients in each group was not large enough for us to perform a multivariate analysis. In the current study, there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of postoperative VAS score, AOFAS score, and MFS; surgery duration; time to RTS; and patient satisfaction (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). Thus, it could be said that both techniques were effective in treating PAIS. There were no serious complications such as a wound problem, vascular injury, or permanent neural complication as well. Although most studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513480614">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513480614">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513480614">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513480614">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513480614">24</xref></sup> reported the absence of serious complications after the procedure, one recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513480614">22</xref></sup> reported an overall complication rate of 8.5% after posterior ankle and hindfoot arthroscopic surgery. More than half of the serious neural complications developed after complex procedures or arthroscopic subtalar arthrodesis in that study. The fact that the cases in the current study only underwent excision of the os trigonum may be the reason for the difference in the complication rate.</p>
<p>Two cases in the current study underwent both arthroscopic and posterior endoscopic procedures because of the technical difficulty in removing the os trigonum arthroscopically; the working space was very limited because of a large os trigonum in the posterior subtalar joint, and also, the visibility was poor in spite of the effort to keep the inflow pressure high. These cases were allocated to the arthroscopic group. On the contrary, there was no failure in the endoscopic group. Thus, it can be said that arthroscopic excision of the os trigonum had a failure rate in 2 of 16 (12.5%) cases. These were the 9th and the 17th cases among the 28 consecutive patients, and the sizes of the os trigonum in these 2 cases were in the top 30th percentile. We believe that more effort and attention were needed in arthroscopic excision of the os trigonum compared with the endoscopic procedure because we had to use a smaller arthroscope to steer through the tight subtalar joint. The fact that the procedure had to be performed on a patient in a supine position with a distraction device around the heel also meant that arthroscopic access to the os trigonum could be very demanding in some cases. In one case study, instead of the standard portals for subtalar arthroscopic surgery, the investigators used 2 stacked posterolateral subtalar portals in a lateral decubitus position.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513480614">17</xref></sup> Another study reported good results of arthroscopic excision of the os trigonum using the modified posterolateral and accessory posterolateral portals in a prone position for 11 cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513480614">12</xref></sup> We have no experience of 2 stacked portals or accessory posterolateral portals in a prone position.</p>
<p>The size of the os trigonum was determined by measurement of the long- and short-axis diameters of the os trigonum using the appropriate MRI scan. We admit that MRI measurements can be misleading at times, and our measurement cannot reflect the true size of the os trigonum. However, measurement of the actual os trigonum was not possible because it was usually broken into several pieces during its removal. We tried to decrease the measurement error by marking the axes by agreement of all the authors. Then, one board-certified orthopaedic surgeon who was blinded to the patients measured the diameters using the PACS internal ruler system. Statistical analysis revealed that the size was significantly larger in the endoscopic group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). It may be that the senior author had chosen the endoscopic technique in cases with a large os trigonum, especially after failure of the 2 cases, although he had not been aware at the time. We admit that this is one of the limitations in our retrospective study. However, we believe that this unintentional selection was made in the best interest of our patients. The similar surgery times between the 2 groups in spite of the size difference also indicate the technical advantage of the endoscopic technique in the current study. It is likely that much more time is needed for removal of a larger os trigonum. In the current study, the size of the os trigonum was larger than 135 mm<sup>2</sup> in the top 25th percentile of cases, and we now prefer to choose an endoscopic excision when the size of the os trigonum is larger than that. Another indication that we favor the endoscopic approach is the case of combined FHL tendinitis because release of the flexor retinaculum deep into the subtalar joint as well as addressing the posterior ankle joint and extra-articular soft tissue lesions are not possible with an arthroscopic approach. On the contrary, the arthroscopic approach is first chosen when ankle or subtalar arthroscopic surgery should be performed for a comorbid condition such as an osteochondral lesion of the talus, anterior impingement syndrome, or sinus tarsi syndrome. We excluded the cases that were combined with an ankle or subtalar disorder in the current study.</p>
<p>The forced hyperplantarflexion test is considered to be the most important for a diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513480614">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513480614">27</xref></sup> In the current study, all patients demonstrated the disappearance of posterior impingement pain in forced hyper–plantar flexion postoperatively. The advantage of subtalar arthroscopic surgery in a supine position was that we could inspect and address the abnormality on the anterior side of the posterior subtalar facet, if any. Although we excluded the cases of PAIS combined with a disorder of the ankle joint such as lateral instability or osteochondral lesion of the talus, we noted the occurrence of combined disorders in selected cases in our practice. It is also possible that these cases may have a subtalar pathological abnormality such as sinus tarsi syndrome because this can develop after an inversion injury of the ankle joint. It is reported that dancers may assume a more inverted en pointe position to decrease impingement of the posterior structures in PAIS; doing so, however, may place increased loads on the anterior tibiofibular ligament, which thus predisposes the dancers to frequent ankle sprains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513480614">18</xref></sup> In cases that required concurrent ankle arthroscopic surgery for the combined ankle injuries, we first performed ankle arthroscopic surgery in the lateral decubitus position and turned the patient to a prone position for posterior endoscopy. Although van Dijk et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513480614">28</xref></sup> suggested the use of ankle arthroscopic surgery in a prone position by hanging the foot upside down, we did not try the ankle arthroscopic procedure in a prone position in our practice.</p>
<p>The reason that we excluded the cases of combined lateral ankle instability, osteochondral lesion of the talus, and FHL tendinitis was that it could give a bias in analyzing the clinical outcomes. There have been several reports stating that the accompanying chondral injuries were associated with poorer surgical outcomes in the treatment of lateral ankle instability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513480614">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513480614">13</xref></sup> It has been reported that injury of the FHL tendon can occur with PAIS because the tendon glides on the posterolateral talar process or os trigonum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513480614">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513480614">27</xref></sup> One study reported the results of 146 posterior endoscopic procedures performed on 136 patients, including 52 cases of posterior bony impingement syndrome, among which 28 cases had concurrent FHL tendintis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513480614">27</xref></sup> We tried to avoid confounding by strict selection of the cases.</p>
<p>This study had some limitations. First, it was a retrospective nonrandomized study rather than a prospective randomized study. Second, the number of patients who underwent arthroscopic or endoscopic excision was relatively small because of the strict selection criteria. Third, our measurement using MRI could not reflect the true size of the os trigonum.</p>
<p>In summary, our study has shown that both arthroscopic and posterior endoscopic treatments were safe and effective in treating PAIS. It appeared that the arthroscopic technique was more demanding especially in case of a large os trigonum with a failure rate of 12.5%.</p>
