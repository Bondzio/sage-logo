<abstract>
<p>European Union (EU) healthcare services policy has been largely driven by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) applying the law of the internal market to the previously separate area of healthcare systems. We argue that it opened up two major risks: that health service planning would be disrupted by cross-border flows of patients and professionals, including ostensibly interchangeable professionals or procedures that actually vary in quality; and that health systems would be disrupted by the application of liberalizing EU regulatory frameworks. The threats have largely been managed by four developments. Cross-border flows have largely appeared as spot markets rather than broad competition. States, meanwhile, have managed both regulatory and planning risks by debating and then legislating, which increases legal certainty, and the ECJ has taken the hint and become more cautious in its rulings. Meanwhile, states and health systems alike have implemented a strategy of ‘bureaucratic resistance’ upon discovering how easy it is to comply in only the narrowest ways, thereby limiting affects on systems and regulations alike. The experience testifies to the difficulty of creating and sustaining health markets, but also to the risks of international trade in health services and the amount of effort it takes to manage such risks.</p>

<body>
<p>In theory, and Commission rhetoric,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0958928712440204">1</xref></sup> cross-border healthcare markets could be good for patients and states. States with long waiting times might try to shorten their waiting lists by sending patients abroad. Others may want to win revenue for their domestic healthcare sectors by receiving more foreign patients. Those with a shortage of professional staff might want to recruit from other countries, while states with high healthcare costs might seek to reduce those costs by introducing more competition into their healthcare system.</p>
<p>Tempting as these proposals might sound, however, opening a health system to greater international competition, patient or professional flows, comes with risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0958928712440204">Ferrera, 2005</xref>). Negative integration reopens a range of regulatory questions – from professional accreditation to aftercare to medical liability – whose answers are imperfect in many systems and nearly imponderable when taken out of the context of existing systems.</p>
<p>The history of European Union (EU) healthcare law is the history of these issues and starts to tell us which outcomes are realistic. A series of decisions made by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) made it very clear that health could be subject to the same EU laws and market principles as any other tradable service, obliging member states to create an EU health services policy that could mitigate the potential damage from these rulings to member states’ health systems. The resulting policy architecture is the most advanced political experiment we can point to in cross-border health services markets and regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0958928712440204">Jarman and Greer, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In examining this experiment, we ask two key questions: what are the potential risks to member state healthcare systems in creating a healthcare services market and how have policymakers, at the EU level and in member states, sought to manage these risks?</p>
<p>The first section of this paper presents the current state of EU health services policy, which has been dominated by internal market law. The second section explores the risks that EU health services policy presents: the risks associated with the free movement of patients and professionals, and those associated with EU-driven deregulation. We argue in the third section that policymakers have managed the risks to health systems. Their strategies include the use of spot markets, calls for ‘legal certainty’, increased caution by the ECJ, minimalist implementation through ‘willful ignorance’ of EU requirements and use of temporary and local healthcare markets for their own purposes. Finally, we assess the implications of this risk management approach for the future of health services policy.</p>
<p>The main lesson from the EU case for policymakers is that markets must be built. The EU’s early health law shocked policymakers, who feared that giving patients the right to seek care abroad would destabilize markets and invalidate key regulations. The real picture of EU health services law and policy, however, has become one of relative stability. This is not simply due to state reluctance and interest group lobbying. Trade in healthcare is difficult because much of healthcare is incommensurable. This makes passing legislation hard, and implementing that legislation very hard.</p>

<title>EU health policy: the shadow of the single market<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0958928712440204">2</xref></sup></title>
<p>It is no longer novel to point out that the EU has its own health policy. Having established that the EU does indeed have health policies, in name and in content, scholars are now beginning to study the developing architecture of the EU health policy regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0958928712440204">Greer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0958928712440204">Greer and Kurzer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0958928712440204">Hervey, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0958928712440204">Hervey and McHale, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0958928712440204">Lamping and Steffen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0958928712440204">Mossialos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0958928712440204">van de Gronden et al., 2011</xref>). EU health policy was, and is, more about markets than about individual or aggregate health outcomes. In comparison to European law and jurisprudence, addressing movements across borders to consume or provide services, competition and market development, European policy initiatives have formed a rather unfortunate, and sometimes ineffectual, appendix. This section very briefly presents the key issues (for more detail on each, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0958928712440204">Mossialos et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-0958928712440204">
<title>Patient mobility</title>
<p>Patient mobility is the signature issue of EU healthcare services law. It refers to the consequences and debates following on from two ECJ decisions from 1998: Kohll and Decker.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0958928712440204">3</xref></sup> In these decisions, the ECJ made two crucial moves. First, it started to apply EU market regulation law to healthcare. Healthcare policymakers had previously thought its exclusion from the treaties meant that they were protected from EU law. They were, the ECJ made clear, not protected, but actually vulnerable. The EU had a rather weak legal basis for health policies, but a strong basis to promote the freedom of movement of capital, goods, services and people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0958928712440204">Greer, 2009</xref>). Over the years 1998–2006, the ECJ made a string of major decisions that systematically undermined policies confining patients to treatment in their home country or making it difficult for foreign providers to enter healthcare systems. The resulting lobbying and member state pressure for legal stability eventually resulted in a directive<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0958928712440204">4</xref></sup> that member states must implement by 2013.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0958928712440204">
<title>Professional mobility</title>
<p>Professional mobility refers to the ability of a professional, educated and trained in one member state, to register and work in another. It has long been a policy objective of the EU, with the first legislation passed in the 1970s. The EU approach – stronger than the US or Canadian approach to interjurisdictional mobility – is one of ‘mutual recognition’. In mutual recognition, the member states all agree a certain standard of qualification (for example, a certain number of hours of education) and then accept each others’ credentials. This raises a number of obvious problems: above all, it has always been hard to believe that nursing or medical (let alone allied professions) training is comparable across the whole EU. As a result, the mutual recognition regime lets the host member state test for skills, including language skills, and apply its full range of regulations to the professional, so long as they do it in a non- discriminatory manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0958928712440204">Nicolaïdis and Schmidt, 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0958928712440204">5</xref></sup> This approach, which is formally quite strong but builds in a great deal of host country power, was consolidated through a series of directives in the early twenty-first century, applying to doctors, nurses and the other professions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0958928712440204">Peeters et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0958928712440204">
<title>State aids, competition and insurance</title>
<p>In addition, there is a large and complex body of EU law focused on the ways states shape markets. Apart from the sheer size of these bodies of law, their application is often far from obvious. (What exactly can be learned about health law from a decision about ownership of a sewage treatment plant or subsidies to a steel mill?)</p>
<p>Competition law focuses on eliminating the ways states rig markets in favour of one kind of participant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0958928712440204">Hatzopoulos, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0958928712440204">Prosser, 2009</xref>). It spans a wide range of issues, including antitrust regulation and polices’ ‘discrimination’ in favour of providers or citizens of a given member state. Its application to healthcare is that it can be used by providers to complain when there is a legal or regulatory advantage for another. State aid law focuses on subsidies, delineating the cases in which a state is illegally aiding an enterprise that should stand on its own two feet in the market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0958928712440204">Von Danwitz, 2011</xref>). If applied to healthcare, it can be used by one provider to complain that another, probably public sector, competitor is being subsidized and therefore getting an unfair advantage. Finally, in insurance regulation the EU has broadly sought to promote a larger European market in insurance products without much regard to the specific and highly regulated roles insurers play in different systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0958928712440204">Thomson and Mossialos, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>These bodies of law have a common goal: improving the internal market by enhancing the mobility of goods, services, capital and people. They are also, with the exception of professional mobility law, driven by the extension of law developed in other policies into the healthcare sphere. In most cases, it is the ECJ taking cases referred by member state courts, rather than legislation or a policy decision, that has extended such law.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0958928712440204">
<title>Negative and positive integration in EU healthcare services policy</title>
<p>It is important to note the differences between positive and negative integration in EU health services policy. The three areas discussed above – regulating services, people and capital – are all examples of negative integration, achieved by removing trade barriers. In this context, trade barriers include refusal to reimburse patients who were treated abroad, refusal to accredit a nurse from another member state or refusal to contract on equal terms with a firm from another member state. Negative integration creates an internal market by removing such barriers and leaving member state policymakers to adapt; this is why Ferrera refers to the EU’s effect as ‘destructuring’ and ‘deterritorializing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0958928712440204">Ferrera, 2005</xref>). It might be demolition for a good reason, but the action is demolition.</p>
<p>Positive integration means building cross-border policies. In the EU this can mean harmonization – putting a floor under member state standards at the same time as removing their ability to discriminate against each other. It also can mean policies in the ordinary sense of promoting research, infrastructure development or networks of various sorts. It can mean new governance mechanisms such as the open method of coordination (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0958928712440204">Greer and Vanhercke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0958928712440204">Sabel and Zeitlin, 2010</xref>). It cannot realistically mean redistribution to cushion the effects of economic change or finance a welfare state as the entire EU budget is about 1% of the EU’s gross domestic product.</p>
<p>The EU budget, treaty bases and difficult legislative process mean that positive integration is very hard, while the power of the ECJ and Commission, and the central role of the internal market in EU law, mean that negative integration is easy. This is the fundamental ‘constitutional asymmetry’ of the EU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0958928712440204">Scharpf, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>For our purposes, what matters is that EU health policy has overwhelmingly been negative integration informed by internal market law, and that it is very hard to turn that energy to positive ends. The EU’s political authorization for negative integration is powerful and solid; its political and legal warrants for positive integration are weak to non-existent and exclude spending anything like the money needed to run health systems or cushion the effects of its policies. It is a regulatory state, externalizing the costs of its actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0958928712440204">Mény, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0958928712440204">Page, 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section6-0958928712440204">
<title>The implications of negative integration: calculating policy risk</title>
<p>Legal and policy impact analyses of the developments outlined above have built up some very clear expectations about the potential risks for policymakers from a fully realized EU health services market. There are two sets of risks, and both are conceptually familiar from other cases of market-making and regulatory change. One set of risks stems from the extent to which the EU policies, dominated by market-making ‘negative integration’, promote the mobility of patients and professionals. The other is the effect of EU regulations on member state regulations – the purely legal effects that could change, or even destabilize, health systems even if the number of patients or doctors crossing borders is negligible.</p>
<sec id="section7-0958928712440204">
<title>Freer movement of people</title>
<p>The first set of risks (threats, opportunities) for healthcare systems comes from the actual prospect of market integration in health. It is, simply, the threat of destabilizing movements of patients and professionals: of having foreign patients swamp a hospital in a country with subsidized low tariffs; of having domestic patients go abroad for private operations and destabilize their previous hospitals; or of having professionals from a poorer country all move to a richer one. If the thrust of EU health policy is to reduce impediments to cross-border trade, then each EU policy makes its contribution.</p>
<p>Harmonization and mutual recognition of professional credentials should create (and has created) more cross-border professional mobility. Rich western countries have been able to solve staffing crises by hiring doctors from poorer accession states, who come with fewer, or at least different, transaction costs than doctors from outside the EU. Just after the Baltic states joined the EU in 2004, western countries hired large percentages of their medical workforces at salaries the Baltic states could never match (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0958928712440204">Wismar et al., 2011</xref>). Patient mobility law, especially in its central legal framing as an extension of the right to sell services, creates a variety of commercial opportunities, including medical tourism of various kinds, outsourcing and market entry of various kinds (for example, serving Germany from a firm incorporated in Hungary). They are already happening, especially in dental and similar services that are both expensive and not well covered by many health systems, or in services that vary widely such as in vitro fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0958928712440204">Glinos et al., 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0958928712440204">2010b</xref>). It is not hard to imagine ways in which cross-border markets could skim off certain lucrative procedures and leave most healthcare systems with worse financial problems – this is particularly easy to imagine because very few people can make much claim to understand the webs of cross-subsidies within hospitals and healthcare systems. Nor is it hard to imagine the negative consequences if, for example, Bulgarian patients were allowed to go to Germany and oblige Bulgaria to pay German prices (in the Elchinov<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0958928712440204">6</xref></sup> decision, the ECJ made exactly that determination, with policy effects yet to be seen) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0958928712440204">Sokol, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This is a classic problem: what if increased competition undermines the ability of healthcare systems and institutions to deliver all of their various objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0958928712440204">Ferrera, 2005</xref>)? These objectives relate to areas as distinct as employment, education, community identity, economic development, research and social care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0958928712440204">Marmor, 2001</xref>). The challenge, therefore, is that healthcare and healthcare professionals would be easily tradable, and would be traded. This would undermine the financial and workforce policies of healthcare systems that were accustomed to relying on a degree of closure – for example, risk pooling for patients, or education and training policies that assume that most professionals stay home.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0958928712440204">
<title>Regulatory risks</title>
<p>The second challenge from EU health law is to the architecture of existing health systems. EU law has an impact regardless of whether any patients move. This is because it outlines certain legal principles that health policies cannot violate. A policy that violates EU law is legally risky because any member state court could overturn it. This attribute of EU law is important in understanding how EU cases and legislation can have effects far greater than the actual populations affected (it is known as ‘supremacy’, because EU law is supreme to member state law, and ‘direct effect’, because EU law does not depend on member state enactment to apply).</p>
<p>The implication for member states is that even if few patients cross their borders their policies could be judged to be non-compliant with the internal market. A challenge under EU law is a standard option for interests that wish to remove a regulation that bothers them. In health law, for example, the plaintiffs in key cases have often wanted something at home and used EU law to get it: a faster hip replacement,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0958928712440204">7</xref></sup> an end to local governments subsidizing competitors to a for-profit hospital chain,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0958928712440204">8</xref></sup> a procedure for a rare disease that was not available in the patient’s home country<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0958928712440204">9</xref></sup> or faster payment for medical devices suppliers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0958928712440204">10</xref></sup> The EU’s negative integration threatens to undermine regulation and existing practice without creating positive regulation or being able to rely on mutually understandable definitions of care, care professionals or quality.</p>
<p>As a result, policymakers in the member states, faced with EU law, must consider the entire web of restrictions and cross-subsidies that make up a healthcare system and the possible challenges. The challenges would come under EU law – a legal system whose commitment to competition is vastly greater and better documented than any commitment to the quality, financial stability or solidarity (let alone regulatory compliance costs) of healthcare systems. A major risk (perhaps the only major risk) lies not in mobile patients, but in potential ill-advised deregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0958928712440204">Hervey, 2011</xref>: 242).</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section9-0958928712440204">
<title>From market-making to managed risks</title>
<p>These two kinds of risk started to emerge in 1998. Since then, health systems, member states, lobbies and others have had time to gauge the risks and benefits and try to manage them. In the face of an uncertain policy environment, policymakers have, more or less wittingly, adopted defensive political strategies which protect domestic systems as they exist. There are four reasons, detailed below, why the risks have not been as alarming as expected.</p>
<sec id="section10-0958928712440204">
<title>Creating spot markets</title>
<p>Buying healthcare or labour domestically, let alone across borders, does not mean buying a standard or easily described good. Can a nurse be a nurse if he or she cannot insert an intravenous needle or lacks a university degree (as is the case in Germany, but not the UK)? Can an ambulance crew decide how to treat a patient during a call (as in the UK) or should a doctor attend (as in Germany)? Different European health systems have different answers. It is not easy to systematically determine what patients are getting when they cross borders, or what kinds of professionals providers are hiring. Because of this, policymakers have been reluctant to rely too heavily on EU healthcare markets to supply healthcare or healthcare professionals – as have managers in places with the wealth or workforces to avoid hiring abroad.</p>
<p>This uncertainty is perhaps best understood using the sociological concept of commensurability. Commensurability is the process of relating different units or practices by means of an external metric and it is considered essential to market formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0958928712440204">Levin and Espeland, 2002</xref>: 124–5). When it works, commensurability makes it easy to compare products, easing shopping, policy and competition. Commensuration should be used with caution, however, as it turns qualitative differences into quantitative ones, focusing attention on what it measures and diverting attention away from what it does not, and thereby often destroying a great deal of data.</p>
<p>Healthcare has, by and large, not proven easily commensurable, despite enormous expenditure of political and economic capital toward that goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0958928712440204">Timmermans and Berg, 2003</xref>). In terms of healthcare procedures or personnel, there are some fundamental disagreements. What are the units being measured? What controls should there be? What are the relevant data, and how should they be interpreted? Definitions are simply not agreed: does bariatric surgery include just the procedure, or also the adjustments often required over a subsequent year, or the outcome of whether the patient loses weight and stays thinner? Who gets credit for a good outcome, then – the doctor, the team, the hospital or some wider care network?</p>
<p>Abstracting from all this complexity to a comparable EU level would be a challenge. Most systems define the terms of trade and assure some level of quality through a mixture of mechanisms: formal regulatory ones, mostly run at the member state level, and informal ones that mostly operate locally – professional networks, local reputations, referrals and so on. None of that is easily, or perhaps ever, going to be abstracted enough to be comprehensible on a European level. Nor is this necessarily desirable – concerns about reducing healthcare to a set of numbers or pecuniary measurements are central to criticisms of EU initiatives such as the open method of coordination (OMC). Trading incommensurable, or badly commensurated goods, is not generally a good idea and explains why cross-border healthcare or professional migration is more risky than domestic consumption.</p>
<p>The quality and planning case against international healthcare markets has a serious flaw; however, markets can be useful. Specifically, healthcare policy depends on matching a number of variables that are not easy to connect, for example workforce, finance, capacity and demand. Nobody gets it right every time and sometimes politics demands a major change in the relationships between those variables. Sometimes, a member state wants more doctors or procedures than it can generate from its own internal resources or educated professionals for which it has no posts.</p>
<p>The result is an international phenomenon in health that is somewhat enhanced by EU health policy: spot markets. Spot markets are characterized mostly by their informality and the uniqueness of individual transactions; there are not enough similar transactions concerning commensurable goods to have a stable supply, demand, venue or regulation. Those demanding extra health capacity, from health decision-makers and managers to patients themselves, have few incentives to create permanent shifts in the pattern of services, but still wish to take advantage of temporary deals. The European markets for both professionals and procedures are essentially spot markets: non-standard and often small. They reflect the disadvantages of shopping in a market with limited commensurability – and the advantages of using foreign help to get out of a difficult situation.</p>
<p>In terms of professionals, the EU internal market is growing rapidly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0958928712440204">11</xref></sup> Outflows from new member states are significant and a large number of the older member states have a substantial proportion of medical staff from overseas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0958928712440204">Glinos, 2012</xref>). In the UK, Ireland and Spain, most of the immigration is from outside the EU, but in other states, such as Austria, Belgium, France, Germany and Italy, professional immigration is mostly from within the EU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0958928712440204">Maier et al., 2011</xref>). Migration flows tend to follow patterns of language education, social networks and colonial relationships, which mean that different member states have very different patterns of health workforce mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0958928712440204">Rutten, 2009</xref>). In fact, much of the professional movement within the EU has been driven by the UK’s large expansion of health workforces under the Blair government, which is already largely over (as the UK expanded its own professional training and education and is unlikely to be doing much hiring in the near future). The EU regulatory framework includes a very minimal level of harmonization, turning a blind eye to the very significant differences in education, training, qualification, specializations and even core skill sets. One comprehensive report found that there was inadequate information about the training, language skills, communications skills, necessary support from employers, cultures and collegial interactions of immigrant professionals working in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0958928712440204">Young et al., 2010</xref>: 113–5). It is hard to think of many other attributes of a professional!</p>
<p>Patient mobility within the EU is also a non- standard set of markets, the biggest of which are quite predictable. The biggest flows are in border regions, and quite stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0958928712440204">Rosenmöller et al., 2006</xref>). A few very small countries, such as Malta, have had long-standing agreements to send patients for complex treatments to other countries (in Malta’s case, the UK). A few Spanish areas with large concentrations of British and German retirees have complex payment politics – but the problems associated with this long-standing issue are not obviously worse than the payment politics between Spanish regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0958928712440204">Greer, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Just as professional labour markets fill gaps or reflect ordinary life decisions, patient mobility is a mixture of pragmatic local practices and a small number of almost one-off transactions. What markets have developed have been in relatively commensurable goods, such as dental laboratories. There also seems to be travel for plastic surgery and similar, relatively marginal areas, in which primary exit is important. The data are poor, but the numbers seem small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0958928712440204">Glinos et al., 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>What happens to concerns about quality when these spot markets are operating? Two aspects of these various transactions suppress squeamishness. First, these spot purchases are generally not long-term relationships. So they are a ‘temporary’ gamble with quality, with limited effects. Or, to put it another way, states and provider organizations that really want to hire professionals tend to discover that quality does not demand such stringent regulations after all. The UK demonstrated this in the early twenty-first century, when it began its international hiring. In the same way, the patients who chose to seek care abroad without preauthorization are making their own judgements about quality. There are obvious problems – many operations are unethical if done without consistent aftercare – but patients seeking such care are apparently untroubled by risks, or unconvinced that the risks are much greater than they would face at home.</p>
<p>Second, at most levels, member state bureaucracies have used other mechanisms to establish trust beyond the very thin levels guaranteed by EU ‘harmonization’. So, for example, most cross-border patient mobility takes place in border regions where there is a lot of available local information, formal and tacit, about the healthcare resources. It is not that difficult for policymakers in the eastern Pyrenees to estimate the use French patients would make of the hospital just over the border in Puigcerdà, or for policymakers in Northern Ireland and the northwest of Ireland to get a sense of local opinions and likely quality of treatment across the border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0958928712440204">Jamison et al., 2006</xref>). When there are transactions between systems that do not have this local concreteness, as when the English national health service bought Belgian hospital services, they acted with a considerable amount of due diligence, including visits to the hospitals in question and discussions of Belgian hospital quality statistics.</p>
<p>In the same way, the effort to use mutual recognition for health professionals has produced as much reticence as efficiency. EU law does not authorize the receiving member state to impose special tests of competency (a doctor is a doctor is a doctor in European law) and even limits language tests. Once a professional has started to practice for a long period of time, he or she can be required to conform to the host country’s professional licensing, meaning problems are concentrated in short-term employment. This puts the burden of quality control on whoever hires or pays doctors; given the amount of healthcare quality control that runs through hospital-based ‘clinical governance’, this can mean minimal or duplicative professional regulation. Increasing regulatory requirements on one professional is the opposite of arbitrage or competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0958928712440204">Nicolaïdis and Schmidt, 2007</xref>). Given the apparent global health workforce shortage, the result is that ‘purchasing’ member states determine the conditions of workforce mobility in light of their domestic politics and needs.</p>

<title>Calls for legal certainty</title>
<p>The small size of healthcare markets does not make the destabilization effect of the EU go away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0958928712440204">Greer and Rauscher, 2011a</xref>). The regulatory risk, of new legal challenges that undermine systems, remains even if nobody goes to a different country. Member states and lobbies, in gauging their risks, had to decide how much attention the EU should receive and what their response should be. They had two responses available: try to channel and change the EU; and comply.</p>
<p>The first way to control the disruption created by the ECJ is to legislate. Discussions of EU healthcare policy since 1998 have recurrently called for ‘legal certainty’, which effectively means an end to case-by-case ECJ decisions as a policymaking process. Legal certainty, compared with case-based decisions, has a number of advantages: it involves the expertise and full range of objectives of health policymakers, rather than a single body of law; it involves politicians and states, rather than leaving it to the EU lawyers; and it is much clearer as, unlike cases, legislation is clearly written to apply in every member state. It was perfectly rational for member states and health system policymakers to ignore or only minimally comply with the destabilizing ECJ decisions while investing in lobbying and legislation that would shape the EU law to their taste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0958928712440204">Conant, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The basic approach of the Commission and states was not clear at first, with a variety of options discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928712440204">Greer, 2008</xref>). They included treating health as a service in the market, as a service of general economic interest and as a specific legislative field in its own right. States, the Commission and relevant interests also invested in less formal supportive mechanisms that allowed them to formulate directions and shared priorities in health policy, including the OMC and a high-level group.</p>
<p>The victorious option, after healthcare was removed from the services (‘Bolkestein’) directive, was specific legislation for healthcare services (Directive 2011/24/EU). The legislation had to fulfill a number of different requirements: it had to be aligned with the ECJ’s extensive jurisprudence, it had to respond to the European Parliament’s interest in strengthening patients’ rights to consumer healthcare across borders and it had to respond to member states’ general lack of interest in having their healthcare systems destabilized by patient mobility and patient mobility regulation. The resulting directive was complex and the effects of its various provisions are far from clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0958928712440204">van de Gronden et al., 2011</xref>). What is worth noting is that the directive, on most issues, amounts to the member states’ most restrictive interpretation of the jurisprudence. There are clear incentives to travel under existing social security coordination law, which requires preauthorization, but fully reimburses costs. Patients travelling under the directive, without preauthorization, are not guaranteed full (or sometimes any) reimbursement.</p>
<p>This restrictive financial framework makes care abroad a niche and luxury good relative to the existing and long-established social security coordination route, which depends on preauthorization. From an overall policy perspective, this is crucial; if the state-controlled social security route is more attractive than the patient-directed market route, then states will mostly be freed from unexpected patient flows.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0958928712440204">
<title>Caution in the court</title>
<p>Healthcare law in the EU developed as the ECJ directly read the treaties, and the treaties trump legislation. If the court finds part of the directive objectionable, it can strike it down. Furthermore, an instrument as complex as the new directive will require interpretation by courts, including quite possibly the ECJ. As a result, the direction of the ECJ still matters. There is a developing case, though, that the ECJ has been engaged in its own learning procedure. It is hard to find any evidence in its early healthcare decisions that it knew much about the substance of healthcare – even that it knew enough to realize that it was entering a complex, politically difficult and very expensive area that has a record of creating serious policy headaches. Now, the tide of ECJ assertiveness seems to be ebbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0958928712440204">Hatzopolous and Hervey, 2012</xref>). The ECJ’s shifts are leaving some of the most alarming legal policy and analyses beached (which means the legal risk is that the tide flows back in).</p>
<p>The mechanism that would allow the ECJ to realize it has overstepped – in policy and political terms – would be ‘dialogue’ with the member state courts that give it references to new cases and give its principles coherence around the EU. The ECJ, as a top court, does not spend much time directly engaged in dialogue with other top political institutions. Its dialogues are with other legal elites – member state courts; Commission legal services (conveniently also located in Luxembourg), which have an extremely good rate of winning ECJ cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0958928712440204">Jupille, 2004</xref>: 98); and the large scholarly field of EU law, which is particularly tightly tied to the ECJ and the European Commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0958928712440204">Conant, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0958928712440204">Schepel and Wesseling, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0958928712440204">Vauchez, 2008</xref>). The ECJ is harder to study, but it seems that the cases referred from member state courts, and the uses that member state courts have made of its rulings, have been alerting it to the complexities, policy problems and political risks that come with its intervention in healthcare.</p>
<p>The legal evidence for the ECJ’s learning process is in its move away from the most radical concepts that it has enunciated in its rulings. The first conceptual problem was that the ECJ began its series of cases on the premise that there was something clearly called ‘hospital care’, defined as such because it was delivered in a ‘hospital’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0958928712440204">12</xref></sup> Defining ‘hospital’ and ‘non-hospital’ care has been a considerable challenge for policymakers and lawyers because it seems there is little or no consistency in the meaning of hospitals or what kinds of care takes place in them across Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0958928712440204">Healy and McKee, 2002</xref>). Originally, the purpose of this distinction was to soften the potentially disruptive effects of the healthcare decisions by limiting them to ‘non-hospital’ care. The ECJ has expanded the applicability of internal market law to hospital services over time and might have expanded its willingness to accept exceptions on grounds of member states’ need for financially stable systems. One benefit is that the hospital/non-hospital debate becomes less important.</p>
<p>The ECJ and its auditor general also experimented with a variety of other legal principles that would help the ECJ to identify discrimination, including the possibility that there was such a thing as an unreasonable waiting time (in the auditor general’s report for Watts<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0958928712440204">13</xref></sup>). This would not just have been a challenge to the autonomy and rationing mechanisms of the UK, it would also have been quite remarkably prescriptive and involved EU law in very expensive and complex issues. If the mechanism of rationing by waiting was under threat in Watts, the mechanism of rationing by limited lists was also under threat from the ECJ’s idea that member states should have to use ‘European’ criteria in deciding what to cover (in the ECJ’s decision in Geraets-Smits and Peerbooms<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0958928712440204">14</xref></sup>). Had the ECJ taken these two options, it would have destabilized two of the key forms of healthcare rationing (leaving co-payments alone; there is no doubt that they comply with EU law). In both cases the ECJ seems to have drawn back. It opted not to decide on the legitimacy of, or criteria for, appropriate waiting lists in Watts. It also refrained from operationalizing or repeating its demand for ‘European’ standards after Geraets-Smits and Peerbooms. Arguments and dialogue with other courts and Commission legal services probably explain why the ECJ chose not to stick with a line of reasoning that would have produced radical policy consequences.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting cases have come from just outside patient and professional mobility. The FENIN case<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0958928712440204">15</xref></sup> was an important one because it confronted the key question of whether, and how, healthcare was subject to internal market law. The ECJ, once again, pulled back from a relatively strong advocate general’s report and expressed some principles that allowed for clearly public-oriented businesses to have some protection from application of internal market law (to the irritation of EU competition law commentators, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0958928712440204">Schweitzer, 2011</xref>: 24, but the relief of member state civil servants interviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0958928712440204">Greer, 2009</xref>). Likewise, two decisions about whether state aid and competition law could reduce subsidies to healthcare systems decided in favour of existing systems. Both the British insurer BUPA and the German firm Asklepios Kliniken had complained that they were being subject to unfairly subsidized competition from public competitors, and sued.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0958928712440204">16</xref></sup> Both suits failed when the EU’s lower court ruled that the health systems were pursuing a legitimate goal (financial stability) with legitimate means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0958928712440204">van de Gronden, 2009</xref>). The ECJ seems to be settling on a compromise quite typical of EU law (especially of competition law), in which it accepts that there can be wide exceptions to internal market law so long as they are determined by clearly specified rules that the ECJ accepts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0958928712440204">17</xref></sup> This approach plays to its strengths: the ECJ, and member states’ courts, have limited expertise in clinical medicine, and both case law and the new directive defer to clinical decisions. They do feel quite comfortable judging administrative procedures for their transparency, coherence, non-discrimination and sensitivity to citizen interests. In other words, they set rules for the rights associated with social citizenship.</p>

<title>Bureaucratic resistance and willful ignorance</title>
<p>Finally, states have learned (or had officials’ suspicions confirmed) about the limits of even directly applicable law that creates a private right of action against them. Namely, it is relatively easy to ignore. On one level there is formal compliance. Formally, the professional mobility directives that should have been transposed have mostly been transposed, and the work of minimal harmonization (for example, 5500 hours of some kind of education as a minimal amount of education for a doctor) was mostly done in the 1970s. Patient mobility is trickier because it is not easy to define ‘compliance’: what exactly was the obligation of a government in Spain to apply a UK decision such as Watts (which made it clear that EU health law applies to national health systems) to its own system? Some quite comprehensive surveys of member states’ reactions have found that formal compliance was relatively easy and low priority (some states say, with no obvious justification, that they were already compliant and did not need to change anything) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0958928712440204">Baeten et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0958928712440204">Wismar et al., 2010</xref>). More detailed studies start to touch on the informal affects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0958928712440204">Glinos et al., 2010b</xref>). They report much the same: minimal legal changes and spot markets that address the incumbent managers’ problems (also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0958928712440204">Glinos et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0958928712440204">Greer and Rauscher, 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0958928712440204">Kostera, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0958928712440204">Obermaier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0958928712440204">Martinsen and Blomqvist, 2009</xref>). Thus, for example, there is a pattern of contracts for relatively short periods of time in which capacity-constrained national health service states buy from social insurance systems with higher densities of hospital beds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0958928712440204">Glinos et al., 2010b</xref>). When we examine the actual mechanisms by which systems steer patients, or ration, we are a long way away from the world of EU law. Patients’ decisions reflect local circumstances, local doctors and managers, and their own bureaucratic literacy much more than the different treaty articles.</p>
<p>Over time, discrepant member state interpretation and implementation could lead to law suits, which might, in turn, lead to more demand for more prescriptive EU legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0958928712440204">Kelemen, 2011</xref>). This process could take years, during which time contained compliance is a reasonable bureaucratic calculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0958928712440204">Greer and Almagro de Iniesta, forthcoming 2012</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section14-0958928712440204">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our analysis shows why EU health law, in its original liberalizing form, was so worrisome. It did not just promise to create destabilizing markets, it also promised to invalidate enough regulations to produce a trade in incommensurable professionals and goods. The images had something to worry anybody: hospitals capsized by departing or arriving flows of patients, inept locum doctors injecting drugs whose labels they could not read, private firms using EU law to block public service subsidies, private insurers cream-skimming from public funds, prescriptions from a country with co-payments being filled for free in another at its expense (possibly in service of prescription drug abuse) and competition law demanding that foreign private firms be allowed to supply public services or challenges to professional regulation in the name of migration.</p>
<p>The worries of policymakers have been confirmed in one, very basic, sense. There is an EU health policy, with a policy community, lobbies, policies and allies to match (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0958928712440204">Greer, 2009</xref>). EU issues have joined the long list of things they must monitor and sometimes engage. The virtues of their engagement are visible, though, in that the EU has not had more dramatic effects so far. The legislative history of EU health policy has shown that states can and do craft legislation that avoids the most dramatic and disruptive options. In professional mobility, the result has been beneficial to richer health systems that have been able to manage their recruitment. In patient mobility, the changes at each step since the services directive have increased states’ ability to manage patient flows and regulatory risk.</p>
<p>States’ and lobbies’ political engagement in Brussels does not fully explain the relative stability we see when compared with somewhat alarming early impact analyses. EU health policy is also developing as a case study in the difficulty of adding markets to healthcare systems. There are two key reasons. First, implementation is hard. Health systems managers, professionals and patients do not just have good reasons to ‘buy local’; they also have many ways to avoid participating in markets if they do not wish to.</p>
<p>Second, trade in healthcare is difficult and healthcare markets are small, because so much healthcare is not commensurable. Even within most healthcare systems, it is hard to find a credible quantitative measure of healthcare quality that communicates much (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0958928712440204">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). Across borders, the need for such measures is greater, and their availability less. They are needed because a patient bound for another country (save in a border region) or a manager hiring a doctor from elsewhere lack all the local embedded knowledge that comes from reputations, networks and referrals. Stripped of tacit knowledge, they depend on formal, commensurable metrics to know what they are buying, let alone its quality. And they do not have such metrics – cross-border comparable data are barely able to shed light on the differences between whole countries, let alone hospitals or doctors. This means that participation in global spot markets is risky and is likely to stay that way.</p>
<p>The results so far have not been bad for most policymakers and states. The spot markets might be serving as a sort of safety valve. The UK under the second Blair government gave us an example of a state that used, and then left, the markets. It is never clear that an EU policy based on a limited interpretation of actionable legal rights is stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0958928712440204">Kelemen, 2011</xref>), but so far the regulatory consequences have been limited.</p>
<p>The difficulty of creating real commensurability, even within the EU, has implications for healthcare markets, trade in healthcare across borders and general discussions of international economic integration. The EU may not have strong harmonization mechanisms in health, but organizations such as the World Trade Organization, through its body of legal rules, and the International Organization for Standardization, through its standard-setting technical committees, certainly do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0958928712440204">Jarman and Greer, 2010</xref>). Promoting free markets is a large part of the remit of both organizations. Maintaining and improving health outcomes is not. At the same time, the professional networks and knowledge that might temper this focus on markets remain stubbornly local. Trade in incommensurable products is usually limited, for good reason. Europe has approached it with the full range of EU policy tools and applied them to systems that are mostly quite sustainable. Globally, neither the EU’s extensive policy toolkit nor its strong health systems can be taken for granted. That suggests the worst of both worlds outside Europe: limited markets and poor quality. The provisional results from the European experiment are primarily a tribute to the difficulty of trading health services and the skills of its bureaucrats in the face of potentially radical deregulation.</p>
