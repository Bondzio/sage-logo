<italic>Sita Sings the Blues</italic> is a feature film written, directed, produced, and animated by comic artist Nina Paley. It retells part of the ancient Indian Ramayana epic from the point of view of Sita, the wife of the hero, Prince Rama. Sita is kidnapped by the demon king Ravana who takes her to his island kingdom of Lanka. Aided by loyal monkey prince Hanuman and an army of monkeys, Rama rescues Sita, but he comes to doubt her fidelity while in captivity and so banishes her to the forest where the spurned wife gives birth to his two sons. The movie also tells a parallel story of Paley’s own marriage, which ends hurtfully after her husband goes to India for a job, becomes emotionally withdrawn, and then dumps her by e-mail. These tales are told in several different styles of animation. Colorful figures in the style eighteenth-century Rajput painting convey the main Ramayana narrative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0276146712446776">Figure 1</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0276146712446776">1</xref>
</sup> Traditional Indonesian shadow puppets give hilariously argumentative commentary on the Ramayana in ironic, Indian-accented English (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0276146712446776">Figure 2</xref>). A computer-generated “squigglevision” version of traditional line drawings depicts Paley’s personal love and loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0276146712446776">Figure 3</xref>). Vector graphic animation of Sita singing provides the film’s emotional punch since these scenes are set to outstanding renditions of American blues standards originally recorded in the late 1920s by jazz age chanteuse Annette Hanshaw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0276146712446776">Figure 4</xref>). These songs of longing moved Paley deeply and motivated her to almost single-handedly create a full-length motion picture on her laptop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0276146712446776">Rochlin 2009</xref>).</p>

<p> After a good five years of development, <italic>Sita Sings the Blues</italic> premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2008 and was made available over the Internet and on DVD in 2009. It has received critical acclaim. At this writing (March 2012), <italic>Sita</italic> garners a 100 percent “fresh” rating from thirty-three critics on rottentomatoes.com, a respectable ninety-four “metascore” on metacritic.com, and 41 five-star and 4 four-star DVD reviews on amazon.com.  Major American reviewers, such as Roger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0276146712446776">Ebert (2008)</xref> of the <italic>Chicago Sun-Times</italic> and A. O. Scott of the <italic>New York Times</italic>, have raved about the movie and it has screened at a number of film festivals and art museums worldwide. Paley’s fusion of disparate cultural forms is superbly done and very charming. On purely artistic grounds this film comes highly recommended, but <italic>Sita</italic> also provides macromarketing insights.</p>
<p> Documentary films and short videos constitute a vast but untapped data source for macromarketing research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0276146712446776">Belk 2011</xref>). These materials help viewers understand marketing systems and societies visually and can vividly expose market failures and gross inequities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146712446776">Pennington and Ball 2011</xref>). <italic>Sita Sings the Blues</italic> is not a documentary film. It is pure entertainment, a work of fiction that does not in itself provide much direct visual evidence germane to macromarketing. However, this animated picture comes with an exceptional backstory that does have great relevance. The creation and distribution of <italic>Sita Sings the Blues</italic> raises questions about the cultural rights of religious groups, corporate infringement on the cultural commons, and how technology has empowered alternative distribution channels.</p>
<p> Religions exert political, institutional, and especially social authority over markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0276146712446776">Mittelstaedt 2002</xref>). In the case of <italic>Sita Sings the Blues</italic>, Hindu religious fundamentalists have tried to shut down distribution because they believe the film defiles a sacred text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0276146712446776">Chazkel 2011</xref>). A religious conglomerate known as Hindu Janajagruti Samiti has fumed that “The film attempts to misrepresent the events and characters of Ramayana in most derogatory manner through its explicit graphics, audio and dialogues” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0276146712446776">Ekadashi 2009</xref>). When the film was to be shown in Queens, New York, some Hindus protested, among other things, against cartoon Sita’s voluptuousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0276146712446776">Reddy 2011</xref>). Comments on the Internet have been personally abusive toward Paley and some so grotesque she has not published them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0276146712446776">Melwani 2010</xref>). Assessing the true extent of this opposition is difficult, but since the mid-1980s, the pro-Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has cast Rama as a strong, martial lord “to encourage militancy among Hindus, who the BJP believes have been made to feel like second-class citizens in India” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0276146712446776">Tripathi 2008</xref>, p. 77). By taking Sita’s perspective, and by showing Rama as a man with limitations, Paley not only contests this heroic BJP interpretation but also may be challenging ingrained habits of patriarchy and male chauvinism. The notion of a “Sitayana”—telling the story from Sita’s perspective—is an old tradition in India and contemporary Indian writers, such as Nabaneeta Dev Sen and Madhu Kishwar, have contributed feminist critiques of the Ramayana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0276146712446776">Tripathi 2008</xref>).</p>
<p> Visually speaking, Paley’s interpretations of Sita’s female form are quite innocent when compared to the long tradition in India of erotic paintings and sculptures, the latter including sexually explicit bas-reliefs on Hindu temples.  Still, animation has had a special capacity to stir up trouble among religious zealots. For example, cartoons published in Denmark’s <italic>Jyllands-Posten</italic> in 2005 depicted the Prophet Muhammad in various guises, including that of a terrorist.  As word about this spread among Muslims, riots broke out that eventually led to hundreds of deaths in the Middle East, to the torching of the Danish embassy in Beirut, and to embargoes on and boycotts of Danish products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0276146712446776">
<italic>The Economist</italic> 2006</xref>). In 2010, a website run by Muslim extremists threatened the lives of the creators of the grossly satirical American cartoon series, South Park, for affronts to Allah who was shown wearing a bear costume, purportedly in deference to Muslim proscriptions against images of the Prophet. Two of the perpetrators went to prison for this act and for other terrorist activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0276146712446776">Barrett 2012</xref>).</p>
<p> <italic>Sita Sings the Blues</italic> has many fans among Indians who are not at all sympathetic to the pro-Hindu position. One of the Indian American voice actors in the film commented: “In the last two decades, the right-wing religious forces in India—Hindu and Muslim—have become very strong, vocal and sometimes violent” . . . “but I also know that there are enough sane, balanced, liberal people in India who take art for what it is” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0276146712446776">Kohn 2008</xref>). The late filmmaker Manish Acharya, who was also a voice actor, defended Paley:  “If people are offended, I don’t think anyone has the right to tell them that they are wrong.  But just as they have the right to push their interpretation of ‘The Ramayana,’ this filmmaker has the right to push hers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0276146712446776">Kohn 2008</xref>). Paley herself is scornful of the criticism:  “In India, offending people is basically against the law. Various groups in India compete over which one will be the most offended” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0276146712446776">Chazkel 2011</xref>, p. 141).</p>
<p> Some faultfinders on the left have said the film represents a Western, neocolonialist point of view. Paley’s vision of the Ramayana is undoubtedly influenced by her American upbringing, but also by her creative understanding of and fondness for Indian art and imagery. Culture travels and fuses with other cultures. Historically, there have been many interpretations of the Ramayana. Its themes have had universal appeal, and for over two millennia this epic had been transmitted orally from India as far as Japan to the east and Iran to the west. “In Southeast Asia in particular, it has indigenised beyond recognition.  Over the years, many tellings of the Ramayana tale have emerged to reflect their cultural ethos” (Peranakan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0276146712446776">Museum 2010</xref>). For example, the Indonesian cultural ethos today celebrates the Ramayana name in branding. Jakarta’s Ramayana Lestari Sentosa (abiding peace) department store chain is a major retailer, and on Batam Island near Singapore, day-trippers frequent the Robinson &amp; Ramayana shopping mall. An outfit from Yogyakarta markets Ramayana brand corona cigars with the brown box featuring drawings of shadow puppets. Indonesia is a predominantly Muslim country that observes its Hindu heritage, but perhaps in more cultural than religious terms. On the predominantly island of Bali, Hindu religious festivals and culture are important components of its vital tourist industry.</p>
<p> In the early stages of creating <italic>Sita Sings the Blues</italic>, and soon after her own marriage had collapsed, a friend introduced Paley to the largely forgotten blues recordings of Annette Hanshaw. Paley has said she was “profoundly inspired” by this music and decided to animate the songs and interweave them into her film because they so well captured Sita’s emotions at different points in the narrative. Only later, when she sought theatrical distribution, did she fully appreciate the copyright issues these songs introduced. Legal research showed that Hanshaw’s performances had entered the public domain, but the rights to the lyrics and music belonged to corporate entities thanks to the 1998 US Copyright Term Extension Act (aka the “Sonny Bono Act” after the late California Congressman who sponsored it and the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act” because of Disney’s strenuous efforts to keep its characters out of the public domain).  The owners wanted $220,000 for licensing rights, a sum eventually negotiated down to $50,000, but even that amount plus $20,000 in attorney’s fees was a lot of money for Paley to scrape together.  The entire production budget for the film was under $200,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0276146712446776">Chazkel 2011</xref>). Paley did finally settle, releasing the songs from “copyright jail” as she put it, but because of the initial problems with copyright infringement, the film never had a theatrical run through conventional distribution.</p>
<p> In 2009, Paley made <italic>Sita Sings the Blues</italic> available for free on YouTube. She also had sold DVDs, as well as soundtrack CDs, color prints, and tee shirts, from the movie website (http://sitasingstheblues.com/). <italic>Sita</italic> has been released under a Creative Commons “Attribution-Share Alike” license, which permits free copying and adaptation with the only stipulation being that any new work also has to be attributed to the originator and available under the same license. Fans have uploaded numerous copies of the entire film, as well as individual Annette Henshaw song segments, on YouTube. Financially speaking, self-distribution may be a suboptimal for independent filmmakers like Paley, but her work appears to have reached a wide audience through the Internet and, therefore, may have provided some psychological income. Blogs and other Internet sources indicate that Paley remains active as an artist and advocate.</p>
<p> Given the legal difficulties making and distributing her film, it is not surprising that Paley opposes overly restrictive copyright regimes. Copying is not theft in her view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712446776">Paley 2009</xref>), and unlike with tangible things there can be no tragedy of the cultural commons. She is not alone. Around the world an active “free culture” or “copyleft” movement has emerged. It is comprised of nonprofit organizations ranging from the Creative Commons (http://creativecommons.org/), which “develops, supports, and stewards legal and technical infrastructure that maximizes digital creativity, sharing, and innovation,” to QuestionCopyright.org (http://questioncopyright.org/), which aims to expand debate and reframe thinking about copyright, to the Pirate Bay (http://thepiratebay.se/), an anticorporate Swedish website that enables file sharing and piracy. The expansion of copyright terms by lawmakers, who appear to be working at the behest of large corporations, has created a political backlash, while digital technologies have empowered artists and consumers to establish alternative channels of distribution.</p>
<p> From a societal and ethical perspective, copyright protection has different meanings for different stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0276146712446776">Nill and Geipel 2009</xref>). Not only might the interests of creators, companies, and consumers diverge, but other claimants, specifically religious groups, can vigorously assert their rights to control the remixing and dissemination of intellectual and cultural property. Theoretically, the copyright issues raised by Paley and her work can be framed as part of a larger debate between social utilitarians, who promote the ideals of cultural sharing, and possessive individualists, whose agenda stresses private ownership of cultural property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0276146712446776">Giesler 2008</xref>). Neoliberal principles of private ownership, which are so basic to the conduct of conventional marketing systems, are harder to sustain when it comes to digital works. The Internet empowers free or communally owned culture by making possible its distribution through alternative marketing systems.</p>
