<p><italic>You have been given an assignment to capture the state of the art of curriculum, instruction, and assessment for the gifted in 40 min. As a result of last minute changes, you have only 3 days to prepare the talk. What do you do?</italic></p>
<p>The use of problem-based learning (PBL) to deal with real-world intractable problems works well in many professions, including educational administration, so I decided to try it out when preparing for my keynote speech this summer at the Asia Pacific Conference in Dubai. I find that the parameters of PBL are an excellent framework for working on a difficult problem. The Need to Know board, for example, allows you to sort the nature of data related to the problem, and the deadline imposed from outside drives you to focus energy to reach resolution that represents the best you can do in the time frame provided, not necessarily the ideal solution. The stakeholder role you assume is critical as well—You have a reputation to uphold as an academic researcher. The assignment is ambiguous—Should you focus more on one aspect of the problem or treat all aspects equally? Should you treat related issues such as professional development, school leadership, and the stance on grouping as central or peripheral to making curriculum work? Finally, there are many aspects of the problem you do not know, given your audience. What countries are represented, and what is the current status of their gifted programs? What do they see as the critical issues that are holding back progress? Although I have worked with several of these countries over the years—Australia, the United Arab Emirates (our host country), Brunei, Singapore, and Hong Kong—by no means would I feel competent to speak to the Asian picture in gifted education in any comprehensive way. Thus, the use of PBL as the organizing approach to the task seemed particularly appropriate.</p>
<p>When I considered <italic>what we know</italic> about curriculum, instruction, and assessment for the gifted, I consulted different research bases, some of which are obvious to students in the field and some perhaps not so obvious. I included studies that were seminal and recent, with a nod to works that have focused specifically on curriculum, instructional, and assessment efficacy. I also was selective in the studies included to be indicative of strong designs. The topics and researchers are listed below:</p>
<list id="list1-1076217512465289" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Research on effective curriculum interventions in language arts, science, and social studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1076217512465289">VanTassel-Baska &amp; Stambaugh, 2009</xref>) suggests that higher level thinking results can be obtained if a structured curriculum is used and implemented faithfully over at least 24 hr of instruction. Curriculum needs to be supplemented by constructivist approaches to instruction coupled with follow-up direct instruction. Assessment results have been obtained using performance-based and standardized approaches. Research on effective math interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076217512465289">Feng, VanTassel-Baska, Quek, O’Neil, &amp; Bai, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1076217512465289">Gavin et al., 2007</xref>) suggests that the use of math materials that emphasize real-world problem solving and use the strategies that support that approach enhances learning at the elementary levels in low income settings.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Research on the use of effective curriculum models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1076217512465289">VanTassel-Baska &amp; Brown, 2007</xref>) suggests that models that show results from careful research designs are superior to those that do not in respect to demonstration of gifted student learning.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Research on effective use of inquiry techniques, including PBL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1076217512465289">Gallagher &amp; Stepien, 1996</xref>), suggests that gifted students are just as effective in mastering underlying content, more effective at transferring problem-based approaches to new problem scenarios, and more motivated when exposed to these inquiry-based approaches.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Research on the use of alternative assessments for learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1076217512465289">VanTassel-Baska, 2008</xref>) suggests that gifted students can be assessed in ways that approximate their authentic learning level and extent through the use of performance-based assessment that is advanced, open-ended, focused on problem solving and thinking, and asks students to articulate thinking.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Acceleration research on fast-paced classes in content areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076217512465289">Lynch, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217512465289">Olszewski-Kubilius, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1076217512465289">Swiatek, 2000</xref>) has continued to show the efficacy of fast-paced curriculum and instruction, provided in intensive learning opportunities that occur in alternative educational settings such as summer and Saturday programs and online programs.</p></list-item>

<p>“The secrets to effective implementation of gifted programs lie in the collaborative use of resources that support the effort.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The second question of interest on a Need to Know Board is <italic>What do we need to know?</italic>. In surveying the field of gifted education curriculum, there are a few questions that are central to the next level of research studies. We have been effective in showing that high-level differentiated curriculum works with these students, that inquiry-based instructional techniques are successful, and that more authentic learning assessments at the classroom level can document the capabilities of these students in addition to the use of off-level assessment tools at the school level. We have been less successful at documenting how these processes actually work at the implementation stage. What is the dosage of differentiation required at each educational level and in each subject area to ensure sustained growth? Does it differ by domains and stages of development? Moreover, we have a limited appreciation for how the dynamics of schools affect the ongoing success of innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076217512465289">Swanson, 2012</xref>). Thus, we need to know much more about how to implement research-based practices, how to address intractable problems in the field, and how to institutionalize gifted programs and services.</p>
<p>Finally, the question of how we uncover the answers to these critical questions is the third aspect of the Need to Know Board. In my view, there are at least three sources of data that should be explored. One of them is the creation of demonstration sites that are working experimental contexts for innovation. Many people would claim that charter schools are examples of this type of solution, yet most charter schools are not doing gifted education as a part of their experiments. Lab schools attached to college campuses are also prime sites for such work but many of these programs have been eliminated, curtailed, or subdued in the use of gifted education practices. Consequently the model sites that have emerged have been schools that are specialized for this population such as Thomas Jefferson High School in Fairfax County, VA, or the Illinois Math and Science Academy in Aurora, Illinois. We need many more models that demonstrate differentiation well, using research-based approaches to do so. Closely linked to the use of model sites is the careful collection of student assessment data that suggests that real learning is occurring for gifted students. Moreover, cross-agency collaboration provides another structural advantage for many schools that work with science facilities, universities, and hold partnerships with other community agencies that enhance the learning enterprise for gifted students. The secrets to effective implementation of gifted programs lie in the collaborative use of resources that support the effort.</p>
<sec id="section1-1076217512465289">
<title>Problems and Their Resolutions</title>
<p>So what are the problems that need to be addressed at this stage in the history of gifted education curriculum? What are the most critical issues confronting our field at the classroom and school levels? The following set of eight problems and their suggested resolutions attempt to provide a portrait of our current dilemmas in schools.</p>
<sec id="section2-1076217512465289">
<title>Problem 1</title>
<p>How do we ensure that curriculum is <italic>differentiated</italic> for the gifted?</p>
<sec id="section3-1076217512465289">
<title>Problem resolution</title>
<p>The process of differentiation is the deliberate adaptation and modification of the curriculum, instructional processes, and assessments to respond to the needs of gifted learners. What are the processes that allow us to make these modifications? They include the following criteria for the design of differentiated curriculum: the use of acceleration and advanced materials, the use of complexity to focus on multiple higher level skills, concepts, and resources simultaneously, the use of depth to focus gifted learning in the form of projects and research, and the use of creativity to provide the skills and habits of mind that support innovation.</p>
<p>Differentiation may also be accomplished through the direct use of differentiated materials that have shown their effectiveness in working with the gifted. Moreover, the implementation of curriculum that is differentiated must be supported by the professional development of teachers who are responsible for working with gifted learners. Over multiple sessions, they can come to demonstrate effectiveness in the use of inquiry-based instructional strategies that support a differentiated curriculum base.</p>

<sec id="section4-1076217512465289">
<title>Problem 2</title>
<p>How do we ensure that <italic>instruction</italic> engages the learner in high-level thinking and problem solving?</p>
<p>Use of inquiry models such as thinking and problem solving, models of writing for persuasion and narrative, and models for conducting research are essential to effective instruction for the gifted as they scaffold higher levels of thinking through effective use. In addition, it is critical that we have a question-asking strategy that is easy to implement yet effective in exploiting different types of thinking within a question cluster set. The four-question strategy, based on Guilford’s Structure of the Intellect model, works very well in providing a framework for question formation and moving to higher level questions that should constitute 75% of those asked of gifted students. The application of the model follows, with a sample set of questions to use in discussing the current global economic crisis.</p>
<sec id="section5-1076217512465289">
<title>Memory/cognition</title>
<p>What is the world economic crisis? When did it begin? What countries were most affected?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1076217512465289">
<title>Convergent</title>
<p>Why did the crisis develop and spread?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1076217512465289">
<title>Divergent</title>
<p>What would have happened if the housing market had not been depressed?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1076217512465289">
<title>Evaluative</title>
<p>Which economic policy is the best solution to the problem—free market or tight controls on interest rates, or austerity measures or a combination of several approaches? Why?</p>
<p>The use of such questioning models guarantees that questions asked by teachers encourage actively different kinds of thinking by gifted learners and model how they may frame their own questions in the future.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1076217512465289">
<title>Problem 3</title>
<p>How do we <italic>assess</italic> gifted student learning effectively?</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important issue in assessing gifted student learning is to use measures that allow us to see the actual growth that has occurred across a period of time, typically a school year. Such growth model measures take into account where students begin (preassessment) and where they end the process of learning (post assessment) on a given dimension or domain of learning. The types of measurement tools that assist in this process include performance-based or curriculum assessments that target the use of higher level skills in content areas and portfolio approaches that document product growth over time. Out of level standardized assessments including critical thinking tests can be useful in demonstrating such growth as well. The worldwide talent searches have used such off-level tests to document advanced student learning in many subject areas. The assessments used in Advanced Placement programs and International Baccalaureate programs are useful models to use in constructing such tools as they have been calibrated to advanced study in selected subjects at the early university level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1076217512465289">
<title>Problem 4</title>
<p>How do we incorporate <italic>creative and innovative thinking</italic> within a traditional academic environment?</p>
<p>We know from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217512465289">Amabile’s (1983)</xref> research that creativity will be enhanced if we teach creativity-relevant skills. Thus, a strong curriculum for the gifted would want to include the following types of strategies in its arsenal and use them to train teachers effectively for classroom implementation of them. As with all strategies, however, they must be integrated into each content area in a way that teachers can see will promote growth within the domain as well. The most well-researched strategy in this area is creative problem solving that emphasizes the use of brainstorming as a tool to enhance ideational fluency, a divergent skill that can be taught and improved for most students. Metaphor development is another strategy that can be taught as a prelude to creating analogies, another imaginative tool to creative thinking, often used by scientists as a basis for describing their discoveries. A third model of import here is the use of synectics, a strategy for “force-fitting” connections and relationships. This approach also leads to making unusual connections that may result in metaphors and/or analogies. Finally, the six hat model, called lateral thinking, developed by DeBono (1980) provides an important tool to get students to take multiple perspectives on an issue and think and feel about it from different vantage points.</p>
<p>Developing original products as a result of applying these skills is the natural outgrowth of such creative thinking skill development. The assessment of whether students have increased their creative thinking lies in the nature and extent of product development they are capable of constructing in self-selected modalities and cross-disciplinary domains. The assessment of such products should focus on the manipulation of creative thinking skills as well as other dimensions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1076217512465289">
<title>Problem 5</title>
<p>How can we ensure <italic>affective development</italic> for the gifted? Affective development of the gifted is dependent on several dimensions of the classroom, not the least being a teacher who understands the affective issues and needs of gifted children. It is also facilitated through flexible grouping that allows for gifted students to be together for substantial periods of instructional time. That said, the more a curriculum can focus on meaning making, the more it will promote autonomous learning by the gifted, which in turn enhances motivation and curiosity to learn more. The more a curriculum can emphasize basic philosophical questions of identity such as who am I and where am I going, and basic axiological questions such as what do I believe and what are my values, the more we address the affective needs of gifted learners in their search for meaning and focus. We also would do well by them to develop specific metacognitive skills such as planning, monitoring, and assessing their own learning, a by-product often of student work on special projects. These metacognitive skills must also be strengthened by more emphasis on reflection on learning and on experiences that have shaped thinking and values.</p>
<p>Finally, affective development can be enhanced through an emphasis on leadership skills and strategies, especially in interpersonal dynamics. Gifted students need to be able to relate well to others and to understand how to be effective in moving their ideas forward if they wish to succeed in any field of endeavor in the real world of the professions. Developing emotional and social intelligence helps the gifted on their journey to excel in any domain.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1076217512465289">
<title>Problem 6</title>
<p>How do we <italic>motivate</italic> gifted learners?</p>
<p>Because gifted learners are entranced with intellectual ideas and unusual facts as well as a rage to know more about how the world works, their motivation is highly dependent on stimulation and novelty and the opportunity to collaborate with others on problems and issues of mutual interest. Interdisciplinary work is one way to stimulate interest and challenge in gifted learners to want to know more. Moreover, they benefit from the repeated use of high challenge, low-risk activities and task demands that afford higher level thinking as the norm. Such activities might include mathematical problems of antiquity, for which no solutions have been found or nonalgorithmic problems for which they have no solution models. Another example of challenge but of low-risk activities might be the use of proverbs or fables or adages as a basis for students to articulate meaning in much the same way they can distill meaning from conducting scientific experiments. An emphasis on important concepts like patterns, models, scale, and systems also provides an intellectual challenge as students strive to understand how these concepts apply to each domain of learning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1076217512465289">
<title>Problem 7</title>
<p>How do we ensure faithful <italic>implementation of best practices</italic> in gifted education at the school level?</p>
<p>For gifted curriculum to be implemented faithfully in classrooms and schools, there is a real need to facilitate teacher change in classroom practices. We have reason to believe, based on studies of classroom use of differentiation practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1076217512465289">VanTassel-Baska et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1076217512465289">VanTassel-Baska, Quek, &amp; Feng, 2007</xref>), that teachers are underutilizing higher level strategies like critical and creative thinking, problem solving, and research. Changes in teacher practices must be the first step in making sure that implementation occurs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1076217512465289">Guskey, 2000</xref>), followed by a monitoring process that keeps the dynamism of positive classroom change occurring. There also needs to be a network of colleagues and a principal who provides supportive leadership for the direction of the changes. Newer studies of implementation suggest that innovation is more likely to last if there are already systems in place to support the innovation. Moreover, teachers are more likely to continue an innovation when they see student engagement and excitement—regardless of actual achievement results. Finally, policies and leadership support are critical to enhancing or minimizing innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1076217512465289">Stambaugh, Bland, &amp; VanTassel-Baska, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1076217512465289">
<title>Problem 8</title>
<p>How do we <italic>align</italic> gifted practices with general education curriculum standards and assessments?</p>
<p>In an age of accountability across the educational spectrum, it is especially important for educators of the gifted to explain and articulate the connections between gifted curriculum and curriculum for all. In the United States, the new common core standards use 21st century skills as a major part of the standards for math and language arts. Yet, the translation of those standards need to be differentiated appropriately for students who begin the learning process at different levels of comprehension as do the assessments that demonstrate learning. This differentiation, however, must be delineated and described along several dimensions. We must document how activities and projects might be different for gifted learners, even as we are addressing the same standard such as analyzing argument in the language arts. We must be able to show how the trajectory of growth for gifted learners needs to be reflected at each stage of development from K-12. We must also be able to show what talent development looks like at each stage of development by subject areas so that schools can become more cognizant of evening out the talent development process to ensure greater retention into the professional pipelines that await. The National Science Foundation Report on Developing Talent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1076217512465289">2010</xref>), for example, has recommended much more emphasis on school-based elementary science programs for the gifted to augment what is available in the form of science competitions and fairs by middle school and beyond. Thus, scope and sequence work needs to be undertaken to illustrate how gifted students are being served in the current climate of standards and assessment and how that service is linked to the overall effort of reform.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The problems outlined in this article are the essential ones we continue to face as a field. We often make the mistake of thinking we have solved them because at one point in time, the resolutions suggested are working. However, schools are social–political environments that are in a constant state of flux with new leadership every few years, with new teachers every year, and with many external ideas competing for attention. In this cacophonous context, gifted education can easily be overlooked or devalued by contradictory positions or leaders who have agendas that emphasize other priorities. Yet, we know that the gifted student is always present in schools, waiting to be well served. Our obligation as educators committed to this population is to ensure that appropriate interventions happen.</p>
