<title>Journées de Méthodologie Statistique de l’Insee (English below)</title>
<p>Du <bold>24 au 26 janvier 2012</bold>, à <bold>Paris</bold> dans les locaux de la Cité internationale universitaire (17 boulevard Jourdan, 75014 Paris), la onzième édition des <bold>Journées de Méthodologie Statistique</bold> de l’Insee aura lieu. Les Journées, ouvertes sur des domaines d’intérêt larges, s’adressent à un public diversifié, tant à l’intérieur du système statistique public qu’à sa périphérie, y compris au monde de l’enseignement et de la recherche et au secteur privé, ainsi qu’à nos collègues de l’étranger. La participation est libre de frais d’inscription.</p>
<p>Ces Journées permettent de faire connaître des travaux novateurs et d’en assurer la diffusion mais ont aussi une ambition pédagogique : elles ont pour but que les auditeurs trouvent matière dans leurs propres travaux à mettre en œuvre les techniques exposées.</p>
<p>Les Journées concernent les diverses composantes de l’activité du système statistique public : enquêtes et opérations statistiques sur les ménages aussi bien que sur les entreprises (échantillonnage, correction de la non-réponse, redressement), démographie et travaux sur le recensement, méthodes statistiques pour le traitement des données (analyse des données, économétrie…), qualité des processus de collecte, techniques spécifiques aux données d’intérêt régional ou local, analyse des séries chronologiques …</p>
<p>Organisées depuis 1991 à l’initiative de Jean Claude Deville, les Journées de Méthodologie Statistique de l’Insee sont devenues un lieu d’échanges très apprécié. La dernière édition qui s‘est tenue les 23, 24 et 25 mars 2009 a enregistré près de 600 inscrits.</p>
<p>Le contact sera assuré, de préférence par courriel, auprès de Marc Christine (<email>marc.christine@insee.fr</email>), de Claudine Gasnier (<email>claudine.gasnier@insee.fr</email>), et <email>DG75-journees-de-methodologie-statistique@insee.fr</email> ou par courrier à Insee, Direction générale, timbre D001, 18 boulevard Adolphe Pinard, 75014 Paris, France.</p>

<title>Statistical Methodology Conference in 2012 (in English)</title>
<p>The eleventh edition of “Les Journées de Méthodologie Statistique” (JMS) organized by the National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) will be held from Tuesday 24 January to Thursday 26 January 2012. These Days will be held in the Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris, 17, boulevard Jourdan, 75014 Paris. This scientific conference, open to broad areas of interest, aimed at a diverse audience within the official statistical system as well as its periphery, including academia and research and the private sector, and international colleagues. Participation is free of registration fees.</p>
<p>Such a conference represents an opportunity to share innovative research. It also has a pedagogical aim insofar as the audience can find material in its own work to implement the techniques discussed.</p>
<p>The conference includes various components of official statistical system activity: household and business surveys (sampling, correction of non-response, imputation techniques…), demography and work on the census, statistical methods for data processing (data analysis, econometrics…), quality of collection processes, specific techniques applied to regional or local interests, time series analysis … The conference is in French but some contributions in English have been accepted.</p>
<p>The possible contacts, preferably by email, are Marc Christine (<email>marc.christine@insee.fr</email>), Claudine Gasnier (<email>claudine.gasnier@insee.fr</email>), or <email>DG75-journees-de-methodologie-statistique@insee.fr</email> and also at INSEE, Stamp D001, 18 Boulevard Adolphe Pinard, 75014 Paris, France.

<p>On <bold>7-9 June 2012</bold>, at the State University of New York at <bold>Stony Brook</bold>, New York, the Center for Study of Working Class Life is pleased to announce the <bold>How Class Works - 2012 Conference</bold>. For more information, visit our Web site at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.workingclass.sunysb.edu">http://www.workingclass.sunysb.edu</ext-link>. Purpose and orientation: The conference seeks to explore ways in which an explicit recognition of class helps to understand the social world in which we live, and ways in which analysis of society can deepen our understanding of class as a social relationship. Presentations take as their point of reference the lived experience of class; theoretical contributions will be rooted in and illuminate social realities. There will be presentations from people outside academic life that sum up social experience in a way that contributes to the themes of the conference. All presentations will be accessible to an interdisciplinary audience. Conference registration and housing reservations will be possible after 20 February 2012. Details and updates will be posted at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.workingclass.sunysb.edu">http://www.workingclass.sunysb.edu</ext-link>.

<title>Experimental Research in Sociology</title>
<p>Session Organizer: Klarita Gërxhani (<email>k.gerxhani@uva.nl</email>, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Laboratory and field experiments are common tools in social science research. Following a long tradition in psychology, experimental sub-disciplines have developed in economics, political science, cultural anthropology and sociology. The control offered by an experimental environment allows the researcher to isolate sociological phenomena and study their development and their effects. For example, both the dynamics of institutions and the effect of institutions on individual and group behavior can be and have been studied in laboratory experiments. Important sociological concepts such as trust, reciprocity, cooperation, solidarity, exploitation, and power have all been studied in experimental research. Yet, experimental research in sociology is still scarce and scattered. Much of this research is done in collaboration with researchers from other social sciences. Though such interdisciplinarity has important advantages, there is one drawback: there is a lack of careful methodological consideration of the role of experiments in sociological research. What are the advantages and limitations of this research for sociology? How do observations obtained in controlled experiments relate to other quantitative or qualitative research results? Such questions can be addressed by methodological research papers, but also by high quality experimental research that may serve as best case examples.</p>

<title>Sociological Hermeneutics - Methods and Methodology</title>
<p>Session Organizers: Silvana Figueroa-Dreher (<email>silvana.figuero@uni-konstanz.de</email>, Universität Konstanz, Germany) and Regine Herbrik (<email>regine.herbrik@tu-berlin.de</email>, Technische Universität Berlin, Germany). According to one of the founding fathers of sociology, Max Weber, the aim of sociological research is to interpretively understand social action and thereby explain its course and effects. Although actors in everyday life accomplish understanding anytime, scientific methods have to be employed, if understanding is to be achieved by social scientists in a traceable manner and in compliance with the rules of good scientific practice. In past decades, a multitude of qualitative methods have been implemented into the social sciences to fulfill this task. Among them, Social Hermeneutics has recently become increasingly important for the analysis of several types of data: interaction sequences, texts, gestures, pictures, video sequences, music or objects. It developed in the context of the sociology of knowledge and is, therefore, closely connected to the theoretical and methodological findings and thoughts of this scholarly tradition. As a result, employing Social Hermeneutics does not only involve the interpretive understanding of any kind of data, but also reflects on the characteristics of scientific understanding, the process of understanding in everyday life itself, and the relation between both. Although, the prominence of Social Hermeneutics went beyond German-speaking sociology years ago, the international scientific discourse on this methodological complex has just begun. This session aims therefore at locating and bringing together sociologists and social scientists of all nationalities employing Social Hermeneutics in empirical studies, or dealing with theoretical considerations on methodical or methodological questions in this field. Thereby, the specific methodological challenges of Social Hermeneutics shall be explored, and the benefits and drawbacks of its specific methods shall be discussed.</p>

<title>Videography and the Analysis of Visual Knowledge and Culture</title>
<p>Joint Session by RC33 (Research Committee on Logic and Methodology) and RC14 (Sociology of Communication, Knowledge and Culture). Session Organizers: Hubert Knoblauch (<email>hubert.knoblauch@tu-berlin.de</email>, Technical University Berlin, Germany), René Tuma (<email>rene.tuma@tu-berlin.de</email>, Technical University Berlin, Germany), and Christiana Constantopoulou (<email>christiana.constantopoulou@panteion.gr</email>, Panteion University, Greece). The last decades have witnessed a “visual revolution”. Visual technologies have become part of everyday life of more and more people who are not only “audiences”, but also producers. In particular, the availability and omnipresence of video recordings has transformed everyday culture and actors’ knowledge. At the same time, sociology and the social sciences around the globe are developing methods for the analysis of audio-visual data. On one hand, audio-visual data allows researchers to capture, store and analyse visible conduct in a variety of settings. Videographic studies have been undertaken, for example, in work spaces, education, museum studies and vernacular communication. The methods for studying visible conduct aim especially at reconstructing the communication processes in which actors render visible their visual knowledge. The analysis of video data will, therefore, be one of the foci of the session. On the other hand, video recordings generated by the actors also come into focus, be it recordings of private events like weddings and recordings of political events that are circulated via YouTube and Wikileaks, etc. The methodical approach to this other form of visual data will also be discussed. The aim of this session is to bring together researchers that either present methodological, methodical questions or exemplary empirical analyses related to video analysis, visual knowledge, culture and communication. Finally, other visual forms of knowledge, such as photography or diagrams, shall be addressed in this session.</p>

<sec id="section7-0759106311426982">
<title>Qualitative Research on Social Memory</title>
<p>Session Organizers: Alejandro Baer (<email>a.baer@uni-bayreuth.de</email>, Universidad Complutense Madrid, Spain) and Bernt Schnettler (<email>schnettler@uni-bayreuth.de</email>, Bayreuth University, Germany). Social or collective memory studies are a growing, broad and multidimensional field in the social sciences. Empirical research on social memory reaches from the exploration of the diverse public aspects of the process of remembering (as official representations of the past in monuments and commemorations) to the analysis of personal narratives and oral history projects, or the influence of different sorts of media in the shaping of historical consciousness. With the focus of attention on the methods that are employed in social memory research, we plan to have papers: 1. that explore the topic of commemoration ceremonies in different local, national and global contexts; 2. that investigate museums, memorials and other sites of memory, their different functions and meanings; 3. that address the intersection between personal narratives and public discourses on the past; 4. that explore the transnational dimensions of social memory practices; 5. that apply new methodologies – such as visual and ethnographic methods – for exploring the workings of social memory. Papers will be in English or in Spanish.</p>

<sec id="section8-0759106311426982">
<title>Ethnography in Sociology of Science and Technology</title>
<p>Session Organizers: Grit Petschick (<email>gritpetschick@googlemail.com</email>, Technical University Berlin, Germany) and Helena Pettersson (<email>helena.pettersson@kultmed.umu.se</email>, Umeå Universitet, Sweden). Ethnography is a methodological approach widely used in the sociology of science and technology. This session aims to explore specific methodological problems and strategies of using ethnography in this field. Papers for this session will therefore address one or more of the following questions: What are the advantages and disadvantages of using ethnography in sociology of science and technology in comparison to other methods? What alternatives do exist (case studies, interviews, surveys, public administrative data)? When and why should which method be preferred? What are the specific challenges of using ethnography in sociology of science and technology (in field access, data collection, data analysis), and how can they be solved? What is the relation between theory and data? How can theoretical concepts of sociology of science and technology be linked to ethnographic data? Which field-specific adaptations of ethnography do exist to solve these problems? What are the characteristics of these field-specific adaptations (“technography” - Werner Rammert, institutional ethnography - Dorothy E. Smith)? How do they differ from classical ethnography? Which of these adaptations should be preferred and why? What are the advantages and disadvantages of using ethnography analyzing categories of inequality in sociology of science and technology in comparison to other methods?</p>

<sec id="section9-0759106311426982">
<title>How to Measure Gender Norms in Cross-National Research</title>
<p>Session Organizer: Daniela Grunow (<email>d.grunow@uva.nl</email>, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Research consistently shows a widening gap over time between increasingly egalitarian attitudes towards gender norms and actual patterns of behaviour. According to this research, many men and women desire more equity in their division of earnings and care-giving than they manage to realize. Discrepancies between actual and desired life courses vary cross-nationally and entail important social consequences. Yet, little is known about why gender norms differ cross-nationally and how recent trends in attitudes are linked with other social transformations. In particular, the construction of these norms seems to be institutionally and culturally intertwined with men and women’s work, and parenting roles in the family. For decades, methods aiming at assessing gender norms and gender role attitudes have relied on the assumption that attitudes towards male and female roles are complementary – an assumption that can no longer be taken for granted. Questions of how adequate the available measures of gender norms are, and how to improve measurement for comparative research, therefore call for innovative solutions. Certain papers should cover recent developments and applications in social science research methodology on the measurement of gender norms, particularly measuring gender norms and gender attitudes in cross-national research.</p>

<sec id="section10-0759106311426982">
<title>Empirical Methods in Aging Research</title>
<p>Joint Session of RC33 (Research Committee on Logic and Methodology) and RC11 (Research Committee on Sociology of Aging). Session Organizers: Valentina Hlebec (<email>valentina.hlebec@fdv.uni-lj.si</email>, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia) and Kathrin Komp (<email>kathrin.komp@uleth.ca</email>, University of Lethbridge, Canada). Against the backdrop of aging populations, many researchers, practitioners, and lay persons ask what aging nowadays entails. They wonder what the characteristics of older people are, how social institutions such as states and families react to aging populations, and how older people themselves perceive aging and their role in society. Aging therefore is a flourishing research topic. However, scientists who conduct aging research face a series of challenges that are specific to their research topic. For example, how do you collect information among people who might be too frail to answer questions? Another example, how do you measure a concept that changed several times throughout the respondent’s life-course? This session will address those and related questions. The papers will address questions and challenges that arise when scholars plan and conduct empirical aging research. The topics covered include: Which sampling strategies are particularly helpful among frail or institutionalized populations? From what age on should people be included in studies on old age? What can we learn from cross-sectional and from longitudinal aging research? Do we need a specific wording when constructing questionnaires for older people? What kind of data is particularly helpful when studying old age and how can this data best be collected? How do researchers make sure that the voice of older people is noticed and included in research? What are challenges and solutions for mixed methods research designs when the older population is addressed? What are the challenges when using secondary quantitative cross-section data not especially designed for studying older population? What can empirical aging research in sociology learn from other scientific disciplines?</p>

<title>Analyzing Communities on the Internet</title>
<p>Session Organizer: Melanie Wenzel (<email>melanie.wenzel@uni-oldenburg.de</email>, Universität Oldenburg, Germany). During the last two decades, the Internet has increasingly been providing platforms that enable communication within communities such as families, religious communities, fan communities, brand communities, communities of practice and social movements to become partly or totally computer-mediated. This results in new methodological challenges, which the session aims to explore. The topics covered in this session include the following questions: what kind of research designs, methods, and techniques are suitable for the investigation of communities on the Internet? Can methods from other fields of research be transferred to this subject or does it need its own, field-specific methods? If this is true, which methods would this be? Are there, in contrast, field-specific methods that could be useful for other sociological research fields? Which sampling strategies are appropriate for this field of research? Specifically: Which parts of communities can by accessed via the Internet, which are excluded? What differences between different types of communities do exist? Which strategies of data collection and data analysis are suitable to the exploration of communities on the Internet? What kinds of data are appropriate to empirically capture the phenomenon, and what kind of information can be gained from these data?</p>

<title>Methodological Challenges and Alternatives to Census Taking in Small Island Developing States</title>
<p>Sessions Organizer: Godfrey St. Bernard (<email>gstbiser@gmail.com</email>, University of the West Indies, Trinidad and Tobago). For the purposes of this panel, census-taking refers specifically to the conduct of population and housing censuses. Despite their small land area and population size, small island developing states (SIDS) continue to experience formidable challenges that could negatively impact their census-taking operations. At the same time, some islands have embraced progressive thrusts and have embarked upon novel strategies deemed to be worthwhile lessons for others. The session aims to explore novel methods and techniques that have been embraced in SIDS to enhance the quality of census-related services, inputs and outputs. In essence, this session will treat issues that redound to enhancing the quality of census-related services and data, the latter being of critical importance, whether in the context of meta data, raw data or statistical facts. Whether in the context of the Caribbean, the South Pacific, the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean or elsewhere, SIDS have encountered numerous experiences with administrative, technical and dissemination functions that impact the quality and efficiency of census-taking outcomes. These experiences have been manifest in the form of challenges and remedial strategies proposed by official statisticians and academicians. Thus, the session strives to stimulate discussion and, where appropriate, debate emergent issues that redound around technological advancement and more sophisticated administrative and technical systems that render traditional systems less efficient. From geographic and socio-economic standpoints, SIDS are similar except for country-specific idiosyncrasies. Nonetheless, the session hopes to assemble contributions from prospective panelists covering all geographic regions that contain SIDS.</p>

<title>Organizations and Mixed Methods - Possibilities and Requirements of a Meso-Level Sociology</title>
<p>Session Organizers: Kathia Serrano (<email>kathia.serrano@soziologie.uni-heidelberg.de</email>, Universität Heidelberg, Germany), Cristina Besio (<email>cristina.besio@tu-berlin.de</email>, Technische Universität Berlin, Germany) and Robert Schmidt (<email>robert.schmidt@soz.tu-berlin.de</email>, Technische Universität Berlin, Germany). Organizations are a complex and hybrid social phenomenon at the meso-level. They are characterized by internal decision-making processes that are guided and constrained by formal structures such as memberships, procedures and roles, but also by discourses, routines and informal dynamics of power. Moreover, they are not isolated units, but rather embedded in wider social contexts and environments which influence them and which they shape in return. While there are some efforts to grasp this complexity in organizational theory by developing organizational models which also encompass the cultural and societal dimension of the organization (in neo-institutionalism, structuration theory or systems theory), the field of organization studies is dominated by empirical studies which focus on only individual or limited facets of the phenomenon. This is also due to the fact that different methodological approaches are seldom combined. Thus, quantitative surveys of a specific type of organization or of organizations in a specific environment are only loosely connected to the numerous “thick” qualitative descriptions of organizational structures and processes available in case studies concerning single or few organizations. Beyond triangulation, mixed-methods designs not only try to increase validity of the analysis, but integrate multiple perspectives to draw a more accurate picture of phenomenon in social life. In the case of organizations, we think that strengthening the links between different methods would contribute to a better informed understanding of the organization as a whole and of the variety of organizational forms. At the same time, the organization could be a privileged object of study for a thread of methodological research which tries to combine methodological approaches, in particular the formerly considered contrary qualitative and quantitative paradigms, into new forms of epistemologically grounded research designs. The session aims to explore possible combinations of methods in order to design multilevel analyses of modern organizations. Papers for this session will therefore address the following questions: What are the methodological requirements when characterizing organization as a complex meso-level phenomenon? Which data are appropriate and what kind of information can be gained from this data? How do types of data often used in sociology (surveys, interviews, documents, observation) have to be adjusted to analyses of organizations? What other types of data are useful in this context (literature, diaries, paintings, films, mechanical drawings, maps, landscapes, buildings), and what advantages do they have in comparison to more traditional data types? How can these methods be merged into balanced research designs? What are the possibilities and difficulties of using mixed-methods designs for research on organizations as a meso-level phenomenon? What are possible observational and methodological insights? How can we link theory and combined methods? Are there certain combinations of methods which are particularly appropriate in the context of a specific theory of the organization?</p>

<title>Qualitative Methods in the Sociology of Religion</title>
<p>Session Organizers: Eloísa Martín (<email>eloisamartin@hotmail.com</email>, University of Brasilia, Brazil), Bernt Schnettler (<email>schnettler@uni-bayreuth.de</email>, Bayreuth University, Germany) and Regine Herbrik (<email>regine.herbrik@tu-berlin.de</email>, Berlin Institute of Technology, Germany). Presently, the “return of religion” is intensely discussed among scholars. This includes the public face and the social forms of contemporary religion as well as its individual dimension. Over the past years, we are witnessing a growing number of empirical studies all over the world concerned with religious phenomena. However, most of these studies employ quite conventional methodology. Therefore, the session will focus on qualitative methods for studying religious phenomena. There will be papers concerned with methodological questions related to the specific problems of empirical research in the Study of Religions. This includes a discussion of appropriate and effective methods for researching religion and may encompass a critical discussion of methodological issues concerning qualitative inquiry in the field of religion; for example, can we transfer methods from other fields of research to the sociology of religion or do we need special, field-specific methods? What can we learn from methods used in neighbouring disciplines? Which sets of methods can be recommended for empirical analyses targeting micro-macro issues in understanding religion? What role does the gender issue play in this? We are especially interested in papers reporting empirical research findings in the sociology of religion using qualitative research methods in combination with methodological reflections. The topics include: religious experience; spirituality; the transformation of contemporary religion; religion in the public sphere and the impact of religion on private life; religion and emotion; religion, migration and ethnicity; social memory and religious identities; the changing role of religious organization; religion, communication, and media; dynamics and transformation of beliefs.</p>

<title>Methods for the Sociological Analysis of Affect and Emotion</title>
<p>Session Organizers: Christian von Scheve (<email>christian.von.scheve@fu-berlin.de</email>, Free University Berlin, Germany) and Regine Herbrik (<email>regine.herbrik@tu-berlin.de</email>, Berlin Institute of Technology, Germany). Since the 1970s, the sociology of emotion has developed into a vibrant and continuously growing field of research and a large number of theoretical treatises and reviews on this topic have been published. The sociology of emotions has been institutionalized in various national and international associations and its findings have begun to diffuse into mainstream social theorizing. However, the increasing importance of the subject has not yet lead to a clearly visible empirical research agenda and empirical studies in the sociology of emotion are in fact still rare. One reason for this might be the absence of a precise methodological canon. Certainly, the way we approach affect and emotion depends on our theoretical background and on our particular topics of interest. Thus, empirical studies in the sociology of emotion employ a wide range of different methods, from standardized paper-and-pencil tests and surveys with large sample sizes to qualitative approaches relying on self-report data, experimental designs, ethnographic materials, or cultural artefacts such as the arts and mass media. However, reflections on specific methodological requirements in sociological emotion research or methodological innovations are almost non-existent. This session therefore aims at exploring the specific methodological requirements of sociological emotion research and at discussing the benefits and drawbacks of specific methods. Can we transfer methods from other fields of research to the sociology of emotion or do we need special, field-specific methods? What can we learn from methods used in neighbouring disciplines? Which sets of methods can be recommended for empirical analyses targeting micro-macro issues in understanding emotion? Papers for this session will therefore address the following questions: Which data are appropriate for the sociology of emotion, and what kind of information can be gained from these data? How can different types of data often used in sociology (surveys, interviews, observation) be combined to get a glimpse of the “bigger picture” (combining surveys with experimental designs)? How do we have to adjust different types of data to field-specific requirements? What other types of data are useful for emotion research (documents, literature, diaries, paintings, films, drawings, maps, architecture, etc.), and what advantages do these data have in comparison to more traditional data types? Which strategies of data analysis are appropriate to the field?</p>
<p>On <bold>31</bold>
<bold>October-3 November 2012</bold>, in <bold>New Orleans</bold> at the Convention Center, the International Conference on Methods for Surveying and Enumerating <bold>Hard-to-Reach Populations</bold> (H2R) will take place. The H2R 2012 conference will bring together survey methodologists, sociologists, statisticians, demographers, ethnographers, and other professionals from around the world to present new and innovative techniques for surveying hard-to-reach populations. Addressing both the statistical and survey design aspects of including hard-to-reach groups, researchers will report findings from censuses, surveys, and other research related to the identification, definition, measurement, and methodologies for surveying and enumerating under-counted populations. Topics to be covered include: Identifying, Defining, and Measuring the Hard-to-Reach; Measuring Under-counts for H2R Groups; H2R Techniques and Methodologies; Use of Social Marketing and Outreach Campaigns; Overcoming Language and Literacy Barriers; Innovative and Emerging Methodologies for the H2R; Homeless and Refugee Populations; Populations Affected by Natural Disasters; Populations in Zones of Armed Conflict; Stigmatized Populations; Cross-cultural Similarities and Differences in H2R Populations.
