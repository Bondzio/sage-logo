<abstract>
<p>In October 2000, a coal impoundment structure emptied more than 300 million gallons of toxic coal waste into the streams of Martin County, Kentucky. This study compares surveys conducted in the months following the disaster with surveys administered 10 years later to determine the long-term impacts of the disaster on trust in government, corporations, and experts. We find that the social trust levels in Martin County partially recovered in the 10 years since the impoundment rupture. This suggests that technological disasters, including those that result in toxic contamination, do not always permanently damage the social fabric of the communities that experience them. However, some factors suggest that Martin County’s recovery in trust may be unwarranted, which, in turn, raises concerns about this community’s susceptibility to environmental hazards and possible future disasters.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past decade, there has been increasing interest in the social causes and consequences of disasters. Media coverage of disasters such as Hurricane Katrina (2005) and the Gulf Coast Oil Spill (2010), combined with extreme weather events exacerbated by global climate change, have served to keep the threat of disaster on our minds. With the exception of the Exxon <italic>Valdez</italic> disaster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1086026612467983">Picou, Marshall, &amp; Gill, 2004</xref>) and Hurricane Katrina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1086026612467983">Miller, 2007</xref>), research on disaster impacts typically focuses on their immediate aftermath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1086026612467983">Nigg &amp; Tierney, 1993</xref>), with a particular emphasis on emergency response, clean-up, litigation, and psychological impacts on disaster survivors. Very few have focused on the long-term social impacts of disasters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1086026612467983">Nigg &amp; Tierney, 1993</xref>). This study addresses one aspect of this gap in the literature by examining the long-term impacts of a coal waste disaster on social trust in Martin County, Kentucky.</p>
<p>The Martin County disaster occurred just after midnight on October 11, 2000, when a 72-acre coal waste impoundment ruptured, spilling more than 300 million gallons of coal waste—including water, diesel fuel, heavy metals, and other contaminants—into Coldwater and Wolf Creeks. On awaking the next morning, area residents were surprised to find their yards, creeks, and, in some cases, floors and basements covered with a black lava-like substance. They had received no warning or evacuation orders during the night. The spill killed all aquatic life, vegetation, and animals that used the creek for water, including deer, livestock, and pets. It also disrupted public water supplies in Martin County and other communities along the Tug River. At the time, the Martin County coal waste spill was the largest environmental disaster in the southeastern United States, dwarfing the Exxon <italic>Valdez</italic> disaster spill of 11 million gallons of oil. Fortunately, no human life was lost in the Martin County disaster.</p>
<p>Through comparing the results of two surveys we conducted in Martin County 10 years apart, our study seeks to determine if this coal waste disaster had long-term impacts on social trust, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1086026612467983">Francis Fukuyama (1995)</xref> defines as “the expectation that arises within a community of regular, honest, and cooperative behavior, based on commonly shared norms, on the part of other members of that community” (p. 26). In particular, we seek to understand whether community members’ trust in regulatory agencies, the government, coal companies, and “experts” recovered in the 10 years after the coal waste disaster.</p>

<title>Central Appalachia and Social Capital</title>
<p>Coal production and consumption have been documented to have negative impacts on human and environmental health in Central Appalachia. These include high rates of occupational deaths and illnesses, underground mine subsidence, contamination of water in streams and wells, air pollution, acid rain, flash flooding, mudslides, coal waste impoundment breaches, and explosions that jar neighboring houses from their foundations and sometimes shower homes with “fly rock.” In 2004, one such incident sent a boulder from a mountaintop removal mine crashing into the bedroom of 3-year-old Jeremy Davidson, killing him in his sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1086026612467983">Thornton, 2006</xref>). Among the major coal mining–related workplace and environmental disasters in the areas near to Martin County are the 1968 Farmington, West Virginia, mine disaster (78 killed); the 1976 Scotia mine disaster in Kentucky (26 killed); the 2006 West Virginia Sago mine explosion (12 killed); the 2010 West Virginia Upper Big Branch mine disaster (29 killed); and the 1972 Buffalo Creek coal waste dam collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1086026612467983">West Virginia Division of Culture and History, 2012</xref>), which killed 125 people.</p>
<p>The Buffalo Creek disaster is particularly relevant to this study. Occurring in a neighboring county in West Virginia, the Buffalo Creek Disaster was another instance of a coal waste spill. On the morning of February 26, 1972, a dam holding back approximately 132 million gallons of coal waste collapsed, destroying 16 settlements, killing 125 residents, and leaving more than 1,000 injured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1086026612467983">Bethel &amp; McAteer, 1978</xref>). This event inspired <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1086026612467983">Erikson’s (1976)</xref> award-winning book, <italic>Everything in its Path</italic>, which argued that the posttraumatic stress felt by victims of the disaster was exacerbated by the loss of community experienced by survivors when they were relocated by federal authorities in the aftermath of this disaster. Isolated from former social networks in settlements characterized by low levels of social trust, Erikson argued that survivors experienced a second trauma caused by loss of community ties.</p>
<p>Written at a time when essentialist conceptualizations of Appalachian culture were common, Erikson assumed that Appalachia had a unique culture developed in response to harsh mountain terrain and geographic isolation. The culture he depicts was characterized by individualism, traditionalism, familism, feuding, high levels of social distrust and suspicion, religious fundamentalism, intolerance, violence, and fatalism (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1086026612467983">Caudill, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1086026612467983">Weller, 1965</xref>, and for a rebuttal, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1086026612467983">Lewis, 1974</xref>). Erikson posited a contradictory “mountain ethos” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1086026612467983">Erikson, 1976</xref>) that produced a vulnerable, anxious, and dependent people “capable of an almost heroic form of acquiescence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1086026612467983">Erikson, 1976</xref>, p. 92).</p>
<p>The characterization of Appalachian coalfield residents as generally anxious, passive, and dependent has been criticized on methodological grounds; Erikson inappropriately made conclusions about a region’s culture based on the legal depositions and interviews of disaster survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1086026612467983">Billings &amp; Maggard, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1086026612467983">Ewen &amp; Lewis, 1999</xref>). We would argue that the observations Erikson made were, in fact, caused by low levels of social capital in the aftermath of the disaster. Social capital, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1086026612467983">Putnam (1995)</xref> defines as “the features of social organization, such as networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit” (p. 67), was destroyed in Buffalo Creek when much of the once tightly-knit community was forced to disperse to disaster-relief housing and the homes of relatives in other communities. The resulting low social capital prevented Buffalo Creek residents from acting collectively and also delayed community recovery.</p>
<p>By 1994, Erikson’s thinking had evolved. In <italic>A New Species of Trouble</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1086026612467983">1994</xref>), he reflected on Buffalo Creek, this time citing the actions of the coal corporation as being the cause of the victims’ response:
<disp-quote>
<p>It can be profoundly painful when the people in charge of a company at the time of a severe mishap deny responsibility. . . . This is not the way of neighbors. . . . It is the way of hostile strangers. . . . The mortar holding human communities together is made up at least in part of trust and respect and decency. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1086026612467983">Erikson, 1994</xref>,pp. 238-239)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Erikson is not the only one to have observed that the “mortar” has been crumbling in Central Appalachian coal towns over the past 40 years. In an examination of social capital in U.S. counties, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1086026612467983">Rupasingha, Goetz, and Freshwater (2006)</xref> found that social capital was lower along the Eastern Kentucky/West Virginia border and in the South and Southwest than in the Upper Midwest and Northwest regions of the United States. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1086026612467983">Putnam (2000)</xref> ranked Kentucky the 10th lowest U.S. state for social capital, whereas neighboring West Virginia, which borders Martin County, was ranked the 8th lowest in social capital. Similarly, in a comparison of three counties in Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, and New England, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1086026612467983">Duncan (1999)</xref> concluded that the low social capital in Appalachia and the Delta accounted for persistent poverty in those regions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a comparison of social capital in poultry-producing and coal-mining towns in West Virginia found that the coal mining town, “Coalville,” had lower stocks of social capital than the poultry-producing town, even though both had economies dominated by a single industry and were demographically similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1086026612467983">Bell, 2009</xref>). Bell traced this disparity to two factors. The first was the large out-migration the coal-mining town experienced due to job losses from mine mechanization. This depopulation disrupted social networks and community bonds in this coal town and others like it. Equally important was the second factor, which resulted from a loss in social trust. The nonunion coal company Massey Energy bought out a union mine near Coalville in the 1980s. The conflict between union and nonunion residents resulted in long-lasting rifts in the community. In addition, the failure of the union residents to prevail left the community without a sense of identity. Citing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1086026612467983">Bluestone and Harrison (1982)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1086026612467983">Bell (2009)</xref> concluded that Coalville suffers from “community anomie,” which caused residents to distrust one another and withdraw from collective life. Thus, it was all the more difficult for citizens to organize to solve collective problems or resist domination.</p>
<p>These studies together suggest that many Central Appalachian communities experience low levels of social capital. Numerous scholars have pointed to the importance of social capital to the ability of communities and groups to act collectively to address social problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1086026612467983">Bell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1086026612467983">Paxton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1086026612467983">Putnam, 1995</xref>). Thus, in the aftermath of a technological disaster in Central Appalachia like the Buffalo Creek Disaster of 1972 or the Martin County disaster of 2000, it may be especially difficult for residents to hold the companies, regulatory agencies, and government officials accountable for the disaster and to pressure these entities into ensuring such a disaster does not occur again.</p>
<p>Technological disasters differ from “natural” disasters, such as tornadoes, because they represent a loss of control over processes perceived to be controllable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1086026612467983">Baum &amp; Fleming 1993</xref>). Perceived loss of control leads the public to lose trust in regulatory agencies, government, and officials because citizens regard such disasters as emanating from the failure of these actors and agencies to do the job entrusted to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1086026612467983">Freudenburg, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1086026612467983">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1086026612467983">Freudenburg &amp; Pastor, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1086026612467983">McSpirit, Scott, Hardesty, &amp; Welch, 2005</xref>). Damage to social trust is further exacerbated when a disaster results in toxic contamination because this creates long-term uncertainty.</p> <p>Unfortunately for residents of the Central Appalachian coalfields, officials have often prioritized economic activity over public and environmental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1086026612467983">Bell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1086026612467983">Burns, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1086026612467983">Couto, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1086026612467983">Duncan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1086026612467983">Fisher, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1086026612467983">Gaventa, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1086026612467983">Hinsdale, Lewis, &amp; Waller, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1086026612467983">Freudenburg (1993)</xref> coined the term <italic>recreancy</italic> to refer to such untrustworthy government action. Recreancy refers to situations in which “persons and/or institutions that hold positions of trust, agency, responsibility or fiduciary or other forms of broadly expected obligations to the collectivity . . . behave in a manner that fails to fulfill the obligation or merit the trust” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1086026612467983">Freudenburg, 1993</xref>, pp. 916-917; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1086026612467983">Brennan &amp; Flint, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1086026612467983">McSpirit, Scott, Gill, Hardesty, &amp; Sims, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1086026612467983">Miller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1086026612467983">Ritchie &amp; Gill, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1086026612467983">Tootle, 2007</xref>). Given the history of low social capital and recreancy in Central Appalachia, along with the occurrence of a technological disaster, we would expect to see long-term impacts on the social trust of Martin County residents.</p>

<title>Study Site: Martin County, Kentucky</title>
<p>Situated in Eastern Kentucky near the West Virginia border, Martin County’s economy is largely dominated by coal. Coal mining is the source of 44.8% of personal earnings in Martin County. This statistic earned Martin a designation as a “core coal county” by the Kentucky Appalachian Commission. This agency has also categorized Martin as a “distressed” county with “demonstrated persistent, long-term problems that have resulted in extraordinary levels of economic and human distress” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1086026612467983">Kentucky Appalachian Commission, 2000</xref>, p. c-4). In 2000, 37% of county residents fell below the federal poverty line; the poverty rate remained about the same in 2010 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1086026612467983">Table 1</xref>). Since 1980, new mining technologies, such as long wall mining and a radical form of strip mining called mountaintop removal, have reduced the demand for labor dramatically, further exacerbating poverty, unemployment, and migration from the coal producing regions of Appalachia (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1086026612467983">Table 1</xref>). This poses a threat to social capital in the region.</p>

<p>In 1998, Martin County produced 12% of the state’s total output of low-sulfur, bituminous coal. At the time of the disaster in 2000, Martin County was the second largest producer of coal in Kentucky. The largest coal producer in the county was the owner of the breached impoundment, Martin County Coal Company. Martin County Coal was a subsidiary of Massey Energy,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1086026612467983">1</xref></sup> a corporation that was established in 1920 and headquartered in Richmond, Virginia. By 2000, Massey was not just the largest producer in Martin County; it was the largest coal producer in Central Appalachia. The company had also gained a reputation for its poor environmental and health safety record as well as its strong antiunion position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1086026612467983">Bell, 2009</xref>). Martin County has many features associated with high social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1086026612467983">Putnam, 2000</xref>): it is rural; racially and ethnically homogenous; structured by dense, overlapping kinship ties; and has relatively low female labor force participation rates. Counterbalancing these social capital–producing factors, however, are high poverty rates, low (but rising) educational attainment rates, high levels of unemployment, low levels of religious affiliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1086026612467983">Jones et al., 2002</xref>), and high economic dependence on coal mining. Martin County is also located in a highly stratified region within a stratified nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1086026612467983">Couto, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1086026612467983">Ludke, Obermiller, &amp; Radamacher, in press</xref>). High levels of stratification impede the construction of social capital, especially between social classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1086026612467983">Putnam, 2000</xref>). Finally, Martin County does not have a prounion, class history and identity to provide the community with organizational capacity and a tradition of social action, as many other Central Appalachian mining communities do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1086026612467983">Fisher, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1086026612467983">Putnam, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Overview of Relevant Postdisaster Events (2000-2010)</title>
<p>Shortly after the disaster in 2000, George W. Bush was elected to the Presidency of the United States. Under Bush, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set up headquarters on the coal company’s property, allowed the company to draft its press releases, and relied on the polluter to collect water samples for testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1086026612467983">Scott, McSpirit, Hardesty, &amp; Welch, 2005</xref>). By the summer of 2001, it was discovered that the coal waste impoundments had leaked in 1994—6 years before the disaster—and that the Mine Safety and Health Administration had not enforced regulations or properly inspected the impoundment. In a 2001 negotiated settlement, the EPA ceded its authority to oversee environmental clean-up and recovery to the corporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1086026612467983">McSpirit et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>At the state level, a legal opinion commissioned by the state Environmental Quality Commission forced the Kentucky General Assembly to release funds from Natural Resource Damage settlement for citizen-led water testing in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1086026612467983">McSpirit et al., 2007</xref>). By this time, an administrative change in local government had resulted in new water plant management. Public water treatment facilities were improved under the new management. A research team composed of citizens and university researchers found the local water supply to be safe for human consumption. However, the new water board never responded to public opinion in favor of the creation of a citizens’ advisory board to monitor drinking water and operations at the physical plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1086026612467983">Scott, in press</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, a 5-year effort to persuade the Kentucky state legislature to mandate coal waste disaster planning (2003-2008) failed in five legislative sessions. Kentucky still has no plan to provide emergency warning for citizens living downstream from coal waste impoundments in spite of the fact that the state is home to approximately 70 coal waste impoundments, 23 (30%) of which are classified as high hazard and pose a significant threat to populations living downstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1086026612467983">Coal Impoundment Project, Location and Information System, n.d</xref>.). West Virginia, in contrast, mandated coal waste disaster planning 40 years ago in response to the Buffalo Creek disaster of 1972.</p>
<p>The 2008 U.S. Presidential election resulted in a change in the EPA and other federal regulatory agencies. Under the Obama administration, the agency acted more diligently to regulate surface mining and mountaintop removal in the region with special attention to monitoring water pollution. As a result, the Kentucky coal industry accused the EPA of being hostile to the industry, thereby threatening jobs and the economic viability of the region. It also escalated its decade-long media campaign to promote coal as a clean energy source that is crucial to our nation’s energy independence. In addition, the industry organized an “astroturf” movement called <italic>Friends of Coal</italic>, through which the public is encouraged to express its political support of the industry. Friends of Coal has joined the Kentucky Coal Operators Association in a multimedia advertising campaign to defend the industry; they also provide educational materials explaining the benefits of coal to K-12 teachers, sport bumper stickers and specialty license plates on their vehicles, and sponsor football and basketball games between in-state rivals, the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1086026612467983">Bell &amp; York, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2010, the Governor of Kentucky, Stephen Beshear, directed the state’s Energy and Environment Cabinet to join the Kentucky Coal Operators Association to sue the EPA for its “arbitrary and unreasonable decisions” to deny mining permits and has agreed with the coal corporations that such actions threaten the coal industry and will reduce jobs in the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1086026612467983">Hjalmarson, 2010</xref>). In opposition, regional environmental groups have encouraged the EPA to take over mine permitting, arguing that the state is failing in its duty to protect environmental and public health in coal mining areas.</p>
<p>In our previous analysis of data collected in 2001, we concluded the government acted in a recreant manner in the lead-up and aftermath to the Martin County coal waste disaster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1086026612467983">McSpirit et al., 2005</xref>). When faced with weak government regulation of coal waste facilities and an inadequate response to the disaster in 2000, we found that the residents we surveyed and interviewed expressed a desire to live elsewhere and a distrust of government regulatory agencies and political leaders, generally. Interviews of nine key community leaders conducted in the spring of 2009, in contrast, showed disagreement about whether the community had regained its trust in local government and regulatory institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1086026612467983">Scott, in press</xref>). Local government officials and the local newspaper editor claimed that the community had regained trust in government while local environmental activists and residents directly affected by the disaster maintained that it had not. The current study sheds further light on the question of whether this disaster had a long-term impact on environmental concern and social trust of these agencies in Martin County.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-1086026612467983">
<title>Survey and Sampling Design</title>
<p>Shortly after the coal waste disaster occurred in October 2000, our research team visited Martin County and began to develop interview and survey instruments. We conducted observations starting in November 2000 and semistructured interviews with 34 Martin County residents in January and February 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1086026612467983">Scott et al., 2005</xref>). We also worked with the community on impact assessments, water testing, and advocacy for impoundment breach emergency planning through 2005. Our survey instrument drew on interviewee concerns and incorporated questions from disaster impact and risk assessment surveys used by other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1086026612467983">Freudenburg, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1086026612467983">Picou &amp; Gill, 1995a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1086026612467983">1995b</xref>). It was pretested in undergraduate sociology classes and revised before use in Martin County.</p>
<p>There were two waves of survey data collection. During the first wave, which was conducted in March 2001, surveys were distributed to every sixth home on roads in the disaster-affected sections of Martin County, including Cold Water and Wolf Creeks, as well as section of the county seat of Inez. To maximize participation, surveys were hand-delivered in a standard door-to-door, drop-off and pickup method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1086026612467983">Steele et al., 2001</xref>). The first wave of surveys was administered by four teams of Eastern Kentucky University undergraduate students and professors. Of the 467 surveys distributed in 2001, 290 surveys were completed, resulting in a response rate of 62%.</p>
<p>In June 2011, an updated and revised survey was distributed by three teams of University of Kentucky graduate students to the same affected areas of Martin County, using the same delivery and retrieval methods and the same sampling interval. The survey was updated to reflect the passage of time and to make the survey briefer. This time, a $5.00 payment was offered to each household in order to encourage participation at a time when the disaster had faded from public consciousness. Of the 410 surveys delivered in 2011, a total of 184 surveys were completed, representing a response rate of 45%. Though the response rate was lower in the second survey sweep, it was nevertheless acceptable.</p>
<p>The original institutional review board approval for this research required us to destroy records revealing the identities of those surveyed in 2001 in order to protect respondent anonymity. Therefore, it was impossible for us to survey the same people in 2011. However, because our conclusions are directed at the community level, as opposed to the individual level, the desirability of surveying the same people is questionable. We believe both surveys (2001 and 2011) to be reasonably representative of the communities directly affect by the spill at both times, which is the most important concern for our analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1086026612467983">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>To determine the connection between social trust and environmental concerns, questions on coal waste and drinking water were examined. Both questions were measured on a four-item scale.</p>
<p>General perceptions of place and community were measured through the following question items. First, ‘Do you expect to live here for the rest of your life?” Respondents could report either “yes” or “no.” The expectation to leave the community could be a precursor to actual outmigration, so it may disrupt community bonds and contribute to the further dissolution of social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1086026612467983">Bell, 2009</xref>). Second, community attachment was measured through the following question: “If you could live any place in the United States you wanted to, would you choose the area where you are living now?” Persons could respond on a 4-point Likert-type scale. It is expected that poor community attachment leads to weak community ties and the further erosion of social capital. These two questions are abbreviated as “Expect to stay” and “Desire to stay” in the Results section.</p>
<p>Possible sociodemographic factors related to social trust and community attachment include gender, age, education (less than high school, high school, some college, college degree), income (less than $10,000, $10,000-20,000, $21,000-40,000, $41,000-60,000, and more than $60,000), and home ownership (yes/no). Economic dependence on the coal industry served as another measure of community attachment through the following question: “Is any person in your household involved in the mining industry—either through being employed, the sale of mineral rights, or through other business-related activities?” This question was generally worded to protect the anonymity of coal industry employees in the event that our 2001 data were subpoenaed in disaster-related litigation. (Our data were, in fact, subpoenaed in April 2005.) Employment status was also used as a measure of community attachment (employed full time/employed part time/self-employed/housewife/unemployed/disabled/retired).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1086026612467983">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>As with almost all survey data, respondents left some questions blank. Although our surveys were reasonably complete, the percentage of missing data for the variables we report here ranged from less than 1% (concerns with drinking water) to 14% (income). To avoid selection bias that might be introduced by removing subjects with partially incomplete responses, we imputed missing responses using the median value for that question among the nonmissing responses. Although this potentially introduces bias, it is a conservative sort of bias (bias toward the null hypothesis) and less of a concern here than selection bias. For <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1086026612467983">Table 2</xref>, where imputation might make the 2001 and 2011 samples appear more similar than they actually are, the raw data were used, with missing values excluded; all other analyses use the imputed data.</p>

<p>The dependent variable in this analysis is an index that measures social trust through four general survey questions: The first one measures general trust in science and experts, “With so many experts telling us what is safe and what is not, it is hard to know what to believe.” The second measures trust in community, neighbors, and local corporations/businesses: “I feel these days a person doesn’t really know who they can count on.” The third question measures general trust in government and governmental agencies, “There’s no use in contacting public officials because they aren’t interested in the average person.” The fourth question more specifically measured trust in local government: “I have trust in the local government.” All four questions were recorded on a Likert-type scale and scaled so that 5 represented the <italic>maximum amount of trust</italic> and 1 the <italic>minimum amount</italic>. These four items were summed to create a <italic>social trust index</italic> with a range from 5 to 20. Higher scores represented higher levels of trust in other individuals and social institutions. In general, the scale had a mean of 7.9 and a standard deviation of 3.1.</p>
<p>In addition, we carried out a principal components analysis of these four variables. The first principal component explained 52% of the overall variability, with no other component explaining more than 20%. This lends credibility to our approach of summarizing these four “trust” variables using a single index. We considered using the principal component itself as an index. Its correlation with the index described above, however, is &gt;0.99, so we chose the summed scores as our index for the sake of simplicity.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>Our previous analysis of the Martin County coal waste disaster demonstrated how regulatory failures by the Mine Safety Health Administration led to the reservoir breach in 2000 and then how postdisaster collaboration between the EPA and the coal corporation led to widespread public distrust in federal mining and environmental agencies in the year following the disaster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1086026612467983">McSpirit et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1086026612467983">McSpirt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1086026612467983">Scott et al., 2005</xref>). Interviews of nine key community leaders conducted in the spring of 2009 revealed disagreement about whether the community had regained trust in local government or regulatory institutions, depending on the social position and experience of the interviewee. Interviewees who were directly affected by the disaster believed that social trust had not recovered in Martin County. Based on those interviewees and the previous research about technological disasters cited above, we expected to find long-term effects on social trust in Martin County. Specifically, we anticipated that the 2011 survey responses would be similar to those in 2001 with regard to trust in government, corporations and “experts.”</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1086026612467983">Table 2</xref> reports demographic and socioeconomic characteristics for survey respondents in the first (2001) and second waves (2011) of survey distribution. There were no significant differences between the two samples in terms of sex, home ownership, connection with the mining industry, or income. Demographically, the 2011 sample was somewhat older (5 years older on average) and better educated, mirroring broader educational trends in the county (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1086026612467983">U.S. Census Bureau, 2010</xref>). The 2011 sample was also more likely to be retired, presumably reflecting the changes in age already noted. Among nonretired respondents, employment patterns were fairly similar.</p>
<p>Differences in community attachment, perceived environmental risk, and trust in institutions between 2001 and 2011 are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1086026612467983">Figure 1</xref>. Our survey produced mixed findings with regard to community flight. In 2011, persons in Martin County were significantly more likely to express a desire to stay in their community than Martin County residents 10 years earlier. On the other hand, whether residents expected to live the majority of the rest of their lives in Martin County changed little between 2001 and 2011. It is not surprising that postdisaster disruption and uncertainty made people want to leave the area in 2001. Nor is it surprising that the desire to move declined in the subsequent decade. Once remediation was complete, independent water testing found the water was safe, and compensation from the company was dispensed, the desire to leave abated. With regard to the stability in expectations about remaining in Martin County, there are a variety of reasons why people might not realistically expect to move from the area. In a poor, rural community like Martin County, it might be difficult to sell one’s house, generally, and even more so after the 2001 disaster and the 2008 financial crisis and housing market declines. In addition, the expense of moving could be prohibitive and job opportunities may have declined in an era of economic crisis and high unemployment. Finally, family obligations may bind residents to their homes, especially those who have children in school or older family members who need care.</p>
<p>Environmental concerns, however, were clearly less acute in 2011 than in 2001, with a significantly smaller percentage of the population concerned about coal waste and drinking water in 2011. This demonstrates that environmental concerns had diminished in the 10 years following the disaster.</p>
<p>Toxic contamination can also lead to widespread distrust in institutions and agencies whose responsibility is to protect the public from such events, as confirmed in the bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1086026612467983">Figure 1</xref>. In comparison to 10 years after the disaster, Martin Countians reported significantly higher levels of distrust in coal companies, local government, and federal mining agencies in 2001. This again indicates that the community recovered at least some trust in corporations and the government in the decade following the disaster. Interestingly, however, there was little change in attitudes toward the EPA across this time period. This could be because EPA actions, unlike those of the corporation and the federal mining agencies, did not lead to the disaster’s occurrence. In addition, the timing of the initial survey sweep may account for this finding. Although the EPA did act in a recreant manner in the aftermath of the spill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1086026612467983">McSpirit et al., 2005</xref>), these actions came to public attention only after the initial survey was administered. Therefore, the 2001 survey showed relatively little distrust in the EPA when compared with institutions whose recreant behavior had become apparent before the first survey was administered.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1086026612467983">Figure 2</xref> provides a breakdown of how residents responded to each of the three-question items and the aggregate changes measured by the four-question social trust index. For each question, answers reflected higher social trust in 2011 than in 2001, although the difference was not always significant. The four-question index of social trust, however, was significantly higher in 2011 than in 2001, suggesting that social trust had been restored, at least partially, in the decade following the Martin County coal waste spill. Martin County’s social trust index climbed from 7.7 in 2001 to 8.4 in 2011. However, even in 2011, Martin County still lags behind Perry County, the control county in our prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1086026612467983">McSpirit et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1086026612467983">McSpirit et al., 2007</xref>), which had a social trust index of 9.4 in 2001.</p>
<p>Our regression analyses focus on the relationship between disaster events and the dissolution of social and institutional trust in Martin County. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1086026612467983">Table 3</xref> examines the effects of the passage of time on social trust. Unadjusted for other explanatory factors, Model 1 indicates positive recovery of citizens’ trust in experts, public officials, corporations, and local government 10 years after the event, as also indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1086026612467983">Figure 2</xref>.</p>
<p>The safety of drinking water was the top concern in Martin County after the spill. Local newspaper coverage of foul-smelling water, which left residue on cookware and caused skin rashes, resulted in increasing public scrutiny of the water supply. This eventually spurred the Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC) to investigate the public water plant and cite it for violations in April 2002. Not surprisingly, Model 2 demonstrates that concern about drinking water plays a strong role in explaining the dissolution of social trust in Martin County. Concerns over drinking water display the strongest correlation (&gt;0.3) with social trust in every model in which it is included. Concerns over coal waste were also highly significant, second only to drinking water concerns in the strength of its association with social trust.</p>
<p>In addition to concern about water, community detachment (as expressed by the desire to live elsewhere) is also associated with the erosion of social trust in Martin County in both 2001 and 2011. Model 4 is the full additive model that includes standard socioeconomic predictors with standard demographic predictors, such as gender, education level, income, employment status, and economic dependence on the coal industry. Surprisingly, none of these standard social capital indicators are significant in Martin County. However, the model indicates that young people in Martin County are more likely to rank higher in levels of social and institutional distrust than older residents. Whether the disaster played a role in this is open to debate. It is possible that young people were more affected by the disaster either because it occurred at an earlier and more impressionable time in life or because they have spent a larger proportion of their lives in a community undergoing postdisaster conflict and ontological insecurity. Generational differences unrelated to the disaster may also play a role.</p>
<p>The analyses in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1086026612467983">Table 3</xref> assume simple additive relationships between social trust and its explanatory variables. It is possible, however, that environmental concerns had a stronger effect on social trust in 2001 than in 2011. To investigate this, we also considered interactions between the explanatory variables and time. We found no evidence of interaction between time and community attachment or between time and concerns over drinking water. However, we did find strong evidence that the effect of concerns about coal waste on social trust varied with time (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). This relationship is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1086026612467983">Figure 3</xref>. As the figure illustrates, concerns over coal waste had a dramatic effect on social trust in 2001, but virtually no effect in 2011. This sheds some light on the reversal of association in terms of the effect of time in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1086026612467983">Table 3</xref>, depending on whether perceived environmental risk was adjusted for (Models 2-4) or not (Model 1). Although individuals certainly tended to be more concerned with environmental risks in 2001 than 2011, individuals who were unconcerned with environmental risks in 2001 had particularly high levels of social trust. Or to put it a different way, individuals who were just as concerned with environmental risks in 2011 as they had been in 2001 had particularly low levels of social trust, perhaps feeling that their community had not made significant progress toward addressing their concerns.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study contributes to the literature investigating the long-term impacts of disasters on social trust. Our findings suggest that the Martin County coal waste disaster of 2000 negatively affected social trust in the short term but that trust has recovered somewhat over the past decade. However, our study does have limitations. As with most disaster recovery research, we could not establish a predisaster baseline measurement of the factors we investigated. Using the disaster as our starting point, we assumed that the slurry spill was the impetus of local distrust in 2001. However, it is possible that the causal relationship between these variables could be reversed: distrust of experts and the government may have caused local concerns about the drinking water. Furthermore, the desire to live elsewhere could have predated the disaster. Despite these limitations with the 2001 data, we believe our findings that suggest a partial recovery of trust in public officials, experts, regulatory agencies, and coal companies are notable.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that technological disasters, even those causing toxic contamination, do not always have long-term impacts on social trust. If institutions are perceived to respond responsibly to such events, trust in social institutions can be restored. Many Martin County respondents regained trust because they felt their environmental concerns had been addressed. Those whose environmental concerns remained the same from 2001 to 2011, however, continued to distrust government and corporations. Because more Martin County respondents were satisfied with the clean-up and recovery of the area, the general trend in Martin County has been toward rebounding trust in institutions from 2001 to 2011. Whether this renewed level of trust is merited remains to be seen, however. Factors supporting renewed trust include the following: (a) independent water tests found the public water to be safe in 2005, (b) changes in local public water district management oversaw improvements in the water plant, and (c) a Presidential election resulted in changes at the EPA in regards to mountaintop removal permitting and regulation. However, there are a number of factors that indicate that lower, rather than higher, levels of trust may actually be warranted. For instance, in the aftermath of the disaster, there was no effort to facilitate public oversight of the corporate-led clean-up efforts. In addition, despite public interest, the local water board failed to incorporate citizen advisors into its organizational structure. Even more troubling is the fact that after this disaster, the Kentucky state legislature did not mandate emergency and evacuation planning for the possibility of future impoundment failures. The legislature’s failure to mandate such emergency planning does not mean there is not a risk of future impoundment failures; in fact, there is a significant risk, given that there are 27 dams in Kentucky deemed to be “high hazards” for failure<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1086026612467983">2</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1086026612467983">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>A priority for future research is to revisit Perry County, Kentucky, the control county that we used in our initial 2001 research. Perry County was not directly affected by the disaster, though it has other similarities to Martin County, including coal dependence and the presence of five coal waste reservoirs within the county. Perry County had a higher social trust index in 2001 (9.4) than Martin County had achieved in 2011 (8.4); this introduces the possibility that Martin County residents had only partially regained trust in government, experts, and corporations. Follow-up research in Perry County would provide important insight into the extent of Martin County’s recovery.</p>
<p>Another future research direction could be to conduct comparisons between Martin County and other disaster-affected communities. This would yield a more comprehensive knowledge about the rates of disaster recovery and how they relate to community characteristics and disaster type. Possible comparison cases include communities affected by the Buffalo Creek disaster of 1972, the Exxon <italic>Valdez</italic> oil spill of 1989, or Hurricane Katrina of 2005. These three disasters make good candidates because they are among the exceptional few whose long-term impacts have been studied. Buffalo Creek stands out as a comparison case because is near Martin County and is similar in demographic characteristics, disaster type, and coal industry dependence. Because Duane Gill consulted with us on the initial survey, we included several questions in the instrument that were also used in his research on the Exxon <italic>Valdez</italic> spill. Comparing the long-term impacts of the Alaskan and Appalachian disasters on social trust would be a feasible next step.</p>
<p>Although this analysis of the long-term impacts of the Martin County coal waste disaster clearly demonstrates that toxic spills do not always permanently erode social trust, this study raises questions that merit further attention. For example, what accounts for the lack of significance of standard social capital predictors, such as gender, education level, income, employment status, and economic dependence on the coal industry in Martin County? Also, which actions or events of the past decade convinced community members to trust the coal company and related institutions again, and why were some members of the community not persuaded by those actions? Finally, what are the implications of this arguably unmerited increase in trust for Martin County’s future? If this increase in trust is indeed unwarranted, this could make the county more vulnerable to environmental risk and disaster in the future. This is of paramount concern, not only to mining communities but also to communities around the world. In an era of global climate change and extreme weather events, improving community preparation for and response to disasters should be a priority.</p>
