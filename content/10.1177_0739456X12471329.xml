<p>I am honored to accept this award on behalf of myself and my coauthor, Leonard Ortolano. For those of you who have been lucky enough to work with Len, you know that he is a dream of an advisor and this article certainly benefited from his expertise. To have one of your first articles not only accepted by <italic>JPER</italic> but awarded this honor is extremely gratifying. This article grew out of my dissertation work at Stanford University’s Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources, which sought to apply concepts from the study of social movements to better understand community opposition to energy facility siting. The hope was to contribute to both studies of siting controversies in planning and also the study of social movements in sociology. This recognition from the planning community leads us to believe that we have at the very least accomplished the first goal. We would like to express our sincere appreciation to the Rapkin Award Committee for recognizing our work.</p>
<p>We would also like to thank the other members of my dissertation committee: Doug McAdam, who ensured that our description of social movement theory was accurate; Meg Caldwell, who helped us connect with important informants in California; and Monica McDermott, who coached us on qualitative methods. The article was also improved by three anonymous reviews, by comments from the JPER editorial staff, and by my participation in the JPER Writing Workshop. I highly recommend this workshop to other young planning scholars, not only for the constructive feedback on your work but also for the colleagues and friends that you will meet and continue to look forward to seeing at conferences like this one long after the weekend is over. Finally, we would like to thank the people of Malibu, Vallejo, Oxnard, and beyond, who generously shared their stories with us so that we could better understand the dynamics of opposition to energy projects. Without their participation, this research would not have been possible.</p>
<p>For those who enjoyed this piece and would like to read more, Doug McAdam and I have continued this line of work in <italic>Putting Social Movements in Their Place: Explaining Opposition to Energy Projects in the United States, 2000-2005</italic>, which was recently published by Cambridge University Press. The book reports the results of a comparative study of twenty communities earmarked for environmentally risky energy projects.</p>
