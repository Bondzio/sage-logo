<p>The film <italic>Pelada</italic> features two recent college graduates who were star student athletes. However, they find that the careers in professional soccer they had been preparing themselves for are not going to happen. Faced with major decisions about their future life paths, and with identity crises (who am I if I’m no longer an athlete who is part of a team?), Luke Boughen and Gwen Oxenham find that their love for and fascination with the game of soccer compel them to find a way to keep it in their lives, at least in the short term. They obtain funding to hire a film crew and travel the world in search of “street soccer”—informal amateur games played by ordinary people. Their journey takes them through South America, Africa, Europe, and Asia as they explore how people around the world play soccer. As they travel, they meet the local people, find out where street soccer is played, and join in their games.</p>
<p>The filmmakers explore several questions: How do people who love soccer, but who are not professional athletes, make the sport a part of their lives? Why do they do it and what do they get out of it? What is the value of soccer when it is done just for fun rather than to win tournaments, to become famous, or to make a living? Who plays soccer in different countries—men and women, rich and poor, old and young? Where is it played? How do the culture, religion, and belief systems of a nation affect the way soccer is played and experienced?</p>
<p>In Brazil, the filmmakers get to know Nene, a former professional women’s soccer player whose involvement with soccer is now limited to informal games played in her neighborhood. Although she wanted to continue her professional career as a player, this was impossible. So she works in a small factory painting toys but uses her free time to watch and join in informal soccer games. In Brazil, Luke and Gwen find a group of senior citizens who have been meeting weekly for decades to play soccer together in a neighborhood park. This segment of the film illustrates how lifetime participation in sport can be the norm, in contrast to the transition to spectatorhood that marks the fate of many American student athletes as they leave their official playing days. The increasing prevalence of organized sports activities in America, often for children as young as 3 years old, has to a great extent replaced organic, grassroots “playing” of games by children in their neighborhoods. Most of these children are now hyperscheduled in school, sports, and other activities, and many seem to have lost the neighborhood connections—and the time to play—that make these informal activities routine in other societies.</p>
<p>In Iran, the filmmakers find that although street soccer is alive and kicking for the men in the country, women are prohibited by religious and cultural conventions from participating in this outdoor and visible activity. Gwen sadly watches from the sidelines, clearly resentful that Luke gets to enjoy playing with the locals but she cannot. They find a street game in a relatively isolated neighborhood in Tehran, where they decide it is worth the risk of asking the men whether both of them can join the game. They enjoy the game greatly, but someone informs the authorities about the game, and Luke and Gwen find themselves called in by officials to explain themselves. Their film footage is confiscated, but it is returned to them by the time they are ready to leave the country. In Japan, they find that space is the limiting factor, with population densities such that neighborhood parks and informal playing fields are hard to find. Getting access to space to play soccer requires some ingenuity and is also expensive; thus space and social class become dual barriers to widespread participation in postuniversity sports activities.</p>
<p>In short, the film touches on a broad range of sociological themes in addition to exploring the place of sports in people’s lives and the search for meaning in life. The film explores the effect of gender, social class, culture, and age on how people play and enjoy the game. The film vividly depicts the great cultural contrasts between nations in the world, as well as differences in poverty and affluence, political systems, and social structures. And so, a film about sports is also a film about life. A film about growing up and making a major life transition is a film about learning how to transform dreams rather than give them up; opening oneself up to new possibilities and learning that after the familiar there is not nothingness or a frightening precipice, but the first step on the path to the rest of your life.</p>
<p>This film will be useful for college classes in the sociology of sports, introduction to sociology, or global studies. The scenes provide a vivid look at how people live in different countries around the world, and the filmmakers’ strategy of engagement with specific individuals provides a personal look at the relationship between sports and people’s lives in the various countries visited. Unfortunately, the film is 92 minutes long, making it too long to neatly fit into most class periods. However, coherent segments from 5 to 20 minutes long can easily be found in the film and shown to the class as examples. The format of the film, which is segmented by geography as the filmmakers move from continent to continent, also lends itself to showing the film over two or more class periods, each covering different parts of the world. Another quibble is that the narration is sometimes a little stilted. However, these minor issues do not detract from the value of the film in serving educational purposes while providing an engaging viewing experience for the students.</p>
