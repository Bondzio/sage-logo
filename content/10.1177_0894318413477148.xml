<abstract>
<p>Students are building a foundation to help them move fluidly and naturally while making human to human connections. Parse’s theory of humanbecoming and the associated teaching-learning processes were used as underpinnings to guide students as they come to know more about themselves and others. The teaching-learning processes help nursing students understand that being present and bearing witness are an important part of honoring quality of life and respecting value choices. The purpose of this column is to highlight the humanbecoming teaching-learning processes as students explore their experiences of learning to be with others in true presence.</p>

<p>Meaningful experiences begin to reveal the essence of becoming a nurse that involves connecting with others and developing relationships in true presence. If effective, student experiences in the clinical practicum setting will move them to better respond to the challenges of the human condition as persons live out their own unique quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894318413477148">Shea, 2007</xref>). As students share discerning contemplations, the theory of humanbecoming is used as an underpinning to highlight the teaching-learning processes as they come to know more about themselves and others. The purpose of this column is to highlight the humanbecoming teaching-learning processes as students explore their experiences of learning to be with others in true presence.</p>
<sec id="section1-0894318413477148">
<title>Teaching-Learning Processes and Student Practicums</title>
<p>In order to learn about human to human connections, it is essential to create and structure the learning environments that allow students to be truly present with others. Nurses are called upon each day to <italic>be present</italic> and to appreciate others’ perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894318413477148">Parse, 2010</xref>). Cocreating relationships is predicated on the growing understanding of ways of being present. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477148">Parse (1994)</xref> explained the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>True presence is a free-flowing attentiveness that does not arise from <italic>trying to attend</italic> to the other, since the <italic>trying to</italic> in itself is a distraction which takes energy and demands a focus away from the other. To be with another in the free-flowing active stillness of true presence, <italic>preparation</italic> and <italic>attention</italic> are essential. (p. 18)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894318413477148">Parse (2012)</xref> asserted, “Nurses come to be present in centering with the moments about-to-be with a quiet gentling down, preparing for, and attending to being present with persons with the becoming visible-invisible becoming of the emerging now” (pp. 50-51). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477148">Parse (1994)</xref> also emphasized the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>Preparation involves an emptying to be open to the other. To be open to someone refers to being flexible, not fixed but gracefully available from one’s center. The nurse prepares through dwelling with the universe at the moment, considering the attentive presence about to be. (p. 18)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Nursing students may become centered while contemplating ways of being with and connecting with others. Focused centering and contemplation can be foundational in the design of the practicum experiences. In many nursing programs, students are asked to keep journals and write out process recordings based on their interactions. This form of reflection is necessary, but will not suffice to assure that students develop their ability to be truly present with others. Focused centering is a way of being in touch with the personal. This enables nurses to open themselves up and really listen.</p>
<p>For this practicum experience, students were encouraged to consider how to integrate and find meaning in each experience as a base for their future practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318413477148">Epp, 2008</xref>). However, the process of reflection does not, in and of itself, assure that nursing students have the scaffolding to fully connect to their learning as it ebbs and flows into a sustainable nursing practice framework incorporating Parse’s theory of humanbecoming. Student journaling was utilized as a means to explore personal experiences of teaching-learning from the humanbecoming perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318413477148">Letcher &amp; Yancey, 2004</xref>). Written journals then provided the material for contemplation on ways of being. These weekly reflections were discussed individually with the instructor and collectively with classmates in the post-conference. Students were urged to express their feelings and to consider the potential implications while taking care to avoid any premature conclusions and remain open to the unfolding in coming to know.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0894318413477148">
<title>Teaching-Learning Processes</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318413477148">Parse (2004)</xref> described teaching-learning from the perspective of the humanbecoming theory as a cocreated journey that focuses on truth in the moment in coming to know. Teaching- learning is “a never-ending journey of giving-receiving in coming-to-know. It is an ever-changing unitary process focusing on individual responsibility for learning and a belief in truth for the moment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318413477148">Parse, 2004</xref>, p. 34). The teaching-learning processes are living with ambiguity, appreciating mystery, potentiating integrity, weaving multidimensionality, honoring wisdom, and witnessing unfolding. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318413477148">Parse (2004)</xref> explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>Living with ambiguity is moment-to-moment, moving with the vague. Appreciating mystery is apprehending with awe the venerated unfathomable. Potentiating integrity is strengthening an oneness of purpose. Weaving multidimensionality is unbounded interlacing. Honoring wisdom is revering the sagacity. Witnessing unfolding is profoundly attending with the ever changing. (p. 35)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Communication that helps to build confidence is important to the teaching-learning processes. In journaling and in contemplation, the priority is for sharing the teaching-learning processes and one’s presence with the other person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318413477148">Letcher &amp; Yancey, 2004</xref>), while at the same time building confidence through non-judgmental dialogue. The ability to be comfortable in the giver-receiver modes of these processes shows a value for the nurse-person relationship as well as the instructor-student relationship. The dialogues give meaning and relevance to the teaching-learning processes, while preparing students for their careers in nursing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318413477148">Bunkers (1999)</xref> stated that “giving meaning involves ascribing value to ideas and lived experiences. Meaning-making constructs personal reality” (p. 229). The recognition of the strengths of each person and the recognition that no two persons are the same in the humanbecoming teaching-learning processes are essences in coming to know (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318413477148">Parse, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Reviewing individual journaling and contemplations within the underpinning of humanbecoming theory assists students to gain a better understanding of themselves and others. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318413477148">Naef (2006)</xref> wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>Nurses need to be guided in a specific knowledge base like humanbecoming and to dare to bear witness to the others placed in their care, to the unfolding of persons’ lives and deaths, and to their experiences of health and illness, from moment-to-moment. (p.155)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A focused review of the student experiences provides this guidance.</p>
<p>On the final day of the practicum experience, there was time devoted to speak about the teaching-learning processes as experienced by the students in nurse-person relationships. The questions used to guide student participation in this scholarly discussion were:</p>
<list id="list1-0894318413477148" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>What surprised you about the experience?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How did the experience challenge your assumptions/expectations?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Describe a moment that stands out in your mind?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How are you similar/ different from other persons?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How can this experience in nursing apply to other aspects of your life?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Teaching-Learning Processes and Student Experiences</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Students typically reveal feelings of apprehension and exhaustion following their first practicum day that involves touring the unit and discussing the expectations of their imagined role. As the practicum experience concluded, one student wrote of the teaching-learning process, <italic>appreciating mystery</italic> in the following journal excerpt.</p>
<p>I was nervous going into this mostly because I knew I needed to make a connection and that is what really helped them and I was afraid of saying the wrong thing or conveying the wrong message. I was surprised of how little I needed to say. It was more that I was there. (J. Gossel, personal communication, December, 2011)</p>
<p>As each day passed the students built confidence. As the key issues of trust and being in a safe environment were addressed the stage was set for openness. Student approaches to connecting with others involved unconditional acceptance. The person is accepted unconditionally as a fellow human being and therefore trust developed. Building trust was a basic theme in student sharing and was often not initially apparent to the student. With contemplation, one student addressed trust as the teaching-learning process of <italic>honoring wisdom</italic>. The student wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>I learned how important communication is in health. It takes 5 to 10 minutes to ask how they [people] are doing. With time, they adjust to you. It is awkward at first; especially thinking someone has problems, so I just started and said, “I am Joel, I am a student nurse.” He was in pain 7 out of 10, he didn’t want me there. I stayed there whether we talked or not, he then noticed me listening, and that I was concerned. After about 20 minutes, I again asked, “How are you doing and what is happening?” Then we talked about his family, hobbies, and his healthcare. (J. R. Armamento, personal communication, November, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Another student also wrote of <italic>honoring wisdom</italic>.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I put myself out there because it gives me a feel for how they want me to be with them. I ask, “How can I be with you? “ We all can experience things differently. Just being there, I understand that an individual nurse’s presence means a lot to each person. (N. Filter, personal communication, November, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similar to trust, listening surfaced in many journals as an important part of truly connecting with others. Listening begins with accepting the person with understanding. Developing an ability to communicate takes practice in a non-threatening setting in which frequent discussions with nurse role models and ongoing reflection can take place. Initially, many students are not comfortable talking with other persons without a task to perform. With ongoing role modeling on the part of the faculty as well as expert nurses on the units, students became more confident in their ability to talk with others. Listening deliberately in discussion revealed in the teaching-learning process of <italic>weaving illimitably</italic> as one student wrote:
<disp-quote>
<p>In nursing school before, we would do tasks, we set priorities a, b, c. It has never been about being with someone and sitting with them. This is what matters most to many people. I will bring it with me to all my work. (N. Stafford, personal communication December, 2011)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Another nursing student also spoke to <italic>weaving illimitable</italic> when she wrote about being with a 61 year old woman who had attempted to jump off a cliff. She shared,
<disp-quote>
<p>My own friend was successful in ending of his/her life. I tried so hard to separate it, so I talked with my instructor. She said ‘just talk with her, her Mother passed away.’ So I sat with my patient. My patient started crying and I had no idea what to say, to be completely honest. It took maturity and communication to be effective. It felt right to let her cry. I sat there trying hard NOT to think of what to say to <italic>my friend.</italic> It helped me to think what I would say in the moment. I finally said, ‘How are you feeling now?’ The patient said, ‘Oh. I feel bad that I made you stay and listen to me.’ I then said, ‘Oh, not at all! Not at all.’ This was the first time she cried. (D. Wilson, personal communication, November, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>While relationships are a central focus for nurses, through this practicum experience, students are better able and more at ease in making connections. One nursing student shared reflection about relationships related to the teaching-learning process of <italic>potentiating integrity</italic> in the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>My patient taught me an important lesson. He asked me to join his Facebook to educate the world about his illness. He said, that “I want people to come to my level. As a student, I learned to pay attention to my thoughts and feelings. I realized that there is a thin line as a professional. Being his same age, I could have easily joined his Facebook. I know now, that I felt hooked-in to have gained his confidence and made some headway in a relationship. I went back to tell him thanks for asking to join his Facebook, but that our relationship was a working relationship focused on his goals. He just said, ‘Cool.’ (C. Ortega, personal communication, November, 2009).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The teaching-learning process of <italic>honoring wisdom</italic> was also exemplified regarding becoming more open to relationships as one student shared in the following reflection.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My patient made no eye contact, he said, ‘It is all too much and everything is overwhelming.’ I then helped him fill out his menu. He repeated things, short phrases over and over. He couldn’t shave. I asked how he would feel to change into some new clothes. He said, ‘Not good.’ So I showed him he did have a clean outfit to change into some new clothes. When I was asked to help him, the staff suggested that I not push him. The following week, he was in fresh clothes, came and stayed in group on his own. And then, the next week he told me he was more confident and could trust people. (A. Robinson, personal communication, November, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Two of the nursing students expressed the teaching-learning process <italic>appreciating mystery</italic> as being moved by the opportunity to be present while listening to others accounts of internal struggles as well as how they were dealing with these struggles. The student wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>It was important to be there for him, even for a few minutes every few hours. He said, ‘I want you to know, you have a wonderful way about you. You helped create the energy of being present. You didn’t leave, you connected with the humanness, even though you couldn’t change anything.’ (J. R. Armamento, personal communication, November, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Another student wrote of <italic>appreciating mystery</italic>:
<disp-quote>
<p>He was very ill and homeless. What is that like? I did not know how to approach him so my nurse preceptor said, ‘Be there for him, and do short brief interactions, and sit a short while with him. Just listen.’ So I was there for him. Being there for someone really helps. (A. Alorro, personal communication November, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Changes in the attitudes of nursing students toward persons with altered qualities of life, and a sense of preparedness for work in the nursing field occurs following practicum experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318413477148">Happell, 2008</xref>). In the following statement related to <italic>honoring wisdom</italic>, a student shared how an experience helped to increase awareness of preconceived attitudes about people. The student wrote: “Look beyond the illness, people are more than their illness. Look past the illness and listen to what each person says their needs are. People are people and I noticed it more in this setting” (N. Filter, personal communication, November, 2009).</p>
<p>Learning to be with people in honoring wisdom requires practice, supervision, and much reflection. The nurse gets centered and contemplates ways of being, while becoming ready to be with another. Through the teaching-learning process of <italic>witnessing unfolding</italic> two students shared how they were able to be with another. The first wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>Being there and being a part of the interdisciplinary team was important. I learned so much listening to someone talk about his anxiety, depression, and pain. Later he was able to express feelings to me and I was able to just listen and sit quietly and just BE for the patient, bearing witness. It was important to learn about the human connection and understand humanness. (T. Tina, personal communication, November, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The other student wrote about teaching-learning process <italic>witnessing unfolding</italic> in the following excerpt,
<disp-quote>
<p>I feel super warm and super good inside, goose bumps. Just think and appreciate how much of ourselves that we put into this experience and how much of ourselves we have shared with other people. It is about how to appreciate the journey. We are all really blessed for the lives we touch. I have done a lot of contemplating if I didn’t write it down in my journal; it is part of me (points to his heart). These are experiences that change us. (N. Lozano, personal communication, December, 2011)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The humanbecoming teaching-learning processes have enlightened the core essence of nursing as it was described earlier involving connecting with others and developing relationships. Nursing students can carry with them the knowledge gained through these processes as they move on with their individual careers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0894318413477148">
<title>Implications for Developing the Role of the Nurse</title>
<p>Students often reveal how fundamental and foundational the practicum can be to becoming a nurse. The experiences shared above highlight the intensely person-centered nature of nursing. Active experiential learning with journaling, contemplation, and discernment on these experiences helped students feel more comfortable and capable of developing nurse-person relationships, while recognizing others’ value priorities and individually constructed quality of life.</p>
<p>An ideal practicum environment helps students maximize their learning. Becoming comfortable, more aware of themselves in relation to others, and practicing to be more deliberate in how to share, helped students to be more open in coming to know. A mutual teaching-learning partnership between the clinical instructor, clinical nurse specialist, and interdisciplinary staff served as a base to decrease apprehensions by establishing connections, dignified and respectful expectations, and safety in the environment. Student reflections expressed appreciation of the importance of excellent role models and active hands-on experiences that are more than just observational.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318413477148">Parse (2011)</xref> challenged educators to co-create
<disp-quote>
<p>opportunities for nurses to learn and practice nursing as a unique discipline with its own science, based on a commitment to competence lived out in treating recipients of care with respect, intently listening to their concerns and honoring their desires. (p. 93)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In easing the transition to the professional nursing role, the students actively join the inter-disciplinary team. Care planning meetings are the routine in this clinical setting and nursing presence at the table where decisions are made with patients is critical to integrating the person’s perspectives on quality of life. In active team participation, students were able to collaborate and practice their beginning negotiating, influencing, conflict resolution, and advocacy skills. Student reflections focused on coming to know, role taking, and identity formation as a nurse within the inter-disciplinary team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318413477148">Benner, Sutphen, Leonard, &amp; Day, 2009</xref>). In preparation for their role as a professional nurse, there is a need for students to practice managing their interactions with the interdisciplinary care team through collaborative actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318413477148">O’Rourke, 2003</xref>) as was done throughout this practicum experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0894318413477148">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Sharing student perspectives on practicum experiences through contemplation is an essential way for the nursing student to embrace teaching-learning regarding making human connections and developing nurse-person relationships. To discern and to review are both essential if the lessons in contemplating one’s way of being are to grow to be accessible to students in future nursing careers. Through experiences, described in this column, students were able to build a foundation for moving fluidly and naturally to make human to human connections. Nurses need to establish a contemplative discerning practice that evaluates ways to bridge theory and practice to better serve persons and their families. Nurses also need to consider the impact that they have in being with others while appreciating and honoring that others not only have the wisdom to know what they need, but are also the experts on their health and quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318413477148">Parse, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477148">1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894318413477148">2010</xref>). Nursing faculty then, need to bring humanbecoming theory to life, teaching students to bear witness to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318413477148">Naef, 2006</xref>). Ultimately, nurses are there for others by having, “profound interest in the human experiences of health and quality of life, a respect for human dignity, a reverence for humans’ unique ways of living health, thereby supporting bearing witness as a way of being with others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318413477148">Naef, 2006</xref>, p. 155). Being able to actively engage in contemplation during practicum experiences offers nursing students precious time to come to know and appreciate individual ways of being as they engage in the teaching-learning processes.</p>
