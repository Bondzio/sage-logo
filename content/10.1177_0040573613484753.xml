<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this article is to investigate the way that Jesus’ sense of humor would have functioned in a first-century Galilean political and religious context. Drawing on both rhetorical and social-scientific criticisms, as well as form-critical reconstructions of the sayings of Jesus, it explores the possibility that neuolinguistic research into the phenomenon of linguistic genius may shed some light on the historical Jesus. It therefore proposes that many of the sayings of Jesus, which have traditionally been taken “seriously” might be better understood as humorous subversions of oppressive discourses by a Galilean peasant with a wicked sense of humor.</p>

<p>Nothing is more important than learning to think crudely. Crude thinking is the thinking of great men.</p>
<p>—Bertolt Brecht</p></disp-quote>
<p>Jesus knew how to think crudely, how to make the kind of jokes that peasants make, and how to use those jokes subversively to raise social awareness. When theologians and religious leaders read Jesus, and miss the punch line, we often end up becoming the joke, and enshrining our own lack of humor in theology, liturgy, biblical studies, and even church structures and social policy.</p>
<p>Bruce Longenecker has suggested that biblical scholars tend to turn a blind eye to the humor of Jesus because of the perception that the Gospels are about more serious matters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573613484753">1</xref></sup> But the <italic>Gospel of Judas</italic> is replete with references to Jesus’ laughter which may be understood as having a basis in genuine memories of Jesus, and the canonical Gospels themselves contain texts which are only read free of comedy because they are traditionally so read, and which can well be read not only to contain humor, but to contain a very earthy and even vulgar line of joking which is appropriate for a peasant who is well known for eating and drinking with an unrespectable crowd of “sinners.”</p>
<p>Longenecker gives the example of Luke 14:15–24, in which three friends decline invitations to a wedding banquet. The first declines because he has acquired land and needs to try it out, the second has acquired oxen and needs to try them out, the third because he has acquired a wife and needs to…decline the invitation. The pregnant pause allows the listeners to observe the sexual implications of the declined invitation—the unspoken “I must go and try her out” would have been obvious to the hearers, but you would have to be there to get the joke.</p>
<p>In arguing that this humorous structure represents a genuine memory of the historical Jesus, Longenecker notes that a number of movies and novels have suggested just this very same character trait in Jesus. In Norman Mailer’s <italic>The Gospel according to the Son</italic> for instance, Jesus’ message is one which opposes a kind of excessively pious seriousness that was connected to the religious establishment: “Jesus is driven to tear down the dehumanising piety that had engulfed the religious structures of Second-Temple Judaism, especially in the region of Jerusalem, with its heavy concentration of the Jewish religio-political powerbase.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040573613484753">2</xref></sup> Longenecker does note that even in such novels, which talk about the possibility of a Jesus who could tell jokes, many refrain from actually depicting Jesus in a state of laughter—except for Walter Wangerin’s novel <italic>Jesus</italic>, in which Peter discovers that Jesus is ticklish, that he arches his eyebrows and chokes when he laughs, unlike Peter who roars and slaps his thigh. But what these novels do seem to be aware of, that biblical scholars have sometimes missed, is that to effectively relate to an oppressed people, and take on the establishment in the way that Jesus did, he must have been able to relate to them on their own level. He ate among tax-collectors and sinners, not as some patronizing Christian missionary, but as one of them. His humor must be understood as humor given in a certain social context, one which we are not a part of (and therefore, not really “in on”), but we can at least as outsiders understand something of how his humor might have functioned.</p>
<p>F. Scott Spenser has portrayed Jesus’ calling of the disciples, “Follow me!,” as a farce, in which Jesus assumes an imperious manner which parodies the manners of the Roman invaders, and which he used to create a counter-imperial movement. If Spenser is right, then Jesus must have been infamous for his cutting wit, and downright dangerous social subversion. The ability to make earthy jokes that raise the social awareness of oppressed people in such an effectively subversive way is a unique talent, but the ability to do so without replicating structures of tyranny is another thing entirely. “Ironic distance from the oppressor must be firmly maintained alongside strategies of appropriation. Jesus accentuates this by his vagabond, anti-Herodian existence: he dwells in no royal villa by the beach.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040573613484753">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Spenser and Longenecker have respectively suggested two jokes, the ribald humor of a wedding night, and the mocking of an invading army by the occupied. To articulate a more general theory about the function of Jesus’ humor in his building of a movement, I will need to draw on a broader cross-section of his sayings, and generalize about how they functioned in his social context. To do so, I will draw on historical and literary information about first-century Galilee, social-scientific models of peasant societies in general, and also some neuro-linguistic models about the way that comic genius functions before applying my conclusions about Jesus’ humor to some specific sayings in their earliest form-critical reconstruction.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0040573613484753"><title>The Historical and Literary Context</title>
<p>It is my claim that Jesus’ sense of humor is behind the classical division between sayings of Jesus which look to ethical or wise living in the current world, and may be described as having a sapiential or realized eschatology, and those which proclaim the immanent end of that world and have an unrealized or apocalyptic eschatology.</p>
<p>The sapiential approach follows the lead of C.H. Dodd, whose concept of realized eschatology managed to combine many of the best insights of classical liberalism (which had ignored eschatology in favor of ethical precepts) with the approach of Albert Schweitzer and Rudolf Bultmann who had pictured Jesus as an eschatological prophet of an imminent kingdom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040573613484753">4</xref></sup> Dodd achieved this synthesis by resolving the tension between Mark 1:14–15 and Matt 12:28 = Luke 11:20. Mark 1:14–15 was traditionally translated as Jesus’ proclamation that the kingdom was “at hand” (<italic>engizein</italic>), while in Matt 12:28 = Luke 11:20, Jesus claimed that his power over demons demonstrates that the kingdom has already come (<italic>phthanein</italic>).</p>
<p>By taking both Greek verbs as translations of the Aramaic verb <italic>m’ta</italic>, to arrive, Dodd was able to understand Mark 1:14–15 as also saying that the kingdom is just not “at hand,” but that it has already arrived.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040573613484753">5</xref></sup> In this way, Jesus’ message can be understood as being not about a future kingdom, but a present kingdom which people may belong to, or exclude themselves from and so place themselves under a coming judgment.</p>
<p>More recently, by J.D. Crossan, the essential ideas of Dodd’s realized eschatology have been rebranded as “sapiential eschatology.” This approach also understands the preaching of Jesus to have been primarily about the present world, and situates Jesus in the world of the Hellenistic, Cynic philosophy of the Decapolis. Sapiential reconstructions of Jesus include those of members of the Jesus Seminar: J.D. Crossan, F. Gerald Downing,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040573613484753">6</xref></sup> and so on. Mediating positions, such as those by Geza Vermes<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0040573613484753">7</xref></sup> and Marcus Borg,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0040573613484753">8</xref></sup> portray Jesus as a sage, but one contextualized by specifically Jewish styles of mysticism, as a “prophetic sage,” but all such reconstructions focus on the ethical and wisdom teaching of Jesus which is found, for instance, in the Sermon on the Mount, and taught simplicity of living, love of enemies, and reliance on the heavenly Father to care for all one’s needs.</p>
<p>The apocalyptic Jesus, on the other hand, is situated by scholars such as D.C. Allison, E.P. Sanders, J.P. Meier, Bart Ehrman, and N.T. Wright in the context of Second Temple Jewish apocalyptic literature, and his relationship to John the Baptist. Contemporary eschatological reconstructions of Jesus envision his message as being of the proclamation of an imminent kingdom/imperial rule, and a Son of Man, similar to the Son of Man who inaugurates the fifth kingdom in Dan 7.</p>
<p>In apocalyptic literature, particularly in Daniel, the kingdom of God and the Son of Man are presented as an alternative kind of reality to the empires of this world, which triumphs over the reality of this world. So, in Dan 2, the statue represents the various empires that oppress God’s people, and the kingdom of God is the stone that broke all the other kingdoms into pieces, and will endure forever. In Dan 7:13, the Son of Man (“human one”) functions in the same way as a contrast to the animals of chs 7–8, which represent the kingdoms of this world. The Son of Man is the one whose kingdom will reign everywhere and never pass away. This vision is a distinctively Jewish and Yahwistic reality unlike the reality of imperial Rome. As Crossan states, it gave Jewish people an empowering discourse of “studying the scriptures to understand your past, reclaim your present, and envisage your future.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0040573613484753">9</xref></sup> Jesus’ teaching about the coming of the end of the age, and the coming of the Son of Man to judge the world are in view here.</p>
<p>Early in the twentieth century, Bultmann argued that Jesus’ ethical and apocalyptic sayings must both be accounted for. He said that it is impossible to understand why the early church would create a rabbi out of their Messiah, or why they would have created an apocalyptic prophet while they struggled everywhere to mitigate his apocalyptic sayings with theologizing glosses about the delay of the parousia. Bultmann’s logic is still quite valid in the current discussion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0040573613484753">10</xref></sup> The examples he gives of this tendency are from the synoptic apocalypse (Mark 13:31, 33–37) and the Q apocalypse (Luke 12:35–38).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0040573613484753">11</xref></sup> This agrees with Bultmann’s understanding of Mark and Q as the two earliest sources for the synoptic tradition, which in turn he understood as the source for Jesus’ message.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0040573613484753">12</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0040573613484753"><title>Social-scientific Models</title>
<p>Social-scientific criticism is able to clarify the way that Jesus’ ambiguity functioned in the context of first century Galilee. When the implications of this ambiguity are thought through, it immediately becomes clear how dynamic such a message could have been in Jesus’ social and historical location. According to Gerhard Lenski’s theory of social stratification, pre-market, rural-agrarian societies (such as Jesus’ Galilee) are characterized by continuous struggle for rights between the ruling class (in this case the Roman Empire) and the governing class (found in Jerusalem), whose interests are managed by a professional retaining class (the high priestly aristocracy in control of the Jerusalem temple system).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0040573613484753">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Drawn from the peasant class, the retaining class managed the power and privilege of the ruling class in exchange for access to greater power and privilege themselves. Jesus’ ambiguous language about the kingdom and the Son of Man (the human one) would have cut in both directions—the apocalyptic language serving to empower the Jewish people against the ruling class of the conquering Romans, and the sapiential language functioning as an attack on the apocalyptic program of the priestly retaining class in Jerusalem to re-establish the kingdom in Jerusalem (including the temple aristocracy, but also rival groups such as the fledgling rabbinic movement and the Essene community) through their apocalyptic, messianic expectations.</p>
<p>In his earlier association with John the Baptist, which took apocalyptic expectations north to Galilee, Jesus had already been part of a movement to take the discourse of apocalyptic resistance to the empire into the possession of the Galilean peasantry, even though by the first century it had become a tool of the priestly retaining class in Jerusalem. Crossan has argued that when John’s apocalyptic vision did not come to pass, Jesus’ message changed to one more conditioned by Cynic philosophy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0040573613484753">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>This clarifies the relationship between the sapiential and apocalyptic materials in the Jesus tradition, that is, the sapiential Jesus is the key to understanding the apocalyptic Jesus. I propose that after the death of John the Baptist, and the failure of his apocalyptic vision, Jesus experienced enlightenment about what apocalyptic really is. However, rather than speaking against apocalyptic, Jesus was able to use apocalyptic language to undermine the apocalyptic vision from within.</p>
<p>Such a Jesus must have been a powerfully original thinker. As Crossan argues, Jesus’ paradoxical claims about John the Baptist founding the kingdom (Luke 7:26), and a later assertion that the kingdom begins not with John, but with a little child (Luke 7:26 = <italic>Gos. Thom.</italic> 46) represent a departure from the teachings of John in the early stages of Jesus’ public ministry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0040573613484753">15</xref></sup> The failure of the kingdom to arrive after John’s death would, no doubt, have led to Jesus being disillusioned with John’s apocalyptic message. And yet, he cannot have forgotten how powerful that apocalyptic language was as a tool for peasants to reclaim their own understanding of time and history. Indeed, he reclaimed apocalyptic language, but grounded it in the lived experience of peasants, and founded a movement that practiced itinerant open commensality among peasants in Galilee.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0040573613484753"><title>“So hear then the joke…”</title>
<p>I have foolishly placed myself in the unenviable position where I need to explain a two thousand-year-old joke, of which almost everyone has missed the punchline. Jesus’ most playful way of exploring and exploiting the tension between apocalyptic and peasant life was through parables. His parables compared the kingdom with this-worldly and mundane things that specifically characterize the life of peasantry—agriculture (the mustard seed in Q 13:18–19 = <italic>Gos. Thom.</italic> 9 = Mark 4:30–32), shepherding (Q 15:3–7 = <italic>Gos. Thom.</italic> 107), children (Q 18:15–17 = <italic>Gos. Thom</italic>. 22:1–2 = Mark 10:13–16 = John 3:1–10), and so on. The two which I will explore here are the two which are best attested in the extant sources, the parables of the mustard seed, and of the little child.</p>
<p>In the parable of the mustard seeds, Jesus assumed the voice of an apocalyptic prophet proclaiming, as it was once proclaimed in Dan 4 and Ezek 17, that the kingdom of God would be like a great cedar of Lebanon planted in Jerusalem, but he said instead that “the kingdom of God is like…a weed, the mustard shrub.” Such a demeaning comparison of a big southern city must surely have earned a chuckle from northern rural folk.</p>
<p>Similarly with Jesus’ sayings about children, Ched Myers has drawn attention to the importance of the social status of children within the patriarchal household in the interpretation of this saying.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0040573613484753">16</xref></sup> An apocalyptic community such as Qumran created a strict priestly hierarchy in which priests were seated at the head of the table, and given first access to food and wine, but minors were excluded from entrance to the community (4Q266, fr. 8 i, 6–9).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0040573613484753">17</xref></sup> In Jerusalem, violent nationalism, which Josephus describes as influencing the “fourth philosophy” and the <italic>sicarii</italic> movement,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0040573613484753">18</xref></sup> held millennial and messianic hopes which provided the ideological basis for the zealot uprising of 66 <sc>ce</sc>. In these contexts, Jesus proposes that to inherit the kingdom, one must become like a small child, who holds as little honor or piety as military ability. Far from the piety of “childlike faith” that is often read into this text, the suggestion is farcical, and incomprehensible. Jesus makes his point by ridiculing the apocalyptic movement.</p>
<p>The effect of this satirical teaching is to say that the kingdom which the retaining class want to use as a futuristic and Jerusalem-based rhetorical tool against Rome becomes a temporally and spatially present possession of the poor. The language thus retained its anti-imperial force, and yet acquired a new anti-religious force. To find a way of speaking that resonates between such diverse cultures, bodies of literature, and worldviews is no small achievement. When such an achievement is carried out in the social context of a leader of a Galilean peasant movement, it suggests a kind of linguistic genius, who was able to build charismatic energy and frustrate opponents through a “slippery” turn of phrase.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0040573613484753"><title>Neurolinguistic Models of Comic Genius</title>
<p>Neurolinguist Steve Pinker has suggested that this kind of linguistic character trait should be understood as a genetic variation which is universal across the human species, and therefore found in all human cultures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0040573613484753">19</xref></sup> If linguistic ability is connected to brain function, but not intelligence, then Pinker argues that linguistic genius itself must be a genetic trait unconnected to intelligence, culture, or education. Some modern parallels he suggests are Yogi Berra (“It ain’t over till it’s over,” and “You can observe a lot by watching”), Shakespeare, Martin Luther King Jr., and Dr. Seuss, all of whom had linguistic skills (wit, poetry, inspirational political speech, clever children’s rhymes) that are idiosyncratic.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of a teacher who could teach people to laugh at the apocalyptic messages of Second Temple Judaism would have been no less than a complete dismantling of the apocalyptic worldview. Crossan has suggested as much when he observed how in material from both Jesus, and from the work of other authors who spoke in parable and paradox, like Jorge Louis Borges and Samuel Beckett, comedy’s function in literature is to reveal the playful structures of language—language that is too self-conscious to take itself seriously. Comic eschatology then is defined as the revelation of how eschatology works. He quotes the philosopher Stanley Cavell to similar effect, who pointed out that “salvation lies on reversing the story, dismantling Eschatology.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0040573613484753">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of more interest to the hypothesis I am suggesting is the kind of linguistic genius that is not only able to dismantle worldviews, but to dismantle ideological social structures, who is able to think of clever quips which stump the ideologue by subverting subtle and disempowering discourses. To take an extreme analogy, when members of Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) picketed Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters with their “God Hates Fags” campaign,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0040573613484753">21</xref></sup> absurdist protesters responded by standing next to WBC with parody signs such as “God Hates Flags,” “God Hates Kittens,” “I Have a Sign,” and “I Was Promised Donuts.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0040573613484753">22</xref></sup> A similar counter-protest was carried out when WBC held a “God Hates Nerds” campaign at Comic Con, with responses such as “God Hates Jedi,” “Is This Thing On?,” and “All Glory to the Hypnotoad.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0040573613484753">23</xref></sup> The (perhaps less than) subtle mimicking of extreme religious language effectively disempowered the signs of WBC because WBC’s strategy depends on the extreme nature of their message to shock people. Compared to the parody signs, the WBC signs no longer seemed extreme, and did not appear any more logical. For instance, it may not be prima facie obvious to a bystander which group made the “God Hates Nerds” sign. Alternatively, the “God Hates Kittens” sign seems more like a parody, but it is not at all clear why WBC shouldn’t believe that God hates kittens. At the same time, the parody signs enabled people in various social locations to regain control of certain discourses of which WBC had taken control: protesting, using slogans, and theologically imagining God’s emotions and attitudes towards certain groups of people.</p>
<p>In the context of Second Temple Judaism, Jesus’ apocalyptic-sounding kingdom aphorisms and Son of Man sayings, as well as his parables, function in a similar way to the parody signs: driving down an oppressive discourse by seizing control of its key methods, and using them more skillfully and creatively than their previous owners. Where the kingdom and the Son of Man had been tied into discourses of apocalyptic language that were wedded to political messiahs, cultic purity, and zealous, violent action, all of which were being used by the retaining class (priests and temple cult) in a nationalistic struggle against the Roman Empire, Jesus recaptured the central image of Judaistic thought on behalf of the peasants by insisting that the kingdom was like things that belong to the peasant class: weeds, mustard seeds, buildings, children, fishing nets, meals, and so on. His words were effective as a means of class struggle because they gave back to the peasant class possession of their own symbolic universe.</p>
