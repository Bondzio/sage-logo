<p>Dear Sirs,</p>
<p>Whether or not different types of vaccines should be administered is a frequent discussion between multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and their physicians, due to concern that immunizations may trigger disease exacerbations. In the case of influenza, there is no evidence so far of any deleterious effect or risk of MS onset or relapse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511417253">1</xref></sup> Of note, vaccine composition is modified seasonally to reflect changing circulating virus prevalence. After the new influenza A H1N1 virus emerged in April 2009, two vaccines were introduced in Argentina for prevention, a monovalent-type containing H1N1 strains only and a trivalent vaccine containing H1N1 together with relevant seasonal strains. The effects of this influenza immunization on MS exacerbation risk were unclear.</p>
<p>We searched in our MS patient database for patients with definite clinical diagnosis of relapsing–remitting MS according to Poser criteria who where regularly attending the clinic for scheduled follow-up visits every 3 months between 1 January and 31 December 2010. All relapses or signs of progression occurring during the observation period in the study population were retrieved from the database. Eligible patients were contacted via email and/or telephone and asked to complete a standardized questionnaire on exposure to immunizations during 2010. Patients and interviewers were unaware of the hypothesis being tested. Those who referred receiving a flu shot were asked to submit a copy of the immunization record specifying the type of vaccine received (monovalent Focetria, Novartis SRL, Italy or trivalent Istivac, Sanofi Pasteur, France). Patients who reported having received other types of immunizations during the observation period were excluded from the study.</p>
<p>A self-controlled case series method extensively used to evaluate the relationship between immunizations and various other conditions which only requires use of cases for same-patient comparison was selected for data analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511417253">2</xref></sup> The risk period chosen corresponded to a window lasting 30 days after influenza immunization and the non-risk period as the remaining follow-up time during 2010. Alternatively 60- and 90-day risk periods were considered. We then calculated relapse rates dividing the total number of exacerbations by the time contributed by each individual during the risk period and the remaining 11 months of follow up. A Poisson regression model was then used to estimate incidence rate ratio of MS exacerbations.</p>
<p>One hundred and sixty one relapsing–remitting MS patients were identified from the database. A total of 23 patients refused to participate and 2 patients had received other immunizations, leaving 137 as finally included. Patients excluded did not differ significantly from those included. Sixty patients received immunization against H1N1 (44%); of these, 49 received trivalent (82%) and 11 received monovalent vaccine (18%). Mean age of this group was 37 ± 8 years, and median disease duration 3 years (range of 1–17 years). Seventy-three per cent of patients were under treatment with IFN-beta, 25% with glatiramer acetate and 2% received no treatment. There were no differences in these variables between vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts.</p>
<p>The 60 vaccinated patients suffered a total of 28 relapses during 2010, with an annual exacerbation rate of 0.47. To assess whether immunization with H1N1 produced an immediate increase in risk of relapse, we first evaluated a risk period of 30 days following immunization. We found an individual relapse ratio of 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.2–3.6, <italic>p</italic> = 0.836) comparing risk periods lasting 30 days with non-risk periods. We then added 60- and 90-day periods for more delayed effects but found equal results (relapse ratio of 0.61, 95% CI 0.2–2.0 for 60 days and relapse rate ratio of 0.51, 95% CI 0.2–1.5 for 90 days). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458511417253">Table 1</xref> summarizes these findings.</p>

<p>Our findings are in line with results published for other seasonal influenza vaccines. Myers and colleagues performed the first double-blind placebo-controlled trial of influenza immunization in MS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511417253">3</xref></sup> in which 33 patients were immunized with a bivalent Victoria A–New Jersey A vaccine and 33 patients received placebo. The authors concluded that vaccination was safe based on the fact that over a 3-month follow-up, both groups had the same number of relapses. A multicenter, randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial was performed 20 years later by Miller and colleagues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511417253">4</xref></sup> They reported no differences between a vaccine-treated group and a placebo group after 1 and 6 months follow-up. Finally, a multicenter case-crossover study in Europe by Confavreux et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511417253">5</xref></sup> including 643 MS patients −23 of whom received influenza vaccination-, evaluated the effect of several immunizations on risk of relapse and found no association.</p>
<p>We could only find one study specifically addressing H1N1 immunization in MS patients. The study by McNicholas and Chataway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511417253">6</xref></sup> reports a surprisingly high relative risk of 6.00 (95% CI 1.4–26.2) within 3 weeks of receiving the vaccine. To note, only 15 patients were immunized and they were only followed for 2 months. Reasons for the discrepancy with our results can be explained by different study designs, the shorter follow-up time in their study and variations in manufacturing and composition of the vaccine used in the different countries.</p>
<p>The design chosen for this study, the self-controlled case series, is an efficient method to study the effect of transient exposures, such as vaccines, on MS relapse rate, since it only needs to analyze the cases and implicitly controls for fixed confounders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511417253">2</xref></sup> The model requires certain assumptions to be made: (a) the probability of exposure should not be affected by the outcome event; and (b) event timing should be variable. Both of these conditions were met in this study. In addition, recall bias can constitute an issue, since patients may provide inaccurate dates of immunization or may recall being immunized only when vaccination occurred close to time of clinical relapse. To avoid this, immunization certificates were requested; also, patients were unaware of the hypothesis being tested, and we believe these measures made recall bias negligible.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results showed no association between H1N1 immunization and increased exacerbation rate in MS. Therefore, this vaccine appears to be safe for MS patients in the short term and can be administered when required.</p>
