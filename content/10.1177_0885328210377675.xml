<abstract>
<p>In critical-size bone defects, autologous or allogenic cells are required in addition to compatible biomaterials for the successful defect healing. State of the art inoculation methods of biomaterials are based on the application of cell suspensions to the biomaterial. However, only less amounts of cells can be applied and sufficient adhesion to the material is required. Therefore, it was investigated whether the advantages of stem cell-based microspheres and insoluble collagenous bone matrix (ICBM) scaffolds can be combined which can lead to an advancement in cell seeding on biomaterials. Microspheres were produced from unrestricted somatic stem cells from human umbilical cord blood and were mounted on ICBM scaffolds. Following the incubation with osteogenic or control medium, the constructs were analyzed histologically after 3, 7, 14, and 28 days. Alizarin Red S and von Kossa staining revealed microsphere mineralization after 3 days in osteogenic and after 14 days in control medium. Meanwhile, a time-dependent increase in tissue, growing out of the microspheres, was detected. Our results provide evidence that microsphere–ICBM constructs are promising candidates for approaches of bone regeneration. They allow the transfer of substantially high numbers of cells in partially mineralized constructs.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0885328210377675" sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Bone defects that are caused by trauma or tumor resection often need to be reconstructed in order to restore functionality and form. Yet, the repair of such defects remains difficult leaving clinicians struggling with severe problems. The choice for a suitable technique is difficult since there is a wide range of artificial and natural scaffolds available, including metals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328210377675">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328210377675">2</xref>], cements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328210377675">3</xref>], polymers [4–6], decalcified bone matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328210377675">7</xref>], and others.</p>
<p>Beside the choice for a natural or a synthetic material, the question arises whether in addition to these scaffolds osteogenic cells are included or not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328210377675">8</xref>]. The applicability of cells is indeed difficult as they need to be immunocompatible. For the healing of critical-size defects, the application of cell-scaffold constructs or autologous bone transplants is essential. As the amount of autologous bone is restricted and the use of autologous transplants is associated with the risk of comorbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328210377675">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328210377675">10</xref>], artificial or biological scaffolds combined with cells are promising alternatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328210377675">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328210377675">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Various <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies were performed to evaluate the cell behavior on a number of artificial or biological scaffold materials [12–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328210377675">14</xref>]. One biomaterial with promising characteristics and a superior biocompatibility <italic>in vitro</italic> over deproteinized bovine bone (BioOss), β-tricalciumphosphate scaffolds, and collagen sponges is insoluble collagenous bone matrix (ICBM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328210377675">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328210377675">15</xref>]. Furthermore, ICBM showed good biocompatibility <italic>in vivo</italic> and to bone formation when implanted with predifferentiated human unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328210377675">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Multipotent USSCs are isolated from human umbilical cord blood and are able to differentiate in cells of all three germ layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328210377675">17</xref>]. Furthermore, the immunological characterization of these cells at the José Carreras Stem Cell Bank (Düsseldorf) allows HLA-matching. Notwithstanding recent findings that indicate HLA-matching is not mandatory, USSCs are tolerated by host immune system [18–20]. A basically different approach that does not require the use of a scaffold is available with the application of microsphere technology. Microspheres are produced by combining approximately 1.8 × 10<sup>5</sup> stem cells within a single sphere. The main advantage of this technique is that an extracellular matrix is built by the cells themselves, which resembles <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions more closely than those present in monolayer cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328210377675">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328210377675">22</xref>]. When USSCs are used for the microspheres, they can be osteogenically differentiated, resulting in strong mineralization of the sphere after 1 week.</p>
<p>In this study we apply microsphere technique with ICBM scaffolds to investigate whether the combination of both techniques shows synergistic effects. Earlier, we demonstrated that the use of a combination of dexamethasone, ascorbic acid, and β-glycerol phosphate (DAG) appears to be more potent in inducing osteogenic differentiation than stimulation with BMP-2 alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328210377675">23</xref>]; thus the application of DAG is the method of choice in this study. We found that microspheres that were seeded on ICBM scaffolds mineralized and at the same time allowed cells to migrate to the periphery. Interestingly, only those cells that were present in the microsphere led to mineralization, whereas none of the cells which migrated into the periphery promoted any mineralization process.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0885328210377675"><title>Culture of USSCs and Preparation of Microspheres</title>
<p>USSCs were kindly provided by the José Carreras Stammzellbank, Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf, Germany. The cells were isolated from cord blood with the informed consent of the mother and subsequently cultivated according to a standardized protocol published by Kögler et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328210377675">17</xref>]; meanwhile, they were also available as GMP grade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328210377675">24</xref>]. Briefly, Ficoll (Biochrom) gradient centrifugation was used to isolate the mononuclear cell fraction. Cells were plated out at 5–7 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL on T25 culture flasks (Costar) in low glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Cambrex), supplemented with 30% Fetal Calf Serum (Pan Biotech), dexamethasone (10<sup>−7</sup> M; Sigma–Aldrich), penicillin (100 U/mL; Grünenthal), streptomycin (100 mg/mL; Hefa-pharm), and ultraglutamine (2 mM; Cambrex). For the following expansion of the cells, dexamethasone was left out from the medium formulation. Cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The cells were split when confluency reached 80% by detaching the cells with 0.25% trypsin (Lonza) and replating them in the ratio 1 : 3.</p>
<p>Microspheres were produced as described by Langenbach et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328210377675">22</xref>]. Briefly, cells of a well-characterized USSC line (female) were detached from the plate, centrifuged, and resuspended in normal growth medium (1 Mio Cells/mL). A microsphere-assembly-unit was prepared by filling 60 μL solution consisting of 2% agarose (Biozyme) in DMEM (without any supplements) into 96-well plates. Subsequently, each well was filled with 180 μL (1.8 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells) of the cell suspension. Due to the concave surface of the hydro-gel (caused by capillary actions), the cells congregated at the center of the well and formed a sphere within 1 day.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0885328210377675"><title>Preparation and Inoculation of ICBM</title>
<p>Slices (1 cm thick) of bovine femur spongiosa were defatted by three washing steps (24 h each) with Chloroform–Methanol solution (3 : 1; Merck). After a washing step in aqua dest for 30 min, the slices were bleached with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (3%; Merck) for 15 min and were washed again in aqua dest. The bone was demineralized by three washing steps with 0.5 M HCl (Merck) for 90 min respectively. Disks with a diameter of 10 mm and a height of 5 mm were cut and incubated in 4 M Guanidine–HCl/50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) (Merck) for 16 h at 4°C. The cylinders were incubated with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0)/0.15 M NaCl (Merck) for 4 h at 4°C and were washed once more with aqua dest for 30 min. For sterilization, the ICBMs were incubated in 70% ethanol (Merck) and washed three times in PBS. Dry ICBMs were placed in 12-well plates and 2 mL normal growth medium or normal growth medium supplemented with DAG (100 nM dexamethasone, 50 μM ascorbic acid, and 10 mM β-glycerophosphate; all from Sigma) was added. Each ICBM was inoculated with five microspheres. In this process, the microspheres sink into the ICBM and remain in the pores of the spongiosa scaffold. The specimens were incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and medium was changed every 3 days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0885328210377675"><title>Histology</title>
<p>After 3, 7, 14, and 28 days, four constructs of each treatment group were fixated in 4% formalin and incubated over night at 4°C. The scaffolds were dehydrated in increasing ethanol concentrations for 1 day per concentration and were subsequently incubated two times for 1 day in xylol (Merck). The samples were embedded in the low-temperature embedding system, Technovit 9100 (Heraeus Kulzer), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the specimens were pre-infiltrated with Xylol/Technovit 9100 basic solution (stabilized) followed by pre-infiltration in stabilized basic solution (containing catalyst 1) and by pre-infiltration in destabilized basic solution (containing catalyst 1) each for 1 day at 4°C. For the final infiltration, the samples were incubated for 3 days at 4°C in infiltration solution (basic solution (destabilized)) with catalyst 1 and PMMA). The final embedding solution consisted of 90% solution A and 10% solution B and was mixed immediately prior to the polymerization. The specimens were placed in the polymerization mold and the mixed embedding solution was added carefully. For the polymerization of the specimens, the airtight closed molds were stored at −4°C for 24 h, transferred to 4°C for 1 h and finally stored at room temperature (RT).</p>

<sec id="sec6-0885328210377675"><title>Sectioning and Deacrylation</title>
<p>Sections (8 µm) were prepared with an electronic rotary microtome (Hyrax M55, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH). The sections were stretched on superfrost plus slides, which had been precoated with a mixture of two parts ponal-solution (2% in aqua dest) and one part poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine-solution (0.01%) for 10 min. The sections were covered with polyethylene foil and pressed with a slide-press for 12 h at 50°C.</p>
<p>The slides were deacrylated by incubation with 2-methoxyethylacetate (Sigma) two times for 20 min at RT, followed by incubation in xylol two times for 5 min. After rehydration in decreasing ethanol concentrations, the slides were ready for histochemical staining.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0885328210377675"><title>Histological Stainings</title>
<p>The hemalaum-eosin (H/E) staining was used to stain nuclei blue, cytoplasm red, and intercellular substance pink. The deacrylated and rehydrated sections were incubated in Mayer’s hemalaum solution (Merck) for 3 min and were subsequently exposed to 0.1% HCl for 2 s. After washing with aqua dest, the sections were stained with Giemsa’s azur eosin methylene blue solution (Merck) for 2 min and washed again.</p>
<p>For the Alizarin Red S staining, the sections were incubated in 2% Alizarin Red S (pH: 4.5) and washed in aqua dest. Alizarin Red S stains divalent cations like calcium and magnesium, whereas von Kossa staining is specific for calcium only. Calcium ions are replaced by silver ions, which are reduced to metallic silver under the influence of light. Rehydrated sections were incubated with silver nitrate solution (5%) and exposed to daylight for 15 min. After washing with aqua dest for 5 min, the sections were incubated in sodiumthiosulfate solution (2%). After washing with aqua dest for 5 min, nuclei were stained with nuclear fast red solution.</p>
<p>In order to demonstrate the nuclei more clearly, cells were stained with the DNA intercalating dye Bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33342). The sections were incubated with bisbenzimide (20 µg/mL aqua dest) in the dark and washed three times with aqua dest for 5 min.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0885328210377675"><title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="sec9-0885328210377675"><title>Cellular Distribution Inside the ICBM</title>
<p>H/E staining was performed to localize the microsphere (approximately 0.9 mm in diameter) in the scaffold and to investigate the outgrowth of cells out of the microspheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328210377675">Figure 1</xref>). A time-dependent increase in the amount of tissue, derived from the cells that grew out of the microspheres, was found. The shape of the microsphere remained visible in the newly formed tissue, due to a denser cellular network compared to the outgrown cells (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328210377675">Figure 1</xref>). Cells growing out of the microsphere were found to fill up spaces between the microsphere and the trabeculae of the spongiosa as well as spaces between adjacent trabeculae. Furthermore, the cells grew alongside the trabeculae in a thin cell layer.

<p>In order to demonstrate the nuclei more clearly, the cells were stained with the DNA intercalating dye bisbenzimide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328210377675">Figure 2</xref>). It was found that the amount of stained nuclei decreased with time of incubation inside the microsphere. Furthermore, the numbers of nuclei in the periphery of the microspheres had decreased compared to the center after 28 days in DAG-treated microspheres (inlay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328210377675">Figure 2</xref>).

<sec id="sec10-0885328210377675"><title>Mineralization of Microspheres</title>
<p>An overview of microsphere mineralization is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328210377675">Table 1</xref>. Alizarin Red S was used to demonstrate mineralization in the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328210377675">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328210377675">4</xref>, middle column). It was found that osteogenically differentiated microspheres start to mineralize after 3 days in culture and were completely mineralized after 28 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328210377675">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, also the control microspheres mineralized spontaneously after 14 days in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328210377675">Figure 4</xref>). Thereby, the localizations of the mineralization showed different starting points of mineralization inside of the microspheres. Whereas the mineralization in the control microspheres started from the center, the microspheres in osteogenic medium mineralized from their periphery to the interior of the sphere. Mineralization of the cells that grew out of the microspheres could not be detected at any time in both cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328210377675">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328210377675">4</xref>).

<p>Since Alizarin Red S stain detects not only calcium in calcium phosphate but also calcium-binding proteins and proteoglycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328210377675">25</xref>], a von Kossa stain was used in addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328210377675">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328210377675">4</xref>, right columns). The von Kossa staining, however, is also not specific for calcium phosphate as it detects also anions like carbonate and sulfate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328210377675">26</xref>]. Therefore it is suggested that Alizarin Red staining is used in combination with von Kossa staining. The chronological sequence in the mineralization-process was similar to that observed in the Alizarin Red S staining. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328210377675">Figure 3</xref>, the mineralization of DAG incubated microspheres is visible at day 3 as brown/dark staining of the tissue. Again, the mineralization in the control groups is visible after 14 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328210377675">Figure 4</xref>). However, von Kossa staining also did not confirm mineralization of the outgrown tissue.</p>

<sec id="sec11-0885328210377675"><title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Due to the superior characteristics of ICBM for bone tissue engineering and the advantages of the microsphere technology, these two techniques were used in combination. The main advantage of microspheres lies in their ability to synthesize extracellular matrix, thereby sharing more characteristics with the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation, compared to monolayer culture techniques. Furthermore, microspheres were shown to mineralize within a few days and therefore they rapidly gain stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328210377675">22</xref>].</p>
<p>A time-dependent increase in the amount of tissue, which consists of cells that were grown out of microspheres, was found, albeit a dense cellular meshwork, indicating that the shape of the microspheres remained visible. The cells that had grown out of the microspheres partially filled the regions between the microsphere and the trabeculae of the spongiosa as well as the spaces between the adjacent trabeculae.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the incubation, cells are inhomogenously distributed over the complete scaffolds. However, longer the scaffold–microsphere constructs are incubated, more cells proliferate and more parts of the scaffolds are colonized with cells. Using more microspheres which are more homogenous distributed in the scaffold could improve the uniformity of the cell distribution in the scaffold and accelerate the filling of the scaffold with cells.</p>
<p>It was found that the mineralization of the tissue was restricted to the microspheres. A reason for the absence of tissue mineralization outside of the microspheres could be the lower cell density in the periphery. Wilson et al. demonstrated that during cell proliferation, osteogenic differentiation is restricted or inhibited and that higher seeding densities resulted in increased bone formation <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328210377675">27</xref>]. Furthermore, low cell seeding densities led to a lower proportion of osteocalcin positive tissue compared to higher cell seeding densities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328210377675">28</xref>]. Additionally, as a consequence of high cell densities, the expression of the important osteogenic regulatory factor RUNX2 (runt related nuclear transcription factor 2) as well as the transcription of osteonectin (secreted protein, acidic, cystein rich – SPARC) was up-regulated <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328210377675">29</xref>].</p>
<p>The spontaneous differentiation of cells inside the microsphere supports the hypothesis that high cell densities support osteogenesis. Another reason for the spontaneous differentiation may be the intercommunication of the cells and the interaction of the cells with the extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328210377675">22</xref>]. The cells interact with the ECM via integrins on the cell surface. These integrins bind to the ECM proteins and signal bi-directionally across the plasma membrane. Thereby, they influence many important cellular processes, like proliferation, migration, and gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885328210377675">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885328210377675">31</xref>]. The <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis and deposition of ECM proteins by mesenchymal stem cells were shown to change the chemical identity of the substrate materials as well as the integrin expression and signal transduction to influence osteogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885328210377675">32</xref>]. It was demonstrated that the adhesion to collagen type I initiates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. The MAPK cascade plays a critical role in the osteogenic differentiation by activating the RUNX2 transcription activator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885328210377675">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885328210377675">34</xref>].</p>
<p>Another evidence for the importance of ECM proteins in osteogenic differentiation was previously provided by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328210377675">15</xref>]. The expression of osteonectin, a matrix associated protein influences the synthesis of ECM proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885328210377675">35</xref>], as well as of collagen type I by USSC on different biomaterials, was investigated. We found an increased expression of osteonectin on collagen type I sponges, compared to other biomaterials. Knockout studies in mice provided evidence for the functional relation between collagen type I and osteonectin. Collagen type I production was significantly reduced in osteonectin knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885328210377675">36</xref>] and osteonectin deposition was significantly down regulated in collagen type I deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885328210377675">37</xref>]. In addition, we found that an increase in expression of collagen type I correlated with an increase in expression of osteonectin. The contact of microspheres to ICBM, however, is not the reason for the spontaneous differentiation. Since in a previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328210377675">22</xref>] mineralization was detected in control microspheres which were grown without ICBM scaffold, it is unlikely that mineralization is induced by the ICBM in this study.</p>
<p>Differences in the starting points of microsphere mineralization can be explained by different levels of accessibility of the cells to osteogenic stimuli. The control microspheres start to differentiate spontaneously from the center of the microsphere, where they reach highest cell densities and probably the highest amount of self-synthesized osteogenic stimuli.</p>
<p>In contrast, in the DAG-treated group, the osteogenic stimulation is mainly provided by the DAG in the medium. Furthermore, the osteogenic stimulation of the cells in the center of the microspheres depends on a sufficient transfer of the medium to the center of the microsphere. Presumably, a lack of diffusion, caused by the tight cell layers in the periphery of the microsphere, accounts for the differences in mineralization.</p>
<p>Comparing cell-seeding strategies, which use the application of cell suspensions or rely on the colonization by cells of a cellular monolayer on which a biomaterial is placed, the cell transfer through microspheres represents an advancement. In earlier experiments, we demonstrated that the amount of cells that could be applied on an ICBM was restricted when cell suspensions were used for inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328210377675">15</xref>]. When a cell suspension of 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells was applied on ICBM, with the same size used in this study (∼0.4 cm<sup>3</sup>), only about 0.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells adhered to the scaffolds. Compared to this, 1.8 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells were applied to an ICBM with the implantation of a single microsphere. In this study 9 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells were added per ICBM; however, more than 10 microspheres can be implanted per ICBM. Using this technique, a 40-fold higher cell load on a single ICBM is feasible, compared to inoculation with cell suspensions. In future experiments, we could try to further improve the presented constructs by using more microspheres with a smaller size. This could contribute to a more uniform cell distribution inside the microspheres that could be advantageous for the use <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, the positive effects of the extracellular matrix could unfold their potential at more places inside the scaffold, and also the mineralization would be more homogenously distributed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0885328210377675"><title>CONCLUSION</title>
<p>ICBM is an excellent carrier for considerably high amounts of cells and is therefore a promising means for approaches for bone regeneration. With the help of microspheres, cell numbers that can be added to biomaterials exceed by far the numbers in current applications using cell suspensions. Furthermore, the application of microspheres accelerates the mineralization of the biomaterial–cell construct and in addition resembles <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions more than in current applications. Therefore the combination of microspheres with ICBM has substantial advantages available for highly efficient engineering of cell–biomaterial constructs.</p>
