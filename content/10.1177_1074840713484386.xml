<abstract>
<p>This study explored (a) parents’ process of changes and challenges in their patterns of daily activities after the onset of diabetes in their children; and (b) how personal gender relations can restrain or create functional strategies for managing the changes and challenges of illness. Interviews were conducted with 21 mothers and 15 fathers of 23 children with type 1 diabetes 8 to 10 months after onset. Using a constant comparative analysis method, the core category depicts how the illness forced parents to <italic>reconstruct their family project</italic> with respect to patterns of daily activities and gender structures. The emerging subcategories of <italic>reinforced mothering</italic> and <italic>adjusted fathering</italic> illustrate the parents’ effort to handle contemporary and contradictory demands. With increased knowledge of the dynamics of gender relations of families in the context of a child’s illness, health care professionals can assist in promoting well-being and functional strategies in families when a child is newly diagnosed with diabetes.</p>

<p>For parents, the onset of diabetes in childhood implies a learning process for managing insulin and dietary adjustments in relation to their child’s current glycemic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1074840713484386">Wennick &amp; Hallström, 2006</xref>). Studies have shown that diabetes onset and initial treatments are associated with elevated levels of stress in both parents, initially and in the long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1074840713484386">Landolt, Vollrath, Laimbacher, Gnehm, &amp; Sennhauser, 2005</xref>). A greater severity of general psychological symptoms in mothers than in fathers has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1074840713484386">Kovacs et al., 1990</xref>). These studies indicate that following an acute stress reaction at the time of diagnosis, mothers’ stress slowly increases again, which may have long-term implications for the family system. Especially mothers of younger children with diabetes have been shown to experience higher levels of stress due to the demands of managing diabetes treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1074840713484386">Grey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840713484386">Sullivan-Bolyai et al., 2003</xref>). Several studies have shown that glycemic control in children with diabetes is associated with the degree of parent-perceived family burden and parent well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840713484386">Hoey, 2009</xref>); parent involvement and concordance in the responsibility of diabetes management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1074840713484386">Anderson, Ho, Brackett, Finkelstein, &amp; Laffel, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1074840713484386">Cameron et al., 2008</xref>); and family dynamics, such as diabetes-related conflicts and compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074840713484386">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>). These studies that examine the impact of the diabetes in families can be viewed as problem oriented, usually exploring negative effects.</p>
<p>The effects of diabetes onset in a child on the family may be twofold. Besides the stress related to direct treatment of the child’s illness, the diabetes-related tasks impact on families’ orchestration of daily activities, irrespective of the child’s age. If the diabetes onset occurs in older children, the families may be expected to have well-established family routines, that is, a stable pattern of daily activities. However, the effect may be just as large in families with preschool children since this has been identified as a critical stage for the construction of routines in daily activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1074840713484386">Systema, Kelley, &amp; Wymer, 2001</xref>). Routines are embedded activities that promote close family relationships and have been found to be maintained during family crisis in resilient families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1074840713484386">Black &amp; Lobo, 2008</xref>). The need of new routines for multiple daily insulin injections and blood glucose check-ups can both lead to satisfactory disease control and undermine the experience of traditional parenting tasks. Thus it is evident that the need to introduce specific routines associated with diabetes’ onset may impact well-established structures and patterns in families’ daily lives. Each individual pattern of daily activities among family members is connected and integrated and parents develop roles and responsibilities in relation to different activities and routines in the care of their children. However, in families with a child experiencing diabetes, this is associated with specific needs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1074840713484386">Wennick, Lundqvist, and Hallström (2009)</xref> found that even if the illness had become a natural element of the family’s life 3 years after a child was diagnosed, it still affected the daily life of family members to different degrees. Furthermore, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1074840713484386">Marshall, Carter, Rose, and Brotherton (2009)</xref> reported that both children and parents strived to regain an ordinary life after the onset of diabetes. Applying an adaption perspective rather than only using an impact perspective when studying families experiencing illness focuses attention on the parents’ experiences of changes and on the management of the illness and strategies for coping.</p>
<p>Despite an increasingly equal division of responsibilities between parents in heterosexual two-parent families in Sweden, mothers still spend more time than fathers caring for children and family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1074840713484386">Statistics Sweden, 2003</xref>). In families where children have diabetes, mothers have been found to take greater responsibility for child care than fathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1074840713484386">Ross, Frier, Kelnar, &amp; Deary, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1074840713484386">Wennick &amp; Hallström, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, irrespective of marital status, mothers often have a so-called double burden, whereby in addition to paid work, they have the lead responsibility at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1074840713484386">Krantz &amp; Östergren, 2001</xref>). This in turn creates a high complexity in women’s everyday life and studies have shown that women who are regularly interrupted in their chores and have many parallel activities simultaneously risk experiencing poorer health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1074840713484386">Erlandsson &amp; Eklund, 2006</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1074840713484386">Windebank (2001)</xref> has, for example, questioned the somewhat one-sided perspectives regarding the relationship between women’s greater participation in employment and men’s greater participation in domestic and parenting work. Although gender inequality is still a reality across Western societies, men are now more expected to have more responsibility in domestic life and care of children, indicating that men from different generations, ethnicities, and social classes have shown a transformative process in gender relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1074840713484386">Aboim, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1074840713484386">Williams, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840713484386">Elwin-Nowak and Thomsson (2001)</xref> found that employed mothers in Sweden create an ideological bridge between women and mother roles, based on assumptions on child-centeredness. The authors argue that this is a way for women to conform to the cultural discourse of gender equality that dominates the Swedish society.</p>
<p>As gender patterns emerge in human encounters, the current gender order may have implications for how parents manage changes and challenges after the onset of diabetes in their child. Depending on the demands and capabilities of the individual, the family, and the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1074840713484386">Patterson, 2002</xref>), challenges in families can be experienced as both positive and negative. If the individual or a couple have the capacity to alter aspects of their everyday life and roles, a need for change might be experienced as just the right challenge. If the situation however already is complex and the individuals lack competences for alterations, the need for alternative strategies might be an overwhelming task. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840713484386">Connell (2002)</xref> claims that the development and acquirement of the prevailing gender order is an active process in which people learn how to manage such structures and is thus constructed depending on contextual conditions. Gender relations are present in specific situations in which people improvise, imitate, and create certain strategies and thus progress by learning in their own way. If those strategies are successful, they can become more stable and subsequently form an internalized pattern of effeminacy and masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840713484386">Connell, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, there is a growing body of research regarding diabetes in childhood in relation to family functioning and parenthood. Yet few studies have involved both mothers and fathers. The gradually emerging shift in gender relations with respect to the allocation of domestic responsibility in patterns of daily activities among families can be expected to continue and develop. How such contemporary gender patterns are constructed and connected to changes related to the diabetes management in families appears to be an understudied area. Enhanced knowledge can assist professionals to support families with a child recently diagnosed with diabetes.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to explore parents’ process of changes and challenges in their patterns of daily activities after the onset of diabetes in a child. A further aim was to explore how personal gender relations can restrain or create functional strategies for managing these changes and challenges during the process of adapting to a chronic illness of a child.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-1074840713484386">
<title>Design and Theoretical Frameworks</title>
<p>This study was initially inspired by a grounded theory (GT) approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074840713484386">Charmaz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1074840713484386">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>). To explore the process of changes and challenges and how parents handle these challenges is congruent with the methodological assumptions of GT. During the concurrent data collection and analysis, our focus increasingly became directed toward exploring how varied gender patterns emerged in the parents’ experiences and ways of managing the challenges of their child’s chronic illness. This led us to search for analytic tools that could assist in exploring such emerging patterns. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1074840713484386">Corbin (2008)</xref> points out the possibility, even in a GT approach, of using a previously developed framework to complement, extend, and verify emerging findings. In keeping with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840713484386">Connell (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1074840713484386">Dale and Rake (2003)</xref>, we acknowledge gender to be a key dimension of private life and social relations and gender relations to be complex phenomenon. A relational approach to gender includes how social practice is organized on the societal level as well as in personal life and in the interaction between humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840713484386">Connell, 2002</xref>). We found that a relational approach to gender was appropriate for guiding the analysis of emerging gender structures. Dimensions of gender relations include power relations, implying subordination/dominance in relations; production relations, in terms of task allocation due to gender division of work and domestic tasks; emotional relations, in terms of emotional energy attached to an object; and symbolic relations, being the processes of communication as vital elements of social structures and important sites of gender practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840713484386">Connell, 2002</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1074840713484386">
<title>Recruitment and Sample</title>
<p>Parents were recruited prospectively from participants in a randomized controlled trial evaluating home- versus hospital-based diabetes care in relation to the onset of diabetes in the child. A detailed description of the trial can be found in the article of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1074840713484386">Tiberg, Carlsson, and Hallström (2011)</xref>. In brief, children in the intervention group were, after 2 to 3 days in hospital-based care, moved to a home-based setting within the hospital area for continued specialist care. This care included a homelike environment, individualized learning, and increased access to a diabetes nurse during admission and after discharge. The children in the control group stayed in hospital-based care for a total of 1 to 2 weeks. Parents from both intervention and control groups were prospectively asked to participate and further variation was obtained by choosing married/cohabiting and divorced mothers and fathers. Ethical approval was received by The Regional Ethical Review Board and included participation in the trial as well as in subsequent interviews.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1074840713484386">
<title>Procedure for Data Collection</title>
<p>Informed consent for participation in the interviews was obtained in relation to a 6-month follow-up after the onset of diabetes. Written and verbal information were provided to confirm voluntary participation and guarantee confidentiality. Interviews were thereafter conducted between June 2009 and October 2010, 8 to 10 months after the child’s diabetes onset. The first author, experienced in qualitative interview techniques, conducted all interviews. Thirty-seven parents of 24 children were asked to participate in interviews. One family declined to participate due to lack of time. For information on age, educational level, social class, and family situation of the 36 parents involved and their children, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1074840713484386">Table 1</xref>. To facilitate the families’ situations, the interviews were mainly conducted in the parents’ homes. For practical purposes, two interviews occurred in a private area within the hospital. All participants were interviewed once. The interviews were conducted separately and guided by open-ended questions, including “Can you describe changes in the family’s daily life after your child was diagnosed with diabetes?” “Can you describe any challenges due to the diabetes onset?” and “How do you handle these changes and challenges?” Supportive questions such as “What do you think?” “What do you mean?” “Could you explain?” were posed during the interviews to obtain detailed descriptions. Subsequent questions focused on cooperation between the parents, and whether or not they were living together. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The median interview duration was 45 min (range, 20-65 min).</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Qualitative analysis was conducted, consistent with principles for constant comparative analysis developed in the GT tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074840713484386">Charmaz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1074840713484386">Corbin, 2008</xref>). The interviews and preliminary analyses were conducted simultaneously by the principal investigator, thereby directing further data collection and sampling strategies along the way. The initial coding of the transcripts from 20 interviews was conducted by two of the authors, that is, labelling sentences, paragraphs, and incidents in active tense to determine how participants expressed challenges and strategies to handle these. When searching for relations between these preliminary categories, an emerging process of challenges and activities evolved, which involved all authors. In the remaining 16 interviews, more focused coding was conducted. This included constant comparison with previous initial coding (of the first 20 interviews); verification and expansion of existing categories; and exploration of the properties and dimensions of the categories. This phase was performed on a more conceptual level although the transcripts and initial coding were referenced to ensure reliability, that is, analysis being grounded in data. This phase also comprised the analysis of how personal gender relations evolved during the process.</p>
<p>Credibility was assured throughout the concurrent data collection and analysis as emerging findings, documented in memos, were explored in future interviews and could thus assist in verifying the emerging pattern. Sharing and discussing the data, codes, and emerging categories with all authors verified the reliability of the generated substantive theory. Acknowledging that three female researchers might influence interpretation of gender patterns, a male ethnologist and one gender researcher were recruited to independently scrutinize the analysis.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section6-1074840713484386">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>The findings are presented as a process of change and challenges in parents’ daily patterns of activities following the onset of diabetes in a child, where the core category constitutes the overall meaning of this process: a <italic>reconstruction of their family project</italic>. Many of the parents explained their reactions and actions by referring to typical female/male behavior, thus conforming to traditional gender norms. However, these differences could sometimes be perceived as assisting in the adaptation to new conditions after the onset of diabetes in their child. Dimensions of how gender relations were constructed during this process are depicted in the categories of <italic>reinforced mothering</italic> and <italic>adjusted fathering</italic>. For an overview of the core category and its related categories (italics) and dimensions (bold) see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1074840713484386">Figure 1</xref>. The findings are illustrated by quotes from participants, labeled as “Mother” or “Father” and the order of interview (e.g., 13).</p>

<title>Core Category: Reconstructing The Family Project</title>
<p>The core category of reconstructing the family project provides an overall interpretation of the descriptions and implications of the changes and challenges in patterns of daily activities following a child’s onset of diabetes. The concept of family project assumes a fulfillment of responsibility in issues that are vitally needed and are not provided in other social arrangements. This means that parents share a common project, for example, the everyday life of the family, and it involves parents’ compensatory and/or protective actions within a system with the overall goal of responding to the needs of their common children. The reconstruction process implied that the parents had to reconsider their former daily pattern to adjust to all new daily routines and activities related to diabetes management:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Mother:</speaker>
<p>“No, I probably won’t be able to work again,” this was a thought which crossed my mind sometimes and “how will I have time to work and concentrate on a job, I probably won’t have time for that any more” so it was a strange kind of feeling, that I will only be able to work very little in that case. (19)</p>
</speech>
<p>This process was present regardless of the family structure, that is, whether the parents were living together or not. Although the term family project means sharing a common issue, which demands a type of partnership between the parents, the reconstruction of the family project after the onset of diabetes seemed to have brought a renaissance of commonality between the mother and father even though they did not live together as a couple. Parents could feel strengthened by considering diabetes as their common project in which they had the same objective, namely, to make the best of the situation for their child:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Mother:</speaker>
<p>Our son’s diabetes has probably brought us closer again. Because we talk to each other more often and keep in touch through it . . . //<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1074840713484386">1</xref></sup> so it has been both a positive and negative experience. (31)</p>
</speech>
<sec id="section8-1074840713484386">
<title>Reconsidering daily pattern</title>
<p>Previously settled patterns of daily activities in the families had to be reconsidered and new strategies developed to manage daily life after the onset of diabetes. Insights on the irrevocable change created by diabetes often appeared immediately, while some parents only later realized that diabetes would be a lifelong companion. One considerable change was the need to adjust daily routines in relation to food. This was experienced as more or less burdensome depending on the family’s preexisting habits, but mothers seemed far more occupied with this issue. Families with regular meals could more easily adapt to managing diabetes in relation to food. The reconsideration of dietary habits ranged from greater awareness of personal health and improved diet to nonapparent imperative restrictions and limitations. Strategies to handle the changes included avoiding undesirable ingredients (e.g., food from cafés etc.) and approaching food and insulin adjustments with estimations instead of calculations. A common goal for both mothers and fathers was to balance the needs of different family members and to minimize the restrictions to achieve normality in daily meals:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Father:</speaker>
<p>We try to live as normal lives as possible. After all, there are five family members. And then we try to accommodate this so as to make the most out of the situation. I believe that her needs should be taken care of and the others have needs as well. (4)</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1074840713484386">
<title>Regaining control</title>
<p>Another considerable challenge after the onset of diabetes was the feeling of having lost control over daily life. The previously developed parental skills were not always sufficient for safeguarding the child’s health and well-being. This included difficulties in identifying abnormal behavior due to unstable blood glucose and distinguishing between symptoms and general tiredness:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Father:</speaker>
<p>And it’s the same whenever we drive somewhere . . . Well, children fall asleep in the car. Then you have to be extra vigilant and ask her—how are you? If she doesn’t reply we have to stop and check on her. (2)</p>
</speech>
<p>A constant evaluation of experiences and actions assisted the parents in regaining control of patterns of daily activities. Some parents felt dependent on monitoring blood glucose, while others felt more relaxed in handling borderline situations. Much effort was directed toward repressing or hiding the concern and, most especially, avoiding transferring anxiety to the child. By accepting the need for this learning process, it became easier to regain control after the immediate insights about their knowledge gap. Successively and together, the parents discovered ways to recognize and draw conclusions regarding symptoms and signs and thereby confirm recently gained knowledge:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Mother:</speaker>
<p>Of course we supported each other with, for instance, “Now we’re going to give insulin” you know, and now we just do it automatically . . . At the time it was: “Oh, let’s do it!” and “Who’s going to do it?” and so on, I remember the first time I was going to do it alone I thought “It’s impossible, we need to do it together” (laughter) then I realised that oh my god this is ridiculous, we have to be able to handle this . . . (laughter). (12)</p>

<title>Facing limited flexibility</title>
<p>Most families described how the onset of diabetes had led to limitations of flexibility in patterns of daily activities. Families with already flexible working hours perceived this challenge as less intrusive but could still experience that they lacked the possibility of spontaneous actions. The parents’ increased need of control over the child’s daily life sometimes caused discussions and conflicts with the child and between the parents. Parents also felt restricted and expressed feelings of having reverted back to a family with small children again: “We had just been through the toddler phase and sort of started living life a bit more freely and then, bang! The door just closed on us.” (23)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1074840713484386">
<title>Allocation of responsibility</title>
<p>The parents gradually became aware of the importance of decreasing the overriding focus on diabetes management. After a while they became more able to see the problem of the time-consuming diabetes management in perspective. The division of responsibility between the parents could differ according to family conditions. Being a single parent mother was perceived as burdensome when the father was not involved in the daily pattern of activities and it was also a reality for one single parent father. By contrast, being divorced and having shared custody and similar involvement could entail more equal responsibility for diabetes management compared to some of the married couples.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Mother:</speaker>
<p>We talk to each other a lot every day.// Earlier we only spoke to each other when we had our change-over every other week . . . and of course if we wanted to change a rule “Yes, but I need to talk to your father first. And find out what he has to say and if he does the same things”// Then of course we have certain rules here and he has other rules at his home but we do talk to each other about major issues. So it feels really good.// It’s only recently that we don’t talk to each other on a daily basis. We have spoken to each other every day, several times a day actually . . . “Now he’s been lying like this and so on” and “this and that has happened” before we could let go and relax. (18)</p>
</speech>
<p>However, parental participation in diabetes management did not always presuppose physical presence. Daily cooperation around diabetes issues was experienced by some of the divorced parents and by one family where the father worked a bit further away. For others, an equal division of diabetes management was facilitated by having similar working conditions, while having irregular working hours forced both parents to assume responsibility. In one family, both parents of a little girl had chosen to work part-time to reduce the increased burden on their domestic life after the onset of diabetes. In other families, one of the parents and mainly the mothers had initially assumed the role of diabetes manager and this pattern was still characterizing the division of responsibility at the time of the interview. However, in one family, the father had assumed the role of diabetes manager despite the mother working in the home and taking the most responsibility for the other children and handling a major portion of the domestic tasks. A few parents felt they were alone with their concern and in some cases persons other than the marital partner contributed with emotional support. If emotional worries were not shared, a sorrow was prominent and this was not related to whether the parents lived together. In some of the parental relationships, mothers expressed disappointment with the fathers’ lack of engagement in diabetes issues. This had, in two families, led to marital separation initiated by the mothers. It seemed to be crucial that parents got involved equally in diabetes management from the start.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Mother:</speaker>
<p>. . . and it’s me and me all the time . . . and we are both parents and we have to be engaged in this and it’s hard to get the time . . . so I just said; “if you are not able to help us, then we have to go separate ways.” (26)</p>

<title>Subcategory: Reinforced Mothering</title>
<p>This category includes how the mothers manage the changes and challenges in relation to the onset of diabetes in their child. The term “reinforcement” is influenced by work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713484386">Hays (1996)</xref> who described intensive mothering as an ideology in which mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture and development of the child. This child-centered mothering requires constant presence and accessibility. After the onset of diabetes, the mothers described how they had to return to this status in a reinforced manner. Earlier habits during the child’s infancy reoccurred, such as the need to nourish and watch over the child, initially around the clock. One energy-consuming consequence of diabetes care was the need for nightly monitoring of the child’s blood glucose. This period of disturbed sleep lasted longer for those with younger children and subsequently they also felt more drained of energy, as the following quote illustrates:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Mother:</speaker>
<p>Yes, that we didn’t get any sleep, in the beginning, and the anxiety at that time . . . it took a lot of effort so I was physically tired, at that point, after the first month. You don’t notice until afterwards how drained you are. (22)</p>
</speech>
<p>A common strategy for managing this challenge was to divide the burden between the parents. Although most parents initially shared the responsibility for the nightly monitoring, several mothers described how they were unable to sleep when it was the father’s turn to perform check-ups. This was described as a return to former patterns (e.g., nightly breastfeeding when the children were infants).</p>
<p>Several mothers experienced more time pressure in patterns of daily activities after the onset of diabetes: “It is just that you live on a timer” (26). In the following quote another mother expressed how this increased workload could lead to feelings of guilt and frustration:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Mother:</speaker>
<p>Earlier we used to be very flexible, and I feel that . . . now we can’t be flexible in the same way. He can definitely survive and sometimes have a late meal or have two snacks one afternoon as dinner is late. But I feel like a bad mother if I don’t try, for his sake, to be reasonably punctual. (18)</p>
</speech>
<p>Becoming <italic>preoccupied by diabetes</italic> appeared to be explicit in the mothers’ stories. Constant thoughts of diabetes-related issues could also make them feel <italic>mentally controlled</italic>. They expressed a great need to be prepared, plan, adjust to, and process information in relation to the child’s current glycemic status or symptoms/signs of unsatisfying control. More specifically, many mothers described how they literally found themselves tied to the kitchen, overwhelmed with the needs of dietary adjustments. Awareness of problems with transferring responsibility of diabetes management was not seen as being related to the father’s actual capacity; instead it was the mother’s own need to maintain control: “And again it’s not that I don’t think he (the father) can’t handle it, it’s rather my own need to be in control, I need to know” (18).</p>
<p>The mothers described a constant sense of concern. One mother who was overloaded trying to decrease her child’s burden had received constructive help from a psychologist who helped her appreciate that her daughter had a capacity of her own. This mother felt that she had become emotionally preoccupied with diabetes, and other mothers gave similar descriptions. Concerns could include a fear of losing control or of not having control over future reactions. In the following quotes, one mother expresses a concern regarding the child’s age-related inability to communicate signs of hypoglycemic episodes:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Mother:</speaker>
<p>No, and that’s the “threat” . . . which frightens me sometimes . . . for example one evening after dinner when I had put her to bed I went upstairs. I just got the feeling that I should go upstairs and take the sugar reading even though it was only an hour and a half ago. Then she was at 1.9 (low blood glucose) . . . and I don’t think anyone could run as fast as I ran down those stairs, to fetch one of those juice packets. Because at that point she was a bit pale as well, she lay there, so of course there is this worry constantly hovering in the background, also because she is so young, she can’t tell us how she is feeling. (13)</p>
</speech>
<p>Some of the mothers felt more overwhelmed by the responsibility than others, and this led to certain strategies to manage the burden. The following quote illustrates one mother’s ambivalence toward taking command and still needing to be relieved from the burden by forcing the father to take responsibility:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Mother:</speaker>
<p>So the (diabetes) nurse came and spoke properly to my husband and told him he has to be a part of this because I can’t do it by myself . . . he listened to what she was saying . . . Yes, I’m glad that he realises that he has to participate/we have decided that I’m going to have some days off. When I have time off I really want to feel like I have time off . . . So we decided to have, one weekend is daddy’s weekend; one is mine and then a weekend when we are all together. //when he (the son) is sitting and eating he shows me the pen and I say “Yes, but now daddy is sitting with you” “Yes, but you must look.” //So I do take the largest part. And that is fine by me; I do like to be in control of the situation. (26)</p>
</speech>
<p>The need to maintain control over diabetes management was more common among the mothers and seemed to be a part of their learning process. Generally, mothers described how they managed this phase mentally by <italic>processing</italic> the changes and challenges independently or by sharing it with others. The mothers expressed a need to discuss dosages with the fathers even though they mostly came to the same conclusions. One mother described their different attitudes and how it affected their actions as follows:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Mother:</speaker>
<p>Both of us were there and listened and so on. And we have tried all along and received information and so on . . . he was also quite well prepared and so on. Most of the time it is probably me asking him: “What should we do with the insulin now?” Not the opposite, because I think he is more confident; “Yes, it will be all right.” I am probably more afraid, thinking one step ahead like “Oh, what if this is too much insulin” and so on. // . . . at the end of the day we probably give pretty much the same amount, but I like to discuss things like check how much he has taken and how much we should give him etc. (16)</p>
</speech>

<sec id="section13-1074840713484386">
<title>Subcategory: Adjusted Fathering</title>
<p>Gender patterns reflecting how the fathers experienced and handled the changes and challenges were interpreted as adjusted fathering. This interpretation assumes that events that substantively change his or his family’s life have the potential to initiate a transition within fathering and thereby changes the fathering trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1074840713484386">Palkovitz &amp; Palm, 2009</xref>). Each transition contributes to a different degree of engagement, identity, or behavior but implies new conditions for viewing himself as a father. The adjustment behavior identified among the fathers in this study, involved <italic>problem-solving attitudes</italic> toward diabetes management, with less need to discuss and confirm decisions related to adjustments compared to what the mothers described. The fathers also expressed a high degree of reliance on the mothers’ abilities. This could be related to the father taking a <italic>supplementary role</italic> whereby he assisted in developing strategies that were needed but which were not always possible for the mother to apply. This in turn could be a response to mothers’ emotional reactions, such as feelings of guilt, and initially higher demands. None of the fathers expressed feelings of guilt for personal failings. The fathers’ way of describing the increased burden after the onset of diabetes was more related to restricted freedom in daily life than responsibility:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Father:</speaker>
<p>It’s that we can’t be as impulsive any more, we constantly have to think about what we are doing all the time, can’t just do whatever whenever we feel like it. Everything requires more planning. That’s the major adjustment. We can’t just let him go off by himself to do different things because we need to be sure that someone is there to keep an eye on him. (25)</p>
</speech>
<p>The parents became more dependent on each other as well as others in their social network to handle the changes in daily life. This implied less freedom and decreased mobility, both generally and in relation to certain situations. The most common way to handle this challenge was to increase the planning of daily tasks as well as carefully prepare for unexpected events. The fathers seemed to be more in need of adjustment to these new conditions.</p>
<p>Manifestations of <italic>embodiment</italic> emerged in some of the fathers’ stories. This means that embodied social habits and practices, or striving for such, gave social meaning and played an important role in regaining control. The challenges of managing diabetes in relation to physical activity caused uncertainty among the parents and much effort was invested in understanding, preventing, and treating unpredictable blood glucose fluctuations related to physical activity. For one father it became increasingly important that the son took up his sport activities to regain control after diabetes. Initially, his attitude caused conflicts and sorrow in the family, but in retrospect it became clear to him that diabetes was used as an excuse to quit:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Father:</speaker>
<p>. . . and I talked to the coach and I talked to the doctor, and well . . . in all likelihood he should get used to the situation first and then he can start training when he feels like it.// But later it actually became more and more clear that he was fed up with it . . . he was probably fed up due to it becoming too serious . . .// Now he’s been playing floor ball since October. So we are thrilled that he wants to do something again . . . But, well . . . on my part it’s not as much fun anymore but if he enjoys himself then he should do it . . . (20)</p>
</speech>
<p>Another father described his embodied way of regaining control in daily life; to manage the increased burden, he used his lunch breaks for exercising. This functional strategy gave him more energy to keep up with the demands of monitoring, planning, and solving diabetes-related issues. Several fathers expressed a more individual approach where the challenge of managing the adjustments resulted in them simply trying to solve the problem.</p>
<p>According to one father’s statement, it seems that the mother’s attitude and strategies implied less involvement from his side but also to feelings relating to it. He acknowledged the unequal burden but explained this as adjusting to her need of keeping control as a reason for taking less responsibility:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Father:</speaker>
<p>I should say that she (the mother) has done most of the work but it is primarily because she herself shouldered the responsibility, not letting me in. That’s why, really.// It is easier now. In the beginning there was no chance I would have . . . And she has taken care of it, and does such a great job . . . so I trust her one hundred per cent so then I suppose I have to accept that . . . she wants to be in control of everything. (27)</p>
</speech>
<p>Also in another family, the father did not acknowledge the diabetes-related conflicts mentioned by the mother. Instead he praised “the mother’s discipline and that he is <italic>relying</italic> on her competence” (20). These cases illustrate how gender relations are reciprocal interactions that can cause conflicts and become counterproductive, such as the father explaining his role in relation to his perception of the mother’s need to keep control.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings of this study add to the growing body of research exploring the experience of parenthood in the context of a chronic illness of a child. The increased focus on fathers’ involvement, which has been less common in previous studies, and the gender perspective of contemporary parenting in illness management has added new knowledge. In the particular context of having a child recently diagnosed with diabetes, our findings are similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1074840713484386">Wennick and Hallström (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1074840713484386">Marshall et al. (2009)</xref> who reported that the changes following this major life event led to challenges in daily life which were experienced as demanding and significant. These challenges forced parents to reconstruct the family project with respect to patterns of daily activities and gender relations, indicating an ongoing adaptive process. Moreover, the process involved less freedom and maintaining control and sharing responsibility together while managing an uncertain and stressful situation. A balance in everyday activities has been found to be a prerequisite for good health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840713484386">Backman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1074840713484386">Erlandsson &amp; Håkansson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>It also became evident that the challenge could be experienced as more or less demanding depending on the children’s age and/or family situation, which is similar to findings in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1074840713484386">Grey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840713484386">Sullivan-Bolyai, Deatrick, Gruppuso, Tamborlane, &amp; Grey, 2003</xref>). Among parents with sufficient recourses, the challenges may even represent something positive, especially for family cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1074840713484386">Patterson, 2002</xref>). However, all families experiencing the onset of diabetes in a child face changes in their daily lives that may impact their experiences of balance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1074840713484386">Goldbeck (2006)</xref> found that parents of children recently diagnosed with chronic illness were more satisfied with their family situation compared to parents of healthy children. Our findings about the reconstruction of the family project, even in families with divorced parents who described improved communication due to the child’s diabetes, were somewhat unexpected and deserve further exploration.</p>
<p>The interpretation of how the mothers’ gender relations were constructed in this study through reinforced mothering, is related to the descriptions of returning to previous patterns of intensive mothering (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713484386">Hays, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1074840713484386">2003</xref>). Because of the ways in which contemporary femininities are constructed, one part of the diabetes management, for example, dietary aspects can have gendered impact on the adaption process. Our findings correspond with results found in a study on teenage girls with diabetes in which mothers concern about diet aspects became apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1074840713484386">Williams, 2000</xref>). Shortcomings in fulfilling dietary requirements seem to be closely related to feelings of guilt and may be an expression of mothering expectations of being responsible for nourishing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713484386">Hays, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Looking at motherhood from a discursive position, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840713484386">Elvin-Novak and Thomsson (2001)</xref> describe the foundation of the mothering process: “. . . the child creates the mother, and the mother exists for the child . . .” (p. 423). This can be compared to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840713484386">Connells (2002)</xref> description of emotional relations, which is illustrated by the emotional energy most mothers in our study attached to their child, in terms of being “emotionally preoccupied” by the diabetes and “mentally controlled” by the child’s needs related to the illness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1074840713484386">Marshall et al. (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840713484386">Sullivan-Bolyai et al. (2003)</xref> similarly found that mothers of young children with diabetes were in “constant vigilance.” Many of the mothers in the present study expressed awareness of being “control freaks,” which could force the fathers to take on a supplementing role. This is consistent with the findings in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1074840713484386">McBride et al. (2005)</xref> in which paternal involvement was moderated by mothers’ beliefs about the role of the father, referring to the concept of “maternal gatekeeping”—a social construction of gender describing mothers’ reluctance to relinquish responsibility over family matters. On the other hand, their ambition of increased reliance on the fathers’ ability regarding diabetes issues indicates that the reality of daily life for these mothers is based on parallel and competitive gender norms related to motherhood (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840713484386">Elvin-Nowak &amp; Thomsson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713484386">Hays, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1074840713484386">Johnston &amp; Swanson, 2006</xref>). This high complexity in women’s everyday life can jeopardize their health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1074840713484386">Erlandsson &amp; Eklund, 2006</xref>) and render strategies dysfunctional because of feeling overloaded with responsibility. Shared decision control at home has been shown to be an essential coping resource influencing satisfaction with life for mothers while personal control was found to be a less potent coping factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1074840713484386">Kushnir, 2006</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1074840713484386">Knafl and Zoeller (2000)</xref> have found a couple’s shared view of confidence in managing the illness to be an important family strength. This is similar to the findings that families who are resilient have greater resources to share and the ability to integrate new routines in their patterns of daily activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1074840713484386">Black &amp; Lobo, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The other category constituting a transformative gender relation was described as adjusted fathering. On one hand, this interpretation illustrates how the fathers adopt traditional masculine behavior of being problem solvers, and so forth. This behavior may be viewed as being constructive in the context of learning how to manage the child’s glycemic control and a way of regaining control, that is, aiming to control situations rather than being controlled by them. Controlling diabetes today is a high-tech issue that might appeal to a majority of men and could contribute to their increased involvement in diabetes management and work as a supplement to the mothers’ emphasis on dietary aspects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1074840713484386">Palkovitz and Palm (2009)</xref> argue that “the more contexts a father has for connecting everyday interactions, functions, roles, and contexts of fathering, the ‘more of a dad’ he becomes” (p. 18). However, in light of the dimension of power relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1074840713484386">Aboim, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840713484386">Connell, 2002</xref>), this might lead to male dominance in parenting in the context of diabetes in the child, which in turn might consolidate prevailing gender order. On the other hand, the promising tendencies of more present and engaged fathers who are willing to assume more responsibility for diabetes related issues indicates a positive development toward improved gender equality in Swedish parents. A contemporary change in the role of the father, with more engagement in family life and child care, is also an example of the dynamics in gender relations. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1074840713484386">Aboim (2010)</xref> raises the question about how men can adopt a nurturing role without being too feminized. The social construction of masculinity is characterized by individualism and rationalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840713484386">Connell, 2002</xref>) and includes higher valuing of sport and exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1074840713484386">Williams, 2000</xref>). Such embodied ways of managing the challenges after the onset of diabetes onset were evident among some of the fathers in our study as well. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1074840713484386">Aboim (2010)</xref> emphasizes that men have to remake the self in private life to adjust to contemporary and contradictory demands. This supports a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1074840713484386">Williams (2007)</xref> that found that working class fathers from different ethnic origins had difficulties in dealing with both their paid work and the domestic domain.</p>
<p>The analysis of gender relations indicates that the mothers and fathers seem to uphold parallel gender norms and patterns. The contradiction between the idealizations of mother/fatherhood toward the equality ideal are both embedded in the current gender order in several Western societies, and may be viewed as a conflict between discourses. This is particularly evident in Sweden where governmental policies have resulted in a greater allowance for combining motherhood and employment than in many other countries. Despite these social conditions in Sweden, the parents in this study acknowledged dichotomous gendered relations by referring to femininities such as taking responsibility, nurturance, and empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840713484386">Connell, 2002</xref>). This illustrates the dominant ideology of mothering expectations in our culture, the intensive mothering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713484386">Hays, 1996</xref>) also found in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1074840713484386">Johnston and Swanson (2006)</xref> who explored how North American women construct their worker–parent identity within a cultural context of competing mothering ideologies. Part-time employed mothers in the U.S sample had similar mothering expectations as the employed mothers in the Swedish study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840713484386">Elwin-Nowak and Thomsson (2001)</xref>.</p>
<p>The fact that the families in the current study seemed to strive for shared responsibility and involvement in diabetes management by adjusting their working conditions indicates that they have expectations about gender equality. This illustrates a transformative gender process that involve new femininities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1074840713484386">Wiklund, Bengs, Malmgren-Olsson, &amp; Ohman, 2010</xref>) as well as new masculinities, that is, multiple masculinities that can differ according to gender relations in a particular situation and/or social setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1074840713484386">Aboim, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1074840713484386">Connell &amp; Messerschmidt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1074840713484386">Williams, 2007</xref>). The similarities between our findings and the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1074840713484386">Aboim (2010)</xref> conducted in Portugal, a country considered to be a family-oriented society compared to the individual-oriented Swedish society, conveys that there are simultaneous ongoing changes in gender relations. Different welfare systems do not seem to have a great impact on this transformation of masculinities, for example, fathering ideologies.</p>
<p>Knowledge about challenges in patterns in daily life and how gender patterns emerge after the onset of diabetes of a child may assist health care professionals in supporting families’ well-being and promote constructive strategies for managing the challenges. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1074840713484386">Johnston and Swanson (2006)</xref> suggest that a cultural change of parenting ideology instead of mothering/fathering expectations better contributes to children’s welfare. Regaining a balance in the family’s everyday life by sharing responsibility and jointly taking control instead of being controlled by diabetes management would most likely decrease the parent-perceived burden and increase parent well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840713484386">Hoey, 2009</xref>). Increased awareness of gender patterns in relation to diabetes management might help diabetes nurses tailor support to families with a child newly diagnosed with diabetes since parental roles and responsibilities in relation to diabetes management are not yet settled.</p>

<title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title>
<p>This study involved both mothers and fathers with varied living conditions and variously aged children with diabetes, which facilitates transferability, especially compared to previous studies in which mainly mothers have participated. It could be argued that the child’s or other key people’s perspective are lacking in this article but this was a conscious decision to maintain focus on the changes, challenges, and gender relations from the perspective of the parents.</p>
<p>The focus of this study on changes in gender relations in general and in relation to diabetes’ onset in particular, contributes to knowledge by offering a contemporary analysis of challenges in daily life for these families. Although the interviews were conducted and primarily analyzed by women, we sought to gain a male perspective by obtaining critical assessment from a male researcher and also by reviewing and incorporating the gender research of plural masculinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1074840713484386">Aboim, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1074840713484386">Connell &amp; Messerschmidt, 2005</xref>). It is not very surprising that the construction of gender emerging in the interviews is partly influenced by the fact that mothers and fathers express their experiences according to general gender norms and expectations, as the ideology of intensive mothering still dominates our culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1074840713484386">Hays, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1074840713484386">Johnston &amp; Swanson, 2006</xref>). Whether the generated concepts of reinforced mothering and adjusted fathering are built on temporary and transitional stages after diabetes’ onset needs to be investigated further.</p>
<p>Another limitation is that the participants only included Swedish speaking parents and occurred shortly after the onset of diabetes. This makes it difficult to compare the results with studies investigating effects on family dynamics and relationships from a more longitudinal perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074840713484386">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840713484386">Hoey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1074840713484386">Wennick et al., 2009</xref>) and/or related to diverse cultures. Finally, the sample was collected from both arms of a randomized clinical trial comparing home- and hospital-based care. Although it could be argued that this might have implications for the findings of this study, the interviews were conducted 8 to 10 months later and focused on changes and challenges in daily life and not at the time of diagnosis.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, the need to reconstruct the family project was related to the changes and challenges in patterns of daily activities after the onset of diabetes of a child. This however had a positive impact on parental collaboration and shared responsibility among both married and divorced parents. The symbolic relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840713484386">Connell, 2002</xref>) of motherhood and fatherhood as definitions related to gender are both changing and undergoing renegotiation regarding their meaning and practices. The emerging subcategories, reinforced mothering and adjusted fathering, illustrate the parents’ effort to handle contemporary and contradictory demands of managing the illness of a child. These gender relations both affect the reconstruction of the family project and become affected by this process. This is surely a fact among parents in general, but this study suggests that the dynamic of gender relations in families with a child recently diagnosed with diabetes has specific features. Health care professionals in diabetes care and researchers need to further explore conditions for and contemporary changes in gender relations in the development and evaluation of future family-focused interventions.</p>
