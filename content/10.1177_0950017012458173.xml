<p>Drawing on an ethnographic study of an empirically neglected sector and setting of employment, namely sales-service work in sex shops located in London’s Soho, this article develops the sociological analysis of sales-service work in two ways. First, it emphasizes the inter-relationship between emotion, aesthetics and sexuality underpinning the <italic>performance</italic> of sexualized labour, shaping the way in which the latter is enacted and embodied. Second, it highlights the importance of locating, or <italic>placing</italic> sexualized labour, teasing out the ways in which it is encoded and embedded in the particular place in which it is performed, a theme that remains under-developed in the study of sales-service work to date.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is a well established body of literature on sex work, much of which draws attention to the importance of space and place in understanding its complex dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012458173">Brewis and Linstead, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0950017012458173">Hubbard and Sanders, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0950017012458173">Sanders, 2005</xref>). The central focus of this article is not with men and women who are employed to sell sex in any direct way, however, but rather with those who work as sales-service providers (advising customers about particular products, including their potential uses), in licensed and unlicensed sex shops, taken here to refer to any ‘business that consists to a significant degree of selling, hiring, exchanging, lending, displaying or demonstrating sex articles or other things intended for the purpose of stimulating or encouraging sexual activity’ (Local Government Act, 1982, 3[4], cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012458173">Coulmont and Hubbard, 2010</xref>: 193). While there have been several ethnographic studies of sex shops, these have focused primarily on customer behaviour, drawing attention to the management of stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0950017012458173">Stein, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0950017012458173">Tewksbury, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0950017012458173">1993</xref>) or to the negotiation of gender performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012458173">Berkowitz, 2006</xref>) on the part of customers. Hence, the role and experiences of sales-service workers in this particular sector remain relatively neglected by sociologists of work. Yet as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017012458173">Malina and Schmidt (1997)</xref> have noted in one of the few published studies of working in a sex shop,
<disp-quote>
<p>sex shops are an example of service where <italic>all aspects of the service encounter are arguably heightened</italic> because of the still fairly sensitive nature of the encounter. Potential customers in particular are <italic>sensitized to their surroundings</italic> and to the actions of staff and other customers in ways which may not be observed in more mundane settings. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017012458173">1997</xref>: 359, emphasis added)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Further, although much has been written about Soho itself, little is known about the work experiences of those employed in its many sex shops. As a recent (and rare) article on sex shops in the <italic>Journal of Management History</italic> put it, there is ‘no other concentration of specialist erotic retailing comparable to London’s Soho, which remains a uniquely themed neighbourhood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0950017012458173">Kent and Berman Brown, 2006</xref>: 201). Yet for sociologists of work, little is known about the experiences of those employed in this particular work<italic>place</italic>. How does Soho’s global association with commercial sex impact upon the work experiences of those employed there? What are the emotional, aesthetic and sexual demands of the role, and how are these demands shaped by the place itself?</p>
<p>Reporting on the findings of an ethnographic study, this article seeks to develop the analysis of emotional, aesthetic and sexualized labour, teasing out some of the distinctions as well as the overlaps in how these different aspects of work are experienced. In doing so, it highlights the importance of space, place and location in the sexualization of work in this particular sector and setting, emphasizing how work performances are enacted and embodied through an interpenetration of emotion, aesthetics and sexuality, and embedded in place through a highly sexualized encoding of those performances into the locale itself. In this respect, the article seeks to extend current understanding of the nature of interactive sales-service work in a relatively neglected industry and location. It does so, first by responding to the call for more research on the relationship between sexuality and interactive sales-service work, in order to develop the ways in which sociologists have made conceptual sense of the sexualization of labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0950017012458173">Warhurst and Nickson, 2009</xref>). Second, it attempts to make an important empirical contribution to the study of work by considering a relatively neglected sector and setting of employment and, in doing so, to highlight the role of place in understanding the lived experience of interactive sales-service work.</p>
<p>The article begins by reflecting on the three main conceptual lenses that have been developed to make sense of the commodification of affect within sales-service work, namely emotional, aesthetic and sexualized labour. It then considers the changing context of Soho as a workplace, outlining the methodological approach that was taken to studying sales-service work in sex shops there. The following section presents the research findings, outlining the performance of sexualized labour and placing it within the context in which it is encoded, enacted, embodied and embedded in Soho. The final section discusses these findings, arguing for a more dynamically inter-related analysis of sexualized labour than has been developed to date, and concludes by reflecting on the contribution and limitations of the current study, outlining potential avenues for further research.</p>
<sec id="section2-0950017012458173">
<title>Emotional, aesthetic and sexualized labour</title>
<p>Broadly speaking, sociological analysis of the different forms of labour underpinning interactive service work has tended to coalesce around three concepts, each emphasizing different aspects of the commodification process involved. Following the publication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0950017012458173">Hochschild’s (1983)</xref> account of ‘the commercialization of human feeling’, much of the field has been shaped by a primary concern with the performance of emotional labour. Taking its analytical cue largely from Hochschild’s hints at the ways in which emotional labour is embodied, attention has also been drawn to the performance of aesthetic labour, involving the incorporation of workers’ embodied attributes into the labour process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012458173">Dean, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0950017012458173">Entwistle and Wissinger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0950017012458173">Hancock and Tyler, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0950017012458173">Pettinger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0950017012458173">Warhurst and Nickson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0950017012458173">Wissinger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0950017012458173">Witz et al., 2003</xref>), as well as to the broader ‘networks of aestheticization’ within which aesthetic labour takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0950017012458173">Chugh and Hancock, 2009</xref>). Alongside but not necessarily in dialogue with this literature has been a more marginal and relatively theoretically under-developed interest in the commodification of sexuality in sales-service work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0950017012458173">Adkins, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0950017012458173">Filby, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012458173">Kirby, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0950017012458173">Pringle, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Attempting to address this problem, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0950017012458173">Warhurst and Nickson (2009)</xref> argue that a conceptual double shift is needed in order to understand how employees become sexualized:
<disp-quote>
<p>Firstly, from emotional to aesthetic and sexualized labour and secondly, from an employee sexuality that is sanctioned and subscribed to by management to that which management strategically prescribes. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0950017012458173">Warhurst and Nickson, 2009</xref>: 385)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Yet, while making an important step towards recuperating the sexualized, embodied character of interactive service work, advocating this linear shift risks losing sight of the dynamic inter-relationship between emotion, aesthetics and sexuality that characterizes interactive service work in sexualized settings. Further, in defining sexualized labour as ‘<italic>the way in which employees’ looks become sexualized</italic> as an organizationally prescribed style of service’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0950017012458173">Warhurst and Nickson, 2009</xref>: 392–3, emphasis added), sexuality is reduced to aesthetics, which in turn become equated specifically with a managerially prescribed look. The reduction of aesthetics solely to the ‘look’ that employees’ bodies produce and, by extension, the reduction of sexuality to a managerially prescribed appearance, arguably obfuscates important aspects of sales-service work in sexualized contexts, not least what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0950017012458173">Dale (2005)</xref> has described as the ‘social materiality’ within which work is enacted and made meaningful. In the theoretical analysis of sexualized labour thus far, it is arguably precisely this social materiality – the mutually constitutive relationship between meaning and materiality that shapes social identities and relations – that remains neglected; and it is on this social materiality that this article focuses, in order to begin to think through the ways in which sexualized labour involves more than simply an aesthetic sexualization of employees’ looks, but rather a dynamic inter-relationship between an embodied performance and an encoding and embedding of sexuality into the spaces, places and locations in which sexualized labour is enacted.</p>
<p>Regarding this latter theme, despite a growing body of literature on space in the study of work in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0950017012458173">Dale, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0950017012458173">Dale and Burrell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0950017012458173">Herod et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017012458173">Kornberger and Clegg, 2004</xref>), themes of place and location have been relatively neglected in the study of sales-service work (this in marked contrast to research on sex work, as indicated above). Yet understanding the relationship between space, place and work is important because, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0950017012458173">Sherry (1998</xref>: 4, emphasis added) has put it in his discussion of markets as places, ‘meaning is continually <italic>emplaced</italic> in consumers’ experience’. This means that more thought needs to be given to the ways in which sales-service work is located in <italic>place</italic> in order to understand how the meanings associated with particular places shape how work is experienced, and of course vice versa. With this in mind, the underlying aim of this article is to consider the interconnections between emotion, aesthetics and sexuality in the performance of sales-service work in a sexualized context, namely sex shops located in London’s Soho, and to explore the role of place in shaping this inter-relationship.</p>

<title>Researching Soho’s sex shops: background and context</title>
<p>Soho occupies a relatively compact area of approximately one square mile of the City of Westminster in central London, but constitutes something of a ‘glocalized space’ in terms of its disproportionate impact, the latter primarily as a result of its global association with commercial sex. Contemporary Soho is a vibrant workplace and thriving residential community, ‘a place of dazzling contrasts […] both homely village and red-light district, a place of work and a place to forget it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0950017012458173">Summers, 1989</xref>: 5). A ‘hybrid and heterotopic site’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012458173">Mort, 1998</xref>: 891), shaped by intersecting yet differential histories, Soho’s multi-faith culture means that it is home to a range of spiritual and political groups, many of which contribute to the maintenance of the area as a place of openness to the Other. Sexual and legal liminality and the assimilation of the area into a fashionable mainstream (in a similar vein to Manchester’s gay village – see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0950017012458173">Binnie and Skeggs, 2004</xref>) contribute to Soho’s reputation as the UK’s ‘gay capital’.</p>
<p>In recent years, Soho has undergone something of an urban renaissance shaped by a combination of entrepreneurial activity, urban branding, local community initiatives and particularly the expansion of businesses specializing in new media and communication technologies. Since the 1980s, purges of the vice squad, along with the introduction of licensing regulations, have served to ‘clean up’ Soho. In 1982 and 1986 new licensing laws were brought into effect giving Westminster City Council, under whose administration Soho falls, the power to restrict the number of sex shops that would be allowed to operate in the district. In 1996, the City of Westminster Act was introduced allowing Westminster City Council to serve an immediate closure notice on any sex shop operating without a licence. Under the terms of this Act, the police have the power to ‘raid’ unlicensed premises (enter them without prior warning and seize their stock). In practice, unlicensed shops tend to stock mainly pornographic DVDs with a total value of no more than the cost of the licence. Because the profit margin on DVDs is high, this means that unlicensed shops can still carry a relatively large amount of stock and stay within the cost of a licence (personal communication with Environmental Health Case Officer, August 2010). Yet despite the regulatory effects of licensing legislation and enforcement and of regular trading standards inspections of any premises connected with the sex industry, commercial sex in all its many guises is still widespread and properties deemed suitable for sex-related businesses command inflated rents. Binge drinking and drug dealing are rife; there are many sex shops remaining, most of which (at the time of writing) are licensed, some of which are not, and the area continues to be associated primarily with commercial sex, the iconography of which shapes Soho’s ‘social materiality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0950017012458173">Dale, 2005</xref>). It was therefore a particularly apposite place in which to study the performance of sexualized labour and to consider the role of sector and setting in shaping this performance.</p>
<p>The research involved observational fieldwork carried out in and around Soho, specifically in 12 (licensed and unlicensed) sex shops in mid-2009. Of these 12 stores, eight were independently owned single stores (employing between two people in the smallest store and 12 in the largest), one was part of a local group of stores based in and around Soho and the remaining three were part of much larger national and international chains. The observational research I undertook in these stores was broadly carried out along a continuum, along which my role shifted from participation as a potential customer (in shops where I had yet to interview), or as an assumed employee (when the staff but not the customers were aware of my role as a researcher – although I had no direct involvement with customers, other than to exchange passing greetings), through to entirely non-participant observation, when I spent time at the counter in the shops with a note book and tape recorder out and was therefore clearly identified as an ‘outsider’. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012458173">Fisk and Grove (1995)</xref> have noted, relatively few studies of sales-service interactions involve participant or non-participant observation. With this in mind, the aim here was to observe as far as possible the dynamic inter-relationship between customers, staff and the setting itself. The plan was to include as many of Soho’s sex shops as possible in the study and with this in mind, my approach to sampling was simply opportunistic in so far as I undertook fieldwork during quiet periods when staff were able to spend time with me. The relative informality of the place and the sector meant that there were no ‘gatekeepers’ as store owners tended to be somewhat absent from day-to-day operations and so staff had relative freedom to make their own decisions about taking part, and about granting access to the shops in which they worked. No one refused to be interviewed, or to allow me to undertake observational research, and this is probably a reflection of a combination of factors including the somewhat liminal nature of the sector and the setting; the openness and generosity that characterizes Soho as a place; the nature of the business (regular customers and friends or acquaintances of employees, including professional sex workers, tend to stand around and chat in sex shops during quiet periods throughout the day) and the relative eclecticism of the setting, including its notoriety as a tourist destination, all of which meant that as an ‘outsider’ I fitted in relatively unobtrusively. While the time I spent in the stores varied considerably, depending on how busy they were and what was happening at the time, periods of observation ranged from 20 minutes in one instance to over two hours at a time. Within the settings of the stores, the observational research often merged into the collection of interview data and vice versa.</p>
<p>In addition to carrying out observational research inside the shops, I observed and made notes on the spaces in and around the shops and in Soho more generally, covering all its main streets, side streets, courts and alleyways. Mindful of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0950017012458173">Strangleman’s (2004</xref>: 180) critique of ‘the absence of both the visual and discussions of representation’ in the study of work and employment, I also took over three hundred photographs and made notes on what had been photographed, and why, making connections between the different photographs and the observational data gathered and whenever possible asking those interviewed to do so as well. I also took photographs in and around the shops where I undertook interviews and observational research, often in collaboration with interviewees.</p>
<p>In addition, 14 semi-structured interviews were undertaken, guided by a schedule that was continually refined, with people working in licensed and unlicensed shops. Interviewees were selected using an opportunistic snowballing technique, through which I simply approached people in the stores and asked whoever was on the shop floor at the time to take part in an interview; following this initial contact, I got to know people working in the stores and several maintained regular contact with me, as well as referring me on to co-workers in their own stores and in other shops. Of the 14 people interviewed, four had managerial responsibilities (one as an area manager) and all but two worked on a full-time basis. Four were women and ten were men, a pattern that seemed broadly reflective of the gendered composition of the workforce in the stores. At 19, Toby was the youngest participant; and in his late 60s, Richard (who was semi-retired) was the eldest, with a broad spread in between; all were from white ethnic groups (again, both the age and ethnic composition of the participants seemed broadly reflective of a more common pattern). With one exception, these interviews were tape recorded and transcribed and subject to thematic analysis at various intervals. (The one exception was Richard, who worked in a store that specialized in ‘school-girl’ themed pornography and spanking equipment. Although Richard preferred the interview not to be recorded – possibly because the store he worked in was unlicensed, perhaps making him more self-conscious than other participants, he was keen to take part and allowed hand-written notes to be taken instead.) Several interviews were conducted in local cafes or on benches, sometimes over several meetings during the participants’ break times or after work, or in the small offices at the back of the stores, but most took place at the sales counter on the shop floor where the participants worked, during working hours or while they were on informal breaks during quiet periods. This meant that (much like Sanders’ interviews with sex workers that were also undertaken in situ – see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0950017012458173">Sanders, 2005</xref>) the flow of the conversation was often interrupted by customers, or by co-workers. However, it also meant that interviewees were able to talk animatedly about their work and their work environments, giving examples and recalling incidents as something in the shop itself triggered recollections or prompted thoughts that they might not otherwise have had.</p>
<p>Many of the interviews, even though they were carried out in the shops themselves, continued for a couple of hours and almost all were at least an hour long, generating rich, detailed and reflexive accounts of people’s work experiences. The interview data, field notes and photographs collected were subject to in-depth thematic analysis, which was undertaken both during and between fieldwork visits to Soho. Two or three transcripts were read at a time and the findings that emerged informed the next interviews to be conducted (although of course I was mindful of confidentiality). Data analysis was a fairly interactive process involving participants, other academics, licensing officers and policy analysts, with whom I discussed emergent findings at various stages, a feature of the research process that enhanced accountability and reflexivity. The transcripts and field notes were analysed through the course of several readings, initially to discern emergent thematic codes and then to substantiate and refine these further until the research began to reach thematic saturation point, a process that also applied to the collection of photographic data and field notes. Everyone I spoke to had interesting stories to tell and before long, as I got to know them better, patterns began to emerge in their accounts of working in sales-service work in sex shops in Soho, to which the article now turns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0950017012458173">
<title>Sales-service work in Soho’s sex shops</title>
<p>As the data began to be subjected to theoretical analysis, it became apparent that the emergent findings stretched the concept of sexualized labour beyond its current analytical capacity. The following discussion of these findings teases out four inter-related themes in the performance and placing of sexualized labour in Soho’s sex shops, focusing on the ways in which sexuality is encoded, enacted, embodied and embedded into sales-service work.</p>
<sec id="section5-0950017012458173">
<title>Encoding sexualized labour: ‘Not in this place, and not in this industry.’</title>
<p>Broadly speaking, the process of encoding involves imbuing cultural artefacts with specific associations – literally converting a particular message into a sensory code (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0950017012458173">Hancock, 2005</xref>). In contrast to previous research on the aesthetic sexualization of primarily female service providers, while supervision of staff within the stores was relatively informal, the people interviewed who had managerial responsibility all explained how, in order to discourage predatory behaviour from customers, the only rule that was non-negotiable related to the maintenance of a neutral, de-sexualized appearance at work. Evoking several important themes in his reflections on the dress code within the store for which he had overall responsibility as an area manager, Nathan explained the importance of maintaining a relatively neutral, ‘presentable’, appearance that was explicitly de-sexualized, with reference to the effects of Soho on customer expectations, as a place of work and consumption with a global reputation for commercial sex:
<disp-quote>
<p>all I ever want is for people just to be smart and presentable really … you really, really don’t want people turning up for work looking sort of tarted up, <italic>not in this place and not in this industry</italic>. (Nathan, May 2009, emphasis added)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Echoing Nathan’s concern that staff should look ‘presentable’, Toby reflected on the importance of looking ‘approachable’ on the shop floor in the store where he worked:
<disp-quote>
<p>I just try and look as normal as possible because I mean it doesn’t matter what I wear … but then you just kind of think you’ve got to look approachable, you’ve got to look nice and well, not smart … you’ve got to look approachable, neutral I guess. (Toby, May 2009)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Many of the women who took part in the research echoed Nathan’s somewhat paternalistic concern that staff, particularly female staff, should not display a sexualized appearance at work. Shirley, for instance, who was the manager of the shop where I worked, explained that her ruling for staff is that they ‘look smart casual’ (a look that she sought to embody herself – see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0950017012458173">Figure 1</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p>You know, keep the uniform clean and if it’s just normal and not revealing everything inside kind of thing, then I don’t really mind about the rest. But it’s got to have quite a casual, relaxed feel about it because if I was walking around in a suit it’s a bit of a barrier for customers … It’s about professionalism. You know, I’m not trying to sell products based on the fact that I’ve got half a cleavage hanging out. (Shirley, June 2009)</p>
</disp-quote>

</fig>
<p>Similarly, when asked about how she chose what to wear for work, Julie explained that her primary concern was not to appear sexualized: ‘It’s about not showing cleavage or letting it all hang out … it’s about the image you want to portray. It’s the image that our particular company does want to portray … just professional really, neutral’ (Julie, June 2009). In addition to explicit de-sexualization therefore, Toby and Julie also evoked an aesthetic of neutrality in their discussion of the meanings encoded into their workplace performances, one that was designed to normalize the stigma associated with working and consuming in a sex shop in a location such as Soho and to imbue their embodied appearance with an ethos of professionalism – both to discourage predatory behaviour on the part of customers, as Nathan described it, in much the same way as the therapeutic massage workers in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012458173">Oerton’s (2004)</xref> study, and to appear approachable, as Shirley also emphasized.</p>
<p>Yet at the same time, as illustrated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0950017012458173">Figure 2</xref>, sex shops in Soho were replete with highly sexualized iconography, manifest in the names of the shops themselves, their colour schemes, their window displays, their product range, their merchandising and point of sale material and, of course, their ubiquitous display of hard-core pornography.</p>

<p>While explicitly de-sexualized in their own presentation of self therefore, those men and women who worked in Soho’s sex shops performed sexualized labour against a semiotic landscape, or ‘servicescape’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0950017012458173">Sherry, 1998</xref>), that was explicitly sexual and that framed the performance of their labour as a highly sexualized encounter; that is, as work involving a commodification of sexual desire. This, coupled with Soho’s long-standing global reputation for commercial sex, played a significant role in shaping staff and customer expectations of the sales-service exchange. Not least, as Toby suggested, again evoking the place itself:
<disp-quote>
<p>You get people coming on to you all the time … You know, everyone gets that. I mean you have to deal with it … It’s the wrong job and the wrong area to work in if you don’t like that sort of attention … it’s just part of the job, and the place. (Toby, May 2009)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The sexualized nature of their work role, place and identities therefore meant that, because of the ways in which sexuality was encoded in the sector and setting in which they worked, sales-service staff in Soho had to continually mediate between, on the one hand, a formally de-sexualized aesthetic in their employment relationship combined with the evocation of an aesthetic of neutrality and a ‘normalized’ ethos of professionalism, and on the other, a hyper-sexualized semiotic shaping customer expectations of the sales-service encounter and of the place and spaces within the shops themselves.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0950017012458173">
<title>Enacting sexualized labour: ‘They come out with such personal stuff.’</title>
<p>As a consequence of the meanings attached to the setting and the sector and to the landscaping of the spaces within and around Soho’s sex shops, a high level of presumed intimacy shaped the sales-service encounter. Combined with the explicit nature of the products and services on offer and the advice sought by customers, this meant that workers often had to manage their own and co-workers’ emotions as they performed sexualized labour. The process of enactment this involved, the commodification of emotion and the lived experience of sector and setting on which it was based, is also central to the negotiation of workplace identity. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017012458173">Malina and Schmidt (1997</xref>: 357) note how:
<disp-quote>
<p>Fitting the part demands a willingness to be a cross between a stand-up comic and advice columnist … where a non-judgemental, unflinching friendliness and wit are essential.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Nathan articulated his own experience of these demands when he recounted how many customers were relatively nervous and required reassurance or discretion, whereas others were much more forthright in articulating their needs:
<disp-quote>
<p>I always say [to the staff he manages], ‘Be polite and offer people your services because a lot of people come in and they are nervous’ … But then you get other people come in and some people just don’t care. They’ll come in and talk to us like they’d talk to their doctor and say ‘Well, I’ve got this problem’ … Some people do ask you some of the strangest things, like you’re a sex therapist or their doctor even. They come out with such personal stuff. (Nathan, May 2009)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Of course the well established historical association of sexuality with shame and embarrassment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017012458173">Burrell, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0950017012458173">Elias, 1978</xref>), coupled with the gender politics of consuming in a sex shop (with its associated connotations of ‘spoiled masculinity’ – see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012458173">Berkowitz, 2006</xref>) meant that the dominant customer service discourse of consumer sovereignty was temporarily reversed. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017012458173">Malina and Schmidt (1997)</xref> intimate in their description of the service encounter as one shaped by heightened sensitivity, the self-consciousness of the customer effectively throws into relief the norms of social interaction and arguably the power relations that characterize sales-service exchanges in more mainstream retail environments. Evoking the locale twice in his reflections, Michael echoed Nathan’s description when he also referred to the presumed intimacy of some customers who talked to staff in the sex shops as if they were sex therapists, explaining how such customers were often self-consciously ‘not sure of themselves’:
<disp-quote>
<p>Some of the locals [regular customers], they come in and speak to me as a local sex therapist! They say, ‘Oh, I’m having a bit of trouble with this’ and they really look to you for help. They really need you to listen and give them advice, and they’re not sure really, not sure of themselves. (Michael, May 2009)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Of those customers who were particularly forthright in articulating their reason for being in a sex shop (e.g. needing advice relating to a particular problem, or guidance on how best to fulfil a particular fantasy) most were regarded as ‘perfectly normal’ or ‘just ordinary’ as several participants put it. Yet, the social taint attached to consuming in a sex shop, coupled with the perceived personal circumstances of many customers, meant, as Nathan suggested when he advised staff to ‘be polite and offer people your services’, that even these ‘ordinary’ customers were often thought of as somewhat vulnerable and in need of reassurance. Shirley summed this up when she described how the role often bordered on that of sex therapist involving, as Michael also suggested, the provision of a sexual advisory service, explaining how this particular aspect of the job also called for the performance of a sexualized form of emotional labour that involved offering reassurance and putting people at ease, at the same time as drawing on their own sexual expertise and experience. This performance of sexualized emotional labour in this respect was similar to the work described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0950017012458173">Bolton (2005)</xref> as ‘emotional management’ in its reliance on workers’ own judgements, experiences and discretion.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Most things I’ve heard of … and <italic>it’s just a case of making people feel comfortable and not feel inadequate or that they’re different</italic>. So even if you told me you’ve got a problem and I’ve never heard of that one before, I would go, ‘Oh, don’t worry.

(Shirley, June 2009, emphasis added)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here Shirley also emphasized how this performance required her to draw on her own ‘specialist knowledge’ of sexual products and practices – ‘of the things that people do’, a recurring theme that highlights important ways in which sexualized labour involves investing in and drawing on reserves of sexual capital.</p>

<sec id="section7-0950017012458173">
<title>Embodying sexualized labour: ‘You learn from your own experience.’</title>
<p>Drawing on phenomenological thought and particularly the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0950017012458173">Merleau Ponty (1962</xref>: xviii), embodiment can broadly be understood as the ontological experience of living through the body; that is, of existing through the body’s lived materiality as a way of perceiving the world and others. Experiencing the world of work and inter-subjective encounters with others such as, in this case, co-workers and customers through the body’s lived materiality characterizes the performance and perception of sexualized labour in the particular sector and setting discussed here in a way that goes beyond simply an aestheticization of the body’s appearance. For instance, staff often drew on reserves of embodied sexual capital during interactions with customers in order to cope with the presumed intimacy of the exchange and to be able to offer the necessary advice and guidance that many customers sought. Michael summed this up when he referred to the high level of specialist knowledge the role demanded:
<disp-quote>
<p>If you asked the average person on the street how you’d use a [xxxx] or something, I don’t think they’d know. You do have to have a lot of specialist knowledge and to be able to draw on your own reserves. (Michael, May 2009)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Most of the people interviewed emphasized how much of their product knowledge was acquired from customers:
<disp-quote>
<p>You’re learning something new all the time. I’ve been here eight years and some 21-year-old kid will come in and go blah, blah, blah. ‘Well, I never knew that!’ You do hear things all the time. You learn stuff from customers. (Nathan, May 2009)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Throughout the fieldwork period, customers were often observed asking for advice and staff frequently drew on their own sexual experiences when advising customers about particular products and their potential uses. As Toby put it,
<disp-quote>
<p>I use the toys and I know people who use the toys. Like I work with a couple of girls and they use all the vibrators and we use lots of the other stuff … so you learn from customers, you learn from the people you work with, from what people say, and you learn from your own experience. (Toby, May 2009)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Mark also explained how the shop he worked in employed staff with a range of sexual interests and expertise and emphasized the extent to which this was essential when advising customers:
<disp-quote>
<p>There are guys here that are into fisting and there are guys here that are quite vanilla, so there’s a wide variety and broad spectrum, so we all have, you know, different knowledge of products and of how they might be used, depending on what your interests are. (Mark, June 2009)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Further, like any other retail environment, staff were also conscious of the need to ‘keep abreast of the current trends’, as Stewart put it, although in an environment such as a sex shop (particularly the more specialist ones) doing so frequently involved learning about ‘activities that most people won’t even have heard of’. In practice, this meant that as well as drawing on their own, their co-workers’ and their (non-professional) customers’ experiences and expertise, staff often also developed their understanding of particular products and sexual practices from their many regular customers who were professional sex workers. As Jason explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>we get a lot of people in here who work in the sex industry, be it escorts or hookers, so they’re obviously a big part of our trade and obviously a lot of those workers use our products in their trade, so we learn a lot from them about what works and what doesn’t work so well, and about what people are asking for. (Jason, June 2009)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Performing sexualized labour therefore involved investing in and drawing on reserves of sexual capital, incorporating knowledge acquired from workers’ own sexual experiences, relationships and identities, as well as those of co-workers, (non-professional) customers and customers who are professional sex workers. This incorporation of sexual capital into the performance of sexualized labour therefore involved a much more embodied process than the analytical emphasis on sexual aestheticization described above suggests; in the findings discussed here it was not simply workers’ ‘looks’ that were sexualized but rather their embodied, sexual subjectivities. In this particular sector and setting, the sexualities of workers and customers alike were produced discursively and not simply aesthetically, as Toby, Stewart, Jason and others suggested, partly as a consequence of the ways in which they were embedded within the place and space of Soho itself.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0950017012458173">
<title>Embedding sexualized labour: ‘It’s because of what and where we are.’</title>
<p>As an entwined social and material process (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0950017012458173">Dale, 2005</xref>), embedding is understood here to refer to the mechanisms of organization whereby a particular entity becomes an integral part of a broader whole and must be understood as such in order to make sense of the dynamic relationship between the parts and the social and material context within which they are situated, in this instance in a particular place and space. In the case of sexualized labour therefore, to argue that work is embedded is to emphasize that it is placed within the context of the specific sector, setting and space within which it is performed and perceived. On the one hand, the sexually explicit expectations and behaviour of customers, the presumed intimacy that characterized the service exchange and the embodied commodification of sexual capital involved resulted from Soho’s long-standing association with commercial sex described above and with the ethos of sexual tolerance and experimentation that characterized this particular setting. In practice, this meant that customers came to Soho with a particular expectation of their experience as a consumer in mind. Andy summed this up when he said that:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>They come to Soho</italic> … there’s probably two or three licences in every town in Britain so they don’t need to come to London to get an R-18 [a ‘restricted’ 18 certificate film that can only be purchased from a licensed sex shop] … <italic>They come to the place</italic>. (Andy, May 2009, emphasis added)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This meant that much of the demand for sexualized labour originated from the commercial associations of the place itself and from the ‘anything goes’ ethos for which Soho had a long-standing reputation. Customers, employees and managers all associated the sales-service encounter described here with a particular set of expectations shaped by the place itself, its history and its continuing associations with legal and sexual liminality. At the extreme, this meant that customers coming into their stores to request ‘under the counter’, illegal pornography featuring children or animals was at least a daily occurrence for all of the research participants. Nathan explained what seemed to be a fairly universal view of such customers, connecting their behaviour specifically to the place itself:
<disp-quote>
<p>Everyone is different, but to me, even to come in here and ask for that, that insults me. It insults all of us doesn’t it? Because they do think because we’re a sex shop, and because of where we are, they can ask for whatever they want. (Nathan, May 2009, emphasis added)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>On the other hand, however, the place itself, while the locus of sexualization, was also an important resource for workers to draw upon in order to cope with the demands and degradations of the job outlined above. Michael explained how staff from the sex shops and sex workers constituted a working community, a theme that recurred in the observational research undertaken, during which the kind of interaction Michael described was frequently observed:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I first came here, the first week, every night I had two or three [sex workers] always approach me, but now I know them all it’s like ‘Hello, how are you? Alright? Are you alright tonight? Are you being careful?’ ‘Yeah.’ You know, things like that. (Michael, May 2009)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Similarly, Julie explained the sense of community that characterized the sector and the setting, describing how those working in the stores and on the streets supported each other: ‘Everybody, especially the businesses, everybody practically knows each other and everyone looks after each other’s back, so it is a little community’ (Julie, June 2009). Toby echoed Julie’s feelings when he reflected on how ‘at home’ he felt in Soho as a place of work, because of the intimacy and sense of community associated with working there: ‘I feel more at home here than I do where I live. Because it’s so intimate. It’s quite a small area. Because all the shops know each other, we all look after each other’ (Toby, May 2009). What these references suggest then is that place itself is central to understanding both the nature of sexualized labour and the coping strategies and techniques deployed by those who perform it. In other words, to make sense of the lived experiences of sexualized labour, it is necessary to understand the inter-connected ways in which work is encoded, enacted, embodied and embedded within the material environments in which it is performed and placed.</p>

<title>Concluding thoughts: performing and placing sexualized labour</title>
<p>This study aimed to provide a deeper understanding of how sexualized labour was shaped by the place in which it was performed, in a particular sector and setting of employment. To develop this contribution, two analytical themes were teased out in the research – performing and placing sexualized labour. First, the research found that in the performance of sales-service work in sex shops, emotion, aesthetics and sexuality were all brought into play, as workers were often required to perform emotion work on themselves and their co-workers and their job routinely called for the performance of a sexualized form of emotional labour in their interactions with customers. The aesthetics of sales-service work in a sex shop are also important to consider, as the aesthetic management of the space – both within the stores and in the place itself – provides an important contextual setting for staff-customer interactions; the aesthetics of the space and place of a sex shop do not constitute a neutral backdrop, but a carefully managed, encoded materiality which shapes and is shaped by the social relations of production and consumption that take place within it. Not least, the findings outlined above emphasize that managers and supervisors within Soho’s sex shops explicitly de-sexualized the appearance of their staff precisely because of the sector and setting, at the same time as encoding the space and place with highly explicit hyper-sexualized imagery. The commodification of sexuality involved not simply a sexualization of aesthetics, therefore, where the latter refers specifically to the sexualization of workers’ appearance, but rather a much more complex commercialization of embodied sexual capital and a broader sexualization of the ‘servicescape’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0950017012458173">Sherry, 1998</xref>) of the shops and of Soho itself. In this respect, the performance of sexualized labour cannot be separated from precisely where it is placed, but rather exists in a complex dialectical relationship that constitutes the social materiality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0950017012458173">Dale, 2005</xref>) of the exchange. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0950017012458173">Entwistle and Wissinger (2006</xref>: 784, emphasis added) describe it in fashion models’ performances of aesthetic labour: ‘while some of this labour takes place at the surface of the body […] aesthetic labour involves <italic>the entire (re)production of body/self for the workplace</italic>’. Implicit in this is a co-optation not simply of a worker’s appearance, but rather his or her entire embodied persona drawing, in the case of the sexualized labour described here, on an employee’s sexual identification, experience and accumulated technical know-how or what might broadly be called ‘repertoire’. What this suggests is that rather than simply ‘the way in which employees’ looks become the sexualized as an organizationally prescribed style of service’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0950017012458173">Warhurst and Nickson, 2009</xref>: 392–3), the sexualization of labour encompasses a much broader process through which work becomes associated, either implicitly or explicitly, with the provision and pursuit of sexual pleasure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0950017012458173">Grey and Sturdy (2007)</xref> have already discussed the ways in which friendships within work contexts can be transformed into a commodity, in the form of social capital; what the findings considered here suggest is that, in the performance of sexualized labour, so too can the tacit knowledge accumulated through one’s sexual experiences and relationships be commodified in the form of sexual capital.</p>
<p>In this respect, while by definition limited to this particular sector and setting, the research presented here problematizes an analysis of sexualized labour that advocates (i) a reduction of sexualization solely to the presentation of a sexualized appearance on the part of the sales-service worker, and (ii) a linear analysis that shifts the conceptual focus from emotion to aesthetics to sexuality.</p>
<p>Rather, in order to capture the complexity and intersectionality of emotion, aesthetics and sexuality in sales-service work and of the relationship between performance and place, a more dynamic, inter-related analysis is needed. Rather than a linear shift from emotion to aesthetics to sexuality, it is necessary to think carefully about ‘fluidity, interpenetration and reversals [rather than] a naive teleology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017012458173">Burrell, 1984</xref>: 102–3) in understanding this complex dynamic. More thought therefore needs to be given to the dynamic inter-relationship between the performance and placing of sexualized labour in other sectors and settings of employment in order to explore the ways in which there is literally much more to sexualized labour than meets the eye.</p>
