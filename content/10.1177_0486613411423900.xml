<abstract>
<p>In this rejoinder, I respond to the recent <italic>RRPE</italic> paper by Cobb, King, and Rodriguez (2009) concerning Mexican immigrant economic informality in the United States. Specifically I assess the discussion of economic informality of Mexican immigrants. I end with a call for further research into this phenomenon that employs millions in the U.S. informal economy.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>The importance of continuing labor research on Hispanic populations in the United States is critical to understanding America’s present and future labor force. Hispanics are now America’s largest minority and are filling essential work roles from Supreme Court Justice to domestic servant. According to the Pew Hispanic Center, there are 45 million Hispanics living in the United States; 30 million are Mexican-American (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0486613411423900">Pew Hispanic Center 2009</xref>). Additionally, of the 12 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States, about seven million come from Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0486613411423900">Passel and Cohn 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In their recent <italic>RRPE</italic> article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0486613411423900">Cobb, King, and Rodriguez (2009)</xref> explore the working world of nearly one-hundred Mexican migrants from Portland, Oregon. Cobb, King, and Rodriguez (CKR) mostly describe a work environment characterized by informal work. In this rejoinder, I assess the contribution of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0486613411423900">Cobb, King, and Rodriguez (2009)</xref> paper of Mexican informality in the United States.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0486613411423900">
<title>2. An Assessment of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0486613411423900">Cobb, King, and Rodriguez (2009)</xref></title>
<p>Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0486613411423900">Hart’s (1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0486613411423900">1970</xref>) initial observations in Ghana, the literature on informal work has blossomed with most studies focused on the developing world where informality is most prevalent. The topic of informality in developed and developing contexts took on renewed emphasis with the publication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0486613411423900">Portes, Castells, and Benton’s 1989</xref> edited work <italic>The Informal Economy: Studies in Advanced and Less Developed Countries</italic>. The United States is a unique laboratory to study informality because of the large undocumented immigrant population which regularly finds employment outside the purview of government regulation. And this “laboratory” is primarily filled with Mexican undocumented workers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0486613411423900">1</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0486613411423900">Cobb, King, and Rodriguez (2009)</xref> rightly spotlight Mexican informality. As an economic phenomenon, Mexican informality in the United States is woefully understudied. Utilizing two samples from Portland—one a sample of 12 migrant restaurant workers and the other a sample of 80 people waiting in the Mexican consulate—CKR suggest that a “spectrum of formality” encompasses many of the migrants in their study. Further, CKR present five key findings, summarized as: 1) Mexican migrants work in a few job categories; 2) migrants benefit from informal conditions; 3) social networks are important in the job search for both employee and employer; 4) Mexican migrants are faced with a homogeneity of informal earnings unconnected to the formal labor market; and 5) Mexican migrant workers may float between jobs with differing levels of (in)formality.</p>
<p>These findings from CKR, perhaps, claim too much given their limited and constrained samples and may have been better offered as propositions to engage further study, rather than key findings. I first focus on CKR’s research methods and literature base before assessing CKR’s key findings.</p>
<sec id="section3-0486613411423900">
<title>2.1 Research Methods:</title>
<p>As the CKR study was conducted in one city with a purposive sample design, more detail as to that research design and overall methodology was required to place respondent answers and investigators’ insights into context.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0486613411423900">2</xref></sup> Additionally, respondent demographics and descriptive statistics are sketchy. Unfortunately, the reader is left to wonder as to the appropriateness of the investigators’ methodology.</p>
<p>Additionally, CKR overstepped in presenting their findings. For example, the authors in their title use the word the United States, rather than the Northwest or just Portland, and generalize their findings to the whole of the United States. Their sample is not representative of Portland, the Northwest, or the United States and their qualitative findings are not, by design, generalizable. The sample simply does not permit the authors to portray their study as emblematic of the Mexican migrant worker informal experience in the United States.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0486613411423900">
<title>2.2 Literature</title>
<p>While there is a growing literature of Mexican informality in Mexico and in the United States, many important works are not consulted. Perhaps this was a function of the journal issue in which the CKR paper appeared, where articles were shortened into a proceedings format. Nevertheless, a classic reference for informality and the academic issues and perspectives revolving around informality in Mexico and Latin America compiled by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0486613411423900">Rakowski (1994)</xref> is absent. The various economic works by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0486613411423900">Maloney and colleagues (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0486613411423900">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0486613411423900">1999</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0486613411423900">Woodruff and colleagues (2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0486613411423900">2008</xref>) concerning informality in Mexico are also omitted. Works that focus on undocumented Mexicans in the United States include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0486613411423900">Hondagneu-Sotelo and colleagues (2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0486613411423900">2007</xref>), Pisani and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0486613411423900">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0486613411423900">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0486613411423900">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0486613411423900">2002</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0486613411423900">Richardson (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0486613411423900">1999</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0486613411423900">Staudt (1998)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0486613411423900">Ward (1999)</xref>.</p>
<p>Hondagneu-Sotelo and colleagues and Pisani and colleagues focus on informal maids and informal gardeners in different regions of the United States, Los Angeles, and South Texas, respectively. Richardson devotes chapters to undocumented Mexican maids and undocumented workers in South Texas. Staudt studies cross-border informality, mostly from a political science perspective, in the El Paso-Ciudad Juárez metroplex. Ward examines informal housing in Texas and Mexico. Though <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0486613411423900">Cobb, King, and Rodriguez (2009)</xref> cite one of Hondagneu-Sotelo’s works, it is not the most prominent of her writings in the area. These works are critical to the understanding of Mexican undocumented immigrant informal work experience and the CKR article would have benefitted much from the consultation of the extant literature cited above.</p>
<p>By examining this literature, Cobb, King, and Rodriguez would have uncovered previous conceptualizations of the informality continuum. In 2002, Pisani and others defined a mid-section of the informality labor continuum uncovered in South Texas as “pseudo-legality.” In essence, a pseudo-legal status permitted an immigrant to be legally inside the United States, but not to work in the United States. This intermediate status, made possible through partial documentation (e.g., a border crossing card, Mexican passport), allows one to legally cross the border and to be legally in the United States, but does not permit one to legally work in the United States; hence, the turn toward the informal economy for those in this intermediate status who wish to be (self-)employed and earn income in the United States. Later work redefined and modeled this intermediate status as “quasi-documented” and expanded the informal continuum to those also legally able to work, incorporating a range of (un)documented possibilities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0486613411423900">Pisani, Richardson, and Patrick 2008</xref>: 29). All of this predates CKR’s spectrum of formality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0486613411423900">
<title>2.3 Key Findings</title>
<p>Each of CKR’s five key findings has already been established in the literature, making this exploratory study more confirmatory in nature. While Mexican migrants are heavily concentrated in a few job categories, CKR note that 50 percent of their sample falls into 4 job categories and 100 percent falls into 11 categories. We have found a much wider assortment of job categories in our recent survey of over 675 informals in South Texas, identifying over 20 informal job categories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0486613411423900">3</xref></sup> A few examples of these jobs include child care givers, photographers, field workers, mechanics, plumbers, electricians, computer technicians, gardeners, maids, food vendors, itinerant street vendors, and waiters/waitresses. Perhaps a larger and more diverse sample or multiple locations would have yielded more variance in job categories for CKR, but their results do not apply to the entirety of the United States.</p>
<p>As nearly every Mexican illegal immigrant who comes to the United States without proper work and/or visa authorization comes to improve her/his lot in life, it is no surprise that these workers benefit from informal employment conditions. For without worker informality, this group could not have access to the economic system for which they migrated. Hence key finding number two is part and parcel of the Mexican migrant economic condition into the United States and an obvious observation. Social networks or social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0486613411423900">Portes 1998</xref>) have long played a role in the migrant experience and have been critical components in the improvement of personal and group well-being for those accessing the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0486613411423900">Bourdieu 1985</xref>). The result by CKR is in line with the literature.</p>
<p>In a comprehensive study of more than 2,650 day laborers throughout the United States, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0486613411423900">Valenzuela et al. (2006)</xref> found a wide dispersion in wages, wages earned primarily by Mexican migrants doing informal work. Though day labor averaged $10 per hour, one-fourth of jobs paid more than $12. We also found a large distribution of wages in our study of 675 informal laborers in South Texas. Though wages are generally lower in South Texas (in our survey informal hourly wages averaged $7.52), wages within one standard deviation varied $13.38 per hour. Here we cannot agree with CKR that there is little variance in informal earnings in the United States.</p>
<p>Last, the notion that informal workers may float between formal and informal jobs or second jobs has been established in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0486613411423900">Pisani and Pagán 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0486613411423900">Roberts 1989</xref>). In our study of home gardeners in South Texas, we found that those with the documentation to legally be and work in the United States more often than not opted to engage their gardener trade informally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0486613411423900">Pisani and Yoskowitz 2006</xref>). In essence, those with the most documentation and with other formal employment (and health and pension benefits) chose to “cherry pick” the best gardening jobs on a part-time basis. In summary, the five key findings elucidated by Cobb, King, and Rodriguez have already been established in or refuted by the extant literature.</p>

<title>3. Conclusion</title>
<p>In this rejoinder, I have commented on the paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0486613411423900">Cobb, King, and Rodriguez (2009)</xref> recently published in this journal. The topic, Mexican migrant workers and their mostly undocumented and informal work experiences, is an important one. However, care must be taken in the research enterprise to elucidate and generalize about populations who mostly work hidden from government purview. In my critique of CKR, I am most concerned with the scope of their findings in light of their restricted and regional sample, reported methodology, incomplete literature review, generalizations, and divergence with the current literature.</p>
<p>New directions which incorporate innovative research designs are necessary to study economic informality because of the hidden nature of informal work. Concerning Mexican migrants and methodology, the research works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0486613411423900">Valenzuela et al. (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0486613411423900">Staudt (1998)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0486613411423900">Richardson (1999)</xref> are most illustrative and also highlight the importance of regional affects and culture. Beyond research methodology, conceptualizing Mexican migrant work deserves greater attention particularly within a political economy framework. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0486613411423900">Pisani, Richardson, and Patrick (2008)</xref> in their work on Mexican migrants from South Texas have found structural impediments to formal work as a result of public policy surrounding welfare, food aid, and health security. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0486613411423900">Pisani and Patrick (2002)</xref> also note the importance of the national institutional framework in bolstering informal outcomes. Last, understanding informal (self-)employment choice is critical to studying Mexican labor informality in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0486613411423900">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>I believe further study of this phenomenon will enable policy makers to better understand the ramifications of public policy decisions. Both intended and unintended public policies at once foster, facilitate, and inhibit informal work. From the building of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to proposed immigration reform, public policy continues to impact and direct the lives of millions of Mexican migrants living and working in the United States.</p>

<p>From the article with regards to the restaurant sample, several important methodological questions remained unclear, such as: did all of these migrant workers come from the same restaurant? From the same family? From the same location in Mexico? What were the ages of the sample? What percentage were women? How were underground activities distinguished from informal ones? What questions were asked? Was a uniform survey instrument employed in each interview? Was each interview recorded and transcribed? How was rapport established (e.g., access gained, relationships built) since economic informality is a criminal offense? For the Mexican consulate sample, new questions emerge, such as: were all of those interviewed Mexican? How long had they been in Portland or the United States? Of working age? When were they interviewed? During harvest season? Did they all work in informal concerns? How long had they been working or how many hours per week did they work when work was available? Last, the reader should be better informed as to the extent the research was literature based.</p>
