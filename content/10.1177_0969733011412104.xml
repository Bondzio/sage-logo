<abstract>
<p>This analysis examines the practice of care providers in residential aged care lying to residents with dementia. Qualitative data were collected through multiple methods. Data here represents perceptions from registered and enrolled nurses, personal care assistants, and allied health professionals from five residential aged care facilities located in Queensland, Australia. Care providers in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) lie to residents with dementia. Lying is conceptualized as therapeutic whereby the care provider’s intent is to eliminate harm and also control behaviour. Care providers of residents with dementia in RACFs need guidance around lying. An ethical framework cognisant of an ethical theory of good and ethical theory of right supplemented by a theory of virtue is proposed. A complimentary four stage communication strategy that promotes truth telling as a first option while also recommending the lie as a suitable strategy is also promoted.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Typically, an article of this kind would concern itself with definitions about lying, deception and truth-telling. A detailed treatise is beyond the scope of this article, although a thorough analysis of these concepts exists elsewhere<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011412104">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733011412104">2</xref>
</sup> in this journal. Wood-Mitchell and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733011412104">3</xref>
</sup> indicate that specific to the care context under review here, there is actually no widely accepted definition of what constitutes deception in dementia care. Some have suggested that to benevolently deceive is to lie.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011412104">4</xref>
</sup> More recently, in this context, others suggest withholding the truth is not in itself identical with lying.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733011412104">5</xref>
</sup> This latter sentiment resonates with deontologists who adhere to strict rules against lying. Fried (cited in Davis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733011412104">6</xref>
</sup>) who proffers a deontological spin on lying, declares ‘lying is wrong, while withholding a truth which another needs may be perfectly permissible – but that is because withholding a truth is not lying’. A most insightful opinion about truth-telling and lying, pertinent to the forthcoming discussion, is expressed as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>Telling the truth means something different according to the particular situation in which one stands… the essential character of the lie is to be found at a far deeper level than in the discrepancy between thought and speech.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733011412104">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Previous findings among personal care assistants in the residential aged care facility (RACF) demonstrated that truth-telling is wholly instrumental. This means that rather than having intrinsic worth, truth-telling is evaluated and operationalized for the sake of the patient and/or the care provider. That is, to meet best interests.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733011412104">8</xref>
</sup> Elsewhere, I review arguments <italic>for</italic> truth-telling and they include: upholding autonomy; physical benefit whereby openly informed persons seek and tolerate treatments; psychological benefit whereby fear, anxiety are reduced and coping increased in the company of open disclosure; and because truth-telling is intrinsically good. Alternatively, the argument relevant here <italic>against</italic> truth-telling, and therefore supporting deceptive practices, includes preventing psychological harm to others (i.e. non-disclosure eliminates distress, anguish, depression).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011412104">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Maintaining a resident’s autonomy as the argument <italic>against</italic> lying resides in the logic that deception fails to respect another as a self-determining, self-governing being. The lying care provider controls the thinking of the resident with dementia, and as such the resident with dementia is limited in acting and pursuing ends in a way freely chosen. To this, counter arguments exist recommending that the resident forfeits autonomy when mentally incompetent. That is, the resident with dementia can be incompetent to be involved in decisions regarding their stay, care and treatment in the RACF and incompetence is incongruent with autonomy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733011412104">5</xref>
</sup> Others agree, suggesting as dementia may render another incapable of autonomous decisions, a lie exists in a context of an already violated autonomy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011412104">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Research indicates that the lie does in fact exist in the dementia care context. Family care providers of those with Alzheimer’s disease engaged in deception that is both routinized and contextualized.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011412104">9</xref>
</sup> Elsewhere described as extensive, even endemic in dementia care settings,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011412104">10</xref>
</sup> deception in the form of lying by caregivers is facilitated by the Alzheimer person’s failing awareness and decreasing cognitive capacity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011412104">9</xref>
</sup> So, care staff admit to lying frequently to people with dementia in a variety of care settings, including residential aged care facilities. In their research, James and colleagues concluded that lying is pervasive across all types of settings demonstrating that 96.4% (<italic>n</italic> = 112) of care providers relied on lying as a communicative strategy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011412104">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Where reasons were forthcoming, the rationale for deception among family care givers in the Alzheimer family is that it manages behaviour rather than manages or controls information. Overall, care givers of persons with Alzheimer’s disease rationalize that the use of deceptive practices is in everyone’s best interests.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011412104">9</xref>
</sup> Lies are told to ease the resident’s distress, family’s distress, improve compliance and to save time.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733011412104">12</xref>
</sup> Typically, lies were told to ease the residents’ distress when they asked to see either ‘an absent/deceased spouse/friend/pet, or to leave the care setting to go home/work’ and ‘to improve care/medications compliance’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011412104">11</xref>
</sup> Complementary findings suggest that residential aged care facility care staff evaluated as acceptable those lies used to protect another from injury or harm but less acceptable those lies used to get a resistant resident to take important medication.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011412104">10</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, when the outcome of open disclosure or truth-telling would be aggression by the resident, the lie is much more forthcoming. In addition, generally staff are also validating the resident’s reality by telling a lie that fits in with the resident’s ‘world’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733011412104">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Where care staff are lying to residents justified on the grounds of enhancing the recipient’s well-being, the ethical correctness is justified on the consequences. An opposite view would vehemently proclaim lying as always wrong irrespective of the foreseeable good (see Tuckett<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733011412104">13</xref>
</sup> for a description and critique of utilitarianism and deontology). I have written elsewhere that in telling the truth, intention is important.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733011412104">14</xref>
</sup> Beneficence and non-maleficence might then direct another to be deceptive on the grounds that truth disclosure to a resident will cause distress;<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733011412104">15</xref>
</sup> anguish and depression<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733011412104">16</xref>
</sup> and anger.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733011412104">17</xref>
</sup> Substantial opposition exists to the notion that truth-telling is harmful.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733011412104">18</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733011412104"/>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733011412104"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733011412104">23</xref>
</sup> However, this latter view is expressed in the context of the competent care receiver, none of these directs the argument in the context of persons with failing awareness and a decreasing cognitive capacity typical of a resident with dementia.</p>
<p>Opponents of lying argue that the ‘use of lies is unethical and that it can never be person-centred’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011412104">11</xref>
</sup> However, the care provider working with confused residents can rely on a number of communicative strategies and the lie is but one of these – where it meets the resident’s need and as such then is person-centred and therapeutic.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733011412104">3</xref>
</sup> Complementary views recommend that in the context of Alzheimer’s disease, care giver responses are situationally emergent;<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011412104">9</xref>
</sup> in other words, understanding care giver utterances require an appreciation of the contextual basis of or a situated ethics.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733011412104">24</xref>
</sup> Preston,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733011412104">25</xref>
</sup> citing the case of a nurse Tanya when interacting with a resident with Alzheimer’s disease, concludes that the rule ‘never tell lies’ as unhelpful in this case and significantly, he states that ‘clearer guidance about ‘truth-telling’ be given to cover such dilemmas in the health care professions’.</p>
<p>This is not to suggest that lying in dementia care is without risk or misgiving. The litmus test for using lying is trust. Lies will be acceptable if trust is not damaged or where so, only temporarily.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733011412104">26</xref>
</sup> Family members caring for kin with Alzheimer’s disease, who rely on lying as a communicative strategy, ‘must deal with their misgivings about how they have violated the normal expectations of intimacy and trust’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011412104">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Based on findings reported elsewhere from a larger study<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733011412104">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733011412104">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733011412104">28</xref>
</sup> the understanding and meanings care providers hold about truth-telling (and lying) requires an understanding of the context in which communication occurs. The perceptions the care providers have about the residential aged care facility (RACF), how they describe it as ‘Home away from home’ (and what this means), as a place of little time and a plethora of situations have implications for the operation of truth-telling as a whole.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733011412104">27</xref>

</sup> To this end, the larger study objectives were<list list-type="bullet">

<title>Sample and setting</title>
<p>Across the five, privately operated residential aged care facilities located in Queensland, Australia, 19 residents, 23 carers, and 15 registered nurses participated in the larger study. Findings here are derived specifically from five Registered Nurses (RN), seven personal care assistants (PCA), three Diversional Therapists (Div. Th), a physiotherapist (Physio) and two enrolled nurses (EN). In the course of the larger study, enrolled nurses and the physiotherapist aligned themselves in the personal carer grouping, not the Registered Nurse grouping.

Operational techniques such as atypical (negative case) analysis, the constant comparison of data, member checking, peer review, and method(ological) and investigator triangulation were also employed.<sup>

<p>The essence of analysis involved the comparison of pieces of data judged to belong to a particular theme, in an effort to recognize the common feature of that theme. Incidents or events were coded (labeled) in terms of as many themes as were relevant and then these incidents or events within the theme compared. The aim was to develop a set of logical themes and associated characteristics (exemplified also by sub themes) which together formed a ‘story’. Ongoing developmental analysis meant that the themes became guides for further analysis of data as the themes in turn were integrated through theorizing. Such a process meant that early themes were often subsumed within this unification of ideas (see<sup>

<def>
<p>We have a lot of people in extra services and that’s my area who do have some type of dementia… there are very few, very few people who don’t and I’m just not sure of the ratio… a lot of them.</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list>
</p>
<p>In light of this, any discussion about telling another the truth in residential aged care must include an analysis of data that associates dementia and truth (telling).</p>
<p>This stated, it is noteworthy that, on the one hand a nurse recognizes that a resident with dementia has insight or awareness. The nurse recalled a resident, ‘Brian’:
<def-list>
<def-item>
<term>RACF3, RN2:</term>

<def>
<p>Yes. So, he knows… So, it’s very strange and it’s just uncanny how they pick up on things.</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list>
</p>
<p>On the other hand, there was a perception ‘people’ with dementia are considered unable to ‘understand’ so that:<def-list>
<def-item>
<term>RACF1, RN1:</term>
<def>
<p>[I]f they’re not able to comprehend, even in lying they [demented persons] wouldn’t even understand what you’re saying. You could tell them the sky’s blue. Whatever the conversation, your answer’s not relevant because they don’t even understand it, those demented people don’t.</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list>
</p>
<p>As a consequence, the care provider that holds to this latter understanding regarding dementia and truth-telling will act so as to say whatever they, the care provider, likes. The resident with dementia is considered incapable of understanding fact or fiction.</p>

<title>Consequentialism</title>
<p>Consequentialism describes the modus operandi care providers use to determine their actions and justify their course of action. Their action is dependent upon the consequences of that action.</p>
<p>By comparison to sentiments expressed above, a nurse (RACF3, RN2) later revealed that in the company of an ‘upset and crying’ resident with dementia who is continually asking all the time ‘Did so-and-so ring?’ she might: <def-list>
<def-item>
<term>RACF3, RN2:</term>
<def>
<p>even say if so-and-so has not rung. I might even say, ‘So-and-so did ring but I couldn’t get you down to the phone’ or something like that. [O]ften you’ll find that will calm them down.</p>

</def-item>
</def-list>
</p>
<p>Within the RACF3 group discussion a nurse manager spoke about truth-telling in the context of a resident with dementia: <def-list>
<def-item>
<term>RACF3, RN1:</term>
<def>
<p>I have lied about 10 times today. One to a resident because she is going to a dementia unit and she wants to know if it is in – and I know the only way she is going to accept it, if I say yes, so that’s a lie…</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list>
</p>
<p>A colleague responded and a personal care assistant at RACF1 agreed: <def-list>
<def-item>
<term>RACF3, RN3:</term>
<def>
<p>We actually get into their reality, and I mean what we say is not the truth… So, and that settles her down.</p>

</def-item>
<def-item>
<term>RACF3, RN2:</term>
<def>
<p>Someone is asking for the bus and I said, ‘Look, I’m sorry but you have missed it’. [Y]ou tell them whatever they want to hear, that you know is going to calm them down. To me it is not out and out lying…</p>

<p>there is one particular woman [resident] here who wants to run away all the time. You settle her down by telling her that the trains are on strike.</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list>
</p>
<p>The confirmation of the dementia resident’s reality is ‘not out and out lying’ since the nurse’s intention is the therapeutic response of ‘settling’. The nurses here consider communication with dementia residents to be making false statements for another’s well being: <def-list>
<def-item>

<p>A distinction is made between the ‘out and out lying’ and the dementia ‘colour(ed)’, ‘calm(ing)’, ‘benefi(cent)’ lies. An insight into the meaning of ‘colouring the truth’ for benefit emerged in a follow-up interview. In this interview, a RACF3 Registered Nurse explained the use of ‘fudge phone calls’: <def-list>
<def-item>
<term>RACF3, RN2:</term>
<def>
<p>I’ve got a woman at the moment who continually goes on about her sons. ‘Have they rung? Have they done this?’ I say ‘Yes’… [W]e can’t be phoning all the time… So I now actually do what we call ‘fudge phone calls’, where I pick up the phone and maybe dial my phone number. I’ve got an answer machine so I just let it ring. Or I just pick up the phone and I won’t push ‘out’ for out… I’ll just dial the number and just hold it there. That calms her down… I’ve also got a deal with [Greg] her son, and if [Greg] answers, I’ll say, ‘Oh, he’s not home today’. And [Greg] says, ‘OK, Bye’. And I just hold the phone there a bit longer as it is ringing.</p>

<title>Confirmation</title>
<p>Confirmation describes the care providers understanding of validation. In essence, validation as an approach to dementia care accepts the reality and personal truth of another’s experience.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, a care provider defined validation: <def-list>
<def-item>
<term>RACF4, Div. Th:</term>
<def>
<p>It’s much better to validate with them and let them think what’s in their mind is real than to disillusion them. They are happier in their little world…</p>

<term>RACF1, PCA2:</term>
<def>
<p>Sometimes residents will take to you for some reason. You remind them of someone from their past and what harm is it doing to be that person if it makes the resident feel more content.</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list>
</p>
<p>The care providers recognize that the resident with dementia exists in a reality removed from the real world (understood to be true). Communication with the dementia resident requires validation of the resident’s reality. This communicative process is described in the context of dementia care, as: <def-list>

<p>that’s why we have to tell a lot of lies. Because it’s for their benefit.</p>

</p>
<p>Finally, the communicative process with residents perceived to have dementia was described as ‘bullshit’: <def-list>
<def-item>
<term>RACF5, EN:</term>
<def>
<p>I bullshit with those residents who are not in reality. You play along with them, those with dementia. You need to get in with them in their own reality.</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list>
</p>
<p>The care providers construct validating (dementia truth) the dementia resident’s reality as benevolent lying. The carers’ recognize that the reality she occupies is separate from the resident’s reality (a false reality from the carer’s perspective).</p>
<p>While care providers here recognized validation as a therapeutic response appropriate in dementia care, some care provider data evidenced some inconsistency about this.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0969733011412104">
<title>Confusion and contrariness</title>
<p>Confusion and contrariness describe the emergence from within the data about an uncertainty, a difference of opinion among care providers, about the communicative interventions or therapeutic strategies utilised.</p>
<p>A diversional therapist’s criticism in her personal journal describes her discontent about a family’s request that staff should not tell a resident with dementia that the resident’s husband has died: <def-list>
<def-item>
<term>RACF2, Div.Th:</term>
<def>
<p>While saying there are occasions where not telling the truth can achieve certain goals there have been situations where I have disagreed with family members not telling the truth to a resident. A resident who had dementia and was German… One day her husband died but the family members would not and did not want staff to try and communicate the situation to her… The mother became more and more withdrawn… and within one year died herself. Even though technically it was not lying, it was not telling the truth, but treating the resident as if she did not have any feelings just because she had dementia… I still do not understand why the family chose this line of action and whenever I saw her, I could almost feel her pain.</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list>
</p>
<p>The RACF2 care provider group, and this diversional therapist in particular, were critical of the request by the family based on assumptions about dementia. These care providers were critical of this family invoking the rule ‘Don’t tell Mum’,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733011412104">27</xref>
</sup> but use this rule with other residents when it is determined by themselves and with perceived justification. Even though a personal care assistant within the group recognized that family use the rule for the same reasons as the care providers themselves (i.e. resident to ‘feel at ease’) the care providers defend their use of the rule over and above that of the family’s.</p>
<p>In contrast to the RACF2 care provider group’s discontent, but consistent with personal carers’ role and practices, a personal care assistant from a different residential aged care facility agreed with the non-disclosure request. Reflecting in her journal, the personal care assistant wrote: <def-list>
<def-item>
<term>RACF1, PCA8:</term>
<def>
<p>I have had a similar situation here. The wife was in a serious car accident and the husband Mr [Smith] [is our resident] we weren’t allowed to tell him what happened to his wife. Mr [Smith] has dementia… I had told him his wife is having a rest and she’ll be up later in the day and or she’s just phoned and she’s running late… [W]e had lied to him… this had calmed him down and eased his mind that his wife hasn’t left him or doesn’t love him anymore. We as personal carers have the obligation to help our residents in any way possible for the safety of them.</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list>
</p>
<p>The truth is omitted and a response provided that calms the resident’s anxious state. A nurse manager reflecting in her journal expressed a different uncertainty: <def-list>
<def-item>
<term>RACF2, RN3:</term>
<def>
<p>this is difficult with dementia. A recent thought on whether the placement of a fake bus stop is a betrayal… If projects like this produce calmness then it could be claimed a useful exercise.</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list>
</p>
<p>Later this was elaborated in an interview: <def-list>
<def-item>
<term>RACF3, RN3:</term>
<def>
<p>[Above] is saying that in dementia they use tactics that aren’t truthful to produce calmness but it isn’t truthful and I do have some difficulties probably with some… strategies that are like… depends on how extreme it’s done I suppose. It is therapeutic but it is still not telling the truth.</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list>
</p>
<p>‘This is difficult with dementia’ – truth-telling is difficult with a resident with dementia. The presentation of the ‘fake bus stop’ is thought to be a ‘betrayal’. Validation is thought to be a ‘betrayal’. Fakery is ‘useful’ if it ‘produce(s) calmness’. Validation is useful fakery but a betrayal. Such validation requires ‘not telling the truth’. This Registered Nurse demonstrates a moral stress.</p>
<p>With some collective opinion among care providers, about the communicative interventions or therapeutic strategies utilised, there also emerged among the personal care assistants a difference in understanding about dementia care per se and the communicative processes deemed appropriate. <def-list>
<def-item>
<term>RACF2, PCA2:</term>
<def>
<p>I work in a dementia care unit… I don’t very often have the pleasure of saying ‘This person is in full control of their faculties’, and so perhaps with my experience of working in a dementia unit you sometimes are without rules, guidelines, props, something – you know. It can be very difficult.</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list>
</p>
<p>For example, this personal carer is uncertain about the place of orientation and confirming another’s reality:<def-list>
<def-item>
<term>RACF2, PCA2:</term>
<def>
<p>Yes there is truth. There is their [resident’s] truth which is a real truth to them. I mean someone with dementia, don’t they, their truth and its quite true to them… [S]o maybe you convince somebody who is living in that truth, that’s not true… you know?</p>

<def>
<p>do you need to?</p>

<def-item>
<term>RACF2, Physio:</term>
<def>
<p>Isn’t that the trend in dementia care now? To go into their reality rather than trying to fall back to ours.</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list>
</p>
<p>The care providers express a difference of opinion about dementia (depending on the type). Here a colleague confirms validation (dementia truth) as appropriate rather than drawing the resident into the carer’s reality.</p>
<p>A colleague in the same group concedes maneuvering or bending the truth in an effort to ‘get them back to some form of reality’. She said in the group: <def-list>
<def-item>
<term>RACF2, PCA5:</term>
<def>
<p>Sometimes you have to maneuver the truth around a little bit, just to fit the circumstances, you know, because you are going to increase their anxiety. [Y]ou more or less come around… You go to’em and say: ‘How long is it since you’ve seen Grandad? Or you bring that into the conversation and they start thinking, some of them do, even with dementia, ‘Oh I haven’t seen him for a long time. He could be dead’, so you get them back to some form of reality.</p>
</def>
</def-item>
<def-item>
<term>AT:</term>
<def>
<p>Are you saying this in the context of those with dementia or…</p>
</def>
</def-item>
<def-item>
<term>RACF2, PCA5:</term>
<def>
<p>Even those without dementia, some form of loss of memory – short term memory or long term. Its not all dementia. Its just loss of memory isn’t it?</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list>
</p>
<p>Within this personal care assistant group, to be kind to residents with dementia, old age, memory loss (short or long term) and with ‘everything against them’ (RACF2, PCA4), requires a twist, a bend that maneuvers the truth. The personal care assistant’s (PCA5) concluding remark places the strategy for bringing ‘them back to some form of reality’ as appropriate for residents with dementia, short or long term memory loss. This carer’s proposition is to orientate the resident to reality. Adding to a contrary view about validation (dementia truth) a personal care assistant writing in her personal journal about a woman who had Alzheimer’s, concluded: <def-list>
<def-item>
<term>RACF4, PCA1</term>
<def>
<p>Playing with a person’s head who has dementia is one of the lowest forms of abuse I can think of. I have seen a case where a resident has asked a nurse where the bus stop is because he/she is going to catch the bus and go home. Instead of ‘diverting’ the Resident onto another thought track, the nurse had told the Resident that the bus stop is just outside… The Resident can be sitting there waiting for a ‘non existing’ bus, but is now out of the way and not pestering the nurse. Eventually another nurse will find the Resident… and gently guide the resident inside and ‘divert’ their attention onto another activity. To me that is a lie and anyone who derives pleasure from this form of ‘abuse’ should not be in a Nursing Home or have any employment where they are in contact with other people.</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list>
</p>
<p>The commentary in the personal care assistant’s journal stands in contrast to an ‘understanding of dementia’ (RACF3, RN3) in which the nurses perceive their actions as ‘not out and out lying’ (RACF3, RN2) since ‘lie isn’t going to hurt’ but rather ‘colouring the truth as beneficial’ (RACF3, RN2) to the resident with dementia. Likewise, this personal care assistant’s understanding is in contrast to an understanding that with dementia residents, the care provider ‘play(s) along’ (RACF3, EN) in the resident’s reality, ‘tell lies for (resident’s) benefit’ (RACF3, Div. Th) and that a care provider ought to ‘validate with them’ since ‘what is in (the resident’s) mind is real’ so that carers ‘stretch the truth in a nice way’ (RACF4, Div. Th).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The revelation that care providers, nursing, care and allied health staff lie to residents with dementia in residential aged care and with justification, risks an outcry in some quarters.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0969733011412104">50</xref>
</sup> Over time the resident with dementia does have a failing cognitive competence and ability to comprehend. As a consequence, this resident is increasingly less able to perceive logic or detect the care provider’s use of deceptive practices.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011412104">9</xref>
</sup> It follows, the resident will not understand and soon forget. However, a caution is required if everyone in the RACF is perceived to have dementia and deceptive practices become the norm rather than an option. Evidence here indicates that those with dementia can exhibit awareness, therefore every effort should be made to determine the resident’s level of insight over time (and attendant diminishing level of cognitive competence) to ensure decisions to deceive are genuinely in the resident’s best interest.</p>
<p>The care providers here premise their deceiving on the grounds that the false utterance has at its heart the welfare of the resident. That is, in the context of the resident with dementia, falsehood has the consequent effect of harm minimization by preventing or reducing anxiety, stress or other high emotions perceived to be of no benefit to the resident for whom they care. The ‘character of the lie’<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733011412104">7</xref>
</sup> at least for these care providers, aligns itself with the view that intention is central to truth-telling.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733011412104">14</xref>
</sup> In essence, the lying is therapeutic.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733011412104">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Lying that is therapeutic can be understood in the context of compassion, thought of as an intensive form of benevolence and its companion, nonmaleficence.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0969733011412104">51</xref>
</sup> A predisposition to act according to beneficence means that a care provider acts for the good of the resident, for the resident’s well-being. Beneficence has been described as ‘concern for the well-being’<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0969733011412104">52</xref>
</sup> and, most commonly, ‘above all do good’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0969733011412104">53</xref>
</sup> In considering the use of a lie premised on this consequentialist ledger, whereby there is a weighing up of good over bad outcomes, circumstances could exist in dementia care where the lie actually prevents a resident from wandering away from a RACF only to be standing in the middle of a busy bus way intersection.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733011412104">24</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Care providers here do rely on minor lies (or white lies, also labelled therapeutic fibs) that fit into the resident’s reality but also lies of this type that create a different reality.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733011412104">24</xref>
</sup> The care providers’ examples highlight their use to not only eliminate (potential) harm but also control behaviour. As such, the care provider’s response is about controlling behaviour rather than information, per se.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011412104">9</xref>
</sup> While a first caution has been previously made about deceptive practices becoming the norm rather than an option, a second caution is also required. Not surprisingly evidence in this study indicates that the RACF care providers engage in validation, albeit with some uncertainty among care provider type. Herein the second caution: where this engagement takes place it is undertaken even though the best available evidence indicates that the basis for validation therapy is poor.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0969733011412104">54</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>What is clear is that the care providers of residents with dementia in RACFs need guidance around lying. Writers in this area have espoused a pragmatic approach that is person-centred and thus based on a situational ethic.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011412104">10</xref>
</sup> Others argued that because the care-giver and care-receiver no longer share the same reality, ‘the ideals of ethics and right and wrong are reformulated’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733011412104">24</xref>
</sup> It is not clear that ethics needs to be reformulated.</p>
<p>The elementary ethic of the fitting<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733011412104">13</xref>
</sup> or what Preston<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733011412104">25</xref>
</sup> describes more comprehensively as an ethic of response, reconciles the tension between what a ‘nurse ought to do’ with ‘who a nurse ought to be’ when confronted with lying as an option to a person with dementia. That is, reconciles adherence to competing rules/principles like: ‘Thou shalt not lie’/’Above all, do good’ with the type of person or character that is prized. The question the care provider asks for addressing situations where truth-telling becomes a dilemma with residents with dementia is: ‘What is the <italic>fitting</italic> response?’ (original italics<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733011412104">25</xref>
</sup>).</p>
<p>Both ethicists provide an ethical framework cognisant of the fact that no ethical theory of good (consequentialism/utilitarianism) or ethical theory of right (deontology) are in themselves complete guides to action without being supplemented by a theory of virtue.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733011412104">13</xref>
</sup> Virtue-based ethical theory can assist in the moral life of care providers as choices or conflicts between rules or principles of obligations are not necessarily clarified by those theories described as act theory (e.g. utilitarianism as a type of consequentialism; and deontology). Giving virtue-based theory some precedence to guide is recommended, since rules or principles within act theory do not in themselves tell us how to apply them.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733011412104">13</xref>
</sup> In the specific context of the resident with dementia in the RACF, what is advocated is the virtuous care provider who is<disp-quote>
<p>[the] person we trust… one who has an ingrained motivation and desire to perform right actions. Not the rule follower, then, but the person disposed by character to be generous, caring, compassionate, sympathetic, fair and the like, is the one… [to] recommend, admire, praise and hold up as a moral model.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0969733011412104">55</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Consistent with this ethical framework, practical advice already exists. James and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011412104">11</xref>
</sup> and others<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011412104">10</xref>
</sup> offer guidelines for care providers who opt to lie to a resident with dementia. Premised on a person-centred approach these guidelines include ‘taking an individualized approach, agreeing clear definitions about what is considered a lie and using a lie if they are in the best interests of a person’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011412104">10</xref>
</sup> Complementing these guidelines, recommendations have been made to include:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>use of a care plan to ensure consistency (everyone is telling the same lie);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>document rationale for the approach;</p>

<p>Furthermore, this same group provide a four stage communication strategy that promotes truth-telling as a first option while also recommending the lie as a suitable strategy.<sup>

<p>Of interest, Dutch nursing home findings exemplified the communication strategy evidencing Stage 2 and 3 above, whereby the nurse ‘translated and transformed’ (Stage 2) the need of the resident with dementia who want to get out of the facility into a response about being cold; and ‘distracted’ (Stage 3) through suggesting they engage in a communal activity.<sup>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Evidence exists that care providers in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) lie to residents with dementia. While true, care providers have a responsibility to determine the resident’s level of insight over time to ensure decisions to deceive are genuinely in the resident’s best interest. In the context of lying to a resident with dementia, lying is conceptualized as therapeutic. Understood by reference to compassion, the care provider’s intent is to eliminate harm and also control behaviour. Care providers of residents with dementia in RACFs need guidance around lying. An ethical framework cognisant of an ethical theory of good (consequentialism/utilitarianism) and ethical theory of right (deontology) supplemented by a theory of virtue is discussed. A complementary four stage communication strategy that promotes truth-telling as a first option while also recommending the lie as a suitable strategy is also promoted.</p>
<p>Finally, a third caution is required. The potential damage to trust between the nurse and the resident with dementia remains when the lie is exercised. Consequently, telling a lie even in this context always requires careful consideration. The Golden Rule for the care provider ought to be: ‘Would I have it done unto me?’ Further research is required to address this and also to determine among residents with dementia: ‘Would they choose to have it done unto themselves?’</p>
