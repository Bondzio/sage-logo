<p>The two books being reviewed explore overlapping themes—environmental history and the history of nomadic peoples—that have emerged into the mainstream in recent years. <italic>The British Empire and the Natural World</italic> collects the papers of a workshop, featuring some new contributions in the field and some writings that have already appeared elsewhere in other formats. <italic>Subjugating Nomads</italic> is a doctoral thesis converted into a monograph. Despite the differences in structure and scope, there is a common ground between these books, which is the intent to explore how the British Empire in South Asia changed the common lands and the commons-dependent peoples from a two-sided imperative, the desire to establish administrative control and the desire to aid commercialisation.</p>
<p><italic>The British Empire and the Natural World</italic> is the outcome of a colloquium that has come together from time to time to revisit the environmental history of South Asia and produce collections of new research papers, recruiting new members on each occasion. The organisers of the colloquium, and many of the contributors, have been deeply influenced by Richard Grove’s path-breaking work in the field, especially his discussion of the influence of the phenomenon of ‘desiccation’ upon the making of forest policy in the colonised tropics. Fittingly, the book is dedicated to Grove.</p>
<p>Environmental history of South Asia started as an account of how the Empire disturbed traditional practices of sustainable use of the commons in order to enable commercial exploitation of minerals, forest products and crops, which commerce expanded in the era of industrialisation. In a further turn of the historiography, another drive to regulate nature was acknowledged, a conservationist one motivated by the desiccation discourse. More recently, a yet third driver behind imperial policy has received attention, representation of nature as a wild space occupied by autochthonous inhabitants located on the margins of settled agricultural society. Integration of spaces like these needed efforts to regulate them, often with consequences on the environment. The editorial introduction discusses these developments, suggesting that by expanding the analytical focus in this way, researchers in the field have moved beyond writing national environmental histories, and have begun to study ‘the global nature of the range of colonial interventions’ (p. 8).</p>
<p>For some examples of how this agenda is pursued, AparnaVaidik’s essay suggests that the British represented the Andaman as an ‘islands’, which connoted wilderness and isolation, and that this bias ‘further relegated these islands into isolation’ (p. 34). Daniel Rycroft considers the interesting survey reports of the Rajmahal Hills written by the early nineteenth century army officer Walter Sherwill, and believes that the technique of ‘visual narratives .. legitimated the domination over subaltern groups’ (p. 62; Sherwill’s pencil drawings apparently unnerved the Santals). Christopher V. Hill deals with a relatively obscure chapter in the public works drive of the mid-nineteenth century, the Coopers Hill engineering college. Although it was short-lived, the college consciously cultivated ‘a spirit of the empire’, according to this account (p. 81). Deborah Sutton shows how the local discourse on forest preservation and regeneration, in this case in the Nilgiri plateau, differed from the pan-regional one owing to the entanglement of the interests of European settlers, including coffee planters. After the 1882 Madras Forest Act, the ‘establishment of the exotic plantations of forests’ replaced ‘natural forests’ as the standard option (p. 87). Jayeeta Sharma delves into the nineteenth century beginning of tea estates in Assam. The description of European enterprise covers a ground that is well-known, but the chapter also offers a novel discussion of the Assamese elite response and participation in the enterprise.</p>
<p>B. Eswara Rao, Praveen Singh, and Peter L. Schmitthenner discuss colonial hydraulic projects, which phrase includes irrigation schemes (in the case of Rao and Schmitthenner, the Godavari and the Cauvery anicuts) as well as embankments for flood control (Bihar, studied by Singh). Singh presents an account of how embankments, owing to misjudgement of geography and faulty institutions, worsened the problem of floods. By comparison, the anicuts were less disruptive on the environment and more successful as productive infrastructure projects. Asoka Kumar Sen studies the Hos of Singhbhum in a chapter that explores ‘how notions about the tribal communal self were marked by specific ecological features, involving the recurrent modifications of their lives and productive ecological spaces’ (p. 202). I am not sure if the chapter does this; but it is a useful economic history of the community. The two final chapters are written by D.G. Donovan and S. Abdul Thaha. Both study ‘forests at the edge of empire’ (Donovan), Nepal in one case and the princely state of Hyderabad in another. The chapters are well written and useful as narrative histories, and show that similar kind of forces had been at work in these regions as there were inside the Empire. Yet, neither region was part of the British Empire, which leads me to a criticism of the volume and the colloquium.</p>
<p>The research collective producing these useful studies has decided to anchor environmental history firmly in imperial history. The tendency reflects a long cultivated habit of thinking about the nineteenth century as a series of transformations wrought by British design to ‘commodify and regulate’ Indian society. But then, the British Empire ruled only over half the space of South Asia. And even within the half that it governed, it had limited powers to regulate anything. Indeed, it was an unusually weak state in fiscal terms. There were many forces of change relevant for environmental history that the Empire did not really give shape to but merely adapted to. Some of these factors were demography, trade, migration, industrialisation, and natural disasters. Painting environmental history with a uniform coat of imperial design does not lead to an elegant or useful model. The laboured attempt by the Nepal chapter to integrate its material into the main currents of British Indian history serves as an example.</p>
<p>The paradigm of imperial design pervades Bhangiya Bhukya’s work on the Lambadas of Hyderabad state as well. Fortunately, the subject matter is an original one, and Bhukya’s narrative history stays close to the sources, making this first systematic book-length work on the bullock-caravan runners a groundbreaking addition to the economic and social history of colonial India.</p>
<p>The Lambadas formed a subgroup, rather a cluster of subgroups, within the broader category known as the ‘banjara’. The main field of operation of the Lambadas was the territory of the princely state of Hyderabad. However, being mobile transporters and traders, they needed to traverse British India and the lands of a number of princely states. They were vital to the commercial world of the arid interior and forested uplands of southern-central India, which had few navigable rivers, and had few roads suitable for wheeled traffic until the railway era. Although the presence of bullock caravans in these regions was recorded from the time the influence of the Delhi Sultanate extended southward, the caravan runners seemed to acquire a special prominence with organized military campaigns and warfare in the Deccan between 1670 and 1818. East India Company records and contemporary travel narratives, therefore, contain much valuable material on them. The book begins from the end of the boom, and drawing upon these resources, describes in detail the social and commercial organisation of the communities. A revealing feature of the description is the presence of strict marriage rules and their enforcement by community elders, a feature that would remind the reader of the structure of many business groups in this time. A somewhat puzzling feature of the early history was the intense rivalry and conflict between the subgroups. The book suggests economic as well as political motivations behind these conflicts, but the details in this regard are insufficient.</p>
<p>Having set out the backdrop, the major part of the book deals with the decline and change in the livelihood of the Lambadas. The railways and enclosure of the common lands as farms or forests deprived them of markets and pastures. Another major effect came from the replacement of mobile and temporary markets by stationary markets of towns which are here called ‘regulated markets’.A yet third factor in the decline, the cessation of warfare in the Deccan, gets less notice in the work. While they lost access to livelihoods as transporters, and by implication as traders as well, numerous members of these groups started as peasants, in which move the introduction of the ryotwari settlement in Hyderabad helped. Although not professional cultivators on a large scale in periods before, the fact that the Lambadas possessed and understood bullocks was an asset in the conduct of agriculture. The business of caravan running did not decline suddenly. Indeed, one of the striking aspects of the account is the slow pace of the transformation. This is explained by the many obstacles, institutional and technical, that came in the way of a large-scale and successful transition into peasanthood. One institutional obstacle came from the colonial state’s policy to designate mobile groups as ‘criminal’ (which policy the Hyderabad state emulated). The last sections of the book describe these measures and how marginality and recreated memory went into the construction of Lambada political identity in postcolonial India.</p>
<p>The larger aim of the book, we are told,is to investigate how ‘the British colonial state sought to transform Indian society’ (p. 236). This is a rather strange aim, since Hyderabad was not part of the British colonial state. British India and the princely states did not work in tandem in matters of economic and social policy. As Richard Temple said, ‘there was always dispute between the British higher officials and their Hyderabadi subordinate officials’ (quoted on p. 167). Besides policy, in geographical, economic, and cultural terms too, the larger princely states represented substantially autonomous worlds, different amongst themselves, and different from the deltas, the coasts, and the riparian plains where British power concentrated.</p>
<p>The Lambada story could be allowed to tell us something about the political-economic world of the princely states. It could be allowed to tell us about the economic institutions of trade reliant on the caravans, which was so common in south-central India and so different from the well-researched commercial world of the littoral. Instead of contributing to these new discourses, which remain buried under the shibboleths about colonial power that dominate the historiography of India, the author decides to follow the gurus of postcolonial and subaltern studies to make colonial power the centre of the book. That complaint notwithstanding, I have much admiration for this impressive work. The offbeat subject matter and an effective treatment thereof make this book a very important addition to the history of modern India.</p>
