<p>The therapeutic misconception (TM) has received considerable attention because it is thought to pose a pervasive obstacle to obtaining informed consent and ensuring ethical research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774512456778">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774512456778">2</xref>]. The 10-item questionnaire developed by Appelbaum and colleagues is designed to help eliminate this obstacle by identifying individuals who are at increased risk of having the TM. Because the authors’ work is careful and thorough, development of the questionnaire, and the process likely to accompany it, also provides perhaps the first real opportunity to assess the practical impact of efforts to reduce the TM.</p>
<p>Scholarship on the TM began in 1982 based on findings that subjects did not understand central aspects of their studies, including the use of placebos and blinding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774512456778">3</xref>]. The authors concluded that these shortcomings traced to the subjects’ tendency to assume that clinical research is just like clinical care. Specifically, the subjects did not appreciate that the primary goal of clinical research is to benefit future patients and that, as a result, clinical research uses methods designed to collect valid data, not to benefit present subjects. This analysis of subjects’ lack of understanding has been widely endorsed, and has led to the view that presence of the TM makes it difficult, if not impossible, for potential subjects to understand what they should understand to give informed consent for clinical research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774512456778">4</xref>].</p>
<p>While Appelbaum and colleagues do not describe the process by which the 10-item questionnaire might be used to help dispel the TM, the following four steps seem to provide a reasonable approach: (1) administer the questionnaire, (2) code and score the responses to determine which individuals are at increased risk of having the TM, (3) evaluate individuals identified as being at increased risk to determine whether they have the TM, and (4) explain the fundamental differences between research and care for those who have the TM.</p>
<p>Assuming the 10 questions take 1 min each to administer, and 5 min in aggregate to code and score, steps 1–2 will take approximately 15 min. Follow-up evaluation to determine whether individuals who are identified as being at increased risk in fact have the TM might take about half as long as the semi-structured interview used by Appelbaum and colleagues to determine which individuals have the TM, or about 15 min. Although explanation of the fundamental differences between research and care can take significant time in individuals who have not previously considered these issues, steps 1–3 provide a good deal of background to the TM. Hence, step 4 might take 10 min on average.</p>
<p>These tentative estimates suggest that identifying and dispelling the TM might take approximately 15 min for each individual evaluated, 30 min for individuals identified as being at increased risk of the TM, and up to 40 min on average for those who have the TM. Given the items included in the questionnaire, this process will help potential subjects to understand three things: research studies are designed primarily to benefit future patients, research studies often do not provide the best treatment available, and the present study may not provide the best treatment available.</p>
<p>The process of identifying and dispelling the TM thus removes a potential barrier to adequate subject understanding. Yet this process does not explain the central aspects of the study in question, including the fact that the study involves research, its purpose, procedures, risks, potential benefits, alternatives, and fact that participation is voluntary. Hence, investigators who complete steps 1–4 will then have to explain these items. This raises the question of whether it makes sense to take the time to first dispel the TM. There seem to be at least three reasons why this might make sense.</p>
<p>First, this process might be worthwhile if the questionnaire successfully identifies which individuals have the TM, and individuals who have the TM cannot adequately understand the study in question. The accuracy of the questionnaire is 0.682, somewhat below the midpoint between random guessing (0.5) and perfect accuracy (1.0), implying that the process often will not be successful. In particular, if the cutoff score at which individuals are regarded as being at increased risk of the TM is set to emphasize the sensitivity of the questionnaire, almost everyone evaluated will undergo at least the 30 min evaluation, including many who do not have the TM. If the cutoff score is set to emphasize specificity, the evaluation will fail to identify many individuals who have the TM.</p>
<p>More importantly, proponents of the TM often seem to assume that its presence precludes individuals from understanding the study in question. Yet, the fact that some, perhaps many individuals’ failure to understand the study in question traces to a failure to appreciate the fundamental differences between research and care does not imply that individuals must understand the fundamental differences between research and care before they can understand the study in question. Many potential subjects may be able to understand the central aspects of the present study – the fact that it involves research, its purpose, procedures, risks, potential benefits, alternatives, and fact that participation is voluntary – despite failing to appreciate that research studies in general are designed to benefit others and often use methods designed to collect valid data, not to benefit present subjects.</p>
<p>Imagine that the potential subjects of a phase II study do not appreciate that it involves five extra research blood draws because they think research is just like clinical care. A targeted explanation of this fact may be sufficient for them to understand, without investigators having to explain the purpose and methods of research in general. This is just one example, and there will be potential subjects with the TM who are unable to understand. At the same time, there are likely to be many subjects who can understand the central aspects of the study in question despite presence of the TM.</p>
<p>Second, recognizing that the process of identifying and dispelling the TM may not be necessary for many potential subjects, this process might still be useful if it focused on things potential subjects should understand for most or all studies. In principle, there does not seem to be any reason to think this will be the case. The decision of whether an item is included in the TM assessment depends on whether it is useful for helping to identify and eliminate this potential obstacle to adequate understanding across a broad range of studies. The fact that an item is useful for this purpose does not imply that it addresses an aspect of the present study which subjects should understand. The 10 items included in the final questionnaire provide the opportunity to estimate the extent to which this will be the case.</p>
<p>Discussion of the nature of research in general as part of the TM assessment should help potential subjects to understand the fact that the present study involves research. The questionnaire also includes four questions (Table 4: questions 1, 4, 7, and 8), which clarify the possibility that the present study may not provide subjects with the best treatment available. These four items likely provide useful background to help potential subjects understand the potential benefits of the present study.</p>
<p>The remaining six questions focus on differences between research and care in general. For example, one question asks whether ‘Being in a research study almost always provides the best possible treatment for a sick person’. Another asks whether ‘A researcher’s most important task is to make sure that the research will help the people who participate’. While these items were found to be useful for predicting presence of the TM across a range of studies, they do not seem to be things potential subjects need to understand to give consent for individual studies. This suggests that approximately half of the TM evaluation addresses things individuals do not need to understand to give informed consent.</p>
<p>Perhaps more worrisome, because the items used to assess presence of the TM were selected based on their relevance across a range of studies, they have the potential to undermine potential subjects’ understanding of specific studies. For example, the four questions intended to clarify that the present study may not provide the best treatments available have the potential to confuse potential subjects when the present study does provide the best treatment, or the best treatment does not work for the potential subjects, or there is no established best treatment for the condition under study.</p>
<p>Third, the process of identifying and eliminating the TM might be valuable to the extent that it helps to enrich subject appreciation for the present study. Specifically, discussion of research in general may provide a greater appreciation for the nature of the present study. While this seems plausible, there are many things which could enrich potential subjects’ understanding. Subjects would have a richer understanding if they understood the different types of scientific and ethical review the study underwent, and what the reviewers regarded as the study’s strengths and weaknesses. Before investigators spend time explaining these things, it seems important to make sure that potential subjects understand the central aspects of the studies in which they participate. This is especially important given significant data that many research subjects do not understand one or more of the central aspects of their studies, including the risks and fact that participation is voluntary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774512456778">5</xref>].</p>
<p>The present analysis raises the question of whether it might be better for investigators to start by explaining the central aspects of the study in question. Typically, this will involve explanation of the fact that the study involves research, its purpose, procedures, risks, potential benefits, alternatives, and the fact that participation is voluntary. This process could then evaluate subject understanding of these items, and clarify any items not understood. When targeted explanation does not yield sufficient understanding, and there remains good reason to enroll individuals, investigators could try to identify the source(s) of their confusion. Some may be distracted, or anxious, and need time to relax. As the work by Appelbaum and colleagues highlights, others may not be able to understand the present study until they appreciate the fundamental differences between research and care.</p>
<p>This study specific approach has several advantages over the TM approach. First, by focusing on the things subjects should understand to consent to the present study, this process is likely to take less time on average. Second, by minimizing discussion of other items, this approach may minimize investigator and subject confusion regarding what potential subjects should understand. Third, a study-specific approach limits evaluation of potential sources of confusion to those who are not able to understand despite explanation and a targeted educational intervention. Fourth, this approach does not assume that any one potential source of confusion is the most important, but instead allows investigators to direct their evaluation of potential sources of confusion to those that seem most likely to be operative for the present individual.</p>
<p>In summary, identifying and dispelling the TM up front would be valuable if: most or all individuals with the TM cannot understand the central aspects of the study in question, this process primarily addresses central aspects of the study, or this process helps to enrich subject understanding. Evaluation of the 10-item questionnaire developed by Appelbaum and colleagues, and the process likely to accompany it, suggests that the TM may represent an insuperable obstacle to understanding for some potential subjects. However, this seems unlikely to be true for many potential subjects. In addition, approximately half of the process of evaluating the TM addresses items that are not relevant to the central aspects of the present study. Finally, while the process of identifying and dispelling the TM could enrich subject understanding, this is likely true of many things. However, investigators should not address these things until potential subjects understand the central aspects of the study in question. This analysis suggests that, rather than focus up front on one potential source of confusion, it may be better to first explain and evaluate understanding of the central aspects of the present study. This approach recognizes that dispelling the TM may be important in some cases, but reserves this process for the likely minority of individuals who are not able to understand the study despite explanation and targeted educational intervention, remain potential subjects, and whose confusion does not trace to other sources.</p>
