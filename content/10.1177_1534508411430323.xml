<abstract>
<p>There has been increased attention to the development of assessment measures for evaluating mathematical skills in young children in order to inform instruction and intervention. However, existing tools have focused primarily on number sense with little attention to other areas of mathematical thinking such as geometry and algebra. The purpose of this study is to describe preliminary reliability and validity evidence for several curriculum-based measures designed to assess mathematical skills in preschool children. Interscorer, test–retest, alternate-form reliability, and concurrent validity of five tasks—Cardinality, Pattern Completion, Shape Naming Fluency, Shape Selection Fluency, and Shape Composition—were examined in a small sample of preschool-age children at risk for academic difficulties because of demographic characteristics. Results indicated strong interscorer reliability, moderate to strong test–retest reliability, and adequate alternate-form reliability. Concurrent validity coefficients ranged from weak and nonsignificant to strong, positive significant correlations. However, non-domain specific correlations were demonstrated, and there was no clear pattern of convergent and divergent validity. Findings are discussed in the context of necessary research in early math measurement for preschoolers.</p>

<body>
<p>In order to promote national mathematics competency, it is important to establish effective early assessment practices to inform instruction and intervention. A number of assessments have been developed to monitor young children’s acquisition and mastery of key mathematical competencies, including curriculum-based measures (CBM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534508411430323">Deno, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534508411430323">1989</xref>). These assessments are standardized in format and are presented as brief, timed samples of performance that typically measure the fluency of behaviors associated with targeted outcomes (e.g., number of numerals read correctly in a minute in the case of early mathematics). CBM has increased utility for screening and progress monitoring purposes because of the time- and cost-efficient features of the instruments, their links to important outcomes, and their potential for informing instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534508411430323">Snyder, Wixson, Talapatra, &amp; Roach, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534508411430323">VanDerHeyden, 2005</xref>). Assessments that can be used repeatedly across time provide a means of evaluating children’s skill development and making necessary instructional changes to accelerate development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534508411430323">VanDerHeyden &amp; Snyder, 2006</xref>). The use of CBM assessment in preschool settings, in particular, facilitates early identification of children who may not be developing foundational mathematical skills and enables teachers to design instruction and intervention based on children’s individual needs.</p>
<p>Whereas research on the utility of CBM with older children is established, research focusing on young children is in its infancy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534508411430323">Deno, 2003</xref>). A literature review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534508411430323">Foegen, Jiban, &amp; Deno, 2007</xref>) identified 17 studies targeting curriculum-based math measures for elementary students, but only four addressing early mathematics (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534508411430323">Chard, Clarke, Baker, Otterstedt, Braun, &amp; Katz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534508411430323">Clarke &amp; Shinn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534508411430323">VanderHeyden, Broussard, Fabre, Stanley, LeGendere, &amp; Creppell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534508411430323">VanDerHeyden, Witt, Naquin, &amp; Noell, 2001</xref>). Specific to preschoolers, five studies have examined technical properties of early math measures (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534508411430323">Floyd, Hojnoski, &amp; Key, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534508411430323">Hojnoski, Floyd, &amp; Silberglitt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534508411430323">Reid, Morgan, DiPerna, &amp; Lei, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534508411430323">VanDerHeyden, Broussard, &amp; Cooley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534508411430323">VanDerHeyden et al., 2004</xref>). An additional study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534508411430323">Lei, Wu, DiPerna, and Morgan (2009)</xref> investigated item selection methods for creating short forms of the numeracy measures developed by Reid et al. Collectively, the studies focusing on early mathematics suggest that scores derived from early CBM tasks demonstrate reliability and certain aspects of validity, and thus have potential as screening and progress monitoring tools that can provide an index of student growth and link to future achievement outcomes. The future of this research is in linking use of CBM to instructional changes and student growth as has been demonstrated with school-age children (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534508411430323">Fuchs, Fuchs, Hamlett, &amp; Stecker, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the promising evidence, existing measures are not without limitations. Notably, existing measures have almost exclusively focused on the domain of number and operations. As defined by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534508411430323">NCTM, 2000</xref>), the area of number and operations is a system for understanding numbers, representing numbers, recognizing relationships among numbers, and understanding number systems. Within a CBM framework, common assessment tasks targeting this domain include oral counting, counting objects, naming printed numerals, comparing quantities, and recognizing or writing numerals. Although the domain of number and operations represents the cornerstone of early mathematical thinking, most of the current measures fail to target the other important domains of early mathematics described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534508411430323">NCTM (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534508411430323">Clements (2004a)</xref>: geometry, measurement, algebra, and data analysis.</p>
<p>Further, in assessing numbers and operations, research teams have neglected to target an important aspect of the understanding of numbers and counting; specifically, cardinality, or the notion that the last counting word represents the cardinality of the set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534508411430323">Clements &amp; Sarama, 2009</xref>). Whereas verbal counting can be completed without reference to specific objects, object counting is the ability to apply the conventional sequence of number words to objects, coordinating counting words with actions such as pointing. Important elements of object counting include the stable order principle, one-to-one principle, and the cardinal principle. Cardinality, or the knowledge that the last count indicates the number of objects in a given set is the “capstone of early numerical knowledge, and the necessary building block for all further work with number and operations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534508411430323">Clements, 2004a</xref>, p. 19). Further, children with knowledge of the cardinality principle have a deeper understanding of the relationship between set sizes and number words, or how number words are assigned to sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534508411430323">Slusser &amp; Sarnecka, 2011</xref>). Accurate verbal and object counting that can be accomplished with little effort and applied strategically to meaningful situations is a critical component of early numerical competence.</p>
<p>Currently, only two studies examining measures of early mathematics have explored domains outside of number and operations (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534508411430323">Reid, Morgan, DiPerna, &amp; Lei, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534508411430323">VanDerHeyden et al., 2004</xref>). Reid and colleagues developed the <italic>Early Arithmetic and Reading Learning Indicators</italic> (EARLI) that included six mathematics screening and progress-monitoring tasks: measurement, number identification, counting aloud, pattern recognition, subitizing, and counting objects. The pattern recognition task, which targets the algebra strand of early mathematics, requires children to identify patterns using short sequences of basic shapes (i.e., circle, square, and triangle). The measurement task requires students to identify basic measurement concepts (e.g., taller, shorter, higher, lower) using basic shapes. In general, the mathematics tasks as a whole exhibited strong item and scale reliability analyses and moderate to strong concurrent correlations with the Math Reasoning, Applied Problems, and Quantitative Concepts scores of the <italic>Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement–Third Edition</italic> (WJ-III; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534508411430323">Woodcock, McGrew, &amp; Mather, 2001</xref>). Although this work extended the focus beyond numbers and operations, none of the EARLI tasks directly targeted the geometry or algebra strand of mathematics as shape was embedded in the pattern task, making it difficult to separate the two skills.</p>
<p>In contrast, the curriculum-based measures of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534508411430323">VanDerHeyden et al. (2004</xref>; i.e., number identification, number naming, counting objects, visual discrimination, and shape identification) included a task that specifically targeted geometry skills as represented by a shape identification task. The Choose Shape task required children to point to the shape that the evaluator named out of four shapes arranged in a row. The task consisted of 10 items, sampling five shapes (i.e., triangle, circle, square, rectangle, and star) twice. Correct answers consisted of touching the shape named by the researcher within 5 s. The shape-naming task demonstrated the weakest alternate-form reliability of the six math tasks. Further, in terms of criterion-related validity, the task did not yield a statistically significant correlation with the Brigance Screen which measures broad academic skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534508411430323">Brigance, 1985</xref>), and it demonstrated weak to moderate correlations with the <italic>Test of Early Mathematics Ability–Second Edition</italic> (TEMA-2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534508411430323">Ginsburg &amp; Baroody, 1990</xref>) that measures math-specific ability. As a result, the task was deemed unacceptable for use by practitioners and was not included in a later study examining these measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534508411430323">VanDerHeyden, Broussard, &amp; Cooley, 2006</xref>). In addition to inadequate psychometric properties, the Choose Shape task only included four basic shapes, only included two-dimensional representations of shapes, and presented shapes in a prototypical fashion. These features of the task result in limited data regarding a child’s skill in naming a range of shapes, knowledge of three-dimensional shapes, and knowledge of shapes in forms other than the prototypical form (e.g., elongated rectangle, right triangle, isosceles triangle).</p>
<p>Geometric and spatial reasoning forms the foundation of much learning of mathematics and other subjects such as science, engineering, art, and architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534508411430323">Clements, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534508411430323">National Council of Teachers of Mathematics [NCTM], 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534508411430323">National Research Council, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534508411430323">Sarama &amp; Clements, 2009</xref>). Geometry, together with measurement, is proposed as the second area of emphasis for young children, following numbers and operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534508411430323">Clements &amp; Sarama, 2009</xref>). Geometry skills help young children mentally structure the spaces and objects in their world and provide a context for the development of mathematical reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534508411430323">National Research Council, 2009</xref>). Among the skills that should be emphasized in preschool to help children develop foundational geometry and spatial thinking are the ability to recognize basic two-dimensional shapes (e.g., square, circle, triangle), variations of two-dimensional shapes (e.g., basic shapes of different sizes and orientations), basic three-dimensional shapes (e.g., cube, sphere), and more abstract shapes (e.g., rhombus, hexagon; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534508411430323">Clements, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534508411430323">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534508411430323">National Research Council, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534508411430323">NCTM, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534508411430323">Sarama &amp; Clements, 2009</xref>). By 3 years of age, children should begin recognizing, matching, and comparing typically oriented shapes, and by 4 years, they should be able to do the same with shapes of less typical orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534508411430323">Sarama &amp; Clements, 2009</xref>). Children should also develop skills in combining shapes into pictures and synthesizing combinations of shapes into composite shapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534508411430323">Clements, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534508411430323">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534508411430323">National Research Council, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534508411430323">NCTM, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534508411430323">Sarama &amp; Clements, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Shape composition is related to the mathematical ability to visualize patterns. Broadly speaking, patterns represent a foundational concept for mathematics. Patterns are evident in perceptual arrangement (i.e., drum beats, domino patterns), in the words used for counting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534508411430323">Wu, 2007</xref>), the composition of number and shape, and arithmetic combinations (i.e., doubles such as 5 + 5). Patterning can be defined as “the search for mathematical regularities and structures” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534508411430323">Clements &amp; Sarama, 2009</xref>, p. 190). In preschool, patterning often is represented by children making patterns of color, shape, or object. Although this activity may not address explicitly the role that patterns play in mathematical understanding, it is a beginning step in building representations of pattern and structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534508411430323">Clements &amp; Sarama, 2009</xref>). Preschool-age children can learn to copy simple patterns, later extending and creating their own patterns. To assist young children in making generalizations about patterns and structures, connections can be made between different representations of the same pattern. For example, clap, stomp, clap, stomp (an auditory representation) and red, blue, red, blue (a visual representation) both follow a basic AB pattern. Representation and structure are the beginning of algebraic thinking in symbols and mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534508411430323">Clements &amp; Sarama, 2009</xref>). Finally, pattern and structure are related to much of the content in other mathematical domains, including subitizing (e.g., seeing patterns in visual arrays), ordinal thinking (e.g., shouting on every third jump while playing), counting (e.g., by three’s), and operations (e.g., adding zero to any number does not change the number).</p>
<sec id="section1-1534508411430323">
<title>Purpose of the Study</title>
<p>Given the importance of early mathematical skills, the development of assessment tasks that address multiple areas of mathematical skill and knowledge is a critical area for further research. Although some progress has been made in this area, there are limitations of the existing measures that suggest the need for additional research. Thus, the purpose of this study was to develop several additional CBM tasks to assess skills that have been neglected in existing measures and to examine the psychometric properties of scores yielded by the tasks. Specifically, preliminary evidence was gathered for the reliability and validity of three tasks of geometry—Shape Naming Fluency (SNF), Shape Selection Fluency (SSF), and Shape Composition (SC), one pattern completion task (PC), and one cardinality task (CAR). The study specifically addresses the following questions: (a) What is the interscorer reliability of each experimental task? (b) What is the test–retest reliability of each experimental task? (c) What is the alternate-form reliability of each experimental task? and (d) What is the concurrent criterion-related validity with selected measures, or more precisely, the validity of inferences about the relationship between scores on the experimental measures and scores on criterion measures as pertains to early mathematical performance in numbers and shapes?</p>

<sec id="section3-1534508411430323">
<title>Power Analysis</title>
<p>Results of an a priori power analysis revealed that a sample size of 28 was needed for statistical power to be at the .80 level when the statistical significance criterion (α) is at .05 and the minimum correlation coefficient is large (i.e., greater than .50; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508411430323">Cohen, 1992</xref>). That is, a minimum of 28 participants was required for the probability of rejecting a false null hypothesis to be at the .80 level when, in fact, the null should be rejected. In conducting the power analysis, a large correlation coefficient was expected because previous research evaluating the psychometric properties of tasks developed within the same tradition has yielded correlation coefficients greater than .50 (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534508411430323">Floyd, Hojnoski, &amp; Key, 2006</xref>), and they are needed to support the quality of the measures being tested.</p>

<sec id="section4-1534508411430323">
<title>Participants and Setting</title>
<p>The overall sample consisted of 40 children from a public preschool setting located in northeastern Pennsylvania. The preschool primarily served children considered at risk for academic difficulties because of demographic characteristics. Children in the sample were attending a summer school session that was consistent with the instructional routines of the school year. Signed parental consent was obtained for 22 boys and 18 girls ranging in age from 42 to 70 months (<italic>M</italic> = 58 months, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.30) at the beginning of the study. Specific demographic characteristics of the sample are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534508411430323">Table 1</xref>. Children were assessed during program hours in a quiet location outside of the child’s classroom.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>Eight measures of mathematics were administered over the duration of the study, five experimental measures and three criterion measures. The experimental measures were Cardinality (CAR), Pattern Completion (PC), Shape Naming Fluency (SNF), Shape Selection Fluency (SSF), and Shape Composition (SC). Criterion measures were the <italic>Preschool Numeracy Indicators</italic> (PNI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534508411430323">Floyd, Hojnoski, &amp; Key, 2006</xref>), the <italic>Test of Early Mathematics Ability–Third Edition</italic> (TEMA-3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534508411430323">Ginsburg &amp; Baroody, 2003</xref>), and the Numbers/Counting, Sizes/Comparisons, Shapes, Direction/Position, and Quantity subtests of the <italic>Bracken Basic Concepts Scale–Third Edition: Receptive</italic> (BBCS-3:R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534508411430323">Bracken, 2006</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section6-1534508411430323">
<title>Measure development</title>
<p>Experimental measures were developed through a review of existing curriculum-based assessments and preschool mathematics curricula, as well as developmental research on early mathematics and standards for early childhood mathematics education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534508411430323">Clements, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534508411430323">NCTM, 2000</xref>). Each area targeted in the experimental tasks represents an important dimension of early mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534508411430323">Clements &amp; Sarama, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534508411430323">Sarama &amp; Clements, 2009</xref>) and has been largely unaddressed in most recent measurement efforts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1534508411430323">
<title>Cardinality (CAR)</title>
<p>Items for cardinality (CAR) were selected using the learning trajectories described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534508411430323">Clements and Sarama (2009)</xref> and were designed to encompass the development of counting and cardinality from small sets of no more than 5 to sets larger than 10. CAR consists of three items: the first item samples counting and cardinality using sets of 4 or 5, the second item samples counting and cardinality using sets of 9 or 10, and the third item samples counting and cardinality using sets of 18 or 20. Sets consist of black circles arranged in columns and rows on an 8.5- × 11-inch page. Each CAR item consists of two parts. First, children are asked to count the circles on the page, using one-to-one correspondence, touching each circle as they count. Once the child has finished counting the circles, the examiner asks, “How many circles did you count?” Each CAR item also is scored in two parts. Children earn a point for each circle counted correctly with one-to-one correspondence, regardless of the number of circles in the set. For example, if a child counts 5 of 8 circles correctly with one-to-one correspondence, a score of 5 is recorded. Children earn an additional point for answering the cardinality question correctly. So, if the child responds “5” when asked “how many circles did you count?” an additional point is recorded for a total of 6 points. The total CAR score is the sum of circles counted correctly with one-to-one correspondence for each item and correct responses to the cardinality question. If the child in the example responded “3” to the cardinality question, then a score of 5 is recorded, representing the five circles counted correctly with one-to-one correspondence. CAR consists of two parallel forms in which the total score is identical but composed of different numbers at the item level.</p>

<sec id="section8-1534508411430323">
<title>Pattern Completion (PC)</title>
<p>Patterns for the experimental pattern task are those that were included in the majority of the curricula reviewed, and include basic AB, ABBA, and ABC patterns. Each pattern type is repeated five times for a total of 15 items. To address concerns about earlier research using shapes for the pattern task (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534508411430323">Reid et al., 2006</xref>), colors were used in the present experimental task. In creating the items, three primary colors of red, blue, and yellow were used, and the correct color response was distributed across the items. For example, in the AB pattern of red–blue–red–blue, red is the correct response on three of the items and blue is the correct response on two of the items. In addition, the task includes a pretest to establish the child’s mastery of the colors used in the task. PC requires children to respond to a pattern presented visually and described orally by the examiner by selecting the color that “comes next.” Following the color pretest, examiners model the task using an ABAB pattern. The child practices using a sample item consisting of an ABC pattern and is provided with corrective feedback if needed. During task administration, 15 patterns are presented one at a time on 8.5- × 11-inch pages in rapid succession for 1 min. If the child does not respond within 5 s, the examiner turns to the next page. If the child incorrectly responds, no corrective feedback is given. PC yields a fluency score that results from multiplying the total number of correct items by 60 and dividing the product by the child’s time of completion. Time of completion for all children who do not respond to all items correctly is 60 s. PC consists of two parallel forms in which the items are presented in a different, specific order.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1534508411430323">
<title>Shape Tasks (SSF, SNF, SC)</title>
<p>Shapes for the experimental shape tasks were included if they were identified as targeted vocabulary in at least three of the six preschool mathematics curricula reviewed. Two-dimensional shapes were circle, square, triangle, and rectangle, and the three-dimensional shapes were cube, sphere, and cylinder. Both the Shape Naming Fluency (SNF) and Shape Selection Fluency (SSF) tasks are composed of 28 items with each of the shapes targeted as the correct response four times. In SSF, each of the shapes was also represented in equal proportions when it was not targeted as the correct answer, but rather was presented as a filler shape. Because it is important for children to recognize different variations of shapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534508411430323">Clements, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534508411430323">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534508411430323">National Research Council, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534508411430323">NCTM, 2000</xref>), triangles, rectangles, cubes, and cylinders were presented in various forms (e.g., elongated rectangle, right triangle, isosceles triangle). In addition, rectangles and cylinders varied in terms of orientation (i.e., horizontal or vertical). Consideration was given to the proportion in which shapes in various forms and orientations were presented. For example, half of the rectangles and cylinders were presented horizontally and half vertically. For the shapes of various forms (i.e., rectangle, triangle, cube, and cylinder), half were presented in their most typical representation in preschool mathematics curricula (e.g., equilateral triangle) whereas the other half were presented in the alternative form (e.g., right triangle, isosceles triangle).</p>
<p>In order to maintain an appropriate developmental level in terms of task difficulty, the Shape Composition (SC) task contains only two-dimensional shapes. Shape composition involves combining shapes into pictures and synthesizing combinations of shapes into new shapes (i.e., composite shapes), first through trial and error and gradually by attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534508411430323">Clements, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534508411430323">Sarama &amp; Clements, 2009</xref>). When decomposing shapes, preschoolers first rely on concrete cues to direct the decomposition (e.g., lines within a shape designating smaller shapes) and later decompose shapes flexibly using independently generated imagery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534508411430323">Clements, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534508411430323">Sarama &amp; Clements, 2009</xref>). The SC task focuses on the initial stages of composing and decomposing by providing students with pictures composed of shapes that are concretely broken down into basic shapes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1534508411430323">
<title>Shape Naming Fluency (SNF)</title>
<p>SNF requires children to say the names of shapes as they are presented one at a time on 8.5- × 11-inch pages. Examiners model the task using a sample that consists of the presentation of three shapes (i.e., circle, triangle, and cube). The child practices using the same sample items and the examiner provides corrective feedback if needed. During task administration, examiners present up to 28 pages in rapid succession for 1 min. If the child does not name the shape within 3 s, the examiner turns to the next page. If the child incorrectly names the shape, no corrective feedback is given. If the child incorrectly names the first 10 shapes, the task is discontinued and a zero is recorded as the SNF score. This task yields a single fluency score that results from multiplying the total number of correct items by 60 and dividing the product by the child’s time of completion. Time of completion for all children who do not respond to all items correctly is 60 s. SNF consists of two parallel forms in which the items are presented in a different, specific order.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1534508411430323">
<title>Shape Selection Fluency (SSF)</title>
<p>SSF requires children to point to the shape the examiner names from four shapes that are depicted in a random arrangement on 8.5- × 11-inch pages. Examiners model the task using a sample. The child is then provided with three opportunities to practice using the same sample and two additional samples. If needed, corrective feedback is given on the sample items. The child must respond correctly to at least one of the sample items in order to be administered the task. If the child responds incorrectly to all sample items, the task is discontinued and score of zero is recorded for SSF. During task administration, examiners present up to 28 pages in rapid succession for 1 min. If the child points to the incorrect shape or does not respond within 3 s, the examiner turns to the next page without providing corrective feedback. The SSF task yields a single fluency score that is derived by multiplying the total number-correct items by 60 and dividing the product by the child’s time of completion. Time of completion for all children who do not respond to all items correctly is 60 s. SSF consists of two parallel forms in which the items are presented in a different, specific order.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1534508411430323">
<title>Shape Composition (SC)</title>
<p>SC requires children to name the two-dimensional shapes that are arranged in the form of a composite picture. Each picture is illustrated on an 8.5- × 11-inch page and contains three to four shapes; a shape may be presented more than one time in the same picture. Examiners model the task using a sample picture (i.e., mouse). The child is then provided with three opportunities to practice using the same sample and two additional samples (i.e., truck, flower). The examiner provides corrective feedback on the first two samples. The child must identify at least one of the shapes in the samples to be administered the task. During task administration, the child is presented with a picture and asked to name the shapes he or she sees. The child is instructed that he or she only has to name each shape one time, even if more than one of a shape is illustrated. Children have 5 s to begin to say the names of the shapes they see in the picture, after which the examiner presents the next page without corrective feedback. If the child is in the process of saying the names at the 5-s mark, the examiner allows the child to finish responding and marks the response correct or incorrect. The SC task yields a total score derived by adding the total number of shapes identified correctly. There are two parallel forms in which the model and sample items are the same, but the composite pictures for the testing items are different.</p>

<sec id="section13-1534508411430323">
<title>Preschool Numeracy Indicators (PNIs)</title>
<p>The PNIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534508411430323">Floyd et al., 2006</xref>) consist of four tasks: Quantity Comparison Fluency (QCF), Oral Counting Fluency (OCF), One-to-One Correspondence Counting Fluency (OOCCF), and Number Naming Fluency (NNF). All the PNI tasks assess the same latent construct identified as number sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534508411430323">Floyd et al., 2006</xref>). The tasks are described fully in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534508411430323">Hojnoski, Floyd, and Silberglitt (2009)</xref>. Briefly, QCF targets children’s ability to discriminate quantities of objects by asking children to identify which of two boxes presented on an 8.5- × 11-inch page contains more circles. Oral Counting Fluency (OCF) targets children’s ability to state numbers sequentially starting from 1, counting as high as they can in one minute. One-to-One Correspondence Counting Fluency (OOCCF) targets children’s ability to count objects using one-to-one correspondence by asking children to point to and count up to 20 circles printed in a 4 × 5 arrangement. Number Naming Fluency targets children’s ability to name quickly and accurately printed numerals from 0-20 randomly presented on 8.5- × 11-inch pages. All of the tasks are designed to yield a fluency score, using the number of items correct within a 1-minute or 30-second (OOCCF) time frame.</p>
<p>For each of the PNIs, test–retest reliability coefficients ranged from .62 to .91 across a 2- to 4-week interval and from .82 to .96 across a 5- to 7-week interval. Test–retest for the current sample was .40 (QCF), .75 (OCF), .43 (OOCCF), and .75 (NNF) across a 2-week interval. Alternate-form reliability coefficients were reported as .65 (QCF) and .72 (NNF) in previous research. For the current sample, alternate-form reliability coefficients were calculated as .73 (QCF) and .95 (NNF). Correlations corrected for age between PNI and scores from the Bracken Basic Concept Scale-Revised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534508411430323">Bracken, 1998</xref>), <italic>Woodcock Johnson-III</italic> Applied Problems test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534508411430323">Woodcock et al., 2001</xref>), and <italic>Test of Early Mathematics Ability-Third Edition</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534508411430323">Ginsburg &amp; Baroody, 2003</xref>) ranged from .29 to .70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534508411430323">Floyd et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Test of Early Mathematics Ability–Third Edition (TEMA-3)</title>
<p>The TEMA-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534508411430323">Ginsburg &amp; Baroody, 2003</xref>) is a standardized, norm-referenced test targeting informal and formal mathematics skills in the areas of numbering, calculation, number-comparison facility, numeral literacy, mastery of number facts, and understanding of concepts. The TEMA-3 has two parallel forms, and alternate-form reliability is .93 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534508411430323">Ginsburg &amp; Baroody, 2003</xref>). Form A was used in the present study. According to the test manual, 2-week test–retest reliability is .82 for Form A, and the median internal consistency reliability for children 3 to 5 years old is .93 for Form A. The TEMA-3 is not timed and requires approximately 20 min to administer. Concurrent validity with several measures, such as the <italic>Woodcock Johnson III Tests of Achievement</italic> Applied Problems test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534508411430323">Woodcock et al., 2001</xref>) and the <italic>Young Children’s Achievement Test Mathematics Quotient</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534508411430323">Hresko, Peak, Herron, &amp; Bridges, 2000</xref>) is moderate to strong.

Raw scores were used in the analysis consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534508411430323">Arnold, Fisher, Doctoroff, &amp; Dobbs, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Bracken Basic Concepts Scale–Third Edition: Receptive (BBCS-3:R)</title>
<p>The BBCS-3:R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534508411430323">Bracken, 2006</xref>) assesses the understanding of basic concepts in young children between the ages of 3 years 0 months to 6 years 11 months. These concepts consist of colors, letters, numbers/counting, sizes/comparisons, shapes, direction/position, self/social awareness, texture/material, quantity, and time/sequence. The first five subtests comprise the School Readiness Composite (SRC). The SRC and each subtest were included as criterion measures along with the subtests of Direction/Position, and Quantity. These additional subtests were selected because of their mathematical relevance. During the test, the examiner presents four pictures in quadrants, and the child is asked to identify the picture representing the target concept by pointing. According to the test manual, the test–retest reliability of the BBCS-3:R is strong (ranging from .79 to .89.), as is internal consistency (ranging from .91 to .97). For data analysis, raw scores from each subtest were used.</p>

<sec id="section16-1534508411430323">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The authors trained four graduate students in school psychology and special education to administer all assessment tasks for the study. All assessments were reviewed and demonstrated using live presentation. Students were required to complete practice sessions during which procedural fidelity was assessed through observation using checklists for the PNI and BBCS-3:R or the manual and protocol for the TEMA-3. All data collectors met a criterion of at least 95% interscorer agreement prior to collecting data with children.</p>
<p>During the initial phase of assessments, children were administered the experimental tasks followed by the PNIs. The sequence in which the experimental shape tasks were administered was counterbalanced to avoid order effects. CAR and PC were administered following the shape tasks. To obtain an estimate of concurrent validity, children were administered the BBCS-3:R and TEMA-3 on separate days within 3 days of the initial assessment. The sequence in which the BBCS-3:R and TEMA-3 were administered was also counterbalanced. During the second phase of assessments and within 1 week following the initial assessment, children were administered the parallel forms of the experimental tasks to provide an estimate of alternate-form reliability. During the third phase of assessment and within 2 weeks following the initial assessment, children were readministered the original forms of the experimental shape tasks to provide an estimate of test–retest reliability. To provide an estimate of interscorer reliability, the first author simultaneously scored 30% of the administrations of the experimental measures across examiners and assessment dates. Interscorer agreement was calculated as the number of items for which both the data collector and primary investigator agreed plus the number of items for which the scorers disagreed multiplied by 100.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1534508411430323">
<title>Data Analysis Plan</title>
<p>First, the distributional properties of each of the experimental measures were explored.Descriptive statistics for all study measures are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534508411430323">Table 2</xref>. The skewness values of all experimental tasks were within the recommended interval of -2 to +2 (Lomax, 2001). Additionally, kurtosis values for all of the experimental tasks were in the recommended range (Lomax, 2001). The percent of zero scores is an important descriptive statistic as it indicates the presence or absence of a floor effect on a particular task. Examination of the percent zero scores for the experimental measures indicates relative absence of a floor effect with the exception of PC. Standard deviations are not excessively large relative to the mean for all experimental measures except PC. Examination of the range of scores is most restricted for PC and SC. With SC, this is expected as it is not a fluency-based measure with 16 being the highest total score that can be obtained. However, PC is a fluency-based measure and should yield a larger range. The highest score in this sample was 12, indicating that even the highest scoring child did not complete each item in the task.</p>

<p>Reliability and validity. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were calculated between the raw scores of the experimental measures from the first and third phases of assessment to provide an estimate of test–retest reliability. To determine an estimate of alternate-form reliability, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients also were calculated between the raw scores of experimental measures from the first and second phases of assessment for the second sample of children. To assess concurrent criterion-related validity, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients between the raw scores of the experimental measures and raw scores of each of the PNI tasks, the BBCS-3:R subtests, and the TEMA-3 subtests were calculated. According to standards for preschool assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534508411430323">Brassard &amp; Boehm, 2007</xref>), criteria for a strong correlation was .70 to .90, criteria for a moderate correlation was .40 to .70, and criteria for a weak correlation was .20 to .40.</p>
<p>In the event of missing data, the child’s scores were not included in the particular analysis for which the data was missing. For example, if data were available for the first and second assessment phases but not the third assessment phase, the child’s scores were included in the examination of alternate-form reliability though not test–retest reliability.</p>

<p>Descriptive statistics for each of the experimental and criterion measures are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534508411430323">Table 2</xref>. Estimates of point-by-point interscorer agreement for the experimental shape tasks are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1534508411430323">Table 3</xref>. Thirty-three percent of administrations were observed during the initial assessment, 31% of administrations were observed during the alternate-form phase, and 28% of administrations were observed during the test–retest phase. Interscorer reliability was strong for each of the experimental tasks across all assessment phases. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1534508411430323">Table 4</xref> presents the Pearson product–moment correlations representing alternate-form reliability and test–retest reliability for the experimental tasks. One-week alternate-form correlation coefficients were strong for all tasks: .79 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) for CAR; .82 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) for PC; .82 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) for SNF, .78 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) for SSF, and .86 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) for SC. All of the experimental tasks demonstrated strong alternate-form reliability (.78 to .86), with the strongest reliability coefficient for SC. Two-week test–retest correlation coefficients were moderate to strong: .69 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) for CAR; .67 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) for PC; .66 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) for SNF, .78 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) for SSF, and .81 for SC (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Only SSF and SC approached or exceeded the recommended value of .80 for reliability of preschool screening measures for purposes of educational decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534508411430323">Salvia, Ysseldyke, &amp; Bolt, 2010</xref>); however, lower levels of reliability are acceptable for screening instruments that inform instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534508411430323">Brassard &amp; Boehm, 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>Correlations between the experimental tasks and the PNI were weak to moderate. Specifically, correlations between CAR and the four PNI tasks were all statistically significant and moderate in magnitude, with the strongest correlations between CAR and NNF followed by CAR and OOCCF. Correlations between PC and the four PNI tasks were weak to moderate, but still statistically significant with the exception of the correlation between PC and OOCCF. Correlations between the experimental shape tasks and the PNI were weak in magnitude with 4 of 12 correlations not reaching statistical significance. For all three shape tasks, correlations were strongest with NNF followed by OCF.</p>
<p>Both CAR and PC demonstrated statistically significant and strong correlations with the TEMA-3. Further, correlations between the experimental shape tasks and the TEMA-3 were all significant with SNF demonstrating the strongest correlation with the TEMA-3 and SC the weakest correlation. Correlations between CAR and the subtests of the BBCS-3:R were weak to moderate, but all statistically significant. The strongest correlation was between CAR and the School Readiness Composite (SRC) followed by the subtest requiring number identification, Numbers. Weakest correlations were between CAR and Quantity followed by CAR and Colors. For PC and the subtests of the BBCS-3:R, all but one of the correlations were statistically significant. Similar to CAR, the strongest correlation was between PC and Numbers, followed by the SRC. Weak correlations were demonstrated between PC and Colors (nonsignificant) followed by Sizes/Comparisons. Correlations between the shape tasks and the subtests of the BBCS-3:R generally were moderate to strong with the exception of the Sizes/Comparisons subtest, where two of the three correlations were nonsignificant. SNF and SSF correlated most strongly with the SRC whereas SC correlated most strongly with the Shapes subtest. All of the experimental shape tasks demonstrated moderate to strong correlations with the SRC and the Shapes subtest. However, all of the experimental shape tasks also demonstrated moderate to strong correlations with the subtests of Numbers and Letters. In general, SNF demonstrated the weakest correlations with all of the subtests of the BBCS-3:R.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous research has identified early mathematics measures for preschoolers developed in the CBM tradition that are technically adequate (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534508411430323">Floyd et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534508411430323">Reid et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534508411430323">VanDerHeyden et al., 2004</xref>). However, in general, these measures have targeted a common set of related skills (i.e., oral counting, number identification) with limited attention to other number sense skills or other important areas of mathematics such as algebra and geometry. Thus, the purpose of this study was to gather preliminary reliability and validity evidence for additional CBM tasks for preschoolers—Cardinality (CAR), Pattern Completion (PC), Shape Naming Fluency (SNF), Shape Selection Fluency (SSF), and Shape Composition (SC)—developed within the CBM tradition.</p>
<p>The descriptive statistics of the experimental tasks provide preliminary evidence of their promise, with the exception of PC. More specifically, the potential for CAR and the shape tasks to discriminate well across children is supported by small standard deviations relative to the mean, adequate skewness and kurtosis values, and the low percentage of zero scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534508411430323">Hojnoski et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, restriction of range, a high standard deviation relative to the mean, and the high percentage of zero scores suggest that PC is not a viable measure in its current form.</p>
<p>Results indicate that only two of the experimental tasks (i.e., SSF and SC) demonstrate adequate test–retest reliability for screening purposes. However, given that an intended purpose of screening with CBM is to facilitate identification of children who may be in need of additional instruction, reliability may be considered adequate for this context and use of the scores. All experimental tasks demonstrated adequate alternate form reliability with the strongest reliability coefficient for SC. One possible explanation for the weaker test–retest reliability coefficients is the increased time lapse between administrations. Mean scores increased from the initial assessment to the alternate-form reliability phase across tasks, and scores further increased from the alternate-form phase to the 2-week test–retest phase. Skill increases could be due to practice effects, and this gain in scores could have led to a different rank ordering of scores from the initial assessment to the test–retest assessment. Further examination with different samples of children is warranted to more definitively establish this dimension of technical adequacy.</p>
<p>With regard to validity, correlations among the shape tasks are stronger than the correlations with CAR and PC, suggesting that these tasks are more positively related to one another and reflect a similar construct. However, the shape tasks also are significantly and moderately correlated with CAR and PC. The significant and moderate correlations among all of the experimental tasks suggest the tasks are related to one another, and could indicate the tasks measure a similar construct potentially. From one perspective, this is positive as it indicates there is some element common to all of the tasks; that is, perhaps, each of the tasks to some degree represents the broad construct of early mathematics. From another perspective, however, the correlations among the tasks call into question the nature of the construct being measured. Theoretically, if the shape tasks are actually measuring some skill representative of early geometry, we would expect low and perhaps nonsignificant correlations with tasks like CAR and PC that are intended to represent numbers and operations and algebra strands of development, respectively.</p>
<p>The concurrent validity data raise similar questions about the measurement construct as correlations with criterion measures do not demonstrate a clear pattern of relations. With regard to the PNI, correlations between the experimental task most intended to measure an aspect of number sense, CAR, demonstrated the strongest correlations with the PNI tasks whereas the shape tasks demonstrated overall weaker correlations with some nonsignificant. These convergent and divergent data are more what would be expected and suggest, at a correlational level, that the PNI along with CAR measure something different than the shape tasks. This pattern is also evident in the weaker correlations between PC and the PNI tasks. However, a contradictory pattern emerges when examining the correlations between the experimental tasks and the TEMA-3 where all five of the experimental tasks correlated significantly with the TEMA-3, despite the fact that the TEMA-3 contains no items related to shape, pattern, or the broad strands of geometry or algebra. This supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534508411430323">Clements and Sarama’s (2009)</xref> assertion that pattern and structure are evident in areas of numerical thinking and performance. Correlations between the experimental tasks and the SRC and subtests of the BBCS-3:R raise issues about measurement that go beyond the domain of mathematics. For example, each of the experimental tasks demonstrated moderate to strong and significant correlations with the SRC and the Colors and Letter subtests. These correlations would not be predicted if the experimental tasks exclusively measured something mathematical.</p>
<p>In sum, the results of the study provide preliminary evidence that supports the promise of cardinality and a shape task as viable measurement tools. Cardinality is a critical aspect of early numerical knowledge that extends children’s counting abilities in a very meaningful way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534508411430323">Clements &amp; Sarama, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, at about 4 years of age, children are likely to achieve this developmental milestone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534508411430323">Clements &amp; Sarama, 2009</xref>), making cardinality a prime target for preschool assessment of early math skills. Despite its importance, until this study, cardinality has not been included in early math CBM for preschoolers. The cardinality task piloted in this study builds on the One-to-One Counting Correspondence Fluency (OOCCF) task of the PNI in a developmentally significant manner. All of the features of OOCCF (i.e., one-to-one counting, ordered stimuli) are maintained with the modification of increasingly larger sets to count. The use of increasingly larger set sizes corresponds to the developmental progression of the counting skill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534508411430323">Clements &amp; Sarama, 2009</xref>), which potentially facilitates a more precise analysis of children’s developing counting ability. Adding the follow-up question of “How many did you count?” significantly increases the value of this task in our understanding of young children’s developmental sense of counting and number. Finally, unlike OOCCF, a time metric was not used to calculate a fluency score, and thus, the score more accurately represents the child’s performance than when transformed using the procedures for calculating OOCCF. Additional research is needed to examine the CAR task’s concurrent relations and sensitivity to growth over time. Evidence of social and predictive validity and instructional utility also should be part of additional studies to further support the inclusion of this task in preschool math assessment.</p>
<p>Of the three shape tasks evaluated, SSF appears to have the most support as a potential measure as the reliability and validity coefficients were strongest for this measure. Adding a shape task to preschool math assessments as an indicator of geometry broadens the scope of the type of skills measured beyond numbers and operations. Shape is a central concept in general cognitive development, and its importance extends beyond geometry to other areas of mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534508411430323">Clements &amp; Sarama, 2009</xref>). The shapes included in the tasks piloted were selected carefully to represent more advanced conceptualizations of shape with which children should have experience in order to develop a richer conceptual foundation. Although SSF appears to have the most basic psychometric support, as with CAR, additional research is needed to determine its sensitivity to growth over time, social validity, instructional utility, and predictive validity. In addition, recognizing shapes is one dimension of the broader domain of geometry, and although shape is a primary emphasis for preschoolers, geometry includes transformations and symmetry, visualization and spatial reasoning, and locations, directions, and coordinates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534508411430323">Clements, 2004a</xref>). Thus, future research should explore the possibility of tasks that address other areas of geometry, or in the least, the extent to which a shape task may be related to other areas of geometry to serve as a broad indicator of geometric development.</p>
<p>The evidence for the potential of PC as an early math CBM is less clear. Test–retest and alternative form reliability were marginally adequate for a screening task that is not used to make high-stakes decisions. However, a large standard deviation relative to the mean suggests the task would not be good at discriminating between children. In addition, a very high percentage of zero scores (35%) indicates a significant floor effect. Correlations with the TEMA-3 and the BBCS-R:3 range from weak and nonsignificant (i.e., correlation with OOCCF) to strong and statistically significant (i.e., correlation with the TEMA-3). However, correlations appear to be non-domain-specific, raising important measurement questions. Although this task was similar in form to the pattern task in the EARLI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534508411430323">Reid et al., 2006</xref>), the evidence for the current task was not as strong. It appears this task was too difficult for this sample of children and the distributional properties (i.e., restricted range) of the resulting score affected correlations. There were several challenges in creating this task in terms of isolating the construct of interest (i.e., color versus pattern), creating a suitable number of items that sampled across pattern types, consideration for mode of response (e.g., selection versus production), and anticipating children’s response time. These dimensions need to be explored further in developing alternate versions. Recognizing, duplicating, and creating patterns are related to later algebraic thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534508411430323">Clements, 2004a</xref>), and pattern and structure underlie much of the domain of numbers and operations (i.e., subitizing, <italic>n</italic> + 1), spatial thinking (i.e., composition of shapes), and area and volume. Thus, patterns, in some form, may still represent a potentially important and meaningful measurement target.</p>
<p>Several limitations of the current study are relevant when interpreting the results. First, the small sample size raises the issue of the appropriateness of parametric statistics. However, the sample size exceeded that which was recommended based on an a priori power analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508411430323">Cohen, 1992</xref>). Certainly, larger sample sizes are recommended for future measurement development studies. In addition, this sample was primarily children at risk for academic difficulties because of demographic characteristics (e.g., half of the sample had a combined family income below $20,000). The sample’s at-risk academic status was substantiated through scaled scores on the TEMA-3 (<italic>M</italic> = 85.3, <italic>SD</italic> = 12.0) that fell one standard deviation below the mean of the normative, standardization sample (<italic>M</italic> = 100, <italic>SD</italic> = 15) and scaled scores on the SRC of the BBCS-3:R (<italic>M</italic> = 7.8, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.3) that also fell below the mean of the standardization sample (<italic>M</italic> = 10, <italic>SD</italic> = 3). Future research should determine if the experimental tasks yield comparable results with samples of children who are not considered at risk.</p>
<p>Another limitation is the time frame and the repeated measurement aspect of the study. Because of the constraints of summer programming, children were repeatedly assessed in a short amount of time, which could have resulted in practice effects and other unintended effects, such as reluctance on the part of the children to engage in the assessment. In addition, although the sequence of the shape tasks was counterbalanced as was the administration of the criterion measures, the administration of experimental measures prior to criterion measures across all participants does not rule out the possible influence of order effects. It is possible that experience with the experimental measures increased performance on the criterion measures, potentially affecting the strength of the correlations between the measures.</p>
<p>A final aspect of the study that is important to note is the presence of non-domain-specific correlations. Specifically, statistically significant and moderate correlations between the experimental tasks that were intended to measure early geometry and algebra and subtests of the BBCS-3:R that are not mathematical in nature (i.e., Colors and Letters) raise questions about the construct of interest. The lack of clear convergent and divergent validity is consistent with what has been found in previous studies of early CBM mathematics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534508411430323">Daly, Wright, Kelly, &amp; Martens, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534508411430323">VanDerHeyden et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534508411430323">VanDerHeyden, Witt, Naquin, &amp; Noell, 2001</xref>), and there are several possible interpretations for these non-domain-specific relations. It is possible that a variety of separate constructs (e.g., early number sense, early geometry, early algebra, declarative knowledge) may be better represented by a distinct, unifying structure. This interpretation is best supported by the strong correlations between the experimental tasks and the SRC of the BBCS-3:R. The strong correlations with the SRC are of particular interest when contrasted with the weak to moderate correlations demonstrated between the experimental tasks and the TEMA-3. An alternate interpretation is that early mathematical tasks in general are a good indicator of school readiness skills and concept knowledge. This interpretation is consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534508411430323">Duncan et al. (2007)</xref> in which math skills at kindergarten entry were the strongest predictors of later achievement.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to explore additional early math CBM and evaluate their potential as viable assessment tools. Specifically, this study sought to develop tasks that were central to young children’s development of numbers and counting, geometry, and algebra. Each of the skills targeted develop early, prior to school entry, and each are important in creating a foundation for later mathematical competence. The link between early number sense skills and continued math achievement has been documented (e.g., Jordan, Kaplan, Locuniak, &amp; Ramineni, 2007; Jordan, Kaplan, Ramineni, &amp; Locuniak, 2009; Jordan, Kaplan, Olah, &amp; Locuniak, 2006; Locuniak &amp; Jordan, 2008), and although these studies focus on kindergarteners, developmental research suggests children’s understanding of number develops earlier than kindergarten (e.g., Baroody, Lai, &amp; Mix, 2006). Further, differences in children’ s number sense emerge early (e.g., Jordan et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534508411430323">National Mathematics Advisory Panel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534508411430323">Starkey, Klein, &amp; Wakeley, 2004</xref>). Similarly, differences in children’s spatial and geometric knowledge emerge at a young age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534508411430323">Starkey et al., 1999</xref>), and international comparisons indicate geometry is a particular weakness in US students (Tatsuoka, Corter, &amp; Tatsuoka, 2004). Noting another mathematical area of relative weakness, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534508411430323">National Mathematics Advisory Panel (2008)</xref> report focused specifically on algebra as a gateway to mathematical success and outlined benchmarks for grades PreK-8 to ensure children develop a strong foundation for mathematical competence. Clearly, further work is needed to create effective assessment frameworks for early mathematics in preschool.</p>
<p>As we proceed we may take new directions to best meet the assessment needs in early mathematics. Although many of us have adopted the CBM framework, we may find ourselves exploring other options. First, we need to define the construct of measurement. The non-domain specific correlations of the present study point to the need to explore the structure of early learning concepts through factor analytic studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534508411430323">Floyd et al. (2006)</xref> included a factor analytic component in the first study of the PNI; the results of which indicated the four tasks were best explained by a single factor. However, a factor analytic study of kindergarten number sense measures indicated a two-factor model best fit the data, with one factor comprised of number-related tasks and the other comprised of rapid automatic naming tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534508411430323">Lago &amp; DiPerna, 2010</xref>). Additional research is needed with preschoolers as new measures are developed to better understand the measurement construct and refine our assessment procedures.Once we more clearly define our construct, we will need to determine what tasks best represent the domain of interest to ensure assessments are efficient. For example, in the current study, the psychometric properties of three shape tasks were evaluated, consistent with the first stage of research in CBM (Fuchs, 2004). The results of this study support continued investigation of the tasks to further explore their technical adequacy with diverse samples of children and address issues of growth, predictive validity, and instructional utility. Predictive validity is an essential component of determining what tasks or tasks from a set of domain-specific tasks (i.e., oral counting, number identification, cardinality) are most closely related to important long-term outcomes, and classification accuracy studies will play an important role in future research of early math CBM. For example, Methe, Hintze, and Floyd (2008) evaluated the technical adequacy and decision accuracy of the Early Numeracy Skill Indicators (ENSI) with results suggesting two of the four ENSI had sufficient psychometric properties and led to accurate classification decisions. Similar research with preschool samples could identify the “best race horse” to assess a particular domain and support a continuum of assessment intended to inform instruction and improve academic outcomes.</p>
<p>Given that several race horses representing different domains may be combined for a more comprehensive assessment, the length of the assessment time is likely to increase, and may prompt us to reconsider our current measurement frameworks with attention to the purposes of assessment. Perhaps, more lengthy assessments would be suitable for screening or diagnostic purposes whereas shorter forms of assessment would be necessary for progress monitoring. For example, using item selection procedures, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534508411430323">Lei et al. (2009)</xref> multiple short forms for two of the EARLI measures. The forms varied in difficulty so they could be used throughout the year as children acquired more skill in early numeracy. To date, most of the early math CBM research has focused on robust indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534508411430323">Foegen et al., 2007</xref>), and the use of item selection procedures may take us in a new direction in developing early math assessments that will better inform differentiated instruction.</p>
