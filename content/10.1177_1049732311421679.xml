<abstract>
<p>Based on a study exploring the phenomenon of coping among Hong Kong Chinese women afflicted with breast cancer, from diagnosis to completion of treatment, we report the findings on meaning making by the informants. Using the grounded theory method, we conducted 35 interviews with 24 women suffering from breast cancer. Among them, we followed and interviewed 5 women thrice, from diagnosis to 3 months after completion of treatment. We noted the evolution of reframing as the key category in the adjustment process through which the women identified meaning at different points of time in the cancer experience, to achieve different outcomes. Chinese women identified a sustaining force from minimizing social disturbance during treatment. The integration of cancer into their lives after completion of treatment was achieved through positive transformation in their philosophy of life and social relationships. Nurses should aim to understand the cancer patients’ interpretation of the situation, explore personally meaningful sustaining forces, and reflect on their cancer experience.</p>

<p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, both in developed and developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1049732311421679">World Health Organization, 2011</xref>). The incidence of breast cancer in Hong Kong has increased in the past decade; there were 2,616 new cases registered in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732311421679">Hong Kong Cancer Registry, 2011</xref>). Patients often start a perplexing journey upon diagnosis of cancer. Many aspects of women’s lives, including ultimate survival, are affected by cancer and its treatment. Although cancer patients’ levels of distress generally decrease over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732311421679">Knobf &amp; Sun, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732311421679">Schroevers, Ranchor, &amp; Sanderman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1049732311421679">Wong &amp; Fielding, 2007a</xref>), the emotional reactions might continue after treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311421679">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732311421679">Schou, Ekeberg, Sandvik, Hjermstad, &amp; Ruland, 2005</xref>). As understood from recent reviews, physical symptoms of the disease, treatment effects, changes in family relationships, changes in self-image, vulnerability to disease recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732311421679">Schmid-Buchi, Halfens, Dassen, &amp; van den Borne, 2008</xref>), response of health professionals, unpredictability of disease, and uncertainty and unmet expectations about extent and rate of recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732311421679">Fernsler, Klemm, &amp; Miller, 1999</xref>) can be sources of demands on patients with cancer. Women diagnosed with breast cancer are at risk of developing several psychological morbidities, such as depression, anxiety, fatigue, negative thoughts, suicidal thoughts, fear of dying, sense of aloneness, sexual and body image problems, as well as an overall decrease in quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732311421679">Al-Azri, Al-Awisi, &amp; Al-Moundhri, 2009</xref>). The impact of cancer is much more profound and subtle than what can be observed directly from the patients. Because stress is inevitable, adjustment outcomes are the result of patients’ coping abilities.</p>
<p>Studies of people’s responses in stressful situations have evolved since the 19th Century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311421679">Parker &amp; Endler, 1996</xref>). The responses were conceived as ego processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311421679">Freud, 1995</xref>), “adaptative” defense mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311421679">Alker, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1049732311421679">Weinstock, 1967</xref>), trait characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311421679">Burgess, Morris, &amp; Pettingale, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311421679">Roth &amp; Cohen, 1986</xref>), and a process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311421679">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984</xref>). All these changes have a crucial impact on the conceptualization of stress responses and the elements involved in the coping process. In a recent review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732311421679">Al-Azri et al. (2009)</xref> found that women with a diagnosis of breast cancer used different coping strategies, including positive cognitive restructuring, wishful thinking, emotional expression, disease acceptance, increased religious practice, family and social support, yoga, and exercise. Meeting the challenges imposed by cancer, the patients require much adjustment and mobilization of coping resources within the cultural context. There is a huge body of knowledge on coping, especially in those with chronic illness and cancer, accumulated from studies done in the past decades. However, the applicability of Western models to understanding the response of Chinese people to cancer is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>In recent years, researchers began to conduct an increasing number of studies to explore elements of the cancer experience of Chinese people, including their needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732311421679">Molassiotis, Chan, Yam, &amp; Chan, 2002</xref>), psychological distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311421679">Lam, Fielding, &amp; Ho, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1049732311421679">Wong &amp; Fielding, 2007a</xref>), quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311421679">Cui et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311421679">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049732311421679">Wong &amp; Fielding, 2007b</xref>), social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311421679">Chan, Hon, Chien, &amp; Lopez, 2004</xref>), preference for information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311421679">Fielding &amp; Hung, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732311421679">Jiang et al., 2007</xref>), decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311421679">Lam, Chan, Hung, &amp; Fielding, 2007</xref>), posttraumatic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311421679">Ho, Chan, &amp; Ho, 2004</xref>), and adjustment outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732311421679">Lu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1049732311421679">Yan &amp; Sellick, 2004</xref>). Chinese patients sought information about their disease in the diagnostic phase; reorientated their body image and comparison/appraisal in dealing with bodily change; employed self-control in dealing with physical, psychological, and social concerns; took a fatalistic view in considering the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311421679">Lu, Chin, &amp; Huang, 1993</xref>); relied on their physicians with complete faith; and had little motivation to seek detailed information about treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732311421679">Ngan, Tang, &amp; Lau, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732311421679">Ngan &amp; Tang, 1984</xref>). Optimistic, self-reliant, palliative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732311421679">He &amp; Liu, 2005</xref>), planning, positive reframing, and self-distraction coping strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732311421679">Li &amp; Lambert, 2007</xref>) were commonly used by Chinese cancer patients. In the majority of these studies, the researchers adopted a quantitative approach with the use of questionnaires, and assessed the cancer patients at one point in time.</p>
<p>We conducted a grounded theory study with the objective of exploring the process of coping in Chinese women with breast cancer. The women were interviewed, and some were followed from the time of diagnosis to 3 months after completion of treatment.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732311421679" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>In this article, we present some of the findings from a study in which we aimed to develop a substantive theory to explain the coping process of Chinese women with breast cancer. In the article, coping is broadly defined as the women’s responses to the impact of breast cancer during the study. We aimed to explain the meaning-making phenomenon in the psychological adjustment of Chinese women to breast cancer both during treatment and thereafter. We adopted a grounded theory method with the objective of identifying the process, changes across time, and the influence of Chinese culture.</p>
<sec id="section2-1049732311421679">
<title>Informants</title>
<p>We conducted the study in the surgical outpatient departments and wards of two hospitals in Hong Kong. The physicians and nurses in the two hospitals helped recruit the informants according to the selection criteria, and obtained their initial consent for interview. Women 18 years of age or older, with no previous diagnosis of cancer, cognizant of the diagnosis of cancer, and diagnosed with primary breast cancer without clinically confirmed metastasis to other organs were the targeted population. We adopted theoretical sampling and selected informants on the basis of theoretical relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732311421679">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>). The first author (Ching) contacted the women who had relevant experience for interview.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049732311421679">
<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>When we used grounded theory, we collected and analyzed data simultaneously. At the beginning of the study, we interviewed women at different stages of their cancer experience once. We tape-recorded the interviews, transcribed them verbatim into Chinese, and imported them into QSR NUD*IST computer software Versions 3 and 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311421679">Richards &amp; Richards, 1997</xref>) for analysis, with the use of the computer software TwinBridge Chinese Partner Version 4.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049732311421679">TwinBridge Software Corporation, 1997</xref>) to enable the display of Chinese characters. We adopted the constant comparative method in data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311421679">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>), and compared each piece of new data with existing ones for similarities and differences.</p>
<p>After interviewing a few women who met the sampling criteria, we started to notice variations in the coping phenomenon by women of different ages and personalities, and the use of coping strategies. We derived hypotheses when relationships between the codes were identified in one interview and verified or modified in the subsequent interviews, illustrating similar responses, different responses, and negative cases. We identified categories (e.g., accepting, sustaining, integrating), and variations in coping were explained in terms of their dimensional difference. At that time, we interviewed 15 women; among them were 3 newly diagnosed women, 6 who were receiving treatment, and 6 who had completed treatment 5 months to 3 years previously (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049732311421679">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>We established an understanding of the women’s coping when the women were newly diagnosed, receiving treatment, and had completed treatment. We then realized the inadequacy of cross-sectional data to enhance understanding of the temporal sequence of events and the changes in the women’s coping responses across time. We decided to adopt a prospective approach, and followed the women throughout their cancer experience. The first author interviewed 9 more women who were newly diagnosed; 6 out of the 9 completed follow-up interviews when receiving treatment. Among those 6 informants, 5 were interviewed for a third time, at 3 months after treatment. We coded and recoded the data collected from all the interviews, including the first 15, with a focus on conceptualizing the relationships between codes.</p>
<p>We identified psychological adjustment to be a significant element in the coping process. Reframing was the core category in psychological adjustment through which the women had reconstructed a cognitive frame to interpret and explain to the world after they were diagnosed with breast cancer. Meaning making referred to the strategies that enabled the women to accept cancer at the time of diagnosis, sustain themselves during treatment, and integrate the cancer experience after completion of treatment. We then related the core category to the other categories by follow-up interviews, rereading and reanalyzing the existing data.</p>
<p>We enhanced the trustworthiness of the findings through prolonged engagement with informants for 20 months, negative case analysis, validation of findings with informants, peer debriefing, and keeping an audit trail throughout the data collection process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311421679">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>). We achieved theoretical saturation when 35 interviews with 24 subjects had been conducted. The interviews lasted for 30 minutes to 3 hours, with the average being 1.5 hours. We conducted 32 interviews either in the women’s homes or in interview rooms in the hospitals, two interviews in the researcher’s office, and one interview in a community center. Of the 24 informants, 15 were between the ages of 40 and 59, 4 between 60 and 79, and 5 between the ages of 20 and 39. Seventeen of the women were married, 4 were single, and 3 were divorced or widowed. Fourteen informants had completed secondary education or above, 5 had primary education, and 5 had received no education. Eleven women were Buddhists, 7 were Christians, and 6 did not have any religious belief. Twenty-one women were diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. Among the 12 women who were newly diagnosed, 2 planned to have a lumpectomy, whereas 8 had decided to choose mastectomy as the first treatment modality. All the other women were receiving or had completed a combination of a lumpectomy or a mastectomy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732311421679">
<title>Ethical Considerations</title>
<p>We strictly followed ethical principles throughout the study. We obtained ethical approval from the hospitals and the university before data collection. The first author obtained informed consent from the informants before interview, and the women were reassured of their right to withdraw at any time without affecting their treatment or care. When we adopted a prospective approach, the informants were told about the follow-up interviews before signing the consent. In anticipation of triggering emotional disturbances among the informants, physicians and nurses helped to monitor informants’ emotional state, and a psychologist agreed to provide counseling whenever necessary. No such referral was in fact required. We kept all study data strictly confidential.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In this article, we describe the meaning making phenomenon of Chinese women when they adjusted psychologically to the impact of breast cancer after the initial stage of the cancer experience.</p>
<sec id="section6-1049732311421679">
<title>Meaning Making in the Reframing Process</title>
<p>The women’s understanding of their assumptive world was disrupted when they discovered abnormal signs suggesting breast cancer. This resulted in a chaotic state in which the women did not have a relevant reference to interpret, explain, or predict their experience. The women were shocked and used denial as a mechanism to protect themselves from facing reality. During the interviews, they mentioned reorganizing their thoughts after the diagnosis of breast cancer, so as to face and interpret the reality. One woman explained, “You need to depend on yourself to work through your thoughts before you know how to cope with and face breast cancer.” Another woman said, “The medical social worker and nurses counseled and comforted me. They worked on my thinking. It was very helpful.”</p>
<p>Reframing, in this study, refers to the organization of and interaction among the thoughts, concepts, or ideas that were input after diagnosis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732311421679">Figure 1</xref>). It was the core category through which Chinese women adjusted psychologically to the impact of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311421679">Ching, Martinson, &amp; Wong, 2009</xref>). Meaning making was a key component of the reframing process, which occurred at different stages in the women’s cancer experience and through which they tried to make sense of the experience and achieve specific coping outcomes. These outcomes included acceptance of cancer at the time of diagnosis, sustaining in the midst of distress during treatment, and integration of the cancer experience into their life after completion of treatment. Here, we describe it as different types of work (i.e., acceptance work, sustaining work, and integration work) that delineated the women’s coping to achieve the outcomes. Achieving the specific outcomes in each stage, the women acquired bases for completion of the outcome in the subsequent stage and smooth progression in the reframing process. Failure in completion of the outcome would result in prolongation or carrying the coping task forward to the next stage, and would hinder the resolution of the outcome at that stage.</p>

<sec id="section7-1049732311421679">
<title>Context for Reframing</title>
<p>In exploring the phenomenon of reframing, we found two conditions—focus and approach—to be discriminating in describing the difference observed in the outcomes of psychological adjustment to breast cancer. Focus and approach are the context of reframing and the particular set of conditions within which action/interactional strategies were taken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732311421679">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990</xref>). <italic>Focus</italic> referred to the things that were in the women’s center of attention. It varied from focusing on coping (i.e., concentrating on the effort to deal with problems) to focusing on problems (i.e., being preoccupied by difficulties). One woman commented on her perceived control in the cancer experience: “You cannot control the disease or your body, but you can control your willpower, your attitude to dealing with the problems.”</p>
<p><italic>Approach</italic> referred to the general method the women adopted in psychological adjustment after the diagnosis of breast cancer. The approach to coping adopted by the women varied from active to yielding. By using an active approach, the women took the initiative to assess the problem situation and adopted strategies targeted at changing the conditions. By using a yielding approach, they conformed to the changes brought about by breast cancer and its treatment. A woman who adopted the active approach described her way of coping with the problems: “I was relieved after I knew what treatment I needed to undergo. . . . When I have problems, I search for solutions. I need to know how the problems can be resolved, or the remedy available.” Another woman, who used the yielding approach, explained her method of coping: “When things like this happen, there is no alternative, and I need to accept everything.” Given the diversity indicated by the two contextual conditions, we constructed a typology to illustrate the four different modes of coping (i.e., fighting, following the natural course, struggling, and bearing) adopted by the women in coping with the demands of breast cancer (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1049732311421679">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig2-1049732311421679" position="float">

<caption><p>Modes of coping</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1049732311421679-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In the next section, we delineate the mechanism of psychological adjustment through which women adopted different modes of coping and made meaning so as to sustain themselves during treatment (i.e., sustaining work), integrated cancer into their lives, and experienced transformation at the end of the cancer experience (i.e., integration work; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049732311421679">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1049732311421679">3</xref>). Acceptance work took place at the beginning of the cancer experience. Meaning making occurred in those women who focused on coping (i.e., adopted fighting and following the natural course mode), and took the form of subjective positive interpretation through which they tried to subjectively “underestimate” the impact of cancer and “overestimate” their ability to cope without distorting the facts about breast cancer. This enabled them to appraise their breast cancer as manageable, accept it, and face the challenge with courage. The women who focused on the problem (i.e., those who adopted the struggling and bearing modes) did not create subjective positive interpretation; they interpreted the situation as unmanageable and were unable to accept cancer. This mechanism was elaborated in another publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311421679">Ching et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Sustaining Work</title>
<p>After the women received information about the diagnosis, they realized the need to undergo a long treatment that might have many side effects. Women adopting different modes of coping reacted to the challenges in different ways. Fighters focused on coping and adopted an active approach; they were able to accept cancer and used differential strategies according to the nature of the problems before and during treatment. Fighters settled the actual problem by trying their best to control it: “My body is weakened after receiving so many injections [of chemotherapy]. Every day, I drink soup made with fructus jujubae, longan, chicken, or bird’s nest on alternate days. I think I have adequate nutrition.” Fighters adopted wait-and-see and act-when-come<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1049732311421679">1</xref></sup> approaches in coping with potential problems. Shortly after disclosure of diagnosis, a fighter said, “I will consider the other problems only after the operation. Then I will not be disturbed and will feel more comfortable acting step by step.”</p>
<p>Followers focused on coping and adopted a yielding approach. They were able to accept cancer. They used conforming strategies to cope with the demands before or during treatment. They relinquished control to advocates and followed their advice in coping. In contrast to fighters, they had fewer plans for coping in the future; they relied on help from advocates without much psychological distress: “I do not think much about cancer right now. I entrust myself to the doctors. I trust them.”</p>
<p>Strugglers focused on problems and adopted an active approach. They were unable to accept cancer. Because of the intolerance of problems, strugglers became overwhelmed and suffered from extreme irritability when facing actual problems or anticipating potential problems. After returning home from surgery, one struggler tried to overcome the high level of anxiety by forcing strategies:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“What can I do?” . . . Wow! I was very nervous. My face was red. I was very afraid. Then I tried to force myself. . . . “Wake up! Be quick! Get washed!” because the weather was hot. I forced myself not to think that much. I struggled with myself . . . real struggling. I forced myself to sleep . . . I had a great fear that I would review all these issues in a nightmare.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Bearers focused on problems and adopted a yielding approach. Because they interpreted the situation as unmanageable and were unable to accept cancer, they used suppressing strategies to cope with the demands of breast cancer. Compared with followers, bearers had a strong sense of powerlessness to control the situation. Bearers adopted suppressing measures and followed the advice of powerful others. One bearer recalled her reactions and feeling of helplessness after being told about the cancer diagnosis:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>After a few days, he [the doctor] gave me a phone call. I was in shock and had no time to think. I did not know how I could cope with it [the cancer]. I had no choice but to follow his advice.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<sec id="section9-1049732311421679">
<title>Creating a sustaining force</title>
<p>Fighters and followers identified meaning in the situation so as to enable themselves to adopt a positive attitude and sustain themselves in their chosen direction for coping. That is, a supporting force was obtained through the identification of objectives that were personally meaningful to them. Meaningful objectives mentioned by the women, such as maintaining hope for a cure and minimizing social disturbance, are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049732311421679">Table 2</xref> and elaborated below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049732311421679">
<title>Maintaining hope for a cure</title>
<p>For most of the women with breast cancer, being cured was one of the most significant concerns. Hope for a cure provided the women with a clear goal at the time of loss, and a strong reason to accept cancer, face the truth, and sustain themselves in coping: “It helps if you know you can be cured. This is the most important concern for all patients. You will sustain and bear all the suffering which cancer brings.” From the data, maintaining hope of recovery seemed to be a subjective choice instead of a matter determined purely by the chance of a cure as illustrated by medical statistics. One woman said,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is important for you to know your chance of being cured and what can be done. Then you can cope with perfect peace of mind. You need to try, even though there might only be a fifty percent chance [of a cure].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1049732311421679">
<title>Striving for a personally meaningful goal</title>
<p>The women identified a goal to give meaning to their suffering. That became a reason to persist. Despite the need to undergo repeated surgery, one woman had no regrets because this gave her hope that she would be able to preserve the breast, which was important to her: “After the lumpectomy, the physician said I needed another operation because there were still some cancer cells in my body. I have no regrets.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049732311421679">
<title>Minimizing social disturbance</title>
<p>The women were motivated and supported so they could cope with a positive attitude by minimizing social disturbance. Two ways to minimize social disturbance were identified in the interview data. One young woman appraised the support from and minimized the burden of her mother by adopting a positive attitude in coping and acting as though she were physically well:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My mother gave me little psychological support. However, I knew that she worried that something bad would happen to me. I thought I needed to let her know that I was fine. I needed to be more positive in coping.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One woman expressed that taking care of dependent others gave her strong reasons to strive and survive, because she was not living only for herself. She chose to fulfill role-related obligations:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The need to bring him [her 3-year-old son] up has become a supporting force. I can’t just die. This helps to sustain me in getting cured. Without him, I might not be that positive. I also think of my parents. I cannot die because I have not fulfilled my obligations.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Minimizing social disturbance seemed to be a deep-rooted belief that meant more than just reducing others’ stress or conflicts between people. One woman described using courage to cope as a way to express her love and fulfill her obligation to her father, who had died a year previously:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I love my father. In fact, I think he was even more important than me. My father suffered a lot when he was in the hospital, but he had a strong will. He did not tell us that he was uncomfortable. He affected my will power, made me stronger. I hope I will be well because of him.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1049732311421679">
<title>Self-reinforcing courage</title>
<p>When facing difficulties, the women played an important and irreplaceable role in the self-reinforcement of courage to sustain and cope. One woman had much fear of chemotherapy. She summoned the courage to face it and said, “Be positive. I just told myself that it [receiving injections] should not be too hard. I am not a child.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1049732311421679">
<title>Appraising progress</title>
<p>Coping with endless suffering could be frustrating and torturous. In the midst of suffering, some women appraised their progress by “counting down.” One woman who had received a course of chemotherapy involving ten injections said,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I told myself, “I shall be fine because I will complete the treatment soon. I just need to be brave and look ahead!” After receiving the third injection, I said, “I am half-way through.” After receiving the fifth injection, I said, “I can see my destination.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1049732311421679">
<title>Appraising secondary gains</title>
<p>Breast cancer brought not only losses, but also gains to the women. In this study, the secondary gains became goals for the women to work toward at the time of suffering:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>No matter what will happen and how hard it will be, I am prepared to suffer. Then I will be fine. There are problems in my lifestyle. I am sure that I will be healthier after I have completed the treatment.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast to fighters and followers, strugglers and bearers did not identify a sustaining force during treatment.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1049732311421679">
<title>Integration Work</title>
<p>Before the cancer experience came to an end, the women needed to incorporate breast cancer into their existing frame of mind. They seldom mentioned their conscious efforts to integrate breast cancer. Integration was achieved naturally when the women were able to complete acceptance and sustaining work. Women adopting different modes of coping experienced differences in “orientation of cancer,” “resumption of ‘normal’ life,” and “vision for the future” (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1049732311421679">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Both fighters and followers appraised cancer as a past event, were able to gradually resume “normal” life, and had a positive vision for the future. One fighter shared her experience at 3 months after treatment:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I am happy since resuming work. The time goes as quickly as before. Everything is just like before. . . . Sometimes I think about it [the cancer experience], and it is just like a dream. It is already a past event.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A follower looked back on the experience and said, “I am still optimistic. . . . That means letting go . . . being happy . . . everyone has to live. One will live better if he is happy.”</p>
<p>Both strugglers and bearers appraised cancer as a present event, failed to gradually resume “normal” life, and had a grave vision for the future. At the end of the second year after completion of treatment, one struggler described the threat of recurrence or metastasis as follows:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Now I am afraid because the others said that there was a chance of recurrence. In fact, I have a thorn in my heart now. Now my situation is just like that before surgery. I believe that they [family members] think I am fine. However, I believe removing the lymph nodes might have a significant influence. . . . The worst outcome is death. I have heard that cancer patients suffer greatly before death.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One bearer appraised the uncertainty of recurrence or metastasis, and anticipated her death:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I worry because it is just like a bomb. . . . It is fine if I cannot be cured because it is predetermined by fate. My health care providers tried their very best to help. Sometimes I think about burial or . . . [the woman started to cry]. Mankind is pitiful. We will be killed by a disease over which we have no control.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<sec id="section17-1049732311421679">
<title>Transformation</title>
<p>From the interviews, it was noted that a positive transformation occurred in women who adopted the fighting mode at the end of the cancer experience. Through transformation, the women gave meaning to and integrated the cancer experience into their lives. Transformational thoughts mentioned by the women, such as change in relative importance of things in life, were listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1049732311421679">Table 3</xref>. Such thoughts were reported by fighters but not mentioned by followers, strugglers, or bearers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1049732311421679">
<title>Change in relative importance of things in life</title>
<p>After surviving a difficult time both physically and psychologically, some women acknowledged that some things other than those that they had treasured in the past were of real importance to them. The importance of family relationships and health often increased after the cancer experience: “Family members are the most important, then my own health, then being happy. Before my diagnosis, I thought money was very important. This belief has changed now.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1049732311421679">
<title>Adoption of a docile attitude and letting go</title>
<p>The women claimed that the breast cancer experience was the most significant event in their lives. After going through the cancer experience, some women realized that things might happen that were beyond their control, and began to understand what was of real importance to them. They became more optimistic and had a more relaxed attitude, learning to let go of things that were less important: “Be more optimistic. Sometimes I have to let go. Now, if I have problems, I tell myself that the problem is minor. I am more easygoing now.” Another fighter said, “I have more experience in life because I have been through birth, aging, and being sick. I only lack the experience of death. My attitude has changed, and I have become more docile.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1049732311421679">
<title>Being more sensitive to others’ needs</title>
<p>After surviving the cancer experience, some women realized that cancer patients might have many unmet needs, and that help from others was crucial in adjusting to the changes. Some women had started to help others: “I spare more energy to contact other patients and talk to them, to help them to analyze the situation so that they will not be so upset. The others helped me, so I try to help others.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1049732311421679">
<title>Appraisal of the good in life</title>
<p>Some women were stimulated by the diagnosis of breast cancer to reflect on many aspects of their life and appraise the good that went unnoticed in their assumptive world before diagnosis. One woman described the change in her attitude toward caring for her son and living as a result of her appraisal that living a smooth life was not a matter of course:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Before being diagnosed, I did not think life was special, and I failed to realize its meaning. Now I understand that I might not be able to live a long life . . . not everyone is able to live a healthy life. Now I think it would be really good if I could bring up my son and take care of him. Now I have a goal. Now I think being able to live one day at a time is already very good.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1049732311421679">
<title>Finding a new orientation in life</title>
<p>After the disruption of the frame at the beginning of the cancer experience, some women reconsidered the values and beliefs they upheld, and found a new orientation in life. One young woman had been at a loss before her diagnosis. After being diagnosed with breast cancer, she was able to regain genuine support and concern from her significant others, reestablish a sense of self-worth, and identify a new direction for her future: “Before my diagnosis, I did not take others’ advice. I grew up after experiencing the disease [breast cancer]. I have made positive changes in my ways of thinking and living because of it.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this article, we describe the process of psychological adjustment to breast cancer by Chinese women. Reframing was the core category. In the process of reframing, the women made meaning out of the experience so as to achieve acceptance, sustaining, and integration work. In this article we focus the discussion on identification of a sustaining force during treatment and transformation after completion of treatment.</p>
<sec id="section24-1049732311421679">
<title>Mental Representation, Meaning Making, and Reframing</title>
<p>Psychologists have long believed that people’s mental representations of the social world are important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732311421679">Carlston &amp; Smith, 1996</xref>). Man’s search for meaning is the primary motivation in his life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311421679">Frankl, 1984</xref>). Some researchers have moved a further step to study the purposes of reorganization of thoughts and meaning in coping. Scholars have written about “meaning” relatively recently within the psychosocial oncology literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049732311421679">White, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311421679">Janoff-Bulman and Frantz (1997)</xref> suggested that making sense of a trauma or loss involves searching for “meaning as comprehensibility” and “meaning as significance.” “Meaning as comprehensibility” refers to understanding how the event fits with one’s view of the world. In our study, the women completed acceptance work through assessing the impact of cancer and their ability to cope in the appraisal process in the early cancer experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311421679">Ching et al., 2009</xref>). “Meaning as significance” refers to generating significance through appraisals of value and worth in the process of benefit finding or creating meaning in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732311421679">Janoff-Bulman &amp; Berger, 2000</xref>; Janoff-Bulman &amp; Frantz). In this study it was evidenced in the creation of a sustaining force by fighters and followers when facing increased physical and psychosocial demands during treatment, the incorporation of cancer into their life, and fighters’ transformation at the end of or after treatment.</p>
<p>Meaning making might be helpful, primarily when there is some resolution achieved through the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311421679">Park, Edmondson, Fenster, &amp; Blank, 2008</xref>). A failure to make meaning might be manifested by struggling with thoughts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732311421679">Segerstrom, Stanton, Alden, &amp; Shortridge, 2003</xref>), as noted in strugglers’ and bearers’ suppression of thoughts related to cancer. In this study, we identified the process and purpose of meaning making at different time points in the cancer experience, the understanding of which has been modest to date.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-1049732311421679">
<title>Meaning Making in Chinese People</title>
<p>In the search for meaning, people might attempt to change the meaning of the event through reattribution or creating illusions, or change the global meaning through positive reappraisal, problem solving, and revaluing ordinary events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732311421679">Skaggs &amp; Barron, 2006</xref>). The informants in this study changed the meaning of the events and sustained themselves in coping through maintaining hope for a cure and appraising their progress. A change in global meaning was noted, in this study and others, in striving for a personally meaningful goal, minimizing social disturbance, self-reinforcing courage, and appraising secondary gain so as to be sustained in coping and in all transformational thoughts, including change in the relative importance of things in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732311421679">Lethborg, Aranda, Bloch, &amp; Kissane, 2006</xref>), adoption of a docile attitude/ letting go, appraisal of the good in life, finding a new orientation in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732311421679">Kenne Sarenmalm, Thorén-Jönsson, Gaston-Johansson, &amp; Öhlén, 2009</xref>), and being more sensitive to the other’s needs.</p>
<p>Through the identification of sustaining forces, the women were able to maintain a positive attitude and persist in suffering. In this study, the women created sustaining forces through identification of objectives or goals that were personally meaningful. Suffering then became the price they paid for their recovery, or the goal they aimed for. One of the most frequent sources of sustaining force mentioned by the Chinese women in this study was minimizing social disturbance through minimizing the psychological burden of significant others, fulfilling role-related obligations, and appraisal of support. The meaning identified reflected the cultural influences on the women’s values and beliefs.</p>
<p>In traditional Chinese culture, people put much emphasis on maintaining a coherent and harmonious state between human beings and nature, as well as among humans. The Chinese conception of man is based on the individual’s transactions with his fellow human beings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732311421679">Sun, 1992</xref>); maintaining harmonious relationships with other people is highly valued. The basic functional unit of traditional Chinese society is the family, not the individual. Chinese people believe that they should maintain harmony among family members, be faithful in protecting and fulfilling obligations for their family members, be unconditionally interdependent on each other, and yield to modesty in the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1049732311421679">Yáng, 1994</xref>). Among the five cardinal social relationships in Chinese society, three involve relationships within the family. There are stereotypical expectations in these dyadic relationships, such as father is loving and son is filial, husband is amiable and wife is gentle, elder brother is friendly and younger brother is respectful (Yáng). Filial piety is the most significant moral principle of all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049732311421679">Yān, 1994</xref>). Because of these traditional Chinese values and social principles, the women in this study gained powerful sustaining forces from the goals of taking care of their elderly parents and young children and fulfilling piety to their dead parents when facing the demands brought about by breast cancer and its treatment. Chinese people’s commitment to fulfilling role-related obligations has been found to create meaning and support them in coping with hardship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1049732311421679">Wang, Shi, Ng, Wang, &amp; Chan, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Chinese people believe that fate is predetermined with the principle of maintaining harmony between human beings and nature. When there is misfortune or suffering, the majority of Chinese people can face it as part of their life and be satisfied when there is improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049732311421679">Yān, 1994</xref>). Perseverance in the midst of suffering is a highly valued virtue. Thus, the women in this study were able to sustain by self-reinforcing courage, appraising progress, and appraising secondary gain, and transform by adoption of a docile attitude and appraisal of the good in life after completing treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-1049732311421679">
<title>Nature and the Prerequisite for Transformation/Posttraumatic Growth</title>
<p>In previous research studies, growth-producing aspects of traumatic or illness experiences were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732311421679">Helgeson, Reynolds, &amp; Tomich, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732311421679">Jenenne, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732311421679">Stanton, Bower, &amp; Low, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732311421679">Tedeschi and Calhoun (1995)</xref> termed this phenomenon posttraumatic growth. In their study, three broad categories of perceived benefits that many people saw as having arisen out of their struggle with trauma were self-confidence, enhanced personal relationships, and a changed philosophy of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311421679">Hughes, Closs, &amp; Clark, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732311421679">Lethborg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732311421679">Stanton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049732311421679">Tomich &amp; Helgeson, 2004</xref>). We identified a similar pattern in this study, except for the increase in self-confidence. The reasons for this difference might be that Chinese people focus more on the physical or social aspects of their life rather than their psychological state, or that the women in this study believed the impact of cancer was not yet over at 3 months after completion of treatment. The Chinese people’s acceptance of and convictions about authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311421679">Leung &amp; Lee, 1996</xref>) and the women’s dependence on their health care providers for decision making and advice in this study might also explain the lack of increase in self-confidence.</p>
<p>From the data, positive transformation was only found in fighters, who examined the values, beliefs, attitudes, goals, and direction in life that they had upheld before the diagnosis. This matches with the principles of personal growth in the aftermath of trauma as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732311421679">Tedeschi and Calhoun (1995)</xref>, which included some positive evaluation for growth and the influence of personality characteristics on the possibility for growth. Fighters transformed at the end of the cancer experience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732311421679">Splevins, Cohen, Joseph, Murray, and Bowley (2010)</xref> also noted a temporal sequence to the growth process, which was suggestive of a need to be able to reduce distress to manageable levels before people experience positive changes.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>Because breast cancer is considered to be a threat to all women, nurses should consider psychological support and counseling as part of routine care instead of a special intervention for those who cannot cope with the demands imposed by breast cancer. Oncology nurses can contribute to improving the psychosocial well-being of cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311421679">Arving et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732311421679">Eicher, Marquard, &amp; Aebi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049732311421679">Turner et al., 2009</xref>). Nurses are professionals who typically deliver psychosocial interventions for cancer patients, as identified in a review of research conducted over a 25-year time span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732311421679">Moyer, Sohl, Knapp-Oliver, &amp; Schneider, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Oncology nurses can start counseling by exploring women’s interpretations (i.e., the cognitive frame formed after a diagnosis of breast cancer), because it influences their coping response, and encouraging them to share their feelings and thoughts pertaining to the situation. Because we noted subjective positive interpretation, a sustaining force, and transformation to be the strategies associated with positive adjustment, women can be helped to explore alternative views of the situation, identify meanings that might support them in coping and maintaining hope, and reflect on the cancer experience. We learned from the experience of women—especially those who adopted struggling and bearing modes—that oncology nurses can focus on enabling the women to understand the situation, clarify misconceptions about cancer, realize their role in coping, and set realistic goals for their recovery. Nurses can facilitate women’s acceptance of breast cancer by encouraging them to see the diagnosis from a fatalistic point of view, but women can derive coping strategies with acknowledgment of their own strengths, limitations, and cultural values, and seek help from family, friends, or health care professionals if necessary.</p>
<p>Social relationships can be an unfailing source of hope, meaning, and support for Chinese women throughout the cancer experience. However, Chinese women might experience limitations in their ability to fulfill their role-related obligations as a result of cancer. Minimizing social disturbance might result in a mutual protection mechanism, which creates barriers, preventing the women from seeking help, and their significant others from sharing their concerns. The women might open up a channel for communication and support through reviewing the situation and sharing, which will benefit both the women and their significant others. Further study can be done to explore the meaning making of women with more advanced cancer. Minimizing social disturbance is a significant source of a sustaining force for Chinese women. Exploration of the social interaction and help-seeking behavior of Chinese people can enhance understanding of this important phenomenon.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, we present the psychological adjustment of Chinese women with breast cancer. We interviewed 24 informants and followed 5 women prospectively from the time of diagnosis to 3 months after completion of treatment. Meaning making was the key component in the reframing process. The women identified meaning at different points of time in the cancer experience to achieve different outcomes. When facing suffering during treatment, women identified a sustaining force to support themselves in enduring the suffering necessary to control cancer. At the end of the cancer experience, transformation facilitated the integration of cancer into the women’s lives. Nurses should focus their interventions on understanding the women’s interpretations of the situation, exploring personalized meaning to support positive coping at different stages of the cancer experience, reflecting on the experience, and realizing their role in coping.</p>
