<p>This article presents a field study that examines the subjective value of equity-based compensation and investigates the relationship between attitude toward risk and compensation preferences. The participants in the field survey received equity-based compensation in the past but lack financial education background. We find that the respondents exhibit difficulty in estimating the value of employee stock options, which usually results in a subjective value that is lower than the objective value (calculated using the Black–Scholes model). Additional findings demonstrate the presence of behavioral biases such as priming and mental anchoring. Finally, we document an absence of transitivity in the preferences of 10% of the respondents.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past decade, the changes in the accounting standards that address equity-based compensation have had a substantial influence on the way in which firms grant such compensation to their employees. Before the enactment of the new standards, employee stock options were usually measured by their intrinsic value. As a result, granting “at-the-money” options (options with an exercise price equal to the stock price at the grant date) was not recorded as an expense in the profit-and-loss statement. In contrast, the granting of restricted stock to employees was recorded as an expense based on the market value of the granted stocks. As a result, many firms chose to grant stock options because of the accounting benefit involved.</p>
<p>This preference toward options was nullified with the introduction of the new accounting standards. Both the international Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP IFRS2) and the U.S. GAAP (FAS123r) mandate the measurement and expensing of stock options by their fair value using option pricing models, thus eliminating the accounting bias in favor of options. Consequently, firms began to grant employees with restricted stock instead of options, or to offer to replace their options with restricted stock based on a defined substitution ratio set by the firm (e.g., the choice offered is between receiving 1,000 restricted shares or 3,000 stock options).</p>
<p>The change in the practice of granting equity-based compensation raises the following question: What is the subjective value of each of the equity instruments in the minds of employees—do they perceive a value equal to the one obtained using financial models or, perhaps, a different value? This question is particularly relevant to stock options, a financial instrument whose value is not transparent and requires measurement at the time of grant using complex financial models. In case the employee attributes the option a subjective value lower than the value calculated using financial models, then this compensation type is not efficient because the cost determined and recorded by the firm is higher than the value the employees place on their options.</p>
<p>Our research is based on a field study that examines the subjective value of equity-based compensation and investigates the relationship between attitude toward risk of employees and their compensation preferences. The study employs a questionnaire, which consists of three parts:</p>
<list id="list1-0886368712472599" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The first part ranks the respondent’s attitude toward risk.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The next part of the questionnaire asks for demographic characteristics, such as gender, age and level of education.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The third part includes questions about preferences between stock options, restricted stock and cash bonuses. This part differs between four questionnaire versions, offering in each a different substitution ratio between options and restricted shares (all questions are the same otherwise). In the first version, the substitution ratio is 1:2 (i.e., the respondent is asked to choose between 2,000 options and 1,000 restricted shares); in the second version the ratio is 1:3; in the third version, the ratio is 1:4 and in the fourth version it is 1:5 (i.e., a choice between 5,000 options and 1,000 restricted shares).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Additionally, the respondent is asked to indicate whether he or she, at any time in the past, received either options or restricted stocks.</p>
<p>We find that respondents have difficulty estimating options’ value; thus, there is a largely subjective element in regard to the perceived value of options. This subjective value is influenced by the employee’s characteristics, as well as by the alternatives offered. We asked respondents to choose between options and restricted stocks, while we offered, as detailed above, four different substitution ratio alternatives, ranging between 1:2 and 1:5, where all other information, including the value of the stock, was similar in all versions.</p>
<p>We predicted that a higher substitution ratio will increase the average tendency of respondents to prefer options (i.e., a higher proportion of respondents will choose options over restricted stock), since the options alternative becomes more attractive compared with restricted stocks alternative. Yet, despite this prediction, we find that there is no significant difference between the four groups (that received a different version of the questionnaire). This finding suggests that employees find it difficult to value options; hence, their choice between stock options and restricted stocks does not depend on the substitution ratio they are offered.</p>
<p>This finding is further emphasized by the comparison between the subjective value of options and the value calculated using the Black–Scholes model (i.e., the objective value).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0886368712472599">1</xref></sup> The objective option value, based on commonly used assumptions, is approximately half of the stock’s value. Therefore, in case the substitution ratio is higher than 1:2, the value of the option alternative is significantly higher than that of the restricted stock alternative (the largest dissimilarity between the alternatives is, of course, where the substitution ratio is 1:5). Nevertheless, most of the respondents chose the less valuable restricted stock alternative. This finding indicates that option’s subjective value is lower than its objective value, calculated using financial models.</p>
<p>Additional findings show that respondents demonstrate behavioral biases corresponding with well-known biases from the field of psychology. As predicted, when the respondents are asked to choose between a cash bonus and a restricted stock package with an identical market value, their tendency to choose the stock goes up the higher the substitution ratio is. However, despite the fact that all the questionnaire’s versions specify the same value for the restricted stock (Israeli New Shekel [NIS] 10,000), the respondents place a higher value on these stocks as the substitution ratio (which was specified in the previous question) increases. This phenomenon reflects <italic>priming</italic>—a known phenomenon in psychology, according to which the exposure of a person to a stimulus at an early stage influences his or her response to another stimulus at a later time.</p>
<p>Another behavioral bias found is a <italic>mental anchoring</italic>. We examined the effect of providing additional input stating that the firm’s stock price had fallen by 50% in the 2 months before it was granted. According to financial theory, the fact that the firm’s stock absorbed a sharp decrease is already embedded in the current stock price (the efficient market theory), and therefore this input does not add additional information to the respondents and in theory is not expected to affect their choices. Despite this prediction, it turns out that the new input leads to an increase in the willingness of the respondents to receive restricted stocks in place of a cash bonus. In other words, the high stock price in the past serves as a mental anchor, and the comparison between past and present stock prices reflects an investment opportunity on the part of the respondents and makes the stock more attractive.</p>
<p>Finally, an additional behavioral bias is the absence of transitivity in the preferences of 10% of the respondents. Responses given to three separate questions indicate that these respondents prefer to receive options over a cash bonus; a cash bonus over restricted shares and restricted shares over options. According to economic theory, the absence of transitivity indicates an irrational preference attitude.</p>

<title>Previously Reported Research</title>
<p>This article aims to estimate (using a field survey) the value of an employee stock options to nonexecutive employees. This subjective estimation of stock options has had only minor attention in the literature, especially when the focus is on lower level employees. In fact, as far as we are aware, there is no study that deals with nonexecutive employees, despite the fact that they are granted in the aggregate larger amounts of options than executives. For example, Hall and Murphy<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0886368712472599">2</xref></sup> and Landsman, Lang, and Yeh<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0886368712472599">3</xref></sup> document that over 90% of the options quantity in S&amp;P 500 firms was granted to nonexecutive employees.</p>
<p>The empirical evidence on low- and middle-level managers begins with Hallock and Olson,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0886368712472599">4</xref></sup> who provide empirical examination of the value an employee places on his or her options. They base their estimation on the revealed preference approach: Employees hold their options for another period if the value from holding them and reserving the right to exercise them later is higher than the value of exercising them currently and collecting the benefit. They show substantial differences (observed and unobserved) among employees in the value they place on their options. Their estimates show most that employees value their options at a value greater than the options’ Black–Scholes value.</p>
<p>Hodge, Rajgopal and Shevlin<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0886368712472599">5</xref></sup> examine whether current midlevel and future entry-level managers subjectively value stock options and restricted stock consistent with economic theory, and whether managers’ subjective valuations are sensitive to changes in key characteristics of these equity instruments. Applying a field survey, they find that on average, managers subjectively value the stock option package at greater than its Black–Scholes value and greater than a fair value-equivalent restricted stock package. They also find that inconsistent with economic expectations, proxies for risk aversion are not significantly associated with managers’ subjective valuations of options or restricted stock.</p>
<p>In contrast to nonexecutive employees, there is vast evidence on the subjective estimation of options granted to executives. The main reason for this difference is that an empirical examination on executives is easier to conduct, since data on executive compensation are more available.</p>
<p>Armstrong<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0886368712472599">6</xref></sup> found that an average CEO in his sample values an option grant at approximately 70% of its Black–Scholes value. However, approximately 14% of the CEOs value their options above their Black–Scholes value, and there is substantial variation across CEOs in terms of their subjective valuation. Lambert and Larcker<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0886368712472599">7</xref></sup> conducted a field survey of top-level executives and concluded that executives tend not to understand the basic economics of stock options. They find that some executives value their options more than they are theoretically worth and that younger executives at low managerial positions have the most upward bias in the perceived values.</p>
<p>An additional field survey made by Devers, Wiseman and Holmes<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0886368712472599">8</xref></sup> shows that managers subjectively overvalue options relative to their Black–Scholes value. Farrell, Krische and Sedatole<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0886368712472599">9</xref></sup> focus on the implementation of an financial education program and find that before the completion of the program, the majority of employees value options lower than firms’ estimated opportunity costs, while estimation after completing the program lead to a significant increase in subjective valuations.</p>
<p>Sautner and Weber<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0886368712472599">10</xref></sup> analyze the behavior of top managers in a specific ESOP (employee stock ownership plan). They show that the average option valuation using the executive volatility estimation is close to Black–Scholes values. Sautner, Weber and Glaser<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0886368712472599">11</xref></sup> use the same database and examine option valuation by top executives. They find that the average manager values his or her stock options substantially above the Black–Scholes value, with strong variation in the values managers place on their options. Finally, a Watson Wyatt (2006)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0886368712472599">13</xref></sup> survey found that employees value stock option grants at 30% to 50% of their “actual value.” Summing up, the current literature focuses mostly on executives and presents mixed evidence regarding the executive’s subjective valuation of equity-based compensation.</p>
<p>An additional research question in our research is the subjective substitution ratio of nonexecutive employees between options, restricted shares and a cash bonus. The general view in the literature is that stock options are a more expensive compensation form relative to both cash and restricted stocks compensation, since options impose more risk per dollar of compensation than the risk per dollar of restricted stock grants, leading managers to require higher risk premium for stock option compensation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0886368712472599">11</xref></sup> Brown and Lee<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0886368712472599">11</xref></sup> document that a dollar decrease in option compensation was associated with 0.35 dollar increase in restricted stocks, following the introduction of FAS 123(R). Hallock and Olsen<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0886368712472599">3</xref></sup> present a case study of a company that in the beginning of each fiscal year establishes an exchange rate for the dollar trade-off between cash pay and stock option pay, and then allows each employee to choose the allocation between total pay and cash pay, at-risk bonus and stock options. They document a substantial variation in the choice of contingent pay, with some employees choosing almost all base pay and others choosing almost entirely options. Younger employees, more experienced employees, higher paid employees and male employees are more likely to allocate a larger fraction of their total compensation to at-risk compensation types.</p>

<title>Research Design</title>
<p>Our research is based on a questionnaire that examines the relationship between risk attitude and compensation preferences, and employees’ attitudes toward options compared with restricted stock. The questionnaire consists of the three parts described previously: (a) the first part is a risk questionnaire; (b) the second examines the subjective value of equity-based compensation, according to employee attitudes and preferences, and compares it with the value of cash bonuses and (c) the final part relates to demographic information (gender, age, education, subject of study etc.).</p>
<p>Respondents were asked to choose between various types of compensation (stock options, restricted stocks and cash bonuses) under different circumstances. The four questionnaire versions differed in the substitution ratio between stock options and restricted stocks. In the first version, the ratio was 1:2 (the choice offered is between 2,000 stock options and 1,000 restricted stocks); in the second, it was 1:3; in the third, 1:4 and in the fourth version it was 1:5. In addition, the subject is asked to indicate whether he or she received stock options or restricted stocks as a compensation in the past.</p>
<p>The respondents selected for our analysis had received stock options or restricted stock grants previously; that is, they are individuals who at some point in time had been exposed to equity-based compensation instruments and therefore have some basic knowledge about the nature of these instruments. This selection criterion minimizes the noise of individuals who had no experience with any type of equity-based compensation and do not know how such compensation works. We also tried, as far as it was possible, to avoid respondents who had been exposed to option pricing models, in order to enable the examination of employees’ original attitudes regarding stock options. We distributed the versions of the questionnaires in a random manner among the respondents.</p>
<p>We distributed the questionnaire in two ways:</p>
<list id="list2-0886368712472599" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>MBA classes at Israeli universities</italic>: We handed questionnaires to students in an Introduction to Finance course. Most MBA students in Israel work or used to work, and some of them have received equity-based compensation in the past. Furthermore, students in the course (the basic course in Finance) usually do not have previous financial education and therefore are not likely to be familiar with option pricing models.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Computerized survey</italic>: This was filled out by respondents with no background in the field of finance.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The final sample included 147 respondents who stated that they had received some sort of equity-based compensation in the past; approximately half of the respondents were students, while the other half completed the computerized survey.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886368712472599">Table 1</xref> describes the sample. The majority of respondents (105; 71%) are males, whereas only 42 (21%) are females. Moreover, the majority of respondents (over 90%) hold either a BA or an MA degree. Out of all the respondents, 63 (43%) hold a BA degree, while 70 (48%) hold an MA degree. In addition, 11 (7%) hold a PhD degree, while only 3 (2%) respondents do not hold any academic degree. The average (median) age of the respondents is 34.5 (33) years with a standard deviation of 6.4 years. Most of the respondents (68%) are in the age range of 30 to 40 years.</p>

<p>With regard to the respondent’s profession, 122 out of 147 (83%) are in the fields of engineering, exact sciences, life sciences and medicine. This finding is not surprising, since the granting of equity-based compensation is very common in these sectors.</p>

<title>Results of Our Analyses</title>
<p>The findings show that option recipients find it difficult to estimate their value and that there is a substantial subjective element involved in the perceived value of stock options. This subjective value is influenced both by the employee’s characteristics and by the other compensation alternatives available. As detailed above, the four different versions of the questionnaire (which differed only in regard to the substitution ratio between alternatives, ranging between 1:2 and 1:5) were distributed randomly among respondents, who were asked to choose between options and restricted stocks. All other information, including the stock value, was identical in all versions.</p>
<p>The preference between options and restricted stock in the four sample groups is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886368712472599">Table 2</xref>. According to our prediction, the proportion of respondents who prefer options over restricted stocks was expected to increase with the increase of the substitution ratio, since it makes the options a more attractive alternative. Nevertheless, the results indicate that there is no significant difference between the percentages of respondents who prefer options over restricted stocks in the different groups. Among the respondents who were asked to choose between 1,000 restricted stocks and 2,000 stock options, 56% chose restricted stocks. When respondents were offered a choice between the same amount of restricted stocks and 3,000 option shares, the percentage of those who preferred restricted stocks was 47%; when the choice was between 1,000 restricted stocks and 4,000 options, 51% of the respondents chose the restricted stocks. Finally, from the respondents who were offered a choice between 1,000 restricted stocks and 5,000 stock options, 43% claimed to prefer the restricted stocks. The differences among the proportions of preference for restricted stocks in the different groups are not statistically significant.</p>

<p>This finding suggests that the substitution ratio between options and restricted stock does not have a significant influence on the choice between these equity-based compensation types. It also indicates that employees do not know how to estimate the value of their options. Hence, their choice between options and restricted stocks is not dependent on the substitution ratio between the offered alternatives.</p>
<p>Next, we compare between the subjective value of options and their corresponding objective value, calculated using the Black–Scholes model. We calculated the options value based on commonly used assumptions, which resulted with a value of an option that is approximately half the value of a restricted stock. This result implies that in case the substitution ratio is higher than 1:2, the value of the option alternative is higher than the value of the restricted stock alternative (the highest difference being, of course, in the version where the substitution ratio was 1:5). Despite this, however, around half of the respondents chose the restricted stock alternative, and this was unaffected by the substitution ratio offered. This finding indicates that the subjective value of options is lower than its objective value.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886368712472599">Table 3</xref> presents a logistic regression analysis of the preference toward options and restricted stock. We estimated the relation between the choice of either options or restricted stock, and the respondent’s demographic characteristics (age, gender and education) and risk preferences. In this analysis, we considered only the respondents who reflected a preference for one of the alternatives, and omitted the respondents who were indifferent between them. We then conducted a logistic regression test using two specifications: In the first specification, we measured the relation between the respondent’s choice and his or her characteristics, including attitude to risk, using dummy variables to indicate the type of questionnaire each respondent filled. In the second specification, we measured the same relation for each of the sample groups separately. The analysis shows that the respondents’ demographic characteristics and their attitude to risk do not have any significant effect on the choice between restricted shares or options, as none of the measured coefficients was significant.</p>

<p>The study also examined the respondents’ choice between receiving a restricted stock package or a cash bonus. The respondents were asked to choose between receiving 1,000 restricted stocks (where the market value of each stock is NIS 10) and a cash payment of NIS 10,000. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0886368712472599">Table 4</xref> presents the respondents’ answers, showing that most of the respondents prefer a cash bonus over restricted stocks (only 15% of the respondents prefer restricted stock). This finding is consistent with financial theory, which states that the value of restricted stock should be lower than NIS 10,000 due to of the illiquidity of the stocks, unlike publicly traded shares.</p>

<p>Another interesting finding is the relationship between the proportion of respondents who prefer restricted stock over cash bonus within each group and the substitution ratio between options and restricted stock in the questionnaire. In each of the four versions, respondents were asked to choose between restricted stock with fixed value versus similar amounts of cash bonus. The only difference between versions is the substitution ratio between stock options and restricted stock—which is irrelevant information for this choice. We assumed that since the value of the restricted stock package is identical in all versions, the stock preference would not differ between groups. However, the results show that the preference of stock over a cash bonus increased together with the increase in the offered substitution ratio.</p>
<p>The lowest (highest) percentage of respondents who prefer restricted stocks was for the questionnaire where the substitution ratio was 1:2 (1:5), around 8% (22%) of the respondents. This finding is an evidence of a behavioral bias known as <italic>priming</italic>, that is, when an individual is exposed to a stimulus at an early stage it influence his or her reaction to a different stimulus at a later stage. Note that the effect of priming in this setting is unique, since even under the circumstances where the estimated value of one option is not clear to the respondents, the more options are offered in place of restricted shares, the higher the subjective value of the restricted stock.</p>
<p>An additional question asked respondents to choose between compensation in the form of options (at varying quantities according to the questionnaire version) and compensation in the form of a cash bonus. The responses to this question, compared with responses to previous questions, show that 10% of the respondents express a nontransitive preference; in other words, their preference attitude is inconsistent because they prefer to receive options over a cash bonus; a cash bonus over restricted stocks and restricted stocks over stock options. This finding further illustrates the problematic and subjective nature of the perceived value of equity-based compensation. According to economic theory, the absence of transitivity reflects an irrational preference attitude.</p>
<p>Last, we examine the implications of additional information: here the report that the stock price fell by 50% in the 2 months before the stock grants. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0886368712472599">Table 5</xref> shows that this information brings about a rise in the willingness of respondents to receive restricted stock instead of a cash bonus. In light of this new information, 25% of the respondents preferred to receive restricted stocks instead of a cash bonus (out of the entire sample), compared with 15% who claimed they had held this preference before receiving the new information about the stock’s performance. The fact that respondents know that the firm has recently absorbed a sharp decline in its stock value makes its stocks more attractive on average to the respondents. It seems that the stock’s previous price acts as a sort of mental <italic>anchor</italic>, which the respondents relate to when they consider the two alternatives. From a financial point of view (according to the efficient market theory), the decline is embedded in the current stock price and does not affect the likelihood that the stock price will rise in future. Still, the findings show that this piece of information increases the tendency of the respondents to choose the stock alternative.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The findings of this study demonstrate the inherent problems in employees’ subjective valuation of equity-based compensation, particularly options. The subjective value of this compensation type may be significantly different from its economic value, and as a result, employees may make erroneous decisions about it. Consequently, firms can exploit this lack of understanding to reduce compensation expenses by using other equity-based compensation alternatives and offering lower substitution ratios of stock options and restricted stocks. From the employees’ perspective, there seems to be a strong need for financial education that will provide them with the tools they need to estimate the objective value of equity-based compensation.</p>
<p>Based on our findings, we offer several recommendations for firms wishing to grant equity-based compensation to their employees:</p>
<list id="list3-0886368712472599" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>One size does not fit all</italic>: Enable each employee to choose the compensation instruments he or she prefers: stock options or restricted stocks. Some will choose options while others will choose stocks. Since the stock alternative usually has lower objective value, this mechanism enables employees to receive their favorable compensation while reducing firm’s compensation expenditure.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Substitution ratios hardly matter (for the time being)</italic>: Our findings show that the choice of an employee is not affected significantly by the substitution ratio. Nevertheless, most firms that currently offer employees a choice between options and restricted stock, use a substitution ratio of 1:3. Usually, this ratio reflects a slightly higher objective value of the option alternative compared with the stock alternative. If this rule of thumb becomes widespread, employees may feel that ratios higher than that are unfair and avoid choosing options.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Cash is still king</italic>: Most employees prefer cash bonus over restricted stocks or stock options. This does not mean that all compensation should be cash, since equity-based compensation has favorable effects, such as retention and performance, and it does not decrease the firm’s cash reserves. Yet, in some cases, the firm may prefer to pay a cash bonus, conditioned on service or performance, rather than equivalent equity-based compensation due to the higher perceived value of cash bonus.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Pay attention to timing</italic>: A decline in the stock price is a good opportunity to grant equity-based compensation. While the employees’ subjective value is affected by the formerly higher price, the value recorded in financial reporting is measured based on the current low price.</p></list-item>
