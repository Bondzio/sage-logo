<p>Marketing students are known as less likely to have an affinity for the quantitative aspects of the marketing discipline. In this article, we study the reasons why this might be true and develop a parsimonious 20-item scale for measuring quantitative affinity in undergraduate marketing students. The scale was administered to a sample of business majors at a midsized university. The scale developed yielded a four-factor solution: Confidence, Enjoyment, Marketability, and Importance. Using multivariate analysis of variance, we test whether there are significant differences in quantitative affinity by gender, major, internship completion, class standing, and class completion. The findings suggest that marketing majors are less likely to enjoy the quantitative aspect of their major, but on completing a marketing research course their appreciation for the importance of quantitative tools increases. Internship completion has no effect on the undergraduate marketing students’ quantitative affinity. Our study complements extant literature by providing a parsimonious scale for assessing quantitative affinity specially adapted to the marketing students and analyzing the characteristics associated with students’ scores.

<p>Marketing students are known as less likely to have an affinity for the quantitative aspects of the marketing discipline. In this article, we study the reasons why this might be true and develop a parsimonious 20-item scale for measuring quantitative affinity in undergraduate marketing students. The scale was administered to a sample of business majors at a midsized university. The scale developed yielded a four-factor solution: <italic>Confidence, Enjoyment, Marketability</italic>, and <italic>Importance</italic>. Using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), we test whether there are significant differences in quantitative affinity by gender, major, internship completion, class standing, and class completion. The findings suggest that marketing majors are less likely to enjoy the quantitative aspect of their major, but on completing a marketing research course their appreciation for the importance of quantitative tools increases. Internship completion has no effect on the undergraduate marketing students’ quantitative affinity. Our study complements extant literature by providing a parsimonious scale for assessing quantitative affinity specially adapted to the marketing students and analyzing the characteristics associated with students’ scores. Suggested teaching strategies, based on the findings and supporting literature, are included.</p>
<p>When we ask marketing students to do basic mathematical operations or statistical work, often we are faced with uneasiness, reluctance, fear, and/or uncertainty. Math and statistics anxiety is a common problem among many business students, <italic>and especially among marketing majors.</italic> Studies show that marketing students are likely to be less prepared quantitatively than other business students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0273475312460764">Aggarwal, Vaidyanathan, &amp; Rochford, 2007</xref>), and therefore, have higher anxiety and lower affinity for the quantitative aspects of marketing. However, in a data-driven decision-making environment, being comfortable with numbers and statistics, interpreting their meaning and devising ways to collect meaningful data are skills that are required of people who seek a career in the marketing profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0273475312460764">Jeffrey, 2010</xref>). In a gap analysis study it was found that 3 to 5 years after graduation, students who had a marketing major reported that they were underprepared in “technical preparation” (including statistical packages) in comparison with the importance of this skill in their jobs (α &lt; .05). In the same study, these students also reported being underprepared in quantitative skills (α &lt; .10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0273475312460764">Davis, Misra, &amp; Van Auken, 2002</xref>). Therefore, understanding the low affinity marketing students have toward the quantitative aspects of marketing, and how to overcome it, is of foremost importance if we, as educators, want to contribute to the development of highly qualified marketing professionals.</p>
<p>Anxiety has been defined as the fear developed due to a perceived nonspecific threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0273475312460764">Barlow, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0273475312460764">Rachman, 1998</xref>). “Math Anxiety” has been defined as “the feeling of tension and anxiety that interferes with the manipulation of numbers and solving of mathematical problems in a wide variety of life and academic situations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0273475312460764">Richardson &amp; Suinn, 1972</xref>). “Statistical Anxiety” has been defined in the literature as a concept distinctive from “Math Anxiety,” in the respect that statistical anxiety also includes components of fear of interpreting statistical data and results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0273475312460764">Cruise, Cash, &amp; Bolton, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>For the purpose of this article, we will use the term <italic>quantitative anxiety</italic> to include all forms of anxiety stemming from any type of quantitative subject matter. However, our focus will be on the more positive dimension of affinity rather than anxiety. In the business world, the ability to interpret data and results relies on the use of mathematics and statistics. If marketing students do not have the ability to work with quantitative analyses it may be because of anxiety issues, the precollege preparation of marketing students, and/or what we, as educators, do in the marketing major and classrooms.</p>
<p>It has been shown that marketing majors come to college with lower ACT and SAT math scores. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0273475312460764">Aggarwal et al. (2007)</xref> found that marketing majors have, in average, an ACT math score of 19.4, whereas management and MIS students score 20.2, finance majors score 22.4, and accounting majors score 21.3. Similarly, for SAT, the marketing majors have an average math score of 454.7, whereas management majors have 466.2, MIS majors 470.9, finance majors 487.6 and accounting majors 484.8. All these differences are statistically significant at 0.01. Out of the 32 comparisons of the various SAT and ACT scores between marketing and other business majors (on all of which marketing students scored lower), 30 were statistically significant at .05. These results may be tied to low affinity or high anxiety issues but we have no way at present of knowing the root cause. What we do know is that, as marketing educators, we have students with lower quantitative skills as they enter college. Evidence cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0273475312460764">Aggarwal et al. (2007)</xref> also shows that marketing majors do not score as well as other business majors on the GMAT and that they rank 10th of 12 in number of CEOs with specific undergraduate majors. The majors included (in rank order from highest to lowest) were engineering, business administration, economics, liberal arts, accounting, history, finance, political science, mathematics, marketing, no degree received, and English.</p>
<p>Though the extant literature mostly focuses on anxiety and its cognitive, psychological and physiological symptoms, in this article we will focus on the positive, on the affinity students have for the quantitative aspects of marketing and how to cultivate it. Affinity is defined as a natural liking, taste, or inclination toward a person or thing (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/affinity">http://www.thefreedictionary.com/affinity</ext-link>). In this article, we define quantitative affinity as the liking, taste or inclination, preexistent or acquired, for quantitative applications as they pertain to marketing. It is well accepted in the communication literature that teachers use affinity-seeking behaviors (toward themselves and the discipline taught) to increase the quality of communication and the effectiveness of their teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0273475312460764">R. A. Bell &amp; Delay, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0273475312460764">Gorham, Kelley, &amp; McCroskey, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0273475312460764">McCroskey &amp; McCroskey, 1986</xref>). We do not define affinity as the opposite of anxiety. However, it is likely that those students who experience high affinity toward a subject matter are less likely to experience anxiety toward the same subject.</p>
<p>In the remainder of the article, we discuss the extant literature on math and statistical anxiety and the instruments available for measuring math and statistical anxiety. We then propose a parsimonious scale for measuring quantitative affinity as it pertains to marketing students. We identify directional hypotheses relating student characteristics to the factors identified and build a MANOVA model for analyzing the findings. In the conclusion of the article, we propose measures for rising students’ affinity for the quantitative aspects of marketing and identify further research avenues on the topic.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Quantitative affinity has received limited attention in the literature, but quantitative anxiety has been extensively studied either as it relates to mathematical or statistical anxiety. Quantitative anxiety manifests as fear of quantitative problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0273475312460764">Legg &amp; Locker, 2009</xref>). This anxiety is often initiated at the high school level but can continue at the university level. It can be defined as a general fear or tension or timidity associated with anxiety-provoking situations that involve interactions with quantitative issues. Quantitative anxiety is one of the factors identified that can affect a person’s problem-solving performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0273475312460764">Tsui &amp; Mazzocco, 2007</xref>). In a data-driven marketing environment this is a potential problem.</p>
<p>A negative attitude toward quantitative issues may begin in the early years of schooling and its effects can continue through high school and at the university level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0273475312460764">Geist, 2010</xref>). Quantitative anxiety can lead to avoidance of quantitative courses and majors, and/or avoidance of careers that use quantitative skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0273475312460764">Ashcraft, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0273475312460764">Chipman, Krantz, &amp; Silver, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0273475312460764">Hembree, 1990</xref>). A study of quantitative anxiety among students conducted by the National Research Council reported that about 75% of American students stop studying mathematics before completing the minimal education requirements mandatory for their career or job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0273475312460764">Scarpello, 2007</xref>). Attrition rates in mathematics and engineering programs average about 60% nationwide, with only about 2% of undergraduates majoring in mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0273475312460764">Farrel, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>“Statistics anxiety” or fear that occurs as a result of encountering statistics in any form and at any level is noticeably common among students whose academic background includes little previous mathematical or statistic training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0273475312460764">Onwuegbuzie, DaRos, &amp; Ryan, 1997</xref>). As expected, quantitative anxiety affects students’ performance in courses with quantitative content and causes feelings of inadequacy or low self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0273475312460764">Blalock, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0273475312460764">Dillon, 1982</xref>) and it is a significant factor that influences students’ ability to finish their degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0273475312460764">Onwuegbuzie, 1997</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-0273475312460764">
<title>Symptoms of Quantitative Anxiety</title>
<p>Psychological and physiological symptoms can be observed in those who suffer from quantitative anxiety. Psychological symptoms may include panic, nervousness before a quantitative class, feeling blank during an exam, or feeling helpless doing homework. Having sweaty palms, a fast heartbeat or an upset stomach are some of the physiological symptoms of quantitative anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0273475312460764">Ruffins, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0273475312460764">Pan and Tang (2005)</xref> indicate that factors contributing to quantitative anxiety include mathematics phobia, a lack of connection to daily life, the pace of instruction, and the instructor’s attitude. Having quantitative anxiety is not reflective of a person’s capability in performing tasks, but it can inhibit the person’s ability to learn, or to successfully apply what they know (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0273475312460764">Freiberg, 2005</xref>). This anxiety could be quite damaging in a marketing career in which decisions are increasingly data driven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0273475312460764">Farris, Bendle, Pfeifer, &amp; Reibstein, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0273475312460764">Jeffrey, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0273475312460764">
<title>Measuring Quantitative Anxiety</title>
<p>Several rating scales have been established to measure quantitative anxiety among students having varying levels of mathematical skill. Two relatively long rating scales are the “Math Anxiety Rating Scale” (MARS) and “Statistics Anxiety Rating Scale” (STARS). MARS was developed in 1972 by Richardson and Suinn and has 98 items. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0273475312460764">Hopko, Mahadevan, Bare, and Hunt (2003)</xref> developed a more parsimonious MARS scale, called the Abbreviated Math Anxiety Scale (AMAS), with only 18 items and two factors. This scale was specifically designed for measuring the anxiety in the math classrooms and is less applicable in the business classroom setting.</p>
<p>The STARS scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0273475312460764">Cruise, Cash, &amp; Bolton, 1985</xref>) uses 65 items and six factors: <italic>Worth of Statistics</italic> (perceived usefulness and relevance of the statistical course, “fit” with their personality and general attitude toward the course), <italic>Interpretation Anxiety</italic> (anxiety that rise from interpreting statistical results), <italic>Test and Class Anxiety</italic> (anxiety resulting from simple enrolment in a statistics class and having to take statistics tests), <italic>Computation Self-Concept</italic> (feelings of inadequacy when working with and interpreting statistics), <italic>Fear of Asking for Help</italic>, and <italic>Fear of Statistics Teachers</italic>. This scale is quite extensive given the 65 items, and more suitable for statistics courses than applied business courses.</p>
<p>Based on a qualitative study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0273475312460764">Pan and Tang (2005)</xref> have identified four main factors that contribute to quantitative anxiety. One is a general phobia related to math and statistics. A second factor is that students do not see a connection of quantitative concepts to their daily lives. Third, the pace of instruction increases anxiety if instruction is too fast. And, fourth the attitude displayed by instructors can influence the anxiety level of students.</p>
<p>Using items designed to capture factors used in MARS, STARS, and the more recent qualitative study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0273475312460764">Pan &amp; Tang, 2005</xref>), we have developed a scale with only 20 items to capture the quantitative attitude of business students in general and of marketing majors specifically. The instrument was based on a shortened version of a scale previously used to measure computer anxiety and an analysis of those scale items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0273475312460764">J. H. Wilson &amp; Daubek, 1992</xref>), while retaining some of the attributes of the longer MARS and STARS instruments.</p>
<p>Unlike the extant scales, our scale focuses on the positive aspects, because the goal is not only to lessen anxiety but also to increase students’ affinity for the quantitative aspects of marketing. Researching the literature on affinity building models we found that even though the vast majority of teachers use strategies to increase affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0273475312460764">McCroskey &amp; McCroskey, 1986</xref>), the tools most used by teachers to develop affinity were not targeted about the subject, but about themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0273475312460764">Gorham et al., 1989</xref>), and when the affinity building focused on the subject, the tool most often employed was enjoyment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0273475312460764">Gorham et al., 1989</xref>). We believe that there are several other strategies to increase students’ quantitative affinity, such as to increase the perception of usefulness and scientific value, and increasing the level of comfort students have with quantitative aspects. The scale developed is included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0273475312460764">Table 1</xref>. Because students’ characteristics and previous experiences are likely to influence the level of affinity they experience toward quantitative aspects, based on the extant literature we have developed hypotheses to guide our exploration.</p>

<p>It is expected that students with more credit hours will have had more opportunity to learn and apply quantitative methods successfully in previous coursework, thereby strengthening their confidence in their quantitative ability and reducing their quantitative anxiety. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0273475312460764">J. H. Wilson and Daubek (1992)</xref> found that amount of coursework has an inverse relationship with computer anxiety.

In addition, the forces of attrition will have had more time to eliminate students with poor quantitative aptitude from the higher level courses (through changes of major to less quantitative areas or withdrawal from school altogether) and correspondingly less time to do so for those from the lower credit hour grouping:</p>

Since marketing research is typically the most quantitative course in the marketing curricula, it is hypothesized that students who have completed this course will develop a greater affinity for quantitative methods. Marketing research is a course in which students learn how quantitative methods are applied to assist marketing decision making and, thus, should give students greater appreciation of its relevancy to a career in marketing and, thus, positively affect quantitative affinity. This is important because research has shown personal relevance to be associated with positive attitudes toward statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0273475312460764">Mvududu, 2003</xref>) and motivation to learn statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0273475312460764">Easton, Roberts, &amp; Tiao, 1988</xref>), and lack of relevance has been identified as an impediment to the learning of statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0273475312460764">Belli, 1993</xref>):</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The instrument that we developed (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0273475312460764">Table 1</xref>, Likert-type scale, 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 6 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>) was administered to 1,291 undergraduate business students at a midsized university (approximately 20,000 students). The order of the items in the original data collection instrument is indicated in parentheses next to the item in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0273475312460764">Table 1</xref>. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0273475312460764">Table 1</xref>, the order in which items are presented reflects the weights of the factor loadings.</p>
<p>From the 1,291 undergraduate business students, who received an e-mail invitation to participate in a web-based survey, we obtained usable returns from 297 students, a 23% return rate. One item asked the students to select the department in which their majors were housed. Of the 297, 118 (40%) were students with a major in the marketing department, which approximates the actual market share of the department (34.4%) in the college of business. The other departments that respondents identified as their major included: <italic>accounting</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 57), <italic>business information systems</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 15), <italic>economics</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 3), <italic>finance</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 24), <italic>management</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 55), and <italic>none of the above</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 25). (Note: <italic>None of the above</italic> identifies students who major in other disciplines outside the college of business, minoring in a business area.)</p>
<p>Approximately 65% of the overall sample were female, with a slightly higher proportion of females among the marketing majors (70%). Ages ranged from 19 to 51 years, with about 90% between 19 and 23 years. There were 11 sophomores, 77 juniors, 207 seniors, and 2 graduate students. About 31% of the respondents had completed an internship (a requirement for the marketing major). The average number of credit hours completed by respondents was about 110. Approximately 11% had taken their required one semester of statistics within the previous 2 years, whereas the others had taken the statistics requirement 3 or more years prior to the study. (Note: There was one student who reported not having taken statistics.) One third of the 297 respondents had taken a marketing research course, which contains a significant statistical component; of those who had taken the marketing research, about 82% were marketing majors.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<sec id="section7-0273475312460764">
<title>Factor Analysis</title>
<p>Using principal component analysis, we extracted a four-factor solution. There were five factors with eigen values greater than 1, but the sharp drop in the plot suggested that a four-factor solution is appropriate. The solution was robust, the variables loading on three of the four factors were identical in the four- and five-factor solutions. In the four-factor solution, Factors 4 and 5 were combined. The four factors we identified are <italic>Confidence, Enjoyment, Marketability</italic>, and <italic>Importance</italic> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0273475312460764">Table 1</xref> for factor allocation and loadings). None of the variables loaded heavily on multiple factors. The highest loading on a secondary factor was .392. This was for the item “Compared with others I know, I am very good in quantitative subjects,” which loaded .629 on the <italic>Enjoyment</italic> factor, and .392 on the <italic>Confidence</italic> factor. The solution presented was rotated using Varimax with Kaiser normalization. The patterns for factor loadings were robust, the solution being highly similar when alternative rotation methods were applied (e.g., Oblimin rotation).</p>
<p>The reliability factors for the subscales were .852 for <italic>Confidence</italic>, .879 for <italic>Enjoyment</italic>, .846 for <italic>Marketability</italic>, and .673 for <italic>Importance</italic>. The reliability factors for three of the factors at higher than .8 are very good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0273475312460764">Cronbach, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0273475312460764">Nunnally &amp; Bernstein, 1994</xref>). Though the value of Cronbach’s α for the last subscale is lower than the recommended .7, splitting the factor into two, as suggested by the five-factor solution, results into a lower alpha for each of the scales. The reliability factors of the first three factors are comparable with the 20-item AMAS scale (.85 and .88 for the two subscales, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0273475312460764">Hopko et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0273475312460764">
<title>Hypothesis Testing Results</title>
<p>The research hypotheses were tested using MANOVA. MANOVA is used to assess simultaneously group differences across multiple dependent variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0273475312460764">Hair, Anderson, &amp; Tatham, 1987</xref>). Student background characteristics were used as independent variables and the four quantitative affinity factors were used as dependent variables. Because of possible confounds with the variable <italic>marketing major</italic>, the tests of Hypothesis 3 <italic>internship</italic> and Hypothesis 4 <italic>marketing research class</italic>, were run just on the subsample of marketing majors. Internships are required of marketing students, but not of other business majors at this university. Thus, a disproportionate number of the students who had an internship experience were marketing majors. Similarly, marketing research is a required class for marketing majors but is not generally taken by nonmarketing students.</p>
<p>The results of the analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0273475312460764">Table 2</xref> and indicate that three of the five hypotheses were supported. At the 95% level of confidence, significant <italic>F</italic> ratios were found for the independent variables <italic>gender, marketing research class</italic>, and <italic>major</italic>. The MANOVAs did not indicate that quantitative affinity was significantly affected by either the number of credit hours taken or internship experience. Follow-up post-hoc <italic>t</italic> tests on the relationships that were found significant in the MANOVAs indicate that the significant differences were all in the hypothesized direction. Female students had less quantitative affinity than male students; marketing students who had taken marketing research were found to have more quantitative affinity than other marketing students; and marketing majors had less quantitative affinity than nonmarketing majors. With regard to the specific <italic>quantitative affinity</italic> factors for which the groups differ significantly, <italic>t</italic> tests indicate that females were significantly less <italic>confident</italic> in their quantitative ability than males; students who had taken marketing research had a stronger belief in the <italic>importance</italic> of quantitative methods than those who had not taken the class, and marketing majors <italic>enjoy</italic> using quantitative methods less than nonmarketing majors.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The four-factor solution proposed is robust and the instrument provided is reliable and less cumbersome to administer than previous instruments for assessing quantitative anxiety. The four factors, that we labeled <italic>Confidence, Enjoyment, Marketability</italic>, and <italic>Importance</italic> provide useful titles for assessing the cause, and the potential measures to increase affinity and alleviate anxiety. Items related to these factors are often present in anxiety-measuring scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0273475312460764">Heinssen, Glass, &amp; Knight, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0273475312460764">Martens, Burton, Vealey, Bump, &amp; Smith, 1990</xref>), and included in teachers’ efforts to increase affinity toward a subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0273475312460764">Gorham et al., 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results indicate that specific courses can have an impact on students’ perceived importance of quantitative concepts. However, in general, marketing students tend to enjoy quantitative methods less than their business school counterparts. The cause may be that many students come into marketing expecting an easier quantitative load and are less prepared to engage in quantitative tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0273475312460764">Aggarwal et al., 2007</xref>). Without knowing much about the complexity of marketing, students may anticipate that it is less quantitative than other disciplines. Those who believe that they have a low level of affinity for quantitative concepts may feel safer in choosing marketing as a major and as a career.</p>
<p>By analyzing the items in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0273475312460764">Table 2</xref>, we see that women scored lower than men on confidence. The women in our sample are less likely to feel confident in using their quantitative skills. However, men and women appear equal with respect to enjoyment, marketability, and the importance of quantitative skills.</p>
<p>We do not observe significantly higher levels of quantitative affinity for the students who have accumulated more credit hours. It is interesting to note that except for major, none of the impact factors analyzed had a positive effect on enjoyment. In our sample, the students who enjoy the quantitative aspects of a business education were more likely to choose either finance or accounting for their major. It is also troubling to observe that students who have actually worked as interns for businesses had no higher quantitative affinity. We speculate that this result might be influenced by the tasks allotted to the students during the internship.</p>

<title>Teaching Strategies for Enhancing Students’ Quantitative Affinity</title>
<p>There are curricular and pedagogical alternatives that may heighten the sense of quantitative affinity among students. We have categorized ways in which we may be able to lead students to greater success with quantitative aspects of marketing into four segments. These are (a) curricular, (b) pedagogical, (c) interpersonal, and (d) technological as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0273475312460764">Figure 1</xref>. The four cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0273475312460764">Figure 1</xref> are not independent of one another. Elements in one cell may facilitate items in other cells leading to our students being successful with quantitative aspects of marketing and empowering them to have confidence in their ability to work with quantitative issues.</p>

<title>Curricular Considerations</title>
<p>Too often we forget the importance of Bloom’s taxonomy of educational objectives with regard to the curricula we design and revise over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0273475312460764">Bloom, Engelhart, Furst, Hill, &amp; Krathwohl, 1956</xref>). Krathwohl has collaborated with others to revise Bloom’s original hierarchy in a manner that may be particularly useful as we consider marketing curricula and help students deal with quantitative issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0273475312460764">Krathwohl, 2002</xref>). The revised version includes (a) <italic>Remember</italic>, (b) <italic>Understand</italic>, (c) <italic>Apply</italic>, (d) <italic>Analyze</italic>, (e) <italic>Evaluate</italic>, and (f) <italic>Create</italic>. In our introductory marketing courses students may be asked to remember and understand quantitative concepts, such as markups and market shares. Once this is accomplished they may also learn to apply these concepts. As we move students into higher level courses we should review these abilities to reinforce them and then move on to higher levels of learning.</p>
<p>We cannot expect students who have not mastered the first three stages to be successful with higher levels. We should have in place mechanisms to help students validate the level of expectations we established in lower level courses. If we take the attitude that if students do not know previous material it is their own problem and we will move ahead regardless, we may be holding students back from learning more complicated concepts and moving to higher learning levels. Such gaps in students’ memories have been called “dropped stitches.” Sewing up such gaps can be time consuming for faculty and students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0273475312460764">Farrell, 2006</xref>). Fortunately there are technologies that can help us remediate such gaps. Podcasting can be used to provide students with a video review of concepts they may not have mastered or that they have forgotten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0273475312460764">Campbell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0273475312460764">Flannagan &amp; Calandra, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0273475312460764">Harris &amp; Park, 2008</xref>). Nowadays, websites such as Kahn Academy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">http://www.khanacademy.org/</ext-link>) provide accessible tutorials for quantitative concepts, helping overcome the “dropped stitches” in an unthreatening way. This should increase confidence and enjoyment when working with quantitative concepts, thus increasing students’ feelings of affinity.</p>
<p>Once we have students at a common level, our upper division courses should then focus on the <italic>Analyze, Evaluate</italic>, and <italic>Create</italic> levels of the revised taxonomy. We can have students analyze interrelationships between concepts and measurements. They can critique judgments based on quantitative data using criteria we provide. Perhaps most important, they can move to the <italic>Create</italic> level in which students synthesize what they have learned and generate original relationships that can be supported with data and data analyzes. The later phase is ideally suited to the use of computerized marketing simulations in the curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0273475312460764">Avramenko, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0273475312460764">Reid, Brown, &amp; Tabibzadeh, 2012</xref>). As students engage in decision-making activities in a competitive context they are likely to recognize the importance of quantitative tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0273475312460764">Whitely &amp; Faria, 1989</xref>) and overcome their fear of numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0273475312460764">Curland &amp; Fawcett, 2001</xref>). This may also help them realize that being quantitatively adept may increase their marketability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0273475312460764">Avramenko, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In our teaching and advising we should establish and strictly enforce a prerequisite structure in course sequencing such that course content and instructional methods follow a consistent pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0273475312460764">Islam et al., 2005</xref>). Nationwide, the trend has been for high schools to increase their math requirements and for universities to create more stringent mathematics proficiency standards for their incoming students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0273475312460764">Walker, 2009</xref>). As marketing faculty we should be actively engaged in this process to ensure that the proficiency levels established include the particular quantitative skills marketing students will need to be successful in their major courses.</p>
<p>We should resist efforts to offer quantitative courses in accelerated formats in which students meet only once a week and those that encourage weekend courses or other efforts to condense courses into shortened formats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0273475312460764">J. A. Bell, 2001</xref>). Covering quantitative concepts too quickly is likely to decrease both confidence and enjoyment and increase the likelihood of cramming which has been found to negatively affect long-term learning retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0273475312460764">McIntyre &amp; Munson, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>We should build our instructional methods around the concept of providing a “marketing connected” experience for students. In marketing we can have successful marketing professionals visit classes to share their experiences and expectations of future marketing graduates. Having female marketing professionals speak in our classes may help address the significant gender effect found in this study by providing female students positive role models. This might help them combat the effects of negative self-stereotyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0273475312460764">Shih, Pittinsky, &amp; Ambady, 1999</xref>) and give them greater confidence that they also can succeed with marketing issues in a quantitative environment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0273475312460764">
<title>Pedagogical Considerations</title>
<p>Our syllabi should be a guide to students. They should let the student know what to expect class by class. The syllabi should provide goals/objectives, should be well organized, should provide detail about tests/papers/projects, and so on and deadlines. They should include office hours which we should honor throughout the course. If students know our expectations and know that we are there to help them, trust can be created (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0273475312460764">Granitz, Koernig, &amp; Harich, 2008</xref>) that faculty can use to help reduce apprehension about dealing with data analysis and quantitative reasoning. It has also been suggested that we should “develop and promote a structure” that encourages students to seek out help at the very start of a quantitative course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0273475312460764">D’Andrea &amp; Waters, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The most consistent recommendation to come out of the literature on how faculty can manage quantitative anxiety and improve student learning is to more thoroughly integrate relevant problem-solving application exercises and real-world examples into our courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0273475312460764">Becker &amp; Greene, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475312460764">Biajone, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0273475312460764">Carlson, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0273475312460764">Easton et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0273475312460764">Gunawardine, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0273475312460764">Mvududu, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0273475312460764">Parr &amp; Smith, 1998</xref>). With regard to application exercises this typically means using cases, projects, and problems requiring students to analyze real or realistic marketing data in order to develop solutions and make recommendations. With the abundance of data that are readily available on sites such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://retailsails.com">retailsails.com</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sec.gov">sec.gov</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mergentonnline.com">mergentonnline.com</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://census.gov">census.gov</ext-link>, and so on, we have the ability to bring realism to our classes in a way that a few years ago would have been impossible.</p>
<p>With regard to real-world examples, for some of us there is easy access to marketing professionals who will visit our classes and share experiences with students. For others such access is limited. However, we all have access to network video, YouTube, and software such as Skype. We should strive to make the subject matter real and related to the current environment.</p>
<p>Finally, prominent math anxiety author Sheila Tobias argues that in order to overcome “mathphobia” we need to allow students in quantitative classes to improvise more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0273475312460764">Hechinger, 1987</xref>). This means focusing less on the use of formulas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0273475312460764">Brewer, 1990</xref>), computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0273475312460764">Becker, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0273475312460764">Brewer, 1990</xref>), and formal hypothesis testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0273475312460764">Easton et al., 1988</xref>) and, more on creative problem solving and thinking quantitatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0273475312460764">Becker &amp; Greene, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0273475312460764">Easton et al., 1988</xref>). In the sciences there are often very precise answers that are either right or wrong. This is less true in marketing. Perhaps we need to think more about process than the final result and reward students for what they do correctly. This probably means less use of multiple-choice testing with scanned grading and more work for us. This is a difficult quandary when we are faced with larger classes and increased demands for research productivity. However, written assignments and oral presentations provide faculty with the opportunity to award partial credit to recognize incomplete but successful learning.</p>

<title>Interpersonal Considerations</title>
<p>Each faculty member has his or her own unique personality which influences how interactions with students take place. However, there are some general things that apply to most, if not all, of us. Students are likely to relate better to us, and learn more from our courses, if we make ourselves real to them. This does not mean we should become their best friend. But, we should be real to them by letting them see our “human” side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0273475312460764">Granitz et al., 2008</xref>). For example, if we had difficulty with some aspects of quantitative analysis at some time we can share the experience with students to let them know “it is not just them.”</p>
<p>It is hard to tell what accessibility means to students but we need to be clear with them about what it means to us. Accessibility has several dimensions. One is the ability for students to have a discussion with faculty outside the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0273475312460764">Conant, Smart, &amp; Kelley, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0273475312460764">Granitz et al., 2008</xref>). We can accomplish this by setting specific office hours than being certain to be in the office at the specified times. We can also be available to students before and after classes. Accessibility may also mean being available via phone, e-mail, or text messages.</p>
<p>There is also an attitudinal aspect to accessibility. We can put up invisible but clear barriers that keep students at a physical or psychological distance, or we can be open and available to them. The more open we are the easier it is for us to help students learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0273475312460764">Conant et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0273475312460764">Tickle-Degnen &amp; Rosenthal, 1990</xref>). From an interpersonal perspective we all need to focus on developing rapport with our students by being positive and engaging in our interactions with students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0273475312460764">Granitz et al., 2008</xref>). The more comfortable students are with us the easier it is for us to help them learn, especially when it comes to quantitative subject matter.</p>
<p>We should welcome and encourage students to ask questions and feel that all their questions and comments are welcome both in and out of class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0273475312460764">Granitz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0273475312460764">Smart, Kelley, &amp; Conant, 2003</xref>). There are times when students ask questions about which we think that they should already know the answer. However, to move to high levels in Bloom’s taxonomy we must be careful to avoid the dropped stitches. If we are not, a “snowball effect” can result in which students are afraid to ask questions. As a result students may fall further behind increasing their confusion with each new concept. In a vicious circle, catching up may appear to be an impossible task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0273475312460764">Farrell, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0273475312460764">
<title>The Technological Dimension</title>
<p>Students now own netbooks, laptops, tablets, cell phones, and other devices that we must consider in our educational planning and delivery. Although the use of these technologies related to testing is debated among faculty, most would likely agree that we can use these technologies to help students review concepts from previous levels of learning. We can provide podcasts and/or video segments designed to remediate those annoying “dropped stitches.”</p>
<p>Computer simulations have been around for many years but are becoming increasingly a part of marketing curricula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0273475312460764">Faria &amp; Wellington, 2004</xref>). Many faculty use simulations as a way to get students involved in making various tactical and strategic marketing decisions in a pseudo-real-world setting with competitive interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0273475312460764">Reid, Brown, &amp; Tabibzadeh, 2012</xref>). We can leverage the results from simulations to encourage students to use data in creative ways as they make individual or group <italic>data-based</italic> decisions. Some simulations provide sufficient detail in the results that students can estimate a variety of elasticities (price, income, advertising, cross price, etc.) which can then be applied to their decisions. Students may be able to use their statistical background to do cross-tabulations and tests for independence, a variety of <italic>t</italic> tests, ANOVA, and regression analysis based on the results from marketing simulations. By demonstrating data analyses with data the students have generated, and having students do their own analyses, we can take an additional step toward increasing students’ affinity toward quantitative methods.</p>
<p>The saying that “a picture is worth a thousand words” is trite but true. We encourage faculty and students to take advantage of the technologies to create graphics that are engaging and that clearly communicate a concept or relationship. It has been shown that visualization of data in graphic forms can be an effective manner in which to convey relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0273475312460764">Tufte, 1983</xref>).</p>

<title>Three Resources We Have Found Useful for Students and Faculty</title>
<p>Over the years we have tried many resources to help students improve their ability to work with quantitative aspects of their academic work. The following are three that we recommend. They are listed in order by their first copyright:</p>

<title>Further Research</title>
<p>Like much of the research we do, the results reported herein raise questions that suggest additional research. Examples would include the following three streams of research:</p>
<p>First, do students’ attitudes about quantitative issues influence their decision to select marketing as a major? Do they have a perception that marketing courses are less quantitative than courses in other majors within the College of Business? Are they influenced by various entry-level courses in business, and the degree of quantitative reasoning in those courses, prior to their declaration of their major? In basic marketing courses what message do they come away with regarding quantitative analysis and its role in the courses taken by marketing majors?</p>
<p>Second, what perception do students have concerning the importance of quantitative analysis in marketing careers? Is this influenced by their parents, by high school courses/teachers, by their first course in marketing, by upper division marketing courses?</p>
<p>Third, this scale could be also used to evaluate the effectiveness of the marketing research course, or the marketing curriculum. New approaches to teaching marketing research are often identified and claimed to work better than extant approaches. A pre–post use of our scale could provide supporting evidence. Would an intervention at the start of courses reduce quantitative anxiety and enhance affinity? Perhaps we can experiment by starting some sections of selected courses (perhaps an intro course, a strategy course, and/or a marketing research course) with a discussion of issues related to attitudes concerning quantitative analyses. Then we could compare attitudes among those marketing students with students in the same classes but without the initial discussion. The 20-item instrument we developed could be administered both at the start of the courses and again near the end to measure the actual effect on students’ attitude.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our study contributes to the marketing education literature by providing a framework for assessing and influencing marketing students’ attitudes toward quantitative issues. Though our study uses a sample of students from one university, we believe that the results provide a basis for understanding the quantitative affinity of marketing students in general. Our findings should provide further incentive for professors in quantitative marketing courses, such as marketing research and marketing strategy, to use creativity, engagement, and immediacy to create greater affinity for quantitative analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0273475312460764">Williams, 2010</xref>). The finding that marketing students who have completed a marketing research class more strongly believe in the importance of quantitative methods (in comparison with other marketing students) is very encouraging and indicates that effective curriculum and pedagogy can have an impact on the quantitative affinity of students.</p>
<p>The scale developed in this study provides faculty with a specialized instrument, adapted specifically for marketing classes. This can be used to measure the effect of their interventions on student attitudes and provide them with actionable data identifying specific areas which need improvement. These data can provide a basis for increasing the effectiveness of courses in helping students to have confidence in their use of quantitative skills in future assignments, internships, and jobs. It can also aid in finding ways to enhance students’ enjoyment of working with quantitative analyses and to increase recognition of the importance of such analyses.</p>
