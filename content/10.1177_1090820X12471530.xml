   <body>
      <p>This letter is in response to the letter by Drs L. Franklyn Elliott and Bryant A. Toth<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X12471530">1</xref>
         </sup> commenting on the editorial by Dr Foad Nahai titled “The Role of Sponsored Supplements in a Peer-Reviewed Journal,” both in <italic>Aesthetic Surgery Journal</italic> (<italic>ASJ</italic>) in 2012.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X12471530">2</xref>
         </sup>
      </p>
      <p>In their letter, Drs Elliot and Toth voiced their concerns regarding a lack of fair and balanced product discussion in a recent supplement in <italic>ASJ</italic> titled “Acellular Dermal Matrix: Fundamentals and Expanding Applications of Plastic Surgery.”<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X12471530">3</xref>
         </sup> They stated that the supplement was “heavily weighted toward one company [and its acellular dermal matrix (ADM) products], with very little representation of any of the other products,” and that the majority of the contributors to the supplement were affiliated with the company that sponsored the supplement, LifeCell Corporation (Branchburg, New Jersey).</p>
      <p>Although we can agree that the supplement was “heavily weighted” toward LifeCell Corporation, it is important to consider the underlying factors that contributed to significant representation of LifeCell’s products in the discussion. It is important to acknowledge and realize that the use of ADM in plastic surgery is a new concept that emerged with the introduction of the first ADM—a human ADM—in 1994, also manufactured by the supplement sponsor. Naturally, as the prototypical ADM, this ADM has been extensively studied since 1994 in multiple applications, including burn treatment, rhinoplasty, palatoplasty, abdominal wall reconstruction, and breast surgery. Drs Elliot and Toth point out that there are several other ADM formulations currently on the market, but it is important to note that there is limited published clinical experience with those products. It is thus unsurprising if the sponsor’s ADM appeared to be “overrepresented” in the supplement. This was not an intentional focus on LifeCell products or an exclusion of other manufacturers’ products, as the comments of Drs Elliot and Roth would suggest; rather, it was a reflection of published clinical data in the literature and surgeon experience with this ADM. Furthermore, it should be noted that this situation is not unique to plastic surgery. In many therapeutic areas, the first clinically proven, effective drug often happens to be the most widely used for the same reasons: extensive clinical experience and physician comfort level.</p>
      <p>With regard to Dr Elliot and Dr Toth’s comment on author affiliations with the sponsor, we were left with the impression that they assumed that each author was selected based on his or her affiliation with the sponsor. We feel that this assumption detracts from the integrity of the authors themselves, who are highly experienced thought leaders in their respective subspecialties.</p>
      <p>Last, we would like to make a comment about supplement sponsorship in general. In 2003, <italic>Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery</italic> published a supplement that almost exclusively discussed the neuromuscular applications of botulinum toxin type A (Botox).<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12471530">4</xref>
         </sup> It is not clear whether the manufacturer of Botox, Allergan, Inc (Irvine, California), sponsored this supplement, but some of the authors were affiliated with Allergan, and 1 article reported the results of an Allergan-sponsored study. Supplements such as this are not uncommon throughout medicine, and if they are acceptable in 1 respected journal, they should also be acceptable in others. Ultimately, the real purpose of any publication is to advance state-of-the-art knowledge. Raising concerns about sponsorship, author affiliation, and product representation when author disclosures and sponsorship were clearly stated and the content was based on published literature, in our opinion, defeats that purpose and hinders advancements in our subspecialty.</p>
