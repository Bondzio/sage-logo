<abstract>
<p>Ostracism involves two parties: The group doing the exclusion (i.e., sources) and the target of the exclusion. Research on social exclusion has often focused on the targets. The current study, however, considers the experiences of both sources and targets. Members of four-person groups were randomly assigned to the roles of targets or sources of exclusion, and then interacted in a face-to-face setting. Participants’ perceptions of themselves and other group members were then evaluated and also compared with control group members. Although targets were negatively affected by exclusion, the sources of exclusion also suffered negative consequences. In addition, these interactions (which were videotaped) were coded by independent judges. The observational data revealed that people use a variety of behaviors to exclude a target, and more stringent forms of exclusion corresponded to more negative outcomes.</p>

<p>Among the most fundamental areas of research in social psychology is advancing the understanding of how people perceive themselves and others in social situations. Person perception or ordinary personology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368430211430517">Gilbert, 1998</xref>) has informed understanding of numerous social psychological phenomena. However, one area that has remained relatively untouched by person perception research is that of social ostracism. Although researchers have gone to great lengths to understand the plight of targets’ suffering in an ostracism situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430211430517">Blackhart, Nelson, Knowles, &amp; Baumeister, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211430517">Gerber &amp; Wheeler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430211430517">Williams, Forgas, &amp; von Hippel, 2005</xref>), far less work has examined processes of interpersonal perception within this social exchange (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368430211430517">DeWall, Maner, &amp; Rouby, 2009</xref> for an exception). The study presented here addresses how targets and sources of ostracism perceive themselves and one another in terms of self-esteem, mood, personality (agreeableness), and liking. Additionally this study examines the correspondence between the specific behaviors used by sources to exclude the target (independently coded from videotapes), and how targets and sources responded to the situation and one another.</p>
<p>Previous work is rich with examples of how ostracism impacts targets’ perceptions of themselves in terms of their self-esteem and mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211430517">Gerber &amp; Wheeler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430211430517">Twenge, Catanese, &amp; Baumeister, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430211430517">Williams, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430211430517">Williams, Cheung, &amp; Choi, 2000</xref>). In these studies, exclusion generally takes one of several forms, such as exclusion by confederates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430211430517">Williams, 2001</xref>), through false feedback from an experimenter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430211430517">Twenge et al., 2003</xref>), or a computer program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430211430517">Williams et al., 2000</xref>). These studies have provided considerable evidence suggesting that social ostracism is a negative experience for targets. Several studies, including meta-analyses suggest that being excluded lowers targets’ self-esteem and need to belong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211430517">Gerber &amp; Wheeler, 2009</xref>; Twenge et al, 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430211430517">Williams et al., 2000</xref>). There is also evidence to suggest that being excluded leads to an increase in negative affect, or simply flat affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211430517">Gerber &amp; Wheeler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368430211430517">Poulsen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430211430517">Twenge et al., 2003</xref>), although the reliability of this effect has been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430211430517">Blackhart et al., 2009</xref>). Still other findings suggest that exclusion leads targets to behaviorally withdraw from the group of people who exclude them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430211430517">Williams, 2001</xref>), or alternatively may increase aggressive intentions or actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368430211430517">Leary, Kowalski, Smith, &amp; Phillips, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430211430517">Twenge, Baumeister, Tice, &amp; Stucke, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1368430211430517">Warburton, Williams, &amp; Cairns, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, relatively few studies have examined how the individuals who exclude a target (i.e., the sources) respond to the experience. The existing work does suggest that sources report increased negative affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368430211430517">Ciarocco, Sommer, &amp; Baumeister, 2001</xref>) and downplay the effects exclusion has on targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430211430517">Sommer, Williams, Ciarocco, &amp; Baumeister, 2001</xref>). Additionally, both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430211430517">Williams, Shore, &amp; Grahe (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211430517">Zadro, Williams, &amp; Richardson (2005)</xref> addressed the impact of being a source of exclusion on psychological needs based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1368430211430517">Williams’ (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368430211430517">2007</xref>) models of ostracism. Of interest, these studies present somewhat different results in terms of whether sources experience threat or fortification of needs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211430517">Zadro et al. (2005)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368430211430517">Ciarocco et al. (2001)</xref> both used a confederate design to study sources of exclusion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211430517">Zadro et al. (2005)</xref> employed a clever design in which participants were assigned roles as either sources of ostracism, sources of argument, or targets of either argument or ostracism. This study found that sources generally had more fortified psychological needs and less severe negative somatic responses than targets. This was especially true for sources of ostracism rather than sources of argument. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368430211430517">Ciarocco et al. (2001)</xref> examined the effects of ostracizing a target (the confederate) by randomly assigning participants to either speak freely to the confederate or to be as silent as possible during the interaction. This study involved one source and one target, and found that sources tended to experience negative emotions. As a caveat, when exclusion occurs in a group of two, the process may be fundamentally different from ostracism in larger groups. Social Impact theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430211430517">Latané, 1981</xref>) and diffusion of responsibility processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368430211430517">Latané &amp; Nida, 1981</xref>) would suggest that when exclusion occurs in groups larger than a dyad, the sources have social support for their behavior. In addition, the opportunity to talk with other sources may make it easier for the sources to minimize their interactions with the target.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430211430517">Sommer et al. (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430211430517">Williams et al. (1998)</xref> examined sources by asking participants to recall a time when they excluded someone, and these studies suggest that sources of ostracism go through a complex psychological process. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430211430517">Williams et al. (1998)</xref> proposed that sources would have more fulfilled needs than targets, results suggested that psychological needs tended to be threatened (or equally threatened and strengthened). Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430211430517">Sommer et al. (2001)</xref> found that sources spent considerable time justifying their decision/actions of social ostracism. Thus there is some evidence that sources of ostracism pay a price when they exclude a target.</p>
<p>Taken together, both laboratory-based studies and recall studies of sources of ostracism suggest that sources seem to pay an emotional toll for their actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368430211430517">Ciarocco et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211430517">Zadro et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430211430517">Williams (1998)</xref> reviews, sources often use ostracism as a means of social control, but the current body of research suggests that this control comes at a cost. Thus, the research to date about sources of ostracism has provided some insights, but has several key limitations. Mainly, the recall studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430211430517">Sommer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430211430517">Williams et al., 1998</xref>) examined sources’ experiences using a memory task, and research has shown that such tasks are subject to bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1368430211430517">Schwarz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430211430517">Schwarz, Groves, &amp; Schuman, 1998</xref>). For instance, work on recall studies suggests that people are most likely to recall very extreme or emotional instances or very recent ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430211430517">Schwarz et al., 1998</xref>), and so sources’ recollections may not be representative of a typical ostracism experience.</p>
<p>In sum, a large body of research has examined ostracism from the perspective of the target, and a smaller body of work has examined ostracism from the perspective of the sources. Nonetheless, ostracism is an inherently social phenomenon that involves both sources and targets interacting (or perhaps not interacting) simultaneously to create the unique dynamic of ostracism in a group. The current study uses a research paradigm that allows us to study both sides of the exchange in ostracism, and explores the impact that ostracism has on how sources and targets see themselves and one another within this situation. Perceptions in ostracism groups will be compared to perceptions in control groups that do not involve exclusion, as well as within exclusion groups based on the person’s role (source or target). Video and audio recordings of the group interactions make it possible to examine target and source behaviors in this context, and will provide information concerning how these behaviors correspond to reported perceptions, and affect.</p>
<sec id="section1-1368430211430517">
<title>Predictions</title>
<p>Based on previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211430517">Gerber &amp; Wheeler, 2009</xref>), we expected that targets would have lower self-esteem compared to members of control groups in which no group members are excluded. We also expected that sources’ self-esteem would be negatively affected by the ostracism experience. Here, our reasoning was that because sources were instructed to ignore the target without additional justification, they would find their own behavior dissonant with their positive self-view. Thus, we expected that targets would have the lowest self-esteem, control subjects (who interact without exclusion instructions) would have the highest self-esteem, and sources would fall somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>Work in social ostracism also suggests that under certain conditions both targets and sources may experience negative emotions relative to controls. However, because the experience of excluding someone is vastly different than being excluded, it may be that targets and sources experience different types of negative emotions. Specifically, targets may perceive being excluded as unjust or unfair treatment from sources, and therefore should feel angrier. Sources, on the other hand, are disobeying certain norms of conversation, and therefore may feel embarrassment and guilt. Also, because targets are being rejected, targets should experience greater intensity of negative emotions than sources.</p>
<p>Another typical finding in the person perception literature in intergroup contexts is that of ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368430211430517">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211430517">Zadro et al. (2005)</xref> suggested that sources feel an enhanced sense of cohesion when excluding an <italic>unwanted</italic> group member. Thus, in the present study, we will explore if this is the case for targets who do not provoke sources. Based on social identity theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368430211430517">Tajfel and Turner, 1979</xref>) it seems likely that the three sources in the group of four people may develop a sense of group membership. If this is the case, then sources should perceive one another more favorably (i.e., as more agreeable, and like one another more) than they perceive the target (analogous to a single outgroup member). Likewise, targets should view the sources negatively.</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of actual interpersonal behavior that occurs in the exclusion groups, we expected to see some variability in how effectively sources excluded targets from the interaction. In cases where exclusion was accomplished by using stronger non-verbal signs of ignoring (e.g., limited eye contact; not responding to a comment from the target), we expected that targets would show more negative effects of ostracism on our measures of self-esteem, affect, and interpersonal perception.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1368430211430517">
<title>Overview</title>
<p>Members of four-person groups engaged in a discussion lasting 10 minutes while being videotaped. In 31 groups, three of the group members were randomly chosen to exclude the fourth group member from the discussion. In 15 control groups no instructions concerning the structure of the interaction were provided. After the interaction, participants reported about their experience in the discussion and gave their perceptions of the other group members. Participants reported on their own self-esteem, mood, level of liking for the other group members, and perceptions of other group members’ mood and level of agreeableness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1368430211430517">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants in the complete sample were 204 university students, 133 women and 71 men, enrolled in lower-level psychology courses. The sample included 168 Caucasians, 12 Asians or Asian Americans, 2 Hispanics, 14 African Americans, 1 Native American and 7 participants of multiple ethnic backgrounds. These participants comprised 51 4-person groups.</p>
<p>In five of the ostracism groups, the target of exclusion in the group verbally indicated <italic>during</italic> the discussion task that he or she suspected that he or she was being excluded from the group interaction as part of the study itself. These groups were removed from all analyses, and so the final sample included 184 participants: 122 women and 62 men. There were 31 ostracism groups and 15 non-ostracism (control) groups in the final sample.</p>

<title>Materials</title>
<sec id="section6-1368430211430517">
<title>Preliminary exercise.</title>
<p>Participants were asked to complete a demographic questionnaire in order to give the experimenter time to set up the remainder of the study, and to provide information such as gender, age, and ethnicity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1368430211430517">
<title>Post-discussion questionnaire.</title>
<p>Group members completed measures after the discussion task about their experiences in the group. All group members rated only themselves on self-esteem. All other ratings were completed in a round-robin rating style such that each group member rated him or herself and every other group member on the same scales. Group members first rated themselves and then rated each of the other group members. Participants rated one person on all items before moving on to ratings of the next person.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1368430211430517">
<title>State self-esteem. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1368430211430517">Heatherton &amp; Polivy, 1991</xref>).</title>
<p>This scale is designed to examine self-esteem moment to moment, consists of 20 items that are summed, and in this sample had an average score of <italic>M</italic> = 78.22, <italic>SD</italic> = 10.43 and a reliability of Cronbach’s α = 0.90. This scale has three subscales measuring Appearance (α = .83, <italic>M</italic> = 21.39, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.15), Social (α = .81, <italic>M</italic> = 28.13, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.62), and Performance (α = .77, <italic>M</italic> = 28.71, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.84) based state self-esteem. Participants used a 5-point scale to rate items, with the endpoints 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). Higher scale values indicated higher levels of state self-esteem.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1368430211430517">
<title>Negative emotions.</title>
<p>Participants completed round-robin ratings of their perceptions of the negative emotions that they, and each of their group members, experienced during the interaction. Items were selected from the measures assessed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368430211430517">Diener, Smith, and Fujita (1995)</xref>, and included angry, frustrated, resentful, self-conscious, embarrassed, and guilty. Each emotion was rated on a 5-point scale with endpoints of 1 (barely or not at all) to 5 (very much), with higher values indicating greater intensity of that emotion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1368430211430517">
<title>Positive emotions.</title>
<p>Participants also completed round-robin ratings of the positive emotions experienced by each group member. The positive emotion items were: Outgoing, warm, and happy, and scores were averaged across items to derive an overall measure of positive emotions. As with the negative emotion items, each positive emotion was rated on a 5-point scale with endpoints of 1 (barely or not at all) to 5 (very much), with higher values indicating greater intensity. The mean of the positive emotion scale was <italic>M =</italic> 1.42, <italic>SD =</italic> .64, with a reliability of Cronbach’s α = 0.79.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1368430211430517">
<title>Liking.</title>
<p>Participants reported on how well they liked each group member. Liking was measured on a seven-point scale with endpoints of 1(not at all) to 7 (very much), and had an average score of <italic>M</italic> = 4.70, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.21.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1368430211430517">
<title>Agreeableness.</title>
<p>Participants rated themselves and other group members on two items that assessed Agreeableness (Friendly-Unfriendly, Considerate-Inconsiderate). Participants rated these items on 7-point semantic differential scales and higher values indicated greater perceived agreeableness. Perceptions of agreeableness had an average score of <italic>M =</italic> 5.79, <italic>SD =</italic> 1.00, with a reliability of Cronbach’s α = 0.87.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1368430211430517">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>When participants arrived at the lab, they were asked to refrain from speaking to one another. The researcher first inquired as to whether any of the participants were acquainted. Acquainted individuals were not allowed to participate together in the same group. Participants then chose an identification tag attached to a necklace from an envelope that was passed around the room. This necklace had a letter (A, B, C, D) by which participants were identified during the interaction so that names were not disclosed.</p>
<p>In the ostracism condition, the researcher led each participant individually into a different room to complete a questionnaire. Persons A, B, and D were all seated in the same large room together, but person C was seated in a room alone. Participants were unaware of how they were being separated. At this point the researcher told persons A, B, and D together the true nature of the interaction in the session as they finished the preliminary questionnaire. She said,
<disp-quote>
<p>In today’s study, we are interested in how people respond to various group contexts. In today’s session, we are particularly interested in exclusion. You have all been assigned an identification letter at random, and in this condition, person C is the person who will be excluded. Person C cannot hear us right now. You will have the role of excluders in this study. This means that we would like you to do your best to minimize your interactions and communications with C. Your role in today’s study is to exclude C from the discussion and to ignore his or her comments to the fullest extent that you can. Person C does not know that you have been given any of these instructions. Although we recognize that this may be rather difficult, we ask that you do your best in your role. Are there any questions?”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The researcher asked them not to interact again until the discussion commenced, and then led the participants individually to the interaction room. Meanwhile, Person C was in a separate room and completed the preliminary questionnaire there alone. The experimenter checked on him/her often and when all participants were finished with the questionnaire, the experimenter led them, one by one to the interaction room in order of their nametags.</p>
<p>The researcher seated the participants around a square table and placed a master copy of the discussion task on the table for the participants to complete as a group. All sessions were videotaped, and participants were aware that they were being recorded. The task involved discussing and rank-ordering what equipment would be important to bring along when making a hypothetical 200-mile group trip on the surface of the moon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368430211430517">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1975</xref>). Participants were encouraged to discuss their ideas and were told that the discussion was more important than coming to a consensus for all items on the list. The researcher instructed participants to begin discussion once she left the room. The experimenter returned at the end of 10 minutes to announce the end of the discussion. She then stopped recording.</p>
<p>Each participant was given the post-discussion questionnaire to complete. The questionnaire included measures of state self-esteem, negative and positive emotions, liking, and perceived agreeableness of the group members.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1368430211430517">1</xref></sup>Members completed round-robin ratings for all scales except self-esteem. Group members were not allowed to talk to each other, but were allowed to look at each others’ nametags to help them remember which group member wore each letter.</p>
<p>The control condition involved many of the same procedures outlined above. Participants were introduced to the study in the same way and were given the same informed consent form as participants in the ostracism condition. In the control condition, unlike the ostracism condition, participants were allowed to complete the preliminary questionnaire in the same room, but spread far apart. Participants in the control condition were not given instructions regarding the structure of the discussion. The group interaction was videotaped, as in the ostracism condition, and the same interaction task was used. After the interaction, the same post-discussion questionnaire was given to participants in the control condition as in the ostracism condition.</p>

<title>Video coding: Severity of exclusion</title>
<p>Four independent raters (two men and two women; all upper-level undergraduate psychology students) coded each of the exclusion video tapes. These four raters were individually trained in the coding task using an example group that was not used in the present analyses. In addition, raters viewed the video tapes in different order, so that any calibration effects that may have occurred on the first few sessions they coded would be distributed equally. Agreement between coders on their ratings was assessed by obtaining the unstandardized Cronbach’s α reliability of all four coders on each item. Raters provided separate coded data for each of the four individual group members.</p>
<p>Raters assessed the level of each source’s use of exclusionary behavior towards the target on a 10-item, 1–9 scale. Items were framed in the question, “When C said something, to what extent did A (or B or D) _____?” Items included: Agree with C; say something negative or sarcastic about the comment; become short or terse with C; ignore the comment as if unheard; obviously hear the comment but did not respond; bring up a different idea/change the topic; interrupt with a constructive criticism; cut off C with a snide comment; steal C’s idea; respond directly to C. Raters also coded each source on the items, “How well did this person do overall at excluding person C?”, and “How rude was this person towards C?”</p>
<p>The items were examined using a principal axis factor analyses with a Promax rotation and two factors emerged: Exclusion via ignoring behaviors, and exclusion via rejection behaviors. The five items in the Ignoring scale (<italic>M =</italic> 6.78, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.16, α=.93), are: Ignore the comment as if unheard; obviously hear the comment but not respond; respond directly to C (reversed); agree with C (reversed); and do well at excluding overall. The three items that were comprised the Rejecting scale are: Bring up a different idea/change the topic; interrupt with a constructive criticism; and being rude towards person C (<italic>M</italic> = 3.52, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.08, α = .83).</p>

<title>Data-analytic approach</title>
<p>Four sets of multilevel models (MLM) that included a random intercept to account for nonindependence within groups were used to test the study hypotheses. The first set of analyses examined self-esteem scores for control participants, sources of ostracism, and targets of ostracism (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1368430211430517">Table 1</xref>). The second set of analyses contrasted self-ratings and ratings of other group members in control versus ostracism groups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1368430211430517">Table 2</xref>). Note that in these analyses, other-ratings in the ostracism groups were not differentiated by participant role (i.e., source or target). The next set of analyses provided a closer examination of interpersonal perception data within the ostracism groups by comparing sources’ ratings of other sources, the target, and themselves with targets’ ratings of the sources and themselves (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1368430211430517">Table 3</xref>). Significant effects from these analyses were followed-up using pairwise tests with a Bonferroni correction for family-wise error. Finally, the last analyses examined whether the method of ostracism (i.e., ignoring versus rejecting) moderated the effects (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1368430211430517">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1368430211430517">5</xref>).</p>

<title>Self- versus other-perceptions in ostracism and control groups</title>
<p>We used a treatment condition (ostracism versus control) by ratee (self versus other) factorial multilevel analysis to examine ratings of negative emotions, positive emotions, liking, and agreeableness As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1368430211430517">Table 2</xref>, there were significant main-effects for condition for five of the six negative emotions. Specifically, ostracism group members reported that they and their other group members experienced higher levels of anger, frustration, resentment, embarrassment, and guilt than did control group members. Additionally, there were ratee main effects for guilt and agreeableness. The ratee effect for agreeableness reflected the fact that across the two types of groups, individuals rated themselves as more agreeable than they rated their fellow group members. The ratee effect for guilt was qualified by a significant condition by ratee interaction such that individuals in the ostracism groups tended to report that they experienced greater guilt than other group members, but no such difference emerged in the control groups. Finally, the comparison between how much individuals liked their group members differed between control and ostracism groups with people in the ostracism condition indicating that they liked their group members less, relative to those in the control condition.</p>

<title>Differences in interpersonal perceptions <italic>within</italic> ostracism groups</title>
<p>Our next analyses focused on differences between self- and other-ratings in the ostracism groups. In these analyses we tested a multilevel model treating rating type (source rating self, source rating other sources, source rating target, target rating self, and target rating sources) as a categorical independent variable. As before, significant tests were followed by pairwise comparisons using a Bonferroni correction. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1368430211430517">Table 3</xref>, sources experienced the lowest levels of anger and frustration based on their self-ratings and their ratings of the other sources. Targets rated themselves as feeling more angry and frustrated than sources, yet significantly less angry and frustrated than sources perceived them to be. Similarly, sources rated targets as significantly more resentful, self-conscious, and embarrassed than they rated themselves or other sources. In this case, however, targets did not report experiencing high levels of these negative emotions. There were also significant differences in guilt emotions. Sources rated themselves higher on guilt than they rated other sources. Sources also perceived that targets felt more guilt than targets perceived that sources experienced. Targets ratings of self and sources on guilt did not differ.</p>
<p>In addition, ratings of positive emotion differed between the five rating types. Sources experienced the most positive emotion in the study, according to themselves, other sources and target ratings. Targets experienced less positive emotion according to self and source ratings. Analyses of agreeableness indicated that there was a mean difference between the five rating-types such that sources and targets rated themselves as most agreeable, and targets rated sources as least agreeable. Finally, liking ratings indicate that targets of ostracism did not tend to like the sources who excluded them, and the sources didn’t evidence much liking of the targets either. However, the sources did report higher liking for the other sources in the group.</p>
<p>We conducted a follow-up analysis that contrasted the self-ratings in control groups with the self-ratings of targets and sources in the ostracism groups using a multilevel analysis with a Bonferroni correction for multiple tests. Here we examined whether there were differences between sources’ self-ratings, targets’ self-ratings, and self-ratings in the control condition (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1368430211430517">Table 2</xref> for the control self-rating means and <italic>SD</italic>s and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1368430211430517">Table 3</xref> for the source and target self-ratings means and <italic>SD</italic>s). Results indicated that targets experienced significantly higher anger and frustration and lower overall positive emotion than did sources or controls, who did not differ. Targets also reported greater resentment than controls, however the comparison between targets and sources was not statistically significant. Notably, there were no differences between sources’, targets’, and controls’ self-ratings of self-consciousness, embarrassment, or agreeableness. Finally sources reported experiencing significantly more guilt than did either targets or controls.</p>

<title>Video coding data</title>
<p>As noted in the method section, independent coders rated the degree to which each source excluded the target using ignoring and rejecting behaviors. These coded variables were used in two sets of MLM analyses. In the first set we examined what might be termed <italic>actor</italic> effects (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1368430211430517">Table 4</xref>). The actor effects examined whether sources who used ignoring or rejecting behaviors to a greater degree saw other sources, the target, and him or herself more negatively. Models examining actor effects included the main effect of the source’s behavior, the main effect of rating type (i.e., sources rating sources, sources rating targets, sources rating self; not discussed here as this overlaps with previously discussed results), and the interaction between rating-type and source’s behavior. The <italic>F</italic>-test for the main effect of the sources own behavior on his or her perceptions (see column 1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1368430211430517">Table 4</xref>) tests whether sources who excluded the target more successfully using ignoring (or rejecting) behaviors tended to perceive all other group members as experiencing more of an emotion or attribute. The interaction (column 2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1368430211430517">Table 4</xref>) tests whether the source’s behavior was differentially predictive of his or her perceptions depending on who was being perceived (other sources, the target, self). Finally, the regression coefficients in the final three columns of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1368430211430517">Table 4</xref> are simple slopes for the sources’ behaviors predicting the sources’ perceptions separately by rating type.</p>
<p>Several findings are apparent in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1368430211430517">Table 4</xref>. First, the significant interactions between the sources’ ignoring behavior and the rating type suggest that the relationship between greater use of ignoring behaviors differed depending on who was being rated. Specifically, the pattern of simple slopes indicates that sources who excluded the target using more ignoring behaviors perceived those targets as experiencing more anger, frustration, and resentment. These sources also reported liking the targets less. There was little evidence that use of ignoring behaviors predicted perceptions of other sources or self for these variables. However, the significant main effects of the sources behavior on ratings of embarrassment and guilt suggest that sources who used more ignoring tended to see everyone in the group as more embarrassed and guilty. A similar pattern emerged for sources using more rejecting behaviors, although rejecting behaviors did not predict differences in liking.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1368430211430517">Table 5</xref> presents the results for <italic>partner</italic> effects of the source’s behavior. These effects assess whether sources who used ignoring or rejecting behaviors more were <italic>seen by</italic> other sources and the target more negatively. As can be seen in the table, sources who used more ignoring behaviors were seen as angrier—especially by targets. These sources were also seen as more embarrassed, less agreeable, and less likable by targets, and they were seen as experiencing more guilt by both sources and targets. A similar pattern occurred for targets perceptions of sources who used more rejecting behavior. These sources were seen as more embarrassed and guilty and less likable by the targets. In contrast, sources who used more rejecting behaviors were actually perceived to have experienced more positive emotions and were seen as less self-conscious, more agreeable, and more likeable by the other sources.</p>

<sec id="section21-1368430211430517" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Results of this study converge to suggest that both sources and targets of exclusion experience negative outcomes. We saw this in the analyses comparing self- and other-perceptions in ostracism groups with self- and other-perceptions in control groups, we saw this in the analyses that compared perceptions within the ostracism groups, and we saw this in the analyses relating outcomes to the specific source behaviors during the interaction. However, there was also evidence that sources may have experienced some positive outcomes. In-line with prior theoretical work, the current data suggest that sources seemed to have established a sort of in-group bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211430517">Zadro et al., 2005</xref>). They tended to like one another more than they liked or were liked by the target, and they were seen especially positively by other sources to the extent that they used more rejecting behaviors to exclude the target.</p>
<p>Although it is not surprising that targets of exclusion did not particularly like the sources, it is notable that the sources reciprocated these relatively low feelings of liking for the target. Such reactions from sources have several possible explanations. First, the act of excluding a stranger is a difficult and embarrassing social task that violates basic social interaction norms. Therefore, even though sources were aware that they were playing a role in the study, the social impact of excluding someone may have engendered a “blame the victim” mindset. Indeed, this may reflect a very basic self-perception process (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368430211430517">Bem, 1972</xref>) in which sources used their own behavior toward the target as information about their perceptions of the target. A second, possibility is that this pattern emerged because of reciprocity processes—the targets perceived the sources negatively because of the way they were treated, and the sources reciprocated. Alternatively, sources’ responses may have been driven by demand characteristics inherent in the study procedure. That is, because sources were aware that they were playing a role in the study, they may have reported what they thought the experimenter expected. However, we believe that it is more likely that our results reflect genuine reactions rather than expectancy effects.</p>
<p>Contrary to predictions, this study yielded null-results in terms of the effect exclusion had on self-esteem. This was surprising given that the link between ostracism and self-esteem tends to be a robust finding in other labs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430211430517">Twenge et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430211430517">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430211430517">Williams et al., 2000</xref>), has an effect size of -.70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211430517">Gerber &amp; Wheeler, 2009</xref>), and is considered in to be among the fundamental needs threatened by exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1368430211430517">Williams, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430211430517">2001</xref>). Other labs that regularly find negative effects of ostracism on target’s self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430211430517">Twenge et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430211430517">Williams et al., 2000</xref>) tend to use different ostracism paradigms (e.g., Cyberball, false feedback about the future), and they tend to measure mood and self-esteem using very short or single-item measures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211430517">Robins, Hendin, &amp; Trzesniewski, 2001</xref>). Additionally, from a theoretical standpoint, given <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368430211430517">Williams’ (2007)</xref> model of temporal responses to ostracism, it may be that self-esteem is impacted more during the reflexive stage, rather than the reflective stage (which is when it was measured in this study). Thus, null effects for self-esteem in this study could be due in part to the timing of measures. Finally, our results are not entirely atypical in light of the meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430211430517">Blackhart et al. (2009)</xref>, who suggested that laboratory manipulations of ostracism do not in fact typically induce lower self-esteem; rather it is a contrast effect with included controls. On the other hand, since our control group involved normative levels of inclusion (but not enhanced inclusion); it is difficult to say with certainty that our control group was in fact ‘neutral’.</p>
<p>One controversy that has emerged in the past decade of ostracism research is the impact it has on emotions. Prior work has provided evidence that targets experience a lack of emotion, even numbness (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430211430517">DeWall &amp; Baumeister, 2006</xref> for a review). However, the current study suggests that although targets and sources experience negative emotions as a result of ostracism, they experience different types of negative emotions. Specifically, we found that targets experienced higher anger and frustration, but sources experienced greater guilt. This pattern may have occurred because of the unfairness created by the ostracism context in this study. It may be that emotional reactions to ostracism—perhaps especially those of the sources—depend on the legitimacy of the underlying cause for excluding an individual. If there is a consensual and justified reason for excluding someone, we suspect that feelings of guilt may be attenuated. A study that systematically varies legitimacy for the ostracism is therefore an important direction for future research.</p>
<p>Of unique interest in this study were results pertaining to how ostracism impacts person-perception for sources and targets. Results demonstrated that some of the effects commonly found when considering ingroup-outgroup status on perception seem to hold in an ostracism situation. In a sense, a target is a lone outgroup member in a group of sources (all ingroup members). Thus in-group favoritism, out-group derogation, and other processes involved in intergroup interactions may explain the current pattern of results, and may also be useful in understanding the effects of ostracism more broadly.</p>
<p>Another contribution of this study is the fact that the sources and the targets were research participants whose behavior was allowed to vary, an approach rarely used to study exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211430517">Zadro et al., 2005</xref>). Although this approach has some disadvantages, particularly in the areas of experimental control and consistency, it has some marked advantages as well. This approach allowed us to study the ostracism context from both sides of the interaction, providing information on the sources’ experiences as well as the target’s. Moreover, our use of independent coders who provided an objective assessment of the degree to which each source excluded the target allowed us to examine whether variation in the sources’ actual behaviors related to all group members’ outcomes.</p>
<p>In terms of the need-threat model, it appears that much like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430211430517">Williams et al. (1998)</xref>, our results paint a mixed picture, at least in terms of sources. Self-esteem seemed to not be fortified or threatened for sources; and if one considers levels of liking among group members to be a proxy for levels of belonging, then it appears that being a source was linked with higher belonging than being a target, but was lower than in control groups, which were generally inclusive based on video-taped observations.</p>
<p>Sources varied in the specific behaviors they used to exclude the target. It is interesting to therefore reflect on how these behaviors play out in other ostracism paradigms. For instance, in Cyberball (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430211430517">Williams et al., 2000</xref>), exclusion is primarily accomplished through ignoring the presence of the target. In other research paradigms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430211430517">Twenge et al., 2003</xref>) targets are more directly rejected, as when they learn that no one wants to work with them. These nuanced differences in exclusionary behavior may produce different results, although the differences were relatively subtle in the present study. Certainly the variation of exclusion behaviors across research paradigms and in the real world is far richer. These results mirror those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430211430517">Blackhart et al. (2009)</xref> which suggest that different forms of exclusion can elicit different responses from targets.</p>
<p>The implications of this study speak to real-world ostracism, where (unlike the laboratory) there is no control over how strongly or weakly a peer uses ostracism on a target. Recent incidents of suicide purportedly caused by bullying and ostracism from family and friends suggest that exclusion can take extreme forms with tragic consequences. Our results suggest that sources of real-world ostracism may find themselves, and their perceptions of the target being influenced through their own acts of exclusion. For instance, they may experience an increased social bond with other sources as well as an increase in their feelings of dislike for the target. Paired together, if excluding someone enhances the source’s ingroup cohesiveness and also increases dislike of the target then the exclusion itself should become all the easier to justify (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430211430517">Haslam, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368430211430517">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study takes some important steps in understanding how group dynamics and severity of exclusion can impact targets and sources. However, it creates new questions: Might mild forms of ostracism have a cumulative effect over time? Are the psychological processes of sources explainable (and thereby preventable) through a combination of feelings of anonymity and dehumanization of the target? By understanding more about the influence of group processes within an ostracism exchange, we have begun to have a better understanding of the consequences of social ostracism.</p>
