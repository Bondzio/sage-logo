<abstract>
<p>A novel botanic biopreservative was successfully prepared by the combination of the bamboo leaves extracts and ebony extracts, designated as ebony–bamboo leaves complex extracts (EBLCE), whose antimicrobial activity was assessed according to an inhibition zone method against 10 common pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms. It was found that EBLCE was more effective from all the chosen microorganisms, as compared by potassium sorbate. Due to its excellent antimicrobial activity, and some additional properties like edibility, safety and economy, EBLCE was selected for further study to evaluate the efficacy in prolonging shelf life and improving the quality of peeled <italic>Penaeus vannamei</italic> during storage at 4 °C, based on periodical microbiological, chemical and sensory analysis. As a result, EBLCE was observed to prevent spoilage of peeled <italic>P. vannamei</italic> efficiently as reflected by a distinct decrease in total viable count, pH and total volatile basic nitrogen, as well as a slower decline in the sensory evaluation scores. Therefore, a prolonged shelf life of 16 days was obtained for EBLCE pre-treated peeled shrimps with comparison of 6 days for the control group, demonstrating EBLCE as a promising alternative for preserving food.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1082013212443061" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>As estimated, approximately 25% loss of food is due to spoilage, especially bacterial spoilage, which leads to the decrease of quality, as well as the increase of health risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013212443061">Baird-Parker, 2000</xref>). In particular, aquatic products are extremely perishable food and are more prone to be contaminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013212443061">Gram and Dalgaard, 2002</xref>). Among them, shrimp, one of the most widely consumed aquatic products, also one of the most important seafood traded worldwide, due to its high-nutritive value and delicious taste, is considered as one of the most perishable foods and is rather apt to decompose by the action of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013212443061">Lu, 2009</xref>). As a result, it leads to the formation of a serial of undesirable compounds, which are responsible for the unacceptable and pungent odors, and subsequently it provokes the decrease of shelf life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013212443061">Gram and Dalgaard, 2002</xref>). Different measures have been taken to either kill the microorganisms, or delay and even inhibit the microbial growth, which progressively prolong the shelf life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1082013212443061">Ding et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1082013212443061">Sivertsvik and Birkeland, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1082013212443061">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). The extension of shelf life is of great importance for transporting the products to distant markets at lower costs. Among the measures adopted, addition of preservative offers the most frequent approach and is proven to be a convenient and effective solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1082013212443061">Bosley and Wainright, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1082013212443061">Qureshi et al., 2008</xref>). At present, chemical preservatives, especially sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate, have been extensively used in the control of pathogens and spoilage microorganisms due to the well-proven antimicrobial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1082013212443061">Yesudhason et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1082013212443061">Yuzbasioglu et al., 2011</xref>). These artificial preservatives, however, would be harmful to some extent and were reported to have some potentially undesirable effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1082013212443061">Tassou et al., 1996</xref>). Therefore, searching for safe, natural and efficient preservatives becomes a great concern to consumers.</p>
<p>Recently, there is an increasing interest in exploring natural preservatives with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, and as a result, a considerable number of researches have focused on this topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013212443061">Fliss et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013212443061">Jacobsen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1082013212443061">Wessels and Huss, 1996</xref>). Biopreservatives could be prepared from microorganisms, animals and plants, which contain numerous physiologically active substances exhibiting antibacterial and antioxidant activity. Up till now, antimicrobial active compounds were predominantly derived from microorganisms, such as nisin, pentocin, lysozyme and so on, while abundant plant resources which also contain many antimicrobial active compounds remain comparatively unexplored and seem to be promising. It has been reported that 400,000 kinds of secondary metabolites, including terpenes, alkaloids, flavonoids, steroids, phenols, amino acids and polysaccharides, produced from 1389 kinds of plants, exhibited antibacterial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1082013212443061">Swait, 1997</xref>). Bamboo, whose leaves contain abundant bioactive components like flavonoids, coumarin lactones, polysaccharides and so on, has attracted substantial attention on extraction of these effective compounds. Recently, a considerable number of researches have demonstrated the antimicrobial activity, anticancer activity and antioxidant activity due to these bioactive compounds in bamboo leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1082013212443061">Kim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013212443061">Lu et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, ebony not only shows excellent antidiarrhea and antitussive potential, but also antimicrobial activity. Other plants, like chilli, garlic, tea, ginger and so on, are also proved to be good resources for extraction of natural food preservatives, which play important roles in retarding microbial contamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1082013212443061">Leuschner and Ielsch, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1082013212443061">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1082013212443061">Yildirim et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, preparation of edible, effective and safe preservatives from the plants remains attractive and promising.</p>
<p>In this study, a new natural preservative was prepared from two plants, namely bamboo and ebony. The efficacy of the preservative against bacterial contamination was investigated by an inhibition zone method. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of the preservative on prolonging shelf life and improving the quality of fresh peeled <italic>P. vannamei</italic> was evaluated on the basis of chemical, microbiological and sensory characteristics.</p>

<p>Bamboo leaves were plucked from Anji bamboo forest (Zhejiang, China) while ebonies were commercially available. Fresh <italic>P. vannamei</italic>, with an average length and weight of 15 cm and 25 g, respectively, was kindly donated by Zhejiang Industrial Group Co., Ltd. (Zhejiang, China). Potassium sorbate was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St Louis, MO, USA). All other chemicals were of analytical grade purity and commercially available.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1082013212443061"><title>Test microorganisms</title>
<p>Ten common pathogens and spoilage microorganisms, which were provided by our lab, namely,<italic> Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Salmonella irumu</italic>, <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, <italic>Bacillus megaterium</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic>, <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic>, <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> as bacteria candidates and <italic>Candida utilis</italic> as a fungi candidate, were selected to investigate the efficacy of the new natural preservative.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1082013212443061"><title>Media</title>
<p>Medium used for bacteria cultivation consisted of the following components (g/L): beef extract 5, peptone 10, NaCl 5, agar 20, whereas incubation of <italic>C</italic>.<italic> utilis</italic> was carried out on solid medium composed of malt extract of 6°Bé, agar 20 g/L. These media were poured into Petri dishes and allowed to solidify after sterilization at 121 °C for 20 min.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1082013212443061"><title>Preparation of ebony leaves extracts</title>
<p>Ebony was washed thoroughly with flowing tap water and then dried. After that, the dried materials obtained were cut into small pieces, 50 g of which were added to 500 mL of water and were dipped in for 60 min. The mixture was then heated to boiling, followed by decoction on mild fire for 60 min, the percolate of which was harvested by filtration. Meanwhile, the residues were added to appropriate amount of water, and the mixture was then subjected to the same procedure with the exception that decoction was carried out for 30 min. The above two filtrations were incorporated and condensed on a rotary evaporator to approximately 50 mL, which was considered as ebony extracts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1082013212443061"><title>Preparation of the bamboo leaves extracts</title>
<p>Ten grams of the minced bamboo leaves, which were prewashed and dried, were brought to 500 mL round-bottom flask containing 250 mL of ethanol (60%, v/v). Then, extraction was carried out using the mixture under the microwave power of 700 W for 7 min. After extraction, percolate was condensed to 100 mL of bamboo extract.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1082013212443061"><title>Preparation of ebony-bamboo leaves complex extracts (EBLE)</title>
<p>The complex preservative was prepared by mixing ebony extracts and bamboo leaves extracts derived from the former two procedures with a ratio of 30 : 70 (v/v). The mixtures were subsequently submitted to a spray dryer (ADL311-A/ADL311S-A, Yamato, Japan) at inlet and outlet temperatures of 175 and 95 °C, respectively, with a feeding rate of 1 mL/min. Subsequently, solid substances, considered as the end products, were obtained with a yield of 1.8%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1082013212443061"><title><italic>P. vannamei</italic> sample preparation</title>
<p>For accurate evaluation of the effectiveness of the novel preservative, <italic>P. vannamei</italic> were manually headed off and peeled, since browning reactions, rather than microbial spoilage, would have been the limiting factor of shelf life for the whole specimens. EBLCE was added to fresh peeled <italic>P. vannamei</italic> uniformly to a final concentration of 1 g/kg, whereas samples without any addition were taken as controls. Afterwards, they were placed in sterile plastic bags and airproofed, which then remained in a refrigerator of 4 °C for 30 days. The samples of 20 g portion were withdrawn at an interval of 3 days for evaluation of the effect of the preservative, in terms of microbiological, chemical and sensory analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1082013212443061"><title>Zone of inhibition</title>
<p>For evaluation of antimicrobial activity, the 10 selected indicator microorganisms were pre-activated in the aforementioned media under 30 °C for 24 h. Subsequently, 0.2 mL of cell suspensions (5 × 10<sup>7</sup>–5 × 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mL) of these testing microorganisms, which were obtained by serial dilution with physiological saline solution, was spread on the plate uniformly. Filter paper discs of 6 mm in diameter were prepared and autoclaved to ensure sterilization. Subsequently, discs impregnated with 200 μL of EBLCE (1%, w/v) and potassium sorbate (1%, w/v), respectively, were placed aseptically and gently over the seeded solidified media. The plates were then incubated at 30 °C for 24 h, after which diameters of the inhibition zones were measured with a caliper. Each assay was performed in triplicate. A comparison was made between diameters of the inhibition zones obtained with EBLCE and those with potassium sorbate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1082013212443061"><title>Microbiological analyses of peeled <italic>P. vannamei</italic></title>
<p>The samples taken every 3 days, were aseptically introduced into 180 mL of sterile physiological saline solution with 0.1% peptone in a stomacher bag, which was then homogenized for 2 min. Serial 10-fold dilutions of the resulting homogenates were carried out using the same diluent. Subsequently, 0.1 mL of each dilution was pipetted onto the surface of the plate count agar in petri dishes for total viable count (TVC), where triplicate agar plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. For enumeration of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp., a Cetrimide Fusidin Cephaloridine agar was used (25 °C, 48 h). H<sub>2</sub>S-producing bacteria (typical of <italic>Shewanella putrefaciens</italic>), were enumerated by spread plating on Iron agar (25 °C, 48 h). Growth medium 0.50% NaCl incubated at 10 °C for 7 days was used for <italic>Photobacterium</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013212443061">Dalgaard et al., 1997</xref>) enumeration. Plates containing 25–250 cfu/mL were selected for counting.</p>

<sec id="sec13-1082013212443061"><title>Determination of pH</title>
<p>For the measurement of pH, a 20-g portion withdrawn was homogenized in 180 mL distilled water, which was then filtered. The pH value of the resulting filtrate was monitored in triplicate with a pH meter (EL20, Mettler Toledo, Switzerland).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1082013212443061"><title>Determination of TVB-N</title>
<p>For determination of TVB-N, which includes ammonia, trimethylamine (TMA), dimethylamine (DMA) and other basic nitrogenous compounds associated with spoilage of aquatic products, 10 g of sample was homogenized with 190 mL of distilled water into a 500 mL round bottom flask. The mixture was supplemented with 1 g of magnesium oxide and a drop of silicone as antifoam solvent before steam distillation. Samples were distilled into a 250 mL conical flask containing 25 mL of 3% aqueous solution of boric acid, 0.04 mL of methyl red and methylene blue as mixed indicators for the titration of ammonia. One hundred and twenty-five milliliters of distillate was collected. Due to the resulting total volatile basic nitrogen, the boric acid solution became green. Hydrochloric acid (0.1 mol/L) was used to titrate the above solution. Titration termination was judged by the change of the color from green to pink. TVB-N was expressed as mg TVB-N per 100 g samples and calculated as follows: % mg TVB-N = (<italic>V</italic> × <italic>C</italic> × 14 × 100)/10, where <italic>V</italic> represented the volume of hydrochloric acid added, and <italic>C</italic> stood for the concentration of hydrochloric acid.</p>

<sec id="sec15-1082013212443061"><title>Sensory analyses of peeled <italic>P. vannamei</italic></title>
<p>Fish samples were assessed on the basis of appearance, odor and texture by seven trained panelists, experienced in marine food sensory evaluation, each of whom was asked to score independently on a 5-point hedonic scale (5: excellent, 4: good, 3: acceptable, 2: poor and 1: extremely poor). The scores of the seven panelists were averaged to obtain the panel mean score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1082013212443061">Lavrova and Krilova, 1975</xref>). The score of overall acceptance equaled the sum of the scores of appearance, odor and texture.</p>

<sec id="sec17-1082013212443061"><title>Zone of inhibition assay</title>
<p>This assay was conducted to qualitatively assess the sensitivity of all the tested microorganisms to the novel complex preservatives prepared from ebony–bamboo leaves extracts. Antimicrobial effectiveness was expressed as the diameter of the inhibition zone (clear zone around discs). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013212443061">Table 1</xref>, EBLCE was able to inhibit the growth of all isolates tested, including some gram positive bacteria, gram negative bacteria, and also yeast (<italic>C</italic>.<italic> utilis</italic>), with a diameter range of 8.7 ± 0.19 to 18.6 ± 0.86 mm. In comparison, smaller diameters were observed in potassium sorbate-treated plates, implying that EBLCE is more effective in inhibiting microbial contamination. In particular, EBLCE exerted excellent antimicrobial efficacy against some common pathogen microorganisms of sea food such as <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, with large inhibition zones of 17.9 ± 0.63, 18.2 ± 0.77 and 18.6 ± 0.86 mm, respectively, while potassium sorbate, the most widely used preservative, displayed a considerable lower capacity toward <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>, with inhibition zones of only 6.8 and 9.6 mm, respectively. Moreover, it was noteworthy that no inhibition zone occurred on the plate inoculated with <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> when potassium sorbate was used as the preservative, indicating a high tolerance of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> to potassium sorbate. Inhibition zone of 9.3 ± 0.32 mm obtained for <italic>C</italic>.<italic> utilis</italic> in the assay demonstrated the antifungal activity of EBLCE. These results suggested the excellent antimicrobial potency of EBLCE, in light of distinctly larger inhibition zone and broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. The antimicrobial constituents like flavonoids in bamboo leaves and organic acids including citric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid and ascorbic acid in ebony might be responsible for the superior inhibitory action of EBLCE against microorganisms. Moreover, nutrient components including terpenes, flavonoids, phenols, amino acids, polysaccharides, vitamins and trace elements in the complex extracts add to the superiority of the novel preservative, which display additional functions like anticancer, antioxidant, antidiarrhea and antitussive activity besides antimicrobial activity. Therefore, this novel botanic preservative, due to the abstracting properties, was chosen for further studies to investigate its effectiveness in the storage of fresh peeled <italic>P. vannamei</italic>.

<p>As known to all, food spoilage is predominately attributed to microbial multiplication. Hence, quantity of microorganism is an index of great importance to food, especially high-protein food, such as seafood. Microbiological criteria for seafood include TVC, TC, also some plate counts for common spoilage microorganisms like <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. and H<sub>2</sub>S-producing bacteria as well, among which, TVC was the most common and convenient parameter. Changes in TVC of EBLCE-treated <italic>P. vannamei</italic> during the storage were depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013212443061">Figure 1</xref>, with untreated samples as controls. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013212443061">Figure 1</xref>, initial TVC of the samples was found to be a low value of 3.7 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g, indicating comparatively good quality and low level of microflora of the initial shrimp. Subsequently, TVC displayed increasing trends over the period of storage for both the treated and untreated samples, though to different extents. As expected, increase in TVC values of untreated samples took place at a faster rate than that of EBLCE-treated ones. The average difference turned out to be 0.85 log units on day 3, whereas this difference was enlarged to 1.63 log units on the 9th storage day, underlining that EBLCE restrained the growth of these bacteria to a large extent. In general, the microbial limit of acceptability is set as 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/g of TVC for seafood, considering that once TVC exceeded 6 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g level, samples become unacceptable. According to this permissible limit, control group could not be consumed after 6 days, whereas shrimp pre-treated with EBLCE was acceptable before 15 days.

<p>Bacterial spoilage of seafood is mainly caused by several Gram-negative bacteria, which are designated as the ‘specific spoilage organisms’ (SSOs), such as <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp., H<sub>2</sub>S-producing bacteria (typical of <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic>), and<italic> Photobacterium</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013212443061">Dalgaard, 1995</xref>). The microbial activity and especially the formation of volatiles such as TMA, ammonium and H<sub>2</sub>S of SSOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013212443061">Dalgaard, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1082013212443061">Tryfinopoulou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1082013212443061">Vogel et al., 2005</xref>), contributes to the off flavours and taste associated with spoilt seafood. These microorganisms might result in detectable spoilage sometimes even at low TVC, so it is of significant necessity to measure these indicators. The effects of EBLCE on <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp., H<sub>2</sub>S-producing bacteria (typical of <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic>), and<italic> Photobacterium</italic> spp. counts for peeled <italic>P. vannamei</italic> stored at 4 °C were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013212443061">Figure 2</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013212443061">Figure 2(a)</xref>, growth of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. in untreated shrimp samples increased exponentially during storage, whereas growth in EBLCE-treated samples was significantly reduced or prevented. Little growth occurred in EBLCE pre-treated samples during the first 6 days, while after 9<sup>th</sup> storage <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. counts began to increase and 5.36 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g was detected on 15<sup>th</sup> storage day. <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> counts were kept well below the critical spoilage level, which was set as 7 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013212443061">Ayres, 1960</xref>). However, the control group reached this acceptable limit before the 6<sup>th</sup> storage day. EBLCE displayed similar inhibition effects on both the growth of H<sub>2</sub>S-producing bacteria and<italic> Photobacterium</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013212443061">Figure 2(b) and (c)</xref>). A cell amount reduction of 1.29 and 1.12 log cycle for H<sub>2</sub>S-producing bacteria and<italic> Photobacterium</italic> spp., respectively, was observed on the 15th storage day when compared with the control group. According to the research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1082013212443061">Lougovois et al. (2003)</xref>, seafood would be rejected when H<sub>2</sub>S-producing bacteria counts exceeded 5 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g. EBLCE pre-treated shrimps were acceptable before day 15, while the control group would be rejected after 6<sup>th</sup> storage day. Based on the results of TVC, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp., H<sub>2</sub>S-producing bacteria, and<italic> Photobacterium</italic> spp. analyses, the shelf-life of the control group was below 6 days, whereas shelf-life of the shrimp pre-treated with EBLCE extended to 15 days, which was 9 days prolongation of shelf life, owing to the inhibitory effect of our novel natural preservative on spoilage bacteria.

<p>Up to date, there was little data concerning the application of EBLCE as a biopreservative, though a large number of data about application of biopreservatives on food were available. Nisin, carvacrol and thymol have all been reported to be biopreservatives acting on some spoilage microorganisms. In these cases, reduction in TVC was observed, to different extents, which led to the delay of spoilage. However, the antimicrobial efficiency of nisin, carvacrol or thymol used alone as a biopreservative was slightly low, they should be always used in combination with other preservatives or other techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013212443061">Lu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1082013212443061">Mahmoud et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1082013212443061">Mastromatteo et al., 2010</xref>). In comparison, antibacterial activity of EBLCE, the mixture of ebony extracts and bamboo leaves extracts, was significantly higher than that of ebony extracts or bamboo leaves extracts alone. The powder form of EBLCE, with broad spectrum and high-antimicrobial efficacy, could efficiently slow down the spoilage, which could in turn decrease health risks and enhance the quality. Hence, it could be directly supplemented without combination with other preservatives or techniques, which added to the convenience of the use of EBLCE.</p>

<sec id="sec20-1082013212443061"><title>pH</title>
<p>As is known, pH value is linked to deterioration of food, despite that it is not a criterion of spoilage. Variation of pH values of peeled <italic>P. vannamei</italic> stored at 4 °C are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1082013212443061">Figure 3</xref>. The initial pH turned out to be 6.43, which reflected the good quality of the samples. It was in accordance with the initial TVC of 3.7 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g, which reflected the freshness of peeled <italic>P. vannamei</italic> as well. As seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1082013212443061">Figure 3</xref>, similar trends were noticed between samples pretreated with EBLCE and the control, whose pH values decreased slightly on the 3<sup>rd</sup> storage day and subsequently increased gradually with the storage time, indicating the loss of quality. Similar phenomena were also reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013212443061">Alasalvar et al. (2001)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1082013212443061">Gopal et al. (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1082013212443061">Fan et al. (2009)</xref>. The slight decrease during the initial days might be ascribed to the depletion of energy, which resulted in the production of lactate and dissolution of CO<sub>2</sub> by endogenous enzymes of peeled <italic>P. vannamei</italic>, while the pH increase could be possibly explained by the accumulation of basic nitrogen compounds, such as ammonia and other basic nitrogenous compounds, predominantly due to proteolysis derived from microbial action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013212443061">Benjakul et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1082013212443061">Ruiz-Capillas and Moral, 2001</xref>). It was observed that pH of EBLCE-treated samples increased at a lower rate compared with that of control. Consequently, pH value of 8.04 and 7.95 was monitored for EBLCE-treated samples on the 18<sup>th</sup> storage day and the control on the 8<sup>th</sup> storage day, respectively. The increasing trend of pH of both EBLCE-treated samples and the control indicated that spoilage of the samples took place. However, the smaller extent of pH increase with the storage time confirmed the inhibitory effects of the novel preservative on microbial growth, which led to the delay of the production of basic nitrogen compounds and in turn resulted in the increase of pH at a lower rate. It is worth mentioning that, in general, the acceptable pH levels for shellfish must be below 8.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1082013212443061">Schormuller, 1968</xref>). Herein, pH values of EBLCE pre-treated samples remained below 8.0 up to day 17, whereas those of the control group retained below 8.0 up to day 8, suggesting that EBLCE pre-treated samples were acceptable before the 18<sup>th</sup> storage day while samples without pretreatment became unacceptable since the 9<sup>th</sup> storage day. Off-odors/flavors in prawns could be formed even below pH 8, or at neutral pH. pH alone is not a suitable quality indicator. Thus, other means of judging freshness besides pH assessment of shrimp such as TVB-N and sensory evaluation should be supplemented and validated.

<sec id="sec21-1082013212443061"><title>TVB-N</title>
<p>Since the crustacean products are rich in free amino acids and soluble nitrogen, their spoilage is always accompanied with the formation of a large amount of TVB-N by the action of reductive enzymes in microorganisms, which predominately refer to ammonia and primary, secondary and tertiary amines. As a result, the content of TVB-N was found to be an important and sensitive index of shrimp freshness. It is also an effective way for evaluation whether the products are suitable for human consumption. Changes in TVB-N were presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1082013212443061">Figure 4</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1082013212443061">Figure 4</xref>, at the beginning of the storage, TVB-N concentration was determined as 7.02 mg/100 g, which was indicative of freshness of raw shrimp material and was consistent with the initial TVC and pH. However, the TVB-N level increased gradually with the storage time, regardless of the treatment of shrimp, indicating the activity of spoilage bacteria. As reported by several authors, this parameter tended to increase with the onset of microbial spoilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013212443061">Fernández-Segovia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1082013212443061">Kykkidou et al., 2009</xref>). This increase was substantially lower in the EBLCE pre-treated samples than in the control samples. The observation was in agreement with the results of TVC and pH. By day 6, the TVB-N value of the control quickly rose to 28.71 mg/100 g, while lower value of 14.33 mg/100 g was detected with corresponding EBLCE pre-treated samples. In addition, the high-microbial load of 6.67 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g on the 9<sup>th</sup> storage day were related to the high TVB-N level of 103.56 mg/100 g, where high counts of the active spoilage organisms in untreated shrimps broke down compounds like TMA oxide, amino acids, peptides and so on, contributing to the sudden increase in TVB-N content. Differently, in case of pre-treated shrimps, evidently lower TVB-N level of only 29.71 mg/100 g was achieved on the 15th storage day, suggesting the excellent preservative potency of EBLCE. On the basis of hygienic standard for shrimps (GB2741-94), the TVB-N value of above 30 mg/100 g of fresh prawn is usually considered as spoiled. Based on this standard, shrimps approached this acceptability limit after 6 and 15 days of storage for the control and EBLCE samples, respectively, implying 9 days extension of the acceptable limit. The data obtained were in accordance with the microbiological data. Hence, TVB-N could be used as an accurate marker for shrimp quality, as also proposed by several researches in a variety of seafood, such as European eel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013212443061">Özogul et al., 2005</xref>), sardine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013212443061">Özogul et al., 2004</xref>) and Chinese shrimp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013212443061">Lu, 2009</xref>).
<fig id="fig4-1082013212443061" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Changes in TVB-N of EBLCE-pretreated and non-treated peeled <italic>P. vannamei</italic> stored at 4 °C.

</fig></p>
<p>Similarly, TVB-N of untreated shrimps surpassed the critical limit (30 mg/100 g) of spoilage after 6 days of storage at 4 °C in the research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013212443061">Chang et al. (1983)</xref>. Furthermore, 16 days of shelf life of shrimps, in terms of TVB-N value, was observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013212443061">Büyükcan et al. (2009)</xref> who adopted high-hydrostatic pressure for the inactivation of food borne pathogens and spoilage bacteria. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013212443061">Lu (2009)</xref> reported that the storage period for Chinese shrimp treated with bacteriocides (consisted of 4-hexylresorcinol, nisin and sodium dehydroacetate) combined with modified atmosphere packaging turned out to be as long as 17 days under 2 °C according to the TVB-N content. Similarly, 15 days of shelf life here indicated that the self-made preservative of EBLCE possessed a strong antimicrobial activity.</p>

<sec id="sec22-1082013212443061"><title>Sensory analyses</title>
<p>Sensory analyses, which are traditional methods for judging the quality of food, were carried out in terms of odor, appearance, texture and overall acceptance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1082013212443061">Figure 5</xref>). The samples were considered as unacceptable for consumption when the sensory score reached below three. As a result, the acceptable score would be nine for overall acceptance. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1082013212443061">Figure 5</xref>, the initial high score of around five for odor, appearance and texture evaluation accounted for the excellent organoleptic properties of <italic>P. vannamei</italic> selected. Afterwards, sensory quality of the EBLCE pre-treated samples, as well as the control sample, decreased as storage time progressed, though sensory scores of samples pretreated with EBLCE exhibited a significantly slower decline. As for EBLCE pre-treated samples, the odor value ranged from 4.81 to 2.47, whereas scores varying from 4.69 to 2.74 and 4.73 to 2.40 were calculated for appearance and texture at the beginning of storage period and the 18th day, respectively. In contrast, the final extremely low scores of 0.97, 0.67 and 0.89 were detected for the odor, appearance and texture, respectively, of the control group on day 18. At that time, both of the samples were heavily contaminated by microorganisms, causing the generation and accumulation of a considerable number of ammonia compounds, with the subsequent negative effects on sensory quality, especially the odor. On the other hand, samples pretreated with EBLCE maintained excellent to good quality up to day 6, whereas those without pretreatment only retained such quality for 2 days. As far as the overall acceptance was concerned, EBLCE pre-treated samples stored for more than 15 days were no longer acceptable. In contrast, it was observed that the overall acceptance score of the control samples turned out to be below 8.94 (below 9) on day 6, indicating that these samples was suitable for consumption before day 6. The sharp differences of the two groups of the samples demonstrated that EBLCE could significantly retard microbial spoilage and thus allowed better keeping quality. Based on the present data, there might be a good correlation between sensory evaluations and both the microbiological and chemical parameters achieved in the above experiments. Hence, it turned out to be a useful means of judging freshness and predicting the shelf life of the shrimp.

<p>In the present study, a novel biopreservative was prepared from the extracts of ebony and bamboo leaves, which exhibited excellent antimicrobial activity against 10 common pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms with an inhibition zone diameter range of 8.7 ± 0.19 to 18.6 ± 0.86 mm. Furthermore, its preserving efficacy for peeled <italic>P. vannamei</italic> was investigated by traditional quality-evaluation techniques. It was observed that pretreatment of peeled <italic>P. vannamei</italic> with EBLCE allowed a remarkably good maintenance of microbiological, chemical and sensory quality. Consequently, shelf life of peeled <italic>P. vannamei</italic> could be extended from 6 days for the control group to 16 days when EBLCE was employed. The safety and high-antimicrobial capacity of EBLCE make it a potential and attracting alternative to other artificial preservatives in food industry. Thus, its broad application in other perishable food is currently in progress in our lab.</p>
