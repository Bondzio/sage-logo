<p>For those of us who choose to follow daily units in preparation of our hearts and minds for Easter, Beth Crisp offers a very different book for Lent meditation. Though specifically voiced by those who have survived sexual abuse, the meditations explore emotions and questions that will be shared by a much wider readership. It cannot fail to move and inspire anyone who knows their own vulnerability. These voices do not always speak in a deeply confessional way but always profoundly, with a quiet truth that is ignored at our peril. And, I suspect, theirs.</p>
<p>In describing the genesis of this book as the product of the five essential food groups of the human soul (‘arguably, love, grace, humour, friendship and forgiveness’) Beth Crisp is claiming the good ground of self that comes through the assault of sexual abuse. This is a collection of stories given voice by those for whom to speak the truth is costly. Because of this, it is at once more precious and challenging to an age which knows the cost of material things before their worth. We are more used to thinking that the most important voices are those which are seemingly big and clever, the loudest and the most dominant. I don’t believe it. They are certainly not the only voices we should be listening to. We do well to listen for the quieter voices. There are many women – and men and children – who are afraid to speak in case they will not be heard, or will not be believed. Some of these daring words are spoken into these meditations and it is important to hear the truth that they give and to let ourselves be changed in the hearing. For many of us, to be changed in this way might make us better able to truly listen to other people and begin to be realistically helpful to them.</p>
<p>As a series of meditations for each day through Lent, <italic>Beyond Crucifixion</italic> opens a daily window into people’s experience. For each day, a contemporary story, followed by a snapshot from scripture. A reflection then gathers the theme towards a question for the day, which is then put into the words of a prayer. For me, the last meditation for Easter Day came as a welcome conclusion to the season. It gives a profoundly significant observation (a voice that should be shouting from the rooftops) that abuse doesn’t have to have the final word. Rejection, humiliation and fear do not respect gender, age, class, race or anything else. We are all vulnerable. The meditations in this book lead us through despair to hope, moving us on into the next, new and precious day of life.</p>
<p>Following this outline, with their different outworking, each day holds up a mirror to our conscience, our expectation of others and of ourselves. To my mind this is a perfect challenge for Lenten preparation for those seeking to grow deeper in their relationship with God, their neighbour and themselves.</p>
