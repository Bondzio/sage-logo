<abstract>
<p>Britain has seen a significant increase in the size of its ethnic minority population over the past 20 years. Because of the relatively youthful age structure of the ethnic minority population, the percentage of ethnic minorities in the school age-groups is much higher than its share of the overall population. Given the very uneven geographical distribution of ethnic minorities, this has raised concerns over the extent of school ethnic segregation. This paper examines the changing distribution of ethnic minority secondary school pupils in England over the period 1999–2009. It shows that, while there have been big increases in the percentage of ethnic minorities in those local authorities with existing concentrations, with ethnic minorities comprising over 50 per cent of pupils in 24 urban authorities in 2009, the dominant trend has been one of an increase in the percentage of ethnic minority pupils across the board combined with the increasing diffusion of ethnic minorities across all local authorities, rather than increasing concentration in a small number of authorities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past 50 years, Britain has experienced a transformation in its ethnic composition from a minority population of 80 000 in 1951 to 4.6 million in 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098011422573">Peach, 2007</xref>). The rate of growth rose sharply in the most recent intercensal decade and the 2001 census enumerated an ethnic minority population of 7.9 per cent in the UK: a 53 per cent increase from 1991. The biggest concentration is in the large cities, particularly in Greater London where ethnic minorities comprised 29 per cent of the total population in 2001, reaching over 50 per cent in two boroughs and over 40 per cent in a further four boroughs, but in much of Britain, outside the big cities, ethnic minorities are thinly distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098011422573">Peach, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098011422573">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098011422573">Johnston <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The size of the ethnic minority population is likely to grow significantly over the next 20–30 years, partly as a result of immigration, but also because of higher fertility rates and the much younger age structure of ethnic minority groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098011422573">Scott <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). In 2008, the 0–15 age-group accounted for 19 per cent of the total population of the UK, but for 35 per cent of the Pakistani and Bangladeshi population and 33 per cent of the Black African group compared with 18 per cent of White British (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098011422573">Matheson, 2009</xref>). Ethnic minority groups accounted for 16.4 per cent of the 0–15 age-group in the UK in 2008—double their percentage in the population as a whole. The Greater London Authority’s population projections indicate that ethnic minorities will comprise 50 per cent of London’s population aged 0–19 in 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098011422573">GLA, 2010</xref>). This has some important implications, partly for the demand for school places in local authorities with high proportions of ethnic minority pupils in their schools, but more importantly for the issue of school ethnic segregation and debates over whether some minority ethnic groups are living ‘parallel lives’ largely separate from the majority of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098011422573">Burgess <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) by virtue of high levels of residential and educational segregation. Whether or not this is correct, major changes in the ethnic composition of schools could have implications for educational attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098011422573">Hamnett <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) as well as for wider issues of social cohesion and integration. This raises the question of the extent to which some of Britain’s cities will have a school system increasingly akin to that of many large American cities in terms of their ethnic composition. It is thus important, to inform both political and policy debates, to understand how the ethnic composition of the school system is changing.</p>
<p>The issue of school segregation has previously been predominantly confined to the US where there is a large body of research showing high levels of segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098011422573">Clotfelter, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098011422573">Ledwith and Clark, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011422573">Frankenberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011422573">Clark, 2002</xref>). The issue has hitherto been much less significant in Europe, but there is evidence that it is an increasing phenomenon in some large cities in countries as diverse as the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098011422573">Clark <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011422573">Karsten, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098011422573">Gramberg, 1998</xref>), Denmark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098011422573">Rangvid, 2007</xref>), France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098011422573">Barthon, 1987</xref>) and Spain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098011422573">Fernandez Enguita, 2005</xref>) as a result of high levels of immigration, the growth of ethnic minority populations and parental avoidance of some public schools with high minority enrolments. It has been suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098011422573">Phillips (2005)</xref> that Britain may be ‘sleepwalking to segregation’, although this has been challenged by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098011422573">Simpson and Peach, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098011422573">Finney and Simpson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098011422573">Peach, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098011422573">Poulsen and Johnston, 2006</xref>) who argue that the dominant trend in terms of ethnic minority distribution is towards increasing diffusion rather than greater segregation.</p>
<p>The issue of school segregation in England has been analysed in detail by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098011422573">Johnston <italic>et al</italic>. (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011422573">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098011422573">2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098011422573">Burgess <italic>et al</italic>., (2005)</xref>. The research shows that there is a substantial variation in the presence of ethnic minorities, with some LEAs, particularly in London, having very high proportions of minorities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098011422573">Johnston <italic>et al</italic>. (2006)</xref> note that, of the 374 000 non-White secondary school students in England in 2003, some 165 000 or 44 per cent lived in Greater London. Nonetheless, research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098011422573">Burgess <italic>et al</italic>. (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098011422573">Johnston <italic>et al</italic>. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098011422573">Johnston, Wilson and Burgess (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011422573">2005)</xref> suggests that school ethnic segregation is not a major issue, looking at England as a whole. A classification of all state-maintained secondary schools undertaken by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098011422573">Johnston <italic>et al</italic>. (2006)</xref> showed that 80 per cent were what they termed type I schools where Whites comprised over 80 per cent of students, 11 per cent were type II White majority schools where Whites comprised 50–80 per cent of students, 5 per cent were type III White minority schools where Whites comprised 30–49 per cent of the total, 2 per cent were type IV non-White-predominant schools, where members of non-White ethnic groups constitute over 70 per cent of students, but no single group dominates and 2 per cent were type V non-White schools, where non-White ethnic groups constitute over 70 per cent of students and where members of one group form the majority. Thus, schools where non-Whites comprise over 50 per cent of all pupils accounted for some 9 per cent of the total number of schools, but many of these schools were concentrated in London.</p>
<p>Recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098011422573">Johnston <italic>et al</italic>. (2008)</xref> has also examined change in ethnic segregation at primary and secondary school level over time in England looking at the period 1997–2003 and comparing entry cohorts. They found that the ethnic composition of entry cohorts changed from 1997 to 2003, especially in London and other cities. They concluded that there was no evidence of increased segregation over time independent of the changes in ethnic composition of the entry cohorts. They did, however, find that the top decile of primary schools saw ethnic change of near 25 per cent and the top 2 per cent of primary schools saw change in their ethnic composition of 37 per cent or more. The figures for the top decile of secondary schools were less marked. Significantly, there was a distinct geography to these changes, with 56 per cent of primary schools and 64 per cent of secondary schools in the top decile of change nationally being found in London with the majority of schools in this group witnessing a decrease in the percentage of their White British students.</p>
<p>The objective of this paper is simple: to examine the changes in the ethnic composition and geography of the secondary school population in England over a 10-year period from 1999 to 2009 using annual published data from The Department for Children, Families and Schools (DCFS) which show the number and percentage of pupils of various ethnic backgrounds in state-maintained secondary schools, by local authorities in England. This analysis is thus different from that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098011422573">Johnston <italic>et al</italic>. (2008)</xref> as it focuses on local authority data rather than individual schools and it looks at a longer time-period. The data are derived from the pupil-level annual school census (PLASC) which all schools have to complete each year and which includes a question on the ethnic origin of pupils. For the sake of simplicity, the paper compares the data for the two years 1999 and 2009. The paper attempts to answer three questions: first, what is the geographical distribution of ethnic minority secondary school pupils in England at local authority level and how has it changed over time; secondly, to what extent have ethnic minority pupils become more or less spatially concentrated in a small number of authorities; and, thirdly, what differences are there in in the changing distributions of Black, Asian and mixed ethnicity pupils looked at individually. These questions are significant because, in a period in which the number and proportion of ethnic minority pupils has increased substantially, it is important to know to what extent such pupils have become more or less concentrated geographically and whether concentration or diffusion is the dominant process of change.</p>
<p>It is important to define terms to avoid ambiguity and increasing concentration is defined as an increase in the cumulative percentage of EMPs in the local authorities with the highest existing shares of the total. Thus if the top 10 authorities with the highest percentages of ethnic minority pupils contained 30 per cent of the total ethnic minority pupil population at t1 and 40 per cent at t2, this would indicate increasing concentration, whereas a shift from 40 per cent at t1 to 30 per cent at t2 would indicate deconcentration and a diffusion of the ethnic minority populations down the hierarchy of local authorities. This can be measured in terms of a change in the cumulative percentage over time. This differs from an increase in the percentage of ethnic minorities across most or all local authorities which is termed intensification.</p>
<p>A range of hypothetical possibilities is shown diagrammatically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098011422573">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0042098011422573">4</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098011422573">Figure 1</xref> shows the situation where the percentage representation of a group has increased across all areas from t1 to t2. This is termed intensification and diffusion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0042098011422573">Figure 2</xref> shows the reverse: a reducing percentage share in all geographical areas from t1 to t2. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0042098011422573">Figure 3</xref> indicates an increasing concentration: the percentage share has risen at the top but fallen elsewhere and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0042098011422573">Figure 4</xref> shows the reverse: a pattern of deconcentration and diffusion. It is possible for intensification to be accompanied by concentration or deconcentration depending on whether the greatest increases take place at the top end of the distribution or lower down the distribution (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098011422573">Massey and Denton, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098011422573">Simpson, 2004</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098011422573">Johnston <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>, for a discussion of some related issues). As will be shown later, what appears to have occurred across local authorities in England over the period is a mixture of overall intensification combined with deconcentration and increasing diffusion.</p>

<title>A Note on Data and Definitions</title>
<p>It should be noted that, while published data for 1999 included data on individual ethnic categories, it included no mixed ethnicities and only had an unclassified category. The 2009 data include a number of different categories of mixed ethnicity including White and Black Caribbean, White and Black African, White and Asian and ‘Any other mixed background’. While the new categories are welcome, this makes comparison difficult, not least as the new mixed ethnicities categories totalled 106 540 in 2009: or 24 per cent of the number of minority ethnic pupils. Given that the size of the ‘unclassified’ group fell by 33 423 (43 per cent) from 1999 to 2009 and the ‘Any other ethnic group’ fell by 16 881 (31 per cent), it is likely that a large proportion of the mixed ethnicities category in 2009 constitute pupils who would have been unclassified or classified as ‘other’ in 1999. Consequently, in the analysis which follows, the preliminary analysis includes the mixed ethnicities categories as ‘non-White’ ethnic minority pupils. Subsequently, the analysis separates out Blacks and Asians, and also looks specifically at the distribution of mixed categories in 2009. The summary data for England and the absolute and percentage changes for the different ethnic groups are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098011422573">Table 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098011422573">Simpson (2004)</xref> discusses some definitional and conceptual issues regarding the use of ethnicity categories in official statistics and how they have changed over time, but the focus of this paper is on the changes identified over time using official statistical categories of ethnicity published by the DfES.</p>

<title>Analysis: The Changing Number and Distribution of Ethnic Minority Pupils Including Those of Mixed Ethnicity</title>
<p>The number of ethnic minority pupils (and those of mixed ethnicity) in state-maintained secondary schools in England has increased significantly over the period 1999–2009 by 57 per cent from 348 834 (11.5 per cent) to 548 010 (17 per cent). This is a substantial increase and it is comprised of three main components; first, a growth in the number of Asian pupils of 33 per cent; secondly, an increase in the number of Black pupils of 48 per cent; and, thirdly, the addition of the category of pupils of mixed ethnicity from zero to 106 540. Allocating the mixed ethnicity pupils to Asian and Black where mixed ethnicity was specified gives increases of 44 per cent and 98 per cent respectively. Looking at identified ethnic groups, the number of Indian pupils declined marginally, by 0.7 per cent, while the number of Pakistani pupils grew by 20 per cent and the number of Bangladeshi pupils grew by 33 per cent. The number of Black Caribbean pupils grew by 7 per cent and the number of Black African pupils by 160 per cent: including the relevant mixed groups, the increases in the latter groups are 95 per cent and 195 per cent respectively. These figures compare with a total increase of 4.7 per cent in the state-maintained secondary school population of England and a decline of 0.7 per cent in the number of White pupils. The biggest growth categories have been in the number of pupils of mixed White and Black Caribbean ethnicity and those of Black African heritage. The figures do not include pupils in private schools which may have seen similar increases in the percentage of EMP.</p>
<p>These headline figures conceal marked geographical variations by both region and local authority. While the percentage of ethnic minority pupils (EMPs), including the mixed ethnicity groups, has grown in every area, most regions still had relatively low percentages in 2009, ranging from lows of 4 per cent in the North East and 5 per cent in the South West to 10–11 per cent in the East, South East and North West, to 21 per cent in the West Midlands. The percentage of EMPs has, however, doubled or even trebled in several regions (North East, South West, Eastern, South East). Greater London stands out by virtue of the fact that over half (53 per cent) of pupils are now from ethnic minority backgrounds, including those of mixed ethnicity, rising to 67 per cent in Inner London (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0042098011422573">Figure 5</xref>). Inner London is thus unique in that over two-thirds of its secondary school pupils are from ethnic minorities although the 14 percentage point increase in Outer London (from 32 per cent to 46 per cent) was greater than the 9 point increase in Inner London (58 per cent to 67 per cent) which is indicative of outwards diffusion within London. London as a whole now has an ethnic-minority-dominated secondary school system, increasingly akin to that of many large US cities, although this is also true of a small number of other towns and cities with large ethnic minorities, notably Slough (64 per cent), Leicester (58 per cent), Birmingham (52 per cent) and Luton (51 per cent).</p>

<p>The regional figures conceal huge variations in the percentage of EMPs by local authority, ranging in 1999 from a low of 0.44 per cent in Barnsley to a high of 77 per cent in Brent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098011422573">Table 2</xref>). In 2009, the range was from 1.3 per cent in Knowsley to 83 per cent in Brent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0042098011422573">Figure 6</xref>). The changes in the overall distribution are clearly shown by the quartile cutting-points. In 1999, the upper quartile divide for the percentage of ethnic minority pupils in the 147 local authorities in England was 19.4 per cent, but in 2009 it was 32 per cent. In other words, a quarter of local authorities had 32 per cent or more EMPs. The median doubled from 5.5 per cent in 1999 to 11 per cent in 2009. The lower quartile cutting-point rose from 1.8 per cent to 4 per cent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0042098011422573">Table 3</xref>). It is thus clear that there has been a significant increase in the percentage of EMPs across the whole range of local authorities.</p>

<p>Looking first at the top end of the distribution, all the authorities with over 25 per cent EMPs in 1999 were either London boroughs or large urban areas and this pattern was replicated in 2009 although the percentage concentrations had intensified. Of the 32 local authorities with over 40 per cent of EMPs in 2009, no fewer than 26 were London boroughs and London boroughs occupied all the top 10 places and 18 of the top 20 places (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0042098011422573">Figure 7</xref>). Brent, Tower Hamlets and Newham each had just over 80 per cent and a further 12 boroughs had over 60 per cent. The other authorities with 40 per cent or over in 2009 were Slough (64 per cent), Leicester (59 per cent), Birmingham (52 per cent), Luton (51 per cent), Manchester (43 per cent) and Bradford (43 per cent), with Barking (39 per cent), Wolverhampton (38 per cent) and Blackburn (36 per cent) just below the cut-off.</p>

</fig>
<p>Conversely and unsurprisingly, the geographical distribution of ethnic minority secondary school pupils in 1999 and 2009 shows that most local authorities with low percentages of EMPs are concentrated outside the big cities in small towns or rural areas in regions such as the North East, the North West, East Anglia and the South West and in places such as Durham, York, the East Riding of Yorkshire, Cumbria, Lincolnshire, Devon, Cornwall and Somerset, Norfolk and Suffolk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0042098011422573">Figure 8</xref>). Comparing the percentage EMP figures for 1999 and 2009 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0042098011422573">Figure 6</xref>) shows that the growth of EMPs has not been confined to a small number of authorities with existing concentrations, but has been widely distributed across England as a whole, diffusing down across all local authorities over the period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0042098011422573">Figure 9</xref>).</p>

<p>Looking at the percentage point changes, the increases have been particularly marked in London, with 22 London boroughs in the top 34 authorities by percentage point change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0042098011422573">Figure 10</xref>). The authority with the largest percentage point increase (26) was Barking and Dagenham in east London, followed by Merton, Croydon and Redbridge, all outer London boroughs. Other local authorities with large percentage point increases include Manchester (18), Reading (15), Milton Keynes (13), Leicester (12), Luton (12), Slough (11), Nottingham (11) and Birmingham (10). What the percentage point change figures show overall is that, while the increases have been greatest in a relatively small number of urban areas with significant existing concentrations, there has been a substantial and across the board diffusion into smaller towns and rural areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0042098011422573">Figure 11</xref>). Bradford, sometimes seen as an exemplar of ethnic minority segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098011422573">Carling, 2007</xref>), is unusual in that, while it experienced a 10 point increase in the percentage of ethnic minority secondary pupils (33 per cent to 43 per cent), the absolute number of such pupils decreased by 340. The explanation appears to lie in a sharp decrease in the total number of pupils from 45 600 to 34 000 and an even sharper decrease in number of White pupils, from 30 700 to 19 500 which would seem, unless rebounding has occurred, to be indicative of either significant White out-migration or a sharp fall in the size of the White population or both.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, the picture presented by the distribution of percentage changes is very different, largely because increases in local authorities with a relatively small initial base result in large percentage changes. In many respects, the picture is almost the complete reverse of the distribution of absolute and percentage point increases. The LA with the greatest percentage growth was Thurrock (462 per cent), an authority in Essex immediately adjacent to London, followed by a mixture of several of the more rural shire counties such as Dorset (290 per cent), Somerset (277 per cent), Devon (275 per cent), Hampshire (256 per cent) and Essex (240 per cent) and smaller towns such as Solihull (310 per cent), Bournemouth (287 per cent) and Barnsley (268 per cent). The top 32 percentage increases are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0042098011422573">Figure 12</xref>. Conversely, the LAs with the smallest percentage increases such as Birmingham (28 per cent), Newham (28 per cent), Brent (27 per cent) and Bradford (-2 per cent) were generally those with large existing concentrations, but they nonetheless reflect significant absolute and percentage point gains.</p>

<p>Clearly, there has been a significant dispersal of EMPs across England as a whole, with many smaller towns and rural areas witnessing significant percentage growth. One way of measuring this is to look at the cumulative percentage distribution of EMPs across all English local authorities. In 1999, 26 local authorities with the largest number of EMPs accounted for 50 per cent of all EMPs in England. By 2009, the top 26 authorities accounted for just 43 per cent of EMPs. In 1999, the top 37 authorities accounted for 70 per cent of all EMPs, but just 63 per cent in 2009. The changing cumulative distribution is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0042098011422573">Figure 13</xref> which shows that the overall distribution is less spatially concentrated in 2009 than it was in 1999. The overall picture is thus one of an intensification of EMPs in urban areas with large existing concentrations, combined with increasing diffusion (deconcentration) of EMPs out of the major cities into adjacent areas and across England as a whole.</p>

<title>The Changing Distributions of Different Ethnic Groups</title>
<p>The analysis thus far is somewhat crude in that it is based on a binary division of ethnic groups into Whites and non-White minorities including, for 2009, the mixed categories. Yet how has the distribution of different ethnic minority groups changed over time? To what extent, for example, are Asian pupils more concentrated than Black pupils and to what extent has one group diffused more rapidly than the other? It is also illuminating to see what the geographical distribution of mixed groups is in 2009. This section of the paper addresses these questions looking at Black, Asian and mixed groups individually and comparing with Whites where appropriate. Looking first at the distribution of absolute changes, the largest increases in the number of Black and Asian pupils were, not surprisingly, found in big cities such as Birmingham, Manchester and Leicester and the London boroughs with the largest numbers of Black and Asian pupils in 1999. However, large absolute increases were not confined solely to those urban areas with existing large concentrations of EMPs. There were significant increases in the number of Asian pupils in the adjacent counties of Surrey, Leicestershire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, Kent, Hampshire and Essex, which is indicative of diffusion and decentralisation out of major urban areas.</p>
<p>The distributions of the top percentage point changes for Asian and Black pupils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0042098011422573">Figures 14</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0042098011422573">15</xref>) show a significant process of outwards diffusion from inner to outer London and outwards from major metropolitan areas. The biggest percentage point increases for Black pupils were in the suburban London boroughs of Barking, Greenwich, Bexley, Croydon and Lewisham, and the biggest percentage point increases for Asian pupils were in Harrow, Redbridge, Leicester, Kingston and Merton. Not surprisingly, the distribution of percentage changes for both Black and Asian pupils is more widely spread with many smaller, and more rural, authorities showing significant growth. The number of Asian pupils has seen significant percentage growth across most of England, while numbers of Black pupils have grown across much of the South East and central England.</p>

<p>There were significant differences in the changing distributions of Black and Asian pupils. The 30 local authorities with the largest absolute increases of Black pupils accounted for 80 per cent of the total increase in Black pupils, whereas the 30 authorities with the largest increases of Asian pupils accounted for just 63 per cent of the total increase. This indicates that the geographical diffusion of Asian pupils has been more widespread than that of Black pupils. This outwards diffusion is clearly seen if we compare cumulative percentage totals. In 1999, the top 20 local authorities accounted for 60 per cent of Black pupils in England. By 2009, the share of the top 20 had fallen to 57.5 per cent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0042098011422573">Table 4</xref>). The decline in the concentration of Asian pupils in the top 20 authorities was more marked—from 58.8 per cent in 1999 to 52.4 per cent in 2009. This shows that the two groups had roughly the same degree of concentration in 1999, but that Asian pupils have diffused more rapidly than Black pupils. By contrast, the cumulative percentage of White pupils in the top 20 authorities increased very marginally from 37.3 per cent to 38.8 per cent.</p>

<p>Fascinatingly, the top 20 authorities only contained 34.3 per cent of pupils of mixed ethnicity in 2009, clearly indicating that this group is much more widely geographically distributed. The distribution of pupils of mixed ethnicity is strongly dominated by London boroughs which take the first 13 places, 18 of the top 20 places and 23 of the top 30 places. Kensington and Chelsea heads the list with 12.6 per cent. The highest non-London local authorities were Nottingham (8.2 per cent) and Wolverhampton (7.9 per cent), then Manchester, Luton, Reading, Slough and Bristol all with between 6.2 per cent and 6.9 per cent. This suggests, not surprisingly, that the growth of mixed ethnicities is most marked in areas with high levels of minority ethnic pupils, but it is a predominantly metropolitan phenomenon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0042098011422573">Figure 16</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>These changes are clearly shown if we compare the cumulative percentage distributions for different ethnic groups from 1999 to 2009. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0042098011422573">Figure 17</xref> shows the cumulative percentage distributions for Black pupils in 1999 and 2009; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0042098011422573">Figure 18</xref> shows the cumulative percentage distributions of Asian pupils in 1999 and 2009; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0042098011422573">Figure 19</xref> shows cumulative percentages of pupils of Black, Asian, White and mixed ethnicity in 2009. Three points can be made. First, the concentration of both Asian and Black pupils declined from 1999 to 2009, although the concentration of Asian pupils declined by much more. Secondly, the concentration of Black pupils remains much higher than that of Asian pupils; and, thirdly, the concentration of pupils of mixed ethnicity is much lower than either Black or Asian pupils in 2009 and is more akin to that of White pupils. We can only speculate on the causes of this gradual diffusion of ethnic minority pupils outwards from the major concentrations, but on the basis of evidence from east London (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011422573">Butler and Hamnett, 2011</xref>) it is likely to involve parental aspirations for better housing and social environments outside the inner cities. The disparity between the outward diffusion of Asian and Black pupils may be explained in part by the very marked differences in housing tenure between the two groups and the greater ability of some Asians to access suburban homeownership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098011422573">Hamnett and Butler, 2010</xref>). This does not apply to Bangladeshi households, however, who are disproportionately concentrated in council and other social housing along with Black African and Caribbean households and who may, therefore, be more restricted in their ability to move out of urban areas (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098011422573">Phillips, 1998</xref>, for a discussion).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Returning to the question raised in the title and the initial sections of whether there has been concentration or diffusion in the distribution of EMPs, it is clear that there has been an increase in the percentage of EMPs in all local authorities and that, in absolute percentage terms, existing areas of concentrations have seen an increasing percentage of EMPs; in some cases very considerable, while other areas with moderate concentrations have seen substantial increases. Yet, notwithstanding this, the dominant characteristic has been one of diffusion and dispersal. Although 15 local authorities, mostly in London, now have over 60 per cent EMPs, and 24 have 50 per cent or more, at the national level the picture is not one of increasing ethnic concentration in a small number of cities, but of deconcentration from the major cities into surrounding smaller towns and rural areas and more widely to those regions of the country which, hitherto, had very small numbers of ethnic minority pupils.</p>
<p>While it is very clear that London and a few other cities such as Birmingham, Manchester and Leicester have seen their secondary school systems become increasingly dominated by ethnic minority pupils, the overall picture is one of increasing spatial diffusion rather than increasing concentration. This conclusion may seem rather paradoxical, but the explanation lies in the large numerical growth and the increasing percentage of ethnic minority pupil numbers in cities such as London and Birmingham and the much larger percentage growth outside the major concentrations. We are thus seeing the growth of ethnic-minority-dominated school systems in some cities and simultaneous increasing diffusion outside the core cities. Although some urban local authorities have witnessed significant increases in the number and percentage of EMPs, the growth in numbers has not been confined to these areas but has been more widely geographically distributed. These changes have major implications for the future. Given that the percentage of ethnic minority primary pupils in England (22 per cent) in 2009 is higher than the percentage of secondary pupils (17 per cent), this suggests that the process of ethnic change in England’s secondary school system has further to go over the next decade. Ethnic minority pupils are increasingly dominant in a handful of English towns and cities such as London, Birmingham, Manchester, Leicester, Luton and Slough and this may point towards an increasingly American-style big city education system characterised by high percentages of ethnic minorities. Yet ethnic minority pupils are no longer confined to these cities and are diffusing across the country. This may make England relatively unusual in Europe, although a lack of ethnic data in many European countries poses measurement problems. The results of the 2011 census should shed further light on the issues raised in this paper.</p>
