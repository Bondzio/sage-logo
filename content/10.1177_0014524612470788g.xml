<p>With this book, Stanley Hauerwas invites readers to confront the reality of war and to imagine a world without war. For those who dismiss the latter invitation as idealistic, he argues convincingly that just war theory is as unrealistic as critics claim pacifism to be. Although it is difficult to develop a sustained argument in a book of essays, the organization of the book into three parts (‘America and War,’ ‘The Liturgy of War,’ and ‘The Ecclesial Difference’) results in a surprisingly coherent argument grounded in the eschatological understanding that Christians are to live in the world as those who know that war has been overcome by the cross and resurrection of Christ. Hence, the commonly held idea that the sacrifices required by war are consistent with the sacrifice of the Cross must be resisted. The church is called to offer an alternative to the perpetual state of war that defines America, and if we cannot abolish war on this side of the eschaton, we can make war less likely.</p>
<p>With enormous appreciation for Hauerwas’s argument, two critical observations are offered here. First, just as Hauerwas invites readers to imagine a world without war, sometimes he needs to use his own imagination regarding how his words can be misconstrued to do serious, if unintended, harm. For instance, since ‘unearned suffering is redemptive’ and forgiveness, not revenge, marks the Christian life, does this mean the victim of a violent crime such as rape should immediately forgive the perpetrator and refuse to turn to the secular courts for justice? Whatever Hauerwas would say, one can be sure that some of his readers will believe this is what he means, and eventually contribute to the suffering, rather than the healing, of such victims. The book can remain ‘suggestive,’ as Hauerwas says, but this does not release him from the obligation to be precise.</p>
<p>Second, Hauerwas rightly says that the accusation that he is sectarian often wrongly arises from his anti-Constantinian stance. Liberal and conservative Christians alike would do well to heed his warnings regarding the cooptation of the church by political and philosophical principles and ideologies. Protecting the integrity of the Christian faith and church does not make him sectarian. At times, however, Hauerwas unwittingly <italic>sounds</italic> sectarian, because his argument often emphasizes the first table of the Decalogue (our relationship with God) without moving clearly enough to the second table (our responsibility to neighbor). This is not his intention, but he needs to extend his theological insights more obviously into the particular ways that claiming Christ as Lord informs Christian responsibility in the political and social arenas of life in relationship to near and distant neighbors.</p>
<p>This book gives readers significant (not idealistic) tools for imagining a world without war and for challenging the prevailing ethos of perpetual war that marks American identity and practices. I highly recommend that readers once again enter into conversation with Stanley Hauerwas regarding what it means to be the peaceable people of God in a world at war.</p>
