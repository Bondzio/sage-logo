<p>The artist is not a special kind of person, every person is a special kind of artist.</p>
<attrib>—A. Coomaraswamy</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The artist quote is part of my email signature. It grounds me in recognizing that each person has gifts to share with others, as long as we are open to receiving them. This article shares a reframing of lifelong learning beyond a formal career.</p>
<p>Like many of my peers, after 40 years in postsecondary education, I have moved beyond my most recent full-time work teaching in an adult education graduate program to emeritus faculty status. I was invited to write this Future’s column to share my experience moving into the next phase of my career and examine my own future. The traditional term for this phase is <italic>retirement</italic>. I transitioned in July 2010, so I have almost 2 years of experience in this post full-time work phase. However, I spent several years preparing for my version of the next phase of my lifework with the key question, “What do I want to do next?”</p>
<p>Before we get too far into this story, let me be open about my personal background. I am in the vanguard of Baby Boomers, born in 1946, and raised in a White, middle-class family from Connecticut. Indiana has been home for 42 years. My life has been privileged and influenced by the academic world. I have been accused of going away to college and liking it so much that I’ve spent my whole career on college campuses!</p>

<title>Perspectives on Aging and Retirement</title>
<p>There is no consensus on the question of how to define the age when one becomes an older adult. The protected status for age discrimination starts at 40 years of age. The age to start drawing Social Security benefits is 62 (earlier if disabilities are involved), but to draw full benefits, the age for Boomers is 66 years. Others say 70 is the age when people are viewed as old. There are also cultural factors and indicators related to health, vitality, family responsibilities, and continued engagement in work (whether full-time or part-time) that influence whether an individual is viewed as <italic>old</italic>.</p>
<p>Adults in the United States above age 65, women and men, as a proportion of the population is increasing rapidly—from 27% in 2000 and predicted to be more than 35% in 2020. In a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045159512452867">2011</xref> American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) Survey of Boomer Expectations, 43% of those who were still working could not wait to retire; however, 41% indicated they did not want to stop working. This survey also showed that in retirement, 71% planned to focus more on time with family, and 66% planned to spend time on hobbies and interests. Expectations of retirement as leisure (57%), personal indulgence (45%), or time for travel (48%) have fallen more than 10 points since 1998. This may be connected with the instability of the economy and traditional economic planning tools.</p>
<p>Although a traditional definition of retirement is withdrawal or rest from work, this is not related to what I planned to pursue. Some Boomers may be reevaluating what to do in the next phase of life, yet it does not sound like as many are moving toward a purposeful <italic>new retirement</italic> focusing on helping to meet the needs of people and communities through committed engagement. With these negative stereotypes, I use the term <italic>retirement</italic> only when I have to describe an <italic>official status</italic>.</p>

<title>So Are You Retired or What?</title>
<p>Family and friends ask, “So are you retired or what?” when I mention I have a couple of conference calls to conduct or am facilitating an online class. I respond with an emphatic, “Or what!” I explain that while my status from the university is emeritus, so I am not working full-time, that does not mean I’ve stopped being an adult educator.</p>
<p>Terms like <italic>reinvention, third age, encore, renewal, evolution</italic>, and <italic>r-evolution</italic> are attempts to replace the <italic>old retirement</italic> status stereotypes. Yet, the phrase I decided to use several years ago to describe the next phase of my lifework is <italic>reframing my career</italic>. This resonates for me as a student of psychology and adult education, reframing my mental perspective, and as a professional theater director, set designer, and theater carpenter.</p>
<p>Moving from one phase of career and lifework to another inevitably stimulates reflection on where you have been and what you have accomplished on your journey. I use the analogy of five acts of a play to conceptualize the periods of career exploration, stability, and transitions along my path this far.</p>
<p>Many factors contribute to building a career and lifework. Throughout my life, I’ve been fortunate to have flexibility, a sense of adventure, openness to new opportunities, and passion for lifelong learning. I am also very thankful for a culture of family support, so when I announced I wanted to major in theater in college, no one asked me, “What are you going to do with that?”</p>
<p>A career can be an evolution of self, or an exploration of possible selves. I do not mean to suggest multiple personalities! Yet, a very important component of reframing or evolving is the transition when moving from one career self to the next. It is key to make transitions between phases and look ahead for the next opportunity. The analogy of one door closing, which leads to other doors opening, serves an important visual image for me.</p>

<title>Five Acts, So Far</title>
<p>Let me share some examples from the acts of my life.</p>
<p>Act 1 provided the growth and development process from birth through adolescence to first adult roles. For me, the primary influences included living in the same house with my grandmother and working in the family-owned general store in a small Connecticut town. The family culture had a strong influence on my academic expectations. Both my grandmothers and one grandfather were college graduates in the 1st decade of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Working in live theater became a lifelong passion, beginning as an undergraduate at Hanover College. During my senior year, my faculty advisor suggested I might be a pretty good “college theater guy.” Within 2 weeks after graduating from Hanover, I enrolled in the theater program at the University of Massachusetts–Amherst with a graduate assistantship, earning an MFA in scene design and theater technology in 1970.</p>
<p>Act 2 of my journey took place at Earlham College as a drama faculty member for 11 years. I focused on experiential learning through theater courses and productions. I also developed a strong involvement in summer programs for students using wilderness/challenge learning expeditions and other student development program exploration.</p>
<p>Act 3 brought me to the Indiana University East campus as I followed a career transition plan to focus on student development programs and services. I also earned an MA in counseling psychology to support this transition. This degree was applicable in many ways to student development, as well as a broad range of helping professions. I served in student services for 10 years with responsibilities for student activities, affirmative action, admissions, and, finally, chief student services officer. During this time, the chancellor of the campus suggested exploring another career direction. He suggested I was really a <italic>continuing education guy</italic> and should check out the Ball State doctoral program in adult and community education. By the end of my first course in this graduate program, it was clear I’d found my intellectual and philosophical home.</p>
<p>Act 4 provided several opportunities in adult and continuing education within Indiana University during the final 12 years of my full-time faculty career. After a few years as director of continuing studies at the East campus, I completed the doctoral degree and was invited to serve one-half time as associate dean for the university-wide School of Continuing Studies. The associate dean role led to part-time teaching opportunities in the MS in adult education program and moving to the Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) campus. During the next few years, we transformed the degree to an online program, and I moved to a full-time faculty role and department chair.</p>
<p>From the perspective thus far in Act 5, I’ve decided to use the phrase <italic>Adult Educator-at-Large</italic> to describe my current status and exploration of next possible self. My goal is to continue reframing my lifework in mindful and meaningful ways to continue serving people and the field. The primary focus has been serving as American Association for Adult and Continuing Education (AAACE) president-elect in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045159512452867">2011</xref> and president in 2012. Another strategy has been to create a formal business identity for the knowledge and skills developed during my varied career. The most recent formal lifelong learning activity has been completion of a retirement coaching certificate to facilitate adults making purposeful transitions to become their next <italic>special kind of artist</italic>.</p>
<p>Looking back on this checkered past, I count faculty appointments in two different disciplines and about 14 different administrative titles and responsibilities. Each represents a different approach to the art of learning. Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “All life is an experiment. The more experiments you make the better. I encourage everyone to experiment at all stages of your lifework!” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045159512452867">Emerson, n.d</xref>.)</p>
