<p>Employment protection legislation (EPL) can be understood as the rules and regulations regarding hiring and firing. Its emergence as well as its effects have been widely studied from a number of disciplinary perspectives. Per Skedinger contributes to these discussions by offering a very comprehensive theoretical and empirical account of EPL across advanced countries and over time. The book is organized in six chapters which are easy to follow and are structured well. After the introductory remarks in Chapter 1, Skedinger delves into the design and evolution of EPL systems in Chapter 2. One of the novelties of this chapter is its emphasis on the enforcement issues and how EPL is implemented in courts in different countries. Nevertheless, the chapter does not go beyond legal enforcement yet there can be significant differences in terms of voluntary agreements and informal deals struck between employees and employers across countries. These would not appear in the number of cases brought to courts and it would be interesting to know how they are resolved and in some cases act as a substitute for formal arrangements.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 provides a synopsis of theoretical expectations on the effects of EPL, which can be summarized as reduced rates of turnover due to both lower firing and hiring, higher segmentation and ambiguous results on productivity. One of the goals of EPL is to provide more secure jobs, hence expectations about a reduced number of firings are obvious. The decreased amount of hiring is more complex and occurs if the firms cut down their recruitment anticipating the difficulties of dismissing these employees in the future. Segmentation can happen via growing wage gaps between protected and unprotected workers and also if the strictness of EPL varies for temporary and permanent workers. Finally, the impact on productivity is unclear as lower turnover and higher security might encourage firm specific skills but might also limit technological dynamism and individual motivation. Skedinger states that given the various theoretical channels EPL can produce, its effect on aggregate employment and unemployment as well as on aggregate wages and productivity can go in both positive and negative directions (p. 64) and thus empirical scrutiny is required.</p>
<p>Before examining the rich empirical literature covering EPL, Chapter 4 discusses the reasons for having legislation for employment protection. While the efficiency argument suggests that EPL can be seen as a remedy for market failures, interest group-based arguments claim that such rules and regulations come into existence due to the power of workers. However, neither of these explanations is sufficient to account for the large cross-country variation, as the author correctly points out. Legal traditions, expectations, historical legacy and mobility are among the reasons why such dispersions exist. One of the shortcomings of the book is the very little space devoted to these factors while some other important ones are overlooked, such as the complementarity of EPL with other labour market tools and institutions. EPL is not the only instrument with its efficiency enhancing or diminishing effects and hence the demand for legislation in comparison to other forms of protection might largely depend on how legislation functions as a part of a system.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 reviews more than 100 empirical studies that test various theoretical expectations about EPL. Skedinger organizes these studies into three categories: aggregate cross-country, disaggregate cross-country and within country, comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each empirical approach. In the first set of studies the results are mixed, as EPL has inconclusive effects on employment and unemployment, with the exception of vulnerable employees who are more negatively influenced by stricter EPL. The second and third sets of research provide clearer findings about the distribution of gains and losses from EPL, particularly that structural change and productivity are decreased when the legislation is more rigid. Finally, this chapter also shows very interesting evidence on whether EPL contributes to workers feeling secure in a job. Skendinger shows that few existing studies detect that the strictness of EPL is indeed weakly or inversely related to perceived job security, raising a number of questions about the viability of these systems and their welfare costs. However, the author does not go into much detailed examination of the issue, which is unfortunate since these issues are relatively understudied and could have added major value.</p>
<p>Since the academic and public debate on EPL appears to be far from over, <italic>Employment Protection Legislation: Evolution, Effects, Winners and Losers</italic> is an excellent survey and can be beneficial to anyone interested in the field, as the author manages to present the material in an accessible and unbiased manner. Despite some of the critical remarks above, both academics and policy makers can learn a lot from the vast range of studies reviewed in this book, particularly from the empirical evidence and suggested routes for new research.</p>
