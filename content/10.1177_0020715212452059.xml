<p>I make a disclaimer as reviewer: I am deeply embedded among many of the scholars Duchesne critiques. I urge reader to hold that in mind and to consult other reviews. That said, <italic>The Uniqueness of Western Civilization</italic> is a succinct summary of Duchesne’s thesis. In the Preface he list five goals: 1) to trace the sources of the ‘multicultural effort to ‘‘provincialize’’ the history of Western civilization’; 2) to assess the empirical adequacy or such revisionist works; 3) to argue that ‘the traditional Eurocentric’ histories remain useful; 4) that liberal-democratic culture was crucial to ‘the rise of the West’; and 5) to trace West’s spirit to ‘the warlike culture of Indo-European speakers’ (pp. ix–x).</p>
<p>Duchesne addresses the first and second goals with detailed critiques of the writing of most of the recent world historians and sociologists, political scientists, and so on who address world historical issues. It is abundantly clear that he is ‘much exercised’ about these revisions. While every location and every history is in some sense unique, there are also many similarities. Sometimes details do not matter as much some generalities, depending on a writer’s purpose. However, his pique with ‘multicultural historians and academic socialists’ (e.g. p. 407) sometimes gets in the way of his argument. He misses the point that most scholars grew up with the view that ‘the West’ was unique and superior. Their critiques are attempts to correct that imbalance. While his argument that some of the revisions were overstated has some merit, his critiques are also overstated.</p>
<p>Next he compares Eurocentrism and Sinocentrism and finds the latter wanting. However, he does not seem to recognize that to make a claim of uniqueness for a civilization, it must be compared with all other civilizations, not solely China. He does raise a number of interesting points that could be addressed by further research. He includes ancient Greece as part of the West, though he notes later that much of what we know about ancient Greece comes to us through Islamic scholars.</p>
<p>The account then turns to the origins of industrial divergence of the West. This may well be the most interesting chapter of the book. He examines the various discussions of the divergence of the West but often repeats the same errors he accuses the revisionists of: cherry-picking the evidence. Several world-systems analysts show that major system changes often come from semiperipheral regions, which is what Europe was in the first half of the second millennium CE (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020715212452059">Chase-Dunn and Hall, 1997</xref>). This calls to mind an old advertising slogan, ‘when you are number two you must try harder’. Neither does he discuss the argument that because industrialization spread so rapidly there was little or no possibility for a second independent invention of it.</p>
<p>Except for some minor forays outside of Western civilization, the remaining five chapters focus on Western Europe and draw very heavily on Eurocentric histories. The next argument is that Europe has been especially creative throughout its history. While acknowledging that many inventions and ideas came from the East, he argues that it was Europe that put them together. While true, this is neither especially unique nor creative. Many inventions throughout history were combinations of other inventions. This is why the rate of new inventions accelerates through time, and is one of the major ways that semiperipheral regions initiate change.</p>
<p>The next two chapters focus on the role of reason and freedom, and the restlessness of the Western spirit in Europe’s development. The argument about reason and freedom hangs on the definitions of both. The argument tap-dances around a tautological concept of reason as uniquely Western and attributes too much to overly zealous cultural relativism. For sure, the latter is a common fault in revisionist histories. But Duchense and some revisionists miss the common anthropological argument that methodological relativism does not, and need not, imply moral relativism. The arguments about Western spirit draw, in my view, excessively on Hegelian philosophy. For readers interested in Hegelian views this will be a fascinating argument.</p>
<p>The penultimate chapter focuses on aristocratic egalitarianism among Indo-Europeans and its roles in the development of Western civilization. Here he recaps many of the arguments about the origins of inequality and a putative equality within strata. This is an interesting approach to origins and evolutions of stratification systems. However, it glosses over many of the complex discussions based on solid data that have different explanations. Since he tossed out materialist approaches to change in the early chapters he does not examine carefully discussions about inequality as a response to material conditions and overemphasizes arguments that see differences in material wealth as originating in ideological differences. Those ideologies are more often post hoc rationalizations.</p>
<p>The final chapter discusses the emergence of the self, drawing heavily on Hegel and complex textual analysis of ancient Greek sources including the <italic>Illiad</italic> and the <italic>Odyssey</italic>. He argues that these constitute ‘The Beginnings of Genuine Personalities in History’ (p. 435 ff). To anyone familiar with anthropological research this is an absurd claim. No society lacks for personalities and selfhood, though to be sure some do have strong socialization practices that submerge individual personalities to some level of collective identity. But that is quite different than a claim for a European invention of the self. Interestingly, he brings in the roles of the Germanic warrior traditions as sources of Western concepts of aristocracy. He then argues that the putative equality within the aristocracy leads to liberty among aristocrats, which then generalizes to the population as a whole and gives rise to representative institutions.</p>
<p>He concludes with the following comment:<disp-quote>
<p>Max Weber is the best known classical exponent of the thesis that the development of the West was due to its ‘specific and peculiar’ rationalism. As commendable as this interpretation is, I hope to have persuaded some that the roots of the West are to be found in a profoundly different aristocratic character that first came into the light of history in the Pontic Steppes. (p. 488)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I am not persuaded. Interestingly, an unfortunate timing of publications meant that Christopher I. Beckwith’s <italic>Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020715212452059">2009</xref>) was unavailable to him. There Duchesne would have found much support for his claims about the role of the peoples from Pontic Steppes in the development of Europe, albeit, not in the way he claims. Beckwith argues that the tradition of the ‘comitatus’, a single warrior leader with a coterie of warriors who put loyalty to the leader over loyalty to kin, clan, or tribe, was a major root of the kinds of aristocracies that developed in Northern Europe. The argument, however, is not couched in ideology. Rather, under highly competitive conditions for nomadic pastoralists living in broad steppe areas, this is a singularly effective form of social organization. As this became institutionalized it also became somewhat self-reinforcing.</p>
<p>While Beckwith’s argument and evidence are somewhat persuasive, it is rooted in material living conditions, not ideology (I note here Beckwith is not a Marxist and this is my interpretation of Beckwith). So while supporting the Pontic Steppes origin argument it undermines much of Duchesne’s argument for ideology and spirit. Still, it would have been interesting to see what he would have had to say about it.</p>
<p>There are a few other problems with this book. Duchesne seems to conflate an author presenting a lot of numbers with having statistics in support of his or her argument. A statistical argument needs evidence on distribution, measures of central tendency, and where appropriate correlations. To be fair to Duchesne, these may have been presented in many of the sources he cites, but were not presented in this text.</p>
<p>There are some other more-or-less stylistic practices I found annoying. There is far too much ‘road mapping’, that is, text or notes saying ‘as I will argue or show in some later chapter’. Duchesne seems to be impressed by very long books and/or very large bibliographies. While I too, like the latter, how is this germane to an argument? Too often Duchesne pronounces some argument by some author to be correct, or others to be wrong. Note this is different from claiming that such and such evidence supports or undermines some argument. While this may be only stylistic, it gives a sense of pontificating from on high. I also find annoying a tendency to use sentences like the following: ‘In his wonderful (or some other adjective) book, <italic>title</italic>, Smith says. . .’ Why not ‘Smith says. . .’</p>
<p>All my criticisms notwithstanding, there are many flashes of insight in <italic>The Uniqueness of Western Civilization</italic>. The book raises many provocative questions, some of which might be answered through further research. Despite my stylistic critiques, the book shows a very wide range of scholarship and many deft syntheses. It is an impressive book.</p>
