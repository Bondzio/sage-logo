<p>Objective: To determine the value of cervicovaginal interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 in predicting intra-amniotic infection and/or inflammation (IAI) in women with preterm labor. Methods: Cervicovaginal fluid samples were collected for IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 measurements immediately before amniocentesis in 85 consecutive women with preterm labor. The IAI was defined as a positive amniotic fluid (AF) culture and/or an elevated AF IL-6 level (&gt;2.6 ng/mL). Results: Receiver–operating characteristic curves demonstrated that cervicovaginal IL-6 and IL-8, but not IL-1β, predicted IAI. Cervicovaginal IL-6 had a significantly higher area under the curve (AUC) than cervicovaginal IL-8 (<italic>P</italic> = .009). However, the AUCs for the cervicovaginal IL-6 and AF white blood cell (WBC) were not significantly different. Conclusions: Among measured cytokines, cervicovaginal IL-6 is the best marker to noninvasively identify IAI in women with preterm labor. Overall, this noninvasive parameter performed as well as AF WBC count for predicting IAI.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A growing body of evidence indicates that the maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with pregnancies complicated by intra-amniotic inflammation, but a negative amniotic fluid (AF) culture is similar to that of pregnancies with a positive AF culture in the context of preterm labor and intact membranes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112451794">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112451794">2</xref>
</sup> Thus, it is important in the management of patients with preterm labor to accurately identify patients at risk of microbiologically proven intra-amniotic infection and also those at risk of intra-amniotic inflammation. The only method demonstrated to reliably detect intra-amniotic infection/inflammation is to sample the AF by amniocentesis. However, amniocentesis is invasive technique with risks. Therefore, noninvasive and accurate means of identifying intra-amniotic infection/inflammation are needed for women with preterm labor.</p>
<p>The use of cervicovaginal fluid has been suggested as a noninvasive alternative sample to AF testing because elevated levels of cytokines and other proteins in this fluid are thought to reflect inflammatory or mechanical damage to the membranes or placenta before birth.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112451794">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112451794"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112451794">5</xref>
</sup> Several studies have investigated the potential role of biomarkers, especially interleukin 6 (IL-6), in cervicovaginal samples in detecting intrauterine infection and have documented the association between IL-6 in cervicovaginal fluid and infection that involves the amniotic cavity and the chorioamniotic membranes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112451794">5</xref>

</sup> At present, however, there is limited data on the relationship between this parameter in cervicovaginal fluid and intra-amniotic inflammation in women with preterm labor. Moreover, the results are conflicting. One study has shown a significant association,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112451794">9</xref>
</sup> while another study has failed to do so.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112451794">7</xref>
</sup> This disagreement may be due to the relatively small sample size,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112451794">9</xref>
</sup> study design (ie, prospective or retrospective), and a different lower limit of detection for the IL-6 assay in previous studies. The purpose of the present study was to determine the value of cervicovaginal IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 in predicting intra-amniotic infection/inflammation in women with preterm labor and intact membranes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1933719112451794" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>This was a prospective cohort study. The study population consisted of consecutive women admitted to Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (Seongnamsi, Korea) from November 2008 to December 2010 with preterm labor and intact membranes. Inclusion criteria were (1) singleton gestation, (2) a live fetus with a gestational age between 20 + 0 and 34 + 6 weeks, (3) transabdominal amniocentesis performed for microbiologic studies of amniotic cavity, (4) cervicovaginal fluid collected at the time of amniocentesis, (5) cervical dilatation of ≤3 cm by digital examination, (6) no history of prior or subsequent cervical cerclage, and (7) absence of a major congenital anomaly. The clinical parameters that were collected at the time of enrollment included demographic variables (maternal age, parity, and previous preterm delivery), gestational age at assessment and biochemical tests results in AF. During the study period, amniocentesis for retrieval of AF and cervicovaginal fluid sampling were immediately offered to patients who were admitted with preterm labor at our institution. The primary outcome measure was intra-amniotic infection/inflammation.</p>
<p>Intra-amniotic infection/inflammation was defined as a positive AF culture for microorganisms and/or the presence of high levels of IL-6 (&gt;2.6 ng/mL) in AF, as reported previously.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112451794">1</xref>
</sup> Preterm labor was defined as the presence of regular uterine contractions with a frequency of at least 2 every 10 minutes and cervical change before 37 completed weeks’ gestation. Women with preterm labor were hydrated and if uterine contractions persisted, they were started on a regimen of intravenous tocolysis with ritodrine or magnesium sulfate after amniocentesis. Corticosteroids were administered between 24 and 34 weeks’ gestation. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, and informed consent was obtained from all study participants.</p>
<p>All women with preterm labor underwent a sterile speculum examination, at which time cervicovaginal fluid samples were collected for cytokine measurements. Samples were obtained from the posterior vaginal fornix with Dacron swabs (Puritan Medical, Guilford, Maine), which were left in place for approximately 15 seconds to absorb the cervicovaginal secretions. Samples were then placed in 1 mL of sample buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in Tris buffer with 5 mmol/L EDTA, 5 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and 0.5 trypsin inhibitory units of aprotinin) and stored at −70°C until assayed.</p>
<p>After collection of the cervicovaginal fluid, amniocentesis was performed transabdominally under ultrasonographic guidance to obtain AF for culture and white blood cell (WBC) count. Microbiologic evaluation included cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and mycoplasmas (<italic>Ureaplasma urealyticum</italic> and <italic>Mycoplasma hominis</italic>) as described previously.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112451794">10</xref>
</sup> An aliquot of AF was transferred to the hematology laboratory and examined in a hemocytometer chamber for the presence of WBCs. The absolute WBC count was calculated by multiplying the area examined by a factor of 10 per area and was expressed as the number of cells per cubic millimeter. The AF that was not required for clinical assessment was centrifuged, and the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −70°C until assayed. Samples were not subjected to freeze-thaw cycles before being assayed. The IL-6 concentrations were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) human IL-6 DuoSet Kit (R&amp;D System, Minneapolis, Minnesota). The range of the IL-6 standard curve was 7.8 to 600 pg/mL. The assay was carried out by strictly following the instructions provided by the manufacturer and samples were measured in duplicate. The calculated intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were &lt;10%. The AF samples were diluted at 1:10 with DuoSet assay diluent (1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2-7.4; R&amp;D Systems) for the preliminary analysis. The AF samples that contained &gt;6 ng/mL were dilated at 1:100 for the final analysis.</p>
<p>Levels of cervicovaginal IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 were simultaneously measured using multiplex detection kits (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California). Multiplex cytokine array analysis was performed using the Bio-Plex protein array system (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using Luminex-based technology.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112451794">11</xref>
</sup> The assay was performed according to the protocol, except that 50 µL of each cervicovaginal sample was diluted at a ratio of 1:10 in sample diluents. The lower limits of detection for the assays used were 2 pg/mL for all cytokines studied, but because the samples were run at a 1:10, the lower limit of detection was 20 pg/mL. In samples in which the cervicovaginal cytokine level was below the lowest point on the standard curve, we used the lowest value. Standard curves were included in each run and data analyses were performed using Bio-Plex Manager software version 4.1.1 (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Interassay coefficients of variation for individual cytokines ranged from 4.0% to 8.6% and intraassay coefficients of variation ranged from 7.5% to 10.0%. The AF IL-6 level and cervicovaginal cytokine levels were not used to determine patient management.</p>
<p>A Student <italic>t</italic> test or Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used for comparison of continuous variables. Comparisons of proportions were performed with a χ<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112451794">2</xref>
</sup> test or Fisher exact test. Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used to test for normal distribution of the data. A Spearman rank correlation test was used to examine the relationship between the continuous variables which did not follow a normal distribution. A receiver–operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to display the relationship between the sensitivity (true-positive rate) and the false-positive rate and to select the best cutoff values for IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 in cervicovaginal fluids in the identification of intra-amniotic infection/inflammation. Diagnostic indices were calculated (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value [NPV], positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio) for IL-6 and IL-8 in cervicovaginal fluids and AF WBC to identify intra-amniotic infection/inflammation. McNemar test was used to compare the sensitivity and specificity of cervicovaginal IL-6 and IL-8 and AF WBC for predicting intra-amniotic infection/inflammation. To assess the overall diagnostic performance of the IL-6 and IL-8 levels in cervicovaginal fluids and AF WBC count for the entire range of cutoff values, the area under the ROC curves (AUCs) for different tests and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and compared using the method of DeLong et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112451794">12</xref>
</sup> Overall logistic regression analysis was used to examine the independent association of each cytokine in cervicovaginal fluids with the probability of intra-amniotic infection/inflammation. Variables found to have a significant correlation or a tendency with intra-amniotic infection/inflammation in univariate analysis (<italic>P </italic>&lt; .20), such as gestational age, IL-6 and IL-8 levels in cervicovaginal fluids, and AF WBC count, were entered into a logistic regression. All reported <italic>P</italic> values are 2-sided, and <italic>P</italic> values &lt; .05 were considered statistically significant. SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois) was used for statistical analysis.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>During the study period, 93 consecutive women with preterm labor who met the entry criteria were recruited for this study. Of the 93 women, AF was not available in 5 women for IL-6 determinations (4 patients with a negative AF culture and 1 patient with a positive culture), cervicovaginal fluid was not available in 2 women for cytokine determinations (both <italic>with negative AF culture</italic>), and 1 woman had a history of cervical cerclage placement during the index pregnancy. These 8 women were excluded from the study, leaving 85 women suitable for evaluation. The mean gestational age (±standard deviation) at the time of amniocentesis was 29.8 ± 3.5 weeks, with a range from 20 + 0 to 34 + 6 weeks. The prevalence of a positive AF culture was 9.4% (8 of 85). Microorganisms isolated from the amniotic cavity including both <italic>U.urealyticum</italic> and <italic>M.hominis</italic> were found in all cases (n = 8). Intra-amniotic inflammation was present in all cases with a positive AF culture. Intra-amniotic inflammation with a negative AF culture was found in 15.6% (12/77) of those with a negative AF culture. All 12 women with intra-amniotic inflammation but with a negative AF culture delivered preterm (&lt;35 weeks), and 75% (9 of 12) of these cases had histologic chorioamnionitis. Women with a negative AF culture but with intra-amniotic inflammation had a significantly lower median gestational age at delivery and higher rates of spontaneous preterm delivery at &lt;35 weeks’ gestation and histologic chorioamnionitis than women with a negative AF culture and without intra-amniotic inflammation (data not shown).</p>
<p>The IL-1β was detected in the cevicovaginal fluid in 80 (94.1%) of 85 women. The median cervicovaginal IL-1β level was 0.336 ng/mL (range &lt;0.02-11.504 ng/mL). The IL-6 was detected in 54 (63.5%) of 85 cervicovaginal samples. The median cervicovaginal IL-6 level was 0.108 ng/mL (range &lt;0.02-2.775 ng/mL). The IL-8 was detected in 84 (98.8%) of 85 cervicovaginal samples. The median cervicovaginal IL-8 level was 6.278 ng/mL (range &lt;0.02-31.0047 ng/mL). Cervicovaginal IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 levels were significantly correlated with each other (all variables; <italic>r</italic> = .376-.755, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Spearman rank correlation showed that the cervicovaginal IL-6 level was significantly correlated with cervicovaginal IL-8 level (<italic>r</italic> = .635, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1933719112451794">Table 1</xref> shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of the women according to the presence or absence of intra-amniotic infection/inflammation. There were no significant associations between intra-amniotic infection/inflammation and maternal age, nulliparity, prior preterm births, and gestational age at the time of amniocentesis. However, women with intra-amniotic infection/inflammation had a significantly higher mean AF WBC count and a lower mean gestational age at delivery than did those without intra-amniotic infection/inflammation. Moreover, the mean cervicovaginal levels of IL-6 and IL-8, but not IL-1β, were significantly higher in women with intra-amniotic infection/inflammation than in those without intra-amniotic infection/inflammation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study demonstrate that cervicovaginal level of IL-6, an easily obtainable and noninvasive marker, can independently predict intra-amniotic infection/inflammation in women with preterm labor and intact membranes. Overall, this noninvasive parameter performed as well as AF WBC count for predicting intra-amniotic infection/inflammation. These findings confirm and extend the previous reports by Rizzo et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112451794">8</xref>
</sup> and Holst et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112451794">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112451794">9</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, these observations have important clinical implications because cervicovaginal IL-6 determination may provide clinicians with data to noninvasively identify those most likely to benefit from invasive amniocentesis and antibiotic treatment in women with preterm labor.</p>
<p>The main finding of this study was an independent association between high levels of IL-6 in cervicovaginal fluid and the presence of intra-amniotic inflammation. Indeed, this finding was not unexpected given previous studies showing a significant relationship between cervical and amniotic levels of IL-6.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112451794">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112451794">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112451794">9</xref>
</sup> Although the precise mechanism for this association is not clear, potential route of ascending intrauterine infection might explain these observations. The main hypothesis is that microorganisms from the lower genital tract would transverse the endocervical canal, reach the decidua, and be located between the amnion and chorion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112451794">13</xref>
</sup> Under this condition, AF cytokines are increased, even in the absence of a microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC), by a diffusion of cytokines over an inflamed membrane.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719112451794">14</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, the microorganisms in the chorioamniotic membranes might cause local inflammation, leading to the breakdown of the chorionic–decidual interface,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112451794">3</xref>
</sup> thus promoting the release of IL-6 into the cervicovaginal fluid. Our view is supported by Jacobsson et al,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112451794">5</xref>
</sup> who demonstrated that the IL-6 in cervical fluid and IL-6 and IL-8 in amniotic fluid are higher in women in preterm labor in whom bacteria were detected in the chorioamniotic membranes.</p>
<p>Among all parameters studied (ie, cervicovaginal IL-1β, IL-6, Il-8, and AF WBC), the most powerful predictive marker of intra-amniotic infection/inflammation, as shown by ROC analysis, was the cervicovaginal level of IL-6. This finding agrees with previous studies of MIAC, intra-amniotic inflammation, and microbial invasions of the chorioamniotic membranes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112451794">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112451794">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112451794">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112451794">9</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, this partly explains previous observations<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719112451794">15</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719112451794"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112451794">17</xref>
</sup> made in the AF that, among other cytokines and laboratory tests, IL-6 levels in AF are the best independent overall predictor of intra-amniotic infection and/or inflammation. Collectively, our findings and the findings of other groups<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112451794">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112451794">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112451794">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719112451794">15</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719112451794"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112451794">17</xref>
</sup> suggest that IL-6 is a reliable marker of intrauterine infection. In contrast to our findings, Hitti et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112451794">7</xref>
</sup> found that the vaginal IL-6 level was not associated with AF infection or high level of AF IL-6 level, while the vaginal IL-8 level was associated with AF infection or high level of AF IL-6 level. We cannot fully explain the discrepancy between the 2 studies, but it seems likely that in the former study,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112451794">7</xref>
</sup> the value of the lower detection limit for IL-6 assay was too high in comparison with ours (0.9 vs 0.02 ng/mL). In this scenario, the values of cervicovaginal IL-6 &lt;0.9 ng/mL would not be considered to have a predictive effect for intra-amniotic infection/inflammation.</p>
<p>Exclusion of intra-amniotic infection/inflammation in patients with preterm labor is important because a costly and invasive amniocentesis may be avoided. Each of the noninvasive tests evaluated in this study (ie, cervicovaginal IL-6 and IL-8) was more suited for exclusion of intra-amniotic infection/inflammation than for its prediction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1933719112451794">Table 2</xref>). Specifically, using the cutoff values of ≥0.232 ng/mL for cervicovaginal IL-6, this test reliably excluded intra-amniotic infection/inflammation with an NPV of 91.8%, suggesting that a low cervicovaginal level of IL-6 can identify women who may safely avoid amniocentesis. From a practical standpoint, we propose that the measurement of cervicovaginal IL-6 level can be used as a screening test for intra-amniotic infection/inflammation rather than a diagnostic test. Screening for intra-amniotic infection/inflammation would begin with a cervicovaginal IL-6 measurement, which would classify women with preterm labor into high- and low-risk groups. Those at high risk could then be targeted for appropriate risk-specific intervention (eg, amniocentesis).</p>
<p>The finding that the overall rates of intra-amniotic infection and intra-amniotic inflammation in women with preterm labor were 9.4% and 23.5%, respectively, which is compatible with the results of previous reports.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112451794">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112451794">7</xref>
</sup> In accordance with recent studies of cervical fluids by Holst et al,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112451794">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112451794">9</xref>
</sup> cervicovaginal IL-6 and IL-8 levels and AF IL-6 level were significantly correlated each other. This correlation suggests a common underlying process for the elevation of cervicovaginal and amniotic fluid IL-6 levels, which occur coincidentally in the 2 different compartments and that cervicovaginal samples may provide a valuable alternative to AF testing for intra-amniotic infection/inflammation.</p>
<p>Our study had several limitations. First, IL-6 and IL-8 assays are not yet commercially available for clinical use. Thus, their diagnostic use is limited. Second, in contrast to previous studies,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112451794">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112451794">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112451794">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719112451794">16</xref>
</sup> mycoplasmas were the only microorganisms that were isolated from the AF. Although the reason for isolation of only mycoplasma in our study is not clear, we believe it is not related to the technical problems of aerobic and anaerobic cultures in our institution because, during nearly the same period, a variety of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were recovered from the AF of patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes in our institution.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719112451794">18</xref>
</sup> Third, the data were obtained from only 1 hospital and there may be concern in applying results to other populations. Therefore, the results of this study will need to be validated in a different population before clinical application. Fourth, we used 2 different laboratory methodology (multiplex bead array assays vs ELISA) to determine the cytokine levels in AF and cervicovaginal fluid compartments. This may make it impossible to directly compare cytokine levels between the 2 compartments, in light of results from a recent large study that demonstrated good correlation, but often poor concurrence of quantitative values, between multiplex bead array assays and corresponding ELISA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719112451794">19</xref>
</sup> Finally, the sensitivities and specificities, as based on the chosen cutoff values of cervicovaginal IL-6 and IL-8 for intra-amniotic infection/inflammation, were maximized because these cutoff values were applied against the same population in which they were derived. Therefore, the cutoff values need to be prospectively validated in a different population to establish their accuracy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, high levels of IL-6 and IL-8 in cervicovaginal fluid are related to intra-amniotic infection/inflammation in women with preterm labor, while cervicovaginal fluid IL-1β level is unrelated. Among all parameters studied, cervicovaginal level of IL-6 was the best marker for intra-amniotic infection/inflammation, which could be used as a noninvasive marker to select the subset of women with preterm labor requiring invasive amniocentesis. Further prospective studies are required to develop and validate a simple bedside test for qualitative estimation of clinically significant IL-6 in cervicovaginal fluid to be used in clinical settings of limited resources.</p>
