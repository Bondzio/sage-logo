<p><bold>Stacey A McKenna and Deborah S Main</bold> offer a timely and useful piece on what community engagement really means. This is a topic of increasing importance as healthcare research comes more to embrace the action research orientation often known as community participatory research. I hope this article finds the readership it deserves among those conventional researchers who seek to re-train their assumptions about how heretofore forgotten stakeholders from the healthcare community (such as patients!) might be meaningfully involved in research that will help transform healthcare in cost efficient ways.

<p><bold>Nicky Duenkel and Judy Pratt</bold> illustrate the emancipatory aspects of action research in coming to share their deeper understanding of power and its dynamics in the context of experiential ecological education.

<p><bold>Fatemeh Adili, Isabel Higgins and Tina Koch</bold> illustrate the application of action research to the treatment of chronic illness and in so doing they help develop theory of transitions in patients with chronic illness. As chronic illness comes to empty the coffers of public health officials, more attention will be brought to the important contribution that action research can offer in meeting the health care’s triple aim: lowering costs, nurturing sustainable health and encouraging universal access.

<p><bold>Kausar S Khan, Sohail Amir Ali Bawani and Ayesha Aziz</bold> write from the context of women’s empowerment in Pakistan where the emancipatory goals of action research come alive. Here we see a lovely example of the integrative (it’s not just about health it’s also about consciousness raising!) and transformative nature of action research.

<p><bold>Lesley Wood and Bernadette Govender</bold> bring an exciting piece of action research from efforts to transform schools in South Africa. They tell of promoting sustainable development by bringing a platform for shared learned to ten schools, and 24 school leaders, in an action research project. Their work exemplifies how <italic>Action Research</italic> journal wishes to relate to the domain of action research and education. As there are other journals devoted to teachers action research and because action research is now common in schools of education, ARJ may distinguish itself by sharing how action research can be brought into transformative design of the entire educational endeavor at large scale. We would be glad to see more such action research.

<p><bold>Fredrik Sandberg and Andreas Wallo</bold> help deepen our appreciation for how Habermas’ theory of communicative action serves action research. Habermas enjoys an unusual degree of popularity among action researchers who often see in his work a philosophical-pragmatist foundation for our contemporary work, happening, and taking seriously linguistic turn and with it, our pragmatist turn to coordinating helpful action together with stakeholders. Interestingly, for most of his career, Habermas has been clear that researchers ought to remain unentangled in the field of action. So the authors’ concept of the ‘virtual participant’ is interesting for explaining how the interactive researcher can engage in performative action without becoming captive to the practice system. This article signals a growing interest in the debate that needs to happen on the proper role of a researcher in the field of practice. Stay tuned for a call for papers to a special issue precisely on how action researchers can indeed bring a deeply informed praxis to the field of practice.

<p>And with that I invite you to another set of interesting papers in another good issue of <italic>Action Research</italic> journal!</p>
