<abstract>
<p>India has experienced significant economic growth since the 1990s. Young middle-class Indian nationals have embraced international tertiary and vocational education as a part of this trend. Many of these students have come to Australia to study. In 2009, claims that Indian students in Australia were being targeted for racial violence received worldwide media attention. This article presents the results of a qualitative study of public documents surrounding the ‘violence against Indian students’ issue over a 12-month period. It contends that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that some of the victimisation had a racial or anti-Indian element to it. Drawing upon literature on racism, it reveals a discourse of denial that runs through the responses of Australia’s political leaders to this claim. In the current global environment, however, exposure of Australia’s denial by the Indian media may operate as a form of counter-discourse from an emerging superpower whose citizens refuse to tolerate the failure of western nations to take responsibility for the injustice of racial violence.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0004865811431330" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the <italic>Man Booker</italic> award winning novel, <italic>The White Tiger</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004865811431330">Aravind Adiga (2008)</xref>, the main character, Balram Halwai, uses violence and corruption to transform his life from that of a subjugated servant from ‘the darkness’ into a successful entrepreneur in Bangalore, the heart of India’s shining new economy. Balram believes that ‘the future of the world lies with the yellow man and the brown man’ now that India’s ‘erstwhile master, the white-skinned man, has wasted himself through buggery, mobile phone usage, and drug abuse’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004865811431330">Adiga, 2008</xref>: 5). In his admiration for China, one of the few nations that have never been ruled by foreigners, Balram writes to the Premier of China to tell him his life story, which, in effect, is the story of Bangalore:
<disp-quote>
<p>See, when you come to Bangalore, and stop at a traffic light, some boy will run up to your car and knock on your window, while holding up a bootlegged copy of an American business book, wrapped carefully in Cellophane and with a title like:</p>
<p>THE SECRETS OF BUSINESS SUCCESS!</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>BECOME AN ENTREPENEUR IN SEVEN EASY DAYS!</p>
<p>Don’t waste your money on those American books. They’re so <italic>yesterday</italic>.</p>
<p>I am tomorrow. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004865811431330">Adiga, 2008</xref>: 6)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>The White Tiger</italic> has been interpreted as an indictment of the master/slave relationship at the heart of India’s recent economic growth. The character of Balram Halwai embodies his nation’s changing place in a post-colonial world: India is ‘tomorrow’. Although a third of India’s population continues to live in deep poverty, during the 1990s an almost equal number became ‘the fastest-growing middle class on the planet’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0004865811431330">Lak, 2008</xref>: 12). As the world’s largest democracy, and despite challenges of literacy, health, internal security and border conflict, India’s share of world trade has trebled in the past 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0004865811431330">Wade, 2011</xref>). It now enjoys ‘the sort of bulge in manpower [sic] which brought sustained booms elsewhere in Asia’, making it conceivable that India will outpace China in the foreseeable future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0004865811431330"><italic>The Economist</italic>, 2010</xref>: 9).</p>
<p>When young Indian nationals travel overseas to study it is this sense of ‘tomorrow’ that many carry with them and actively pursue. Indeed, one of the signs, and drivers, of India’s prosperity is the enthusiasm with which middle-class families embrace international education for their children (and in some cases the path to migration this delivers). As inheritors of a recent sense of ‘India shining’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0004865811431330">1</xref></sup> they do not expect to be ‘pushed around’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0004865811431330">Wade, 2011</xref>: 22) like their colonised forbearers. Yet in 2009 this is exactly how some Indian nationals claimed they were being treated while studying at tertiary and vocational institutions in Australia. At the time, there were approximately 120,000 Indian students in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0004865811431330">Commonwealth of Australia, <italic>Parliamentary Debates</italic>, Smith, 9 February 2010</xref>), a significant increase from the 30,000 of five years earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0004865811431330">Hodge and Karvelas 2009</xref>). Amongst those who commenced study in Australia between 2005 and 2009, 74 per cent were males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0004865811431330">Joudo Larsen et al., 2011</xref>: 30) and many were living in Melbourne, which had the largest concentration of Indian students in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0004865811431330">Joudo Larsen et al., 2011</xref>). On 31 May 2009, thousands of international students, largely from the Indian sub-continent, led by the Federation of Indian students in Australia (FISA), staged a demonstration in Melbourne’s central business district (CBD) to protest about a range of educational, welfare, visa and safety concerns. At the core of the protestors’ concerns about personal safety was the claim, spear-headed by FISA, that Indian nationals studying in Australia were being targeted for property and violent crime that was racially motivated.</p>
<p>This article is concerned with this claim. It presents the results of a qualitative study of public documents surrounding the ‘violence against Indian students’ issue. Despite the overblown nature of the claim of racist violence, there is evidence that some victimisation, albeit far from all, reported by Indian nationals studying in Australia had a racial or anti-Indian element to it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0004865811431330">2</xref></sup> The article explores responses to this claim of racial victimisation from that sector of Australian society where ‘damage to the Australian brand’ (<italic>Herald Sun</italic>, 17 September 2009, quoting John Brumby) is of the utmost priority, namely Australia’s political leaders. As purveyors of ‘elite’ discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0004865811431330">van Dijk, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0004865811431330">1993a</xref>), statements and interviews by politicians, particularly at the national level, stand as a record of a nation’s position on events of global importance such as cross-border accusations of racism. While there have been mixed responses from Australian parliamentarians, it will be argued that those at the federal level have all too often adopted a series of discursive manoeuvres – classified as avoidance, rhetoric and deflection – to accomplish a form of interpretive denial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865811431330">Cohen, 2001</xref>) in response to this claim of racial violence. In the face of allegations (fair or unfair) that Australia is a racist nation, denial at the highest political level operates as a management strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0004865811431330">van Dijk, 1992</xref>) for maintaining not just a share of international trade but, more fundamentally, Australia’s image as a good global citizen. Yet there are limits to denial as a national face-saving strategy. This article considers whether exposure of Australia’s denial by the Indian media can be interpreted as a counter-discourse or form of ‘speaking back’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0004865811431330">Gelber, 2002</xref>) from an emerging superpower such as India, whose citizens refuse to tolerate both acts of racial prejudice <italic>and</italic> the failure of western nations to acknowledge and take responsibility for such injustice.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0004865811431330"><title>Racism and denial</title>
<p>Racism is the power to fragment groups of people by placing different values on their lives (Golder, forthcoming) within a normative hierarchy of ‘good’ and ‘inferior’ groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0004865811431330">Foucault, 2003</xref>: 255). While historical expressions of racism in Australia, such as the White Australia Policy, were concerned with racial purity and biological superiority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004865811431330">Curthoys, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0004865811431330">Forrest and Dunn, 2007</xref>), ‘new’ racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004865811431330">Barker, 1981</xref>) operates through cultural differentiation and exclusion on the grounds that ‘a cultural group does not fit or belong within the society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865811431330">Dunn et al., 2007</xref>: 566 –567). In Australia this is apparent in the new liberal forms of multiculturalism that emerged in the 1990s, replacing direct and confrontational forms of racism with ‘obfuscatory terms such as one nation, community relations and harmony’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004865811431330">Babacan, 2006</xref>: 7). The ‘problem’ with migrants or refugees, for example, is no longer expressed as racial difference but, instead, as the failure to assimilate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0004865811431330">Forrest and Dunn, 2007</xref>), the violation of mainstream values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0004865811431330">Simmons and Lecouteur, 2010</xref>) or protection of one’s home from ‘invasion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0004865811431330">Hage, 1998: 37</xref>): anxieties encapsulated in the policies of the One Nation Party during the 1990s. Thus recent survey research reveals that although Australians are ‘largely tolerant people’, too many (41%) have a ‘narrow view of who belongs in Australia’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0004865811431330">Dunn et al., 2011</xref>). Yet, the routine nature and everyday contexts within which these attitudes are expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0004865811431330">Essed, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0004865811431330">Noble, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0004865811431330">Wieviorka, 1995</xref>) can make the label of racism seem exaggerated and counter-productive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004865811431330">Cox, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0004865811431330">Hage, 2003</xref>). Indeed, for some, the word racism has become so loaded that it generates confused and defensive reactions that ‘do not work well’ in public and political debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004865811431330">Cox, 2006</xref>: 7): accusations of racism can shut down debate instead of opening up solutions.</p>
<p>Despite the compelling nature of these concerns, it is difficult to imagine how some human rights advancements of the last 50 years could have been achieved without naming certain individual and institutional practices as racist (e.g. racial discrimination in education, employment and sport). While the concept of racism has limited heuristic capacity in the volatile and shifting world of contemporary race relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004865811431330">Curthoys, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0004865811431330">Gilroy, 2000</xref>) it remains valuable as a political tool for exposing ‘clear acts’ of prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0004865811431330">Hage, 1998</xref>: 28) towards those who find themselves on the bottom of racial, ethnic, cultural and national hierarchies. Racism may be a blunt label that over-determines complex processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0004865811431330">Noble, 2009</xref>) but in the absence of a superior linguistic tool – words such as nationalism do not have the same denunciative qualities – we have an ethical responsibility to name racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0004865811431330">Hage, 2006</xref>) lest we become complicit in it.</p>
<p>It is significant, therefore, that denial is one of ‘the most crucial properties of contemporary racism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0004865811431330">van Dijk, 1992</xref>: 87). As new racism is increasingly expressed through ‘subtle and indirect … constructions of cultural difference and incompatibility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0004865811431330">van Dijk, 1992</xref>: 93), the label of racism is reserved for extreme attitudes associated with ‘old racism’, for example, the treatment of indigenous populations under colonialism, the anti-Semitism of the Third Reich or the South African system of apartheid. Van Dijk’s research in Europe and North America reveals that the denial of racism is pervasive, not just in everyday conversation but also in the ‘elite discourse’ of politicians, the media, academia and corporations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0004865811431330">van Dijk, 1993a</xref>). When accusations of racism are made, nations, like individuals, employ ‘impression management’ strategies that facilitate ‘face keeping’ or ‘positive self presentation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0004865811431330">van Dijk, 1992</xref>: 89); for example, through literally declaring ‘we are not a racist society’, promoting nationalist rhetoric or deflecting the issue onto other seemingly more pressing concerns such as unemployment or terrorism. While Australia’s history is replete with instances of such denial, recent examples are found in some ‘elite’ responses to the Cronulla riots of December 2005. Despite evidence that people were encouraged to go to Cronulla beach to ‘support “Leb and wog bashing day’’’ and victims were selected because of their Middle Eastern appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0004865811431330">Strike Force Neil, 2006</xref>: 35), many state and federal parliamentarians quickly denied that racism was involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0004865811431330">Dunn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0004865811431330">Poynting, 2009</xref>). For example, the then Prime Minister, John Howard, stated: ‘I do not accept that there is underlying racism in this country … yesterday’s behaviour was completely unacceptable but I’m not going to put a general tag [of] racism on the Australian community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0004865811431330">Ninemsn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0004865811431330">Noble, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>While van Dijk’s research provides insight into the linguistic content of racism denial, Cohen’s broader study of the politics and psychology of harmful and oppressive practices offers a typology of <italic>what</italic> exactly is denied. Cohen identifies three primary means of accomplishing denial: literal, interpretive and implicatory. In literal denial, an event or the knowledge of an event is denied outright: ‘it simply did not happen’. Implicatory denial involves minimising or rationalising the implications of the event and avoiding responsibility: ‘it happened but the moral or personal impact is not so bad’ or ‘it’s got nothing to do with me’. In interpretive denial, the raw facts are given a different meaning from the meaning others give to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865811431330">Cohen, 2001</xref>: 7). In the public realm, interpretive denial largely involves the claim that ‘what happened is not what you think it is, not what it looks like, not what you call it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865811431330">Cohen, 2001</xref>: 7). An example of interpretive denial familiar to feminist criminologists is the refrain, ‘it was consensual sex not rape’.</p>
<p>The degree of ethnic and racial tolerance of a nation is now seen as a symbol of its ‘social progress and modernity’, and is related to the quality of the products and services it provides to other nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0004865811431330">van Dijk, 1992</xref>: 95). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0004865811431330">Davis (2006)</xref> suggests, the assessment that a nation is racist can be threatening in a global economy where industries are dependent upon business from developing or ‘non-white’ nations. Australia’s trade in international education is no exception. The following sections show how denial has been used as a protective strategy in the construction of a positive national image. While previous Australian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0004865811431330">Noble, 2009</xref>) and European research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0004865811431330">Wodak and van Dijk, 2000</xref>) highlights literal forms of political denial, it will be argued that Australia’s political leaders have favoured a more interpretive approach to denying racial elements in the victimisation of Indian students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0004865811431330"><title>The study: Documenting violence against Indian students</title>
<p>The aim of the present study was to examine how Australian politicians, as the purveyors of ‘elite’ discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0004865811431330">van Dijk, 1992</xref>), responded to the claim of racial victimisation against Indian nationals studying in Australia, which, by necessity, required a consideration of the veracity of the claim itself. The study analysed a database of public documents discussing the violence against Indian students phenomenon compiled in the 12 months following the Melbourne demonstration (1 June 2009 to 31 May 2010), focusing on those engaging with the claim of racial victimisation. This database includes: (i) Australian state and federal Hansard; (ii) press releases and interviews from Australian parliamentarians, Indian parliamentarians, Australian police in Victoria and New South Wales, community groups and government agencies; (iii) reports of government inquiries, summits and roundtables; (iv) sentencing hearings for convictions for offences committed against victims assumed to be of Indian heritage; and (v) media reports in Australia and India, including online blogs attached to internet media. Excluding repetitious or minor material produced a database of approximately 250 key documents.</p>
<p>Three samples of material were drawn from the database for analysis: documents containing evidence of the claim of racial victimisation; public statements by Australian parliamentarians pertaining to the claim of racism; and documents commenting on the response of Australian politicians to the claim of racism, which often overlapped with the first sample. The first sample is used to explore the claim of racial victimisation and is analysed in the context of other literature on the safety of international students in Australia (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004865811431330">Babacan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0004865811431330">Joudo Larsen et al., 2011</xref>). The second sample is examined via techniques of critical discourse analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0004865811431330">Fairclough, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0004865811431330">Foucault, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0004865811431330">van Dijk, 1993b</xref>) which identify codes or linguistic repertoires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0004865811431330">Potter and Wetherell, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0004865811431330">Mason, 2002</xref>) employed by Australia’s political leaders to describe, define and comment upon the victimisation. Although not without its critics, this form of discourse analysis, used extensively in scholarship on racism, recognises that multiple readings may arise from a given document but aims to identify dominant interpretations and the influence of hegemonic discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0004865811431330">Toolan, 1997</xref>). Linking the language of leading Australian parliamentarians to wider themes of social and cultural inequality revealed a series of discursive manoeuvres amounting to a form of interpretive denial around the claim of racial victimisation. Even so, the impact of counter-discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0004865811431330">Foucault, 1972</xref>), or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0004865811431330">Gelber (2002)</xref> calls ‘speaking back’, cannot be dismissed in the context of racism, hate speech or hate crime. Thus the third sample of material is drawn upon in the final section of the article to raise some questions about denial as a strategy for managing Australia’s image as a good global citizen.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0004865811431330"><title>The claim of racist violence</title>
<p>While racial violence has been identified as a problem in Australia for some time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004865811431330">Cunneen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0004865811431330">HREOC, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0004865811431330">Noble, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0004865811431330">Poynting and Noble, 2004</xref>), it was not until the 2000s that the welfare of overseas students became a major concern in the education sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0004865811431330">Nyland et al., n.d.</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0004865811431330">Victorian Department of Innovation, Industry and Regional Development, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0004865811431330">The May 2009</xref> demonstration by international students brought these two issues together. Amongst a plethora of complaints regarding educational standards, accommodation and transport, FISA was explicit about the racial nature of personal safety concerns within their constituency: ‘How can they say that none of these attacks were racist when we hear criminals saying terms like “curry bashing?”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0004865811431330">FISA, 2009</xref>). These concerns were supported directly by other student groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0004865811431330">University of Melbourne Graduate Student Association, 2009</xref>) and indirectly by institutions such as Victoria University which commissioned scoping studies into the safety of international students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004865811431330">Babacan et al., 2010</xref>) and the Australian and New Zealand Human Rights Commissions which devoted their 2009 roundtable to the topic. Although the May demonstration was partly prompted by high profile cases, such as the stabbing of Baljinder Singh in the Melbourne suburb of Carnegie, FISA also claimed that such incidents formed part of a larger problem of racial violence against Indian nationals studying in Australia.</p>
<p>FISA’s claim was received with considerable trust in India. Shortly after the demonstration, the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, addressed parliament on the issue, stating that he had been ‘appalled by the senseless violence and crime, some of which are racist in nature’ and that he had spoken to the Australian Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, who had assured him that ‘any racist attack against Indian students will be sternly dealt with’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0004865811431330"><italic>Hindustan Times</italic>, 2009</xref>). A few days later, the Indian Minister for External Affairs, Shashi Tharoor, described the victimisation as: ‘a continuing pattern of anti-Indian violence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0004865811431330">Wade, 2009</xref>). However, it was in the Indian media, particularly the tabloid electronic and print press, that the claim of racist violence was most heavily promoted and amplified. A selection of headlines and banners from news items appearing in Indian media during 2009 exemplifies this point: ‘Australia, land of racism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0004865811431330"><italic>The Economic Times</italic>, 2009</xref>); ‘Another Indian student attacked in Australia’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0004865811431330"><italic>Times Now</italic>, 2009a</xref>); ‘Racist Australia?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0004865811431330">NDTV, 2009</xref>); ‘Sixth racist attack in one month’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0004865811431330"><italic>Times Now</italic>, 2009b</xref>); ‘Racism: Beyond shame’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0004865811431330"><italic>Times Now</italic>, 2009b</xref>); ‘Race terror down under’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0004865811431330"><italic>Times Now</italic>, 2009d</xref>).</p>
<p>In Australia, however, there was reluctance to take FISA’s claim at face value.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0004865811431330">3</xref></sup> In January 2009, five months before the student demonstration in Melbourne’s CBD, the Victoria Police acknowledged that people of Indian origin were over-represented as victims of robbery in Melbourne’s western suburbs but rejected the claim that they were being targeted because of their race or ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0004865811431330">Victoria Police, 2009a</xref>). In the days and weeks immediately following the May demonstration, neither Victorian nor NSW Police were prepared to acknowledge that racism was a major factor in the victimisation of Indian students, preferring instead to describe the incidents as ‘opportunistic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0004865811431330">Victoria Police, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0004865811431330">ABC Television, 9 June 2009</xref>) and pointing out that many factors may contribute to the over-representation of Indian victims in certain crime categories, such as travelling on public transport late at night, returning home to outer areas of the city following shift work, and carrying valuable electronic equipment. Similarly, in late 2009, the federal Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations concluded that ‘the majority of the evidence given to the committee indicated that the incidents were more likely to be opportunistic robberies… as opposed to attacks based on race’ (2009: 25–26). Unfortunately, the only evidence cited by the Committee for this conclusion was one submission from an international student association.</p>
<p>More recently, a rigorous study of crimes against international students conducted by the Australian Institute of Criminology matched names and dates of birth from student visa information held by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship against police victim records for the years 2005–2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0004865811431330">Joudo Larsen et al., 2011</xref>). Examining three key offence types – assault, robbery and other theft – the study concluded that, with some variations, international students – from India, China, Korea, Malaysia and the United States – ‘are no more likely than Australian reference populations to be the victim of assault or other theft’, and, in fact, ‘were often less likely to the victims of these crimes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0004865811431330">Joudo Larsen et al., 2011</xref>: 53). As flagged by the Victoria Police, however, the study found that Indian students were ‘significantly more likely to be the victims of robbery compared with other international students and the Australian reference populations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0004865811431330">Joudo Larsen et al., 2011</xref>: 53). This heightened vulnerability to robbery amongst male and female Indian students is explained, in part, by the fact that Indian students have a level of English proficiency which means they are more likely to find employment that comes ‘with an increased risk of crime’ (whether at work or while travelling to and from work), such as at late night convenience stores, service stations and as taxi drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0004865811431330">Joudo Larsen et al., 2011</xref>: 53). Yet, significantly for the present discussion, the authors are clear that their study ‘does not permit a reliable test for racial motivation’ (xvi) (which throws into sharp relief the premature conclusion of the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations).</p>
<p>In the absence of reliable police or victimisation data, it is necessary to turn to other sources. Two sources drawn from the present study’s database are useful. First, are media reports. Although media reports do not provide reliable information on the nature or extent of racist violence against Indian students, they do offer a ‘softer’ or tentative illustration of the claim, and a picture of problem as it is represented in the public domain. Despite the sensationalist nature of some of the Indian media’s coverage of this issue, the present study found signs that some, certainly not all, of the violence reported by Indian nationals during 2009 had a racist element to it. For instance, during the 12-month period of the study, more than 20 incidents were reported in the Australian and Indian media of criminal offences involving a victim (or victims) identified as a student from India. While there is insufficient evidence in most of these reports to determine whether racism was a factor, some do contain victim accounts which point to the presence of racism. For example: (i) in May 2009, Mr Sourabh Sharma, a 21-year-old student from India, was the victim of an assault and robbery in Werribee, Melbourne, during which the assailants allegedly yelled ‘Why the fuck did you come here?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0004865811431330">Miller, 2009</xref>); (ii) in June 2009, Mr Sunny Bajaj, a 20-year-old student from India, was assaulted in Boronia, Melbourne by assailants who allegedly called him a ‘fucking Indian cunt’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0004865811431330"><italic>Times of India</italic>, 2009</xref>); and (iii) in September 2009 a large group of assailants abused four members of the Singh family, including two students, in a hotel car park in Epping, Melbourne. One of the victims, Mr Mukhtiar Singh, described the incident as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>They had bottles… We didn’t have a chance to go away, people everywhere around us, everybody was saying, ‘go back to India, get out, leave the country’, f-word they were using, even the women were screaming like ‘go back to your country, go back to India’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004865811431330">ABC Television, 16 September 2009</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast to earlier incidents, the Victoria Police immediately identified the racial nature of this incident against the Singh family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004865811431330">ABC Television, 16 September 2009</xref>). Indeed, in their subsequent study of community safety and international students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004865811431330">Babacan et al. (2010)</xref> conducted a series of interviews with members of the Victoria Police, concluding that ‘[m]ost police could think of incidents in which both opportunism and racism were combined’ and that while racism may not always be a primary motive, some police officers felt it was ‘sometimes a clear secondary element used to further humiliate or weaken the resistance of victims during the course of a robbery or an assault’ (2010: 3).</p>
<p>These findings are consistent with the second source of material drawn from the study’s database: sentencing hearings of offenders convicted of criminal offences against victims of apparent Indian heritage where evidence of racial motivation was present. During the period of the study, two cases that came before the Victorian courts serve as helpful examples (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0004865811431330"><italic>Hussein v The Queen</italic> [2010]</xref> VSCA 257). In <italic>DPP </italic>v<italic> Caratozzolo</italic> the Victorian Supreme Court found that the defendant, who had pleaded guilty to one count of murder and two counts of robbery committed in January 2008, had selected at least one of his victims on the grounds that the victim was believed to be Indian (having already violently robbed a victim of Chinese heritage who subsequently died, the defendant persuaded his group of co-offenders to ‘hustle’ a ‘curry’). At the sentencing decision, Harper J was ‘satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that an element of racism was involved’:
<disp-quote>
<p>[Y]ou focused on members of the Indian community as targets for physical assault. You wanted to cause them physical injury. You took the trouble to learn how to swear at Indians. So, having found your second victim, Bhinesh Mosaheb, you swore at him in Hindi. Not only that, but the language you used was designed to cause the maximum offence. That is unequivocally racist. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0004865811431330"><italic>DPP </italic>v<italic> Caratozzolo</italic>, 2009</xref>: 14)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Later that year, in <italic>R </italic>v<italic> Gouros</italic>, the Victorian County Court sentenced another offender who, along with a group of co-offenders, had engaged in a spate of robberies largely at train stations in Melbourne’s western suburbs, selecting multiple victims on the grounds of their assumed Indian origin. The Crown tendered evidence that in three previous armed robbery offences committed by Gouros in 2008, all of the victims were also of Indian appearance. This was sufficient to satisfy Judge Cohen beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was aware when he started the 2009 offences that ‘the choice of victim was, at least partly based on their apparent race or ethnic origin’ (<italic>R </italic>v<italic> Gouros</italic>: 30). This selection of victims of Indian heritage was held by the Court to invoke Victoria’s new hate crime sentencing provision which interprets motive of prejudice or group hate as an aggravating factor for sentencing purposes (s. 5(2)(daaa) <italic>Sentencing Act 1991</italic>).</p>
<p>The assessment that criminal conduct is racist depends upon the availability of reliable data which, in turn, requires evidence of racist language and symbols or patterns of perpetrator behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0004865811431330">Mason, 2005</xref>). More fundamentally, however, any such assessment comes to rest upon the way in which racist crime is defined. Criminal conduct that is motivated purely by racism – such as the populist image of random attacks on racial minorities by white supremacists – presents little definitional difficulty as it tends to be accompanied by language (such as racial insults) or gestures (such as graffiti) that make the perpetrator’s motive apparent. Conduct that is only partially motivated by racism – such as a perpetrator who deliberately selects robbery victims on the grounds of their Indian appearance – is also deemed sufficiently racist by the criminal law to attract penalty enhancers in Victoria as well as multiple US and European jurisdictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0004865811431330">Mason, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0004865811431330">OSCE, 2009</xref>). In Western Australia and the United Kingdom certain forms of criminal conduct will also be classified as racially aggravated if there is evidence of racial hostility before, during or after the commission of the offence, such as a perpetrator who makes racial insults when confronted with a victim of Indian appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0004865811431330">Mason, 2009</xref>). In short, it is now well accepted in law and policy that racist crime encompasses criminal behaviour that is ‘wholly or partly motivated by, grounded in, or aggravated’ by racial prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0004865811431330">Mason, 2009</xref>: 327). In other words, a crime will be racist if racial prejudice is an <italic>element</italic> or component of the offence, whether as motive, a driver of victim selection or accompanying hostility. While the above evidence does not establish the prevalence of racial crimes against Indian students, it does reveal, as Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Simon Overland acknowledged in January 2010, that ‘undoubtedly some of these attacks have a racist motive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004865811431330"><italic>The Age</italic>, 2010</xref>) – in Victoria at least. Similarly, the Australian Institute of Criminology comments that it is ‘undeniable’ that there is a ‘racial element to some of the reported incidents’, emphasising, however, that ‘the nature and extent’ of this racial motivation is ‘yet to be determined’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0004865811431330">Joudo Larsen, 2011</xref>: 4). Nonetheless, the harm of racist crime cannot be measured simply by the extent of reported incidents. Once news of individual racist offences circulates through local networks or is broadcast via the media, feelings of vulnerability, anxiety and anger are quickly amplified throughout the targeted group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0004865811431330">Chakraborti, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0004865811431330">Mason, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0004865811431330">Perry, 2002</xref>). As the Victorian Sentencing Advisory Council puts it, this sends a ‘powerful message of intolerance and discrimination’ that can have a ‘general terrorizing effect’ on the wider community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0004865811431330">Sentencing Advisory Council, 2009</xref>: 8, 1).</p>

<sec id="sec5-0004865811431330"><title>Political responses to the claim of racist violence: Interpretive denial</title>
<p>Parliamentary discourse stands as a record of a nation’s position on issues of global and domestic importance. For this reason, denial is a favoured political response to claims of racism from other nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0004865811431330">van Dijk, 1992</xref>). The response of Australia’s political leaders to the claim of racist violence against Indian students has been no exception. The reluctance of Victoria’s then Premier, John Brumby, to admit that the victimisation of Indian students had a racial element has been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0004865811431330">Stewart, 2010</xref>). In his first address to Victorian parliament after the May 31 demonstration, John Brumby did state that ‘there is no doubt that some, but not all, of the assaults which have been committed against members of the Indian community have been racially based’ (Victoria, <italic>Parliamentary Debates</italic>, Brumby, 2 June 2009). Nathan Rees, then Premier of NSW, made comparable comments. However, such frank admissions quickly dissolved, and over the subsequent months Brumby shied away from this characterisation, seeming more concerned that ‘racial violence was hurting Australia’s image abroad’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0004865811431330">Wotherspoon, 2009</xref>). Brumby was lambasted in the Indian media for this hesitancy (discussed further below), and by the time he visited India in September 2009, and after the attack against the Singh family described above, he demonstrated greater preparedness to link the attacks with racism, commenting that Victoria needed to ‘keep getting the message across that… acts of racism are completely unacceptable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004865811431330">ABC Television, 16 September 2009</xref>) and that his government would assist via the introduction of harsher sentencing provisions for prejudice motivated crime.</p>
<p>While Australian media have been critical of John Brumby and the Victoria Police, the reactions of Australia’s federal parliamentarians to the issue have attracted less negative attention in this country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0004865811431330">Stewart, 2010</xref>). This is remarkable because the present study found that it was rare for federal parliamentarians from the two major parties to acknowledge any racial element to the victimisation in the 12-month period following the May 2009 demonstration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0004865811431330">4</xref></sup> This lacuna is particularly striking in those crucial first few months after the demonstration when tensions were high and Indian students and their supporters were looking for signals from government that their concerns about racism were being taken seriously. Instead of providing this assurance, Australia’s federal politicians tended to engage in more circular, coded and cautious responses. In particular, three interwoven discursive manoeuvres can be identified in the responses of federal politicians to the claim of racial violence against Indian students: avoidance, nationalist rhetoric, and deflection.</p>
<p>In the second half of 2009, Australian journalists reported that federal politicians, particularly the then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and the then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education Julia Gillard, had ‘reassured’ India that Australia was not a racist nation and rejected any element of racism in the spate of attacks on Indian students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0004865811431330">ABC Radio National (Kelly F), 3 September 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0004865811431330">Coorey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0004865811431330">Franklin, 2009</xref>). However, a close reading of the parliamentary statements and interviews relied upon by journalists to make this claim reveals that neither Gillard nor Rudd literally denied the involvement of racism. In fact, neither spoke directly of race or racism at all.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0004865811431330">5</xref></sup> Taking Julia Gillard as an example, we see that she refused to engage with the racism question in an interview on the ABC 7.30 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0004865811431330">Report during her visit to India in September 2009</xref>, despite an attempt by journalist Chris Uhlmann to force the issue:
<disp-quote>
<p>Chris Uhlmann: How do you overcome the perception that Australia’s a racist country?</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Julia Gillard replies:
<disp-quote>
<p>Julia Gillard: I think the important thing is to be here in India and explaining factually to people what has happened and what the Government’s response has been. Of course the incidents involving Indian students got a lot of media in India and caused anxiety. That’s to be expected. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0004865811431330">ABC Television, 1 September 2009</xref>)</p></disp-quote>In interviews following her meeting with the Indian Prime Minister later in September 2009, Julia Gillard also avoids the issue of racist violence by citing only the ‘treatment’ of Indian students and offering reassurance that the government was acting on ‘welfare and other concerns’:
<disp-quote>
<p>I had a warm, constructive meeting with the Prime Minister. I obviously discussed the concerns that there have been about the treatment of Indian students in Australia. The Prime Minister noted approvingly the measures that Australia has taken to address these concerns… (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0004865811431330">ABC Radio National (Kelly F), 3 September 2009</xref>)</p>

In contrast to both the Howard government’s response to the Cronulla riots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0004865811431330">Noble, 2009</xref>) and trends within European and North American parliamentary discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0004865811431330">van Dijk, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0004865811431330">Wodak and van Dijk, 2000</xref>), Julia Gillard shied away from direct denials of racism. This reticence may stem from a belief that some Australians actually are racist (as opposed to John Howard’s earlier expression of disbelief). Alternatively, it may be that one of the political lessons of the Cronulla riots is an appreciation that literal denials of racism are largely unpersuasive. Thus, Gillard’s avoidance of the ‘R’ word may be an attempt to ward off inflammatory and unconvincing headlines along the lines of ‘Deputy PM denies racism’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0004865811431330">David Marr (2009)</xref> has pointed out that for the language of race to work in politics, it has to come heavily disguised: ‘Race can never been be seen simply as race: Once uncloaked, it’s disowned’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0004865811431330">Marr, 2009</xref>: 1). The above examples suggest that the same may be true of racism.</p>
<p>As the ‘prime forum for nationalistic rhetoric’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0004865811431330">van Dijk, 1992</xref>: 109) parliament provides the perfect vehicle for nations to present positive images of themselves, which, in turn, operate as a common strategy in the overall denial of racism. Such rhetoric has been particularly pronounced amongst federal politicians in response to the victimisation of Indian students. In his address to parliament on 1 June 2009, the day after the Melbourne demonstration, then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>Australia is a country of great diversity, harmony and tolerance. We are a multicultural nation and we respect and embrace diversity – diversity which has enriched our nation, Australia. That is why these recent acts of violence are all the more deplorable. They are equally unacceptable and deserve to be met with the full force of the law.

Within the context of India’s rising prosperity and increasing global power, he condemned the violence as a threat to Australia’s national pride, diversity and tolerance:
<disp-quote>
<p>We are a country that prides itself on diversity and tolerance… We have managed to develop a broad, multicultural society with very little friction. But these recent brutal events in Melbourne threaten that peace and that tranquillity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004865811431330">Commonwealth of Australia, <italic>Parliamentary Debates</italic>, Turnbull, 1 June 2009</xref>)</p></disp-quote>In both examples, condemnation of the ‘deplorable’, ‘unacceptable’ and ‘brutal’ (not racist) violence is embedded within, and contrasted to, positive images of ‘diversity’, ‘harmony’, ‘tolerance’ and ‘multiculturalism’ as normal to the Australian community. The implication is that the citizens of a diverse and tolerant nation such as Australia are not capable of ‘real’ racism, which is reserved for the most prejudiced and hateful attitudes. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0004865811431330">Hage (1998)</xref> has argued, such calls by the State for multicultural tolerance are a ‘quintessential example’ of the ‘widespread belief that what one needs to do in the face of racism is to reassert the fact that Australian society is built on “tolerance”’ (1998: 79). Yet, as Hage and others point out (1998, 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0004865811431330">Noble, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0004865811431330">Tsiolkas, 2008</xref>), policies based on tolerance present a veneer of egalitarianism that merely disguises the wider exclusionary assumption that it is up to some (read privileged) groups to decide where and how to draw the line between desirable/undesirable people, behaviour and lifestyles (87). While Rudd and Turnbull’s assertions of Australian values and tolerance indirectly allude to the claim of racism, their reliance upon the ‘obfuscatory language’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004865811431330">Babacan, 2006</xref>) of national peace, tranquillity and tolerance sidesteps and minimises the problem of racist victimisation. As Simmons and Lecouteur put it, in their analysis of the Redfern and Macquarie Fields riots, the problem is depicted ‘as an isolated, non-normal event, produced by a very small number of people’ (2010: 677).</p>
<p>Australia’s political leaders have trodden a fine line between reassuring India and other trading partners that Australia is a ‘safe and welcoming country’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0004865811431330">ABC Radio National (Kelly F), 3 September 2009</xref>) and offering sufficient condemnation of the victimisation of Indian students. In the second half of 2009 they sought to do this by characterising it as routine violence within a wider problem of urban crime. For example, in his address to federal parliament the day after the Melbourne demonstration, Kevin Rudd contextualised the victimisation in the following way:
<disp-quote>
<p>In fact, there is a much wider problem of urban violence in various parts of some of our largest cities. I speak on behalf of all Australians when I say that we deplore and condemn these attacks.

<p>Later in 2009, during his visit to India, Kevin Rudd was equally clear about the source of the problem:
<disp-quote>
<p>As Prime Minister of Australia, I am deeply disturbed and disgusted by attacks of violence against any foreign students studying in our country as our guests.

In this context, we see the same kind of terminology being deployed to normalise the victimisation of Indian students as everyday violence. Embedded in the declaration of a commitment to the safety of ‘all’ visitors and ‘all’ citizens, is the implication that this violence is random and could happen to ‘any’ of us, not just people from India. In other words, there is nothing peculiar or distinctive about this group of victims, this crime is no different to other crime and the solution lies in heavier policing rather than anti-racism strategies. While this formulation of the problem is not without some justification – many of the incidents reported are breaches of the criminal law and take place in Australia’s largest urban centres – the trouble is that it compresses the experiences of Indian students to a crime problem alone and thereby discounts racism as a variable. The fact that it is both escapes this formulation.</p>
<p>While Australia has a long history of denying racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004865811431330">Ang, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0004865811431330">Noble, 2009</xref>), the interpretive rather than literal qualities of this denial are underscored in the ‘violence against Indian students’ phenomenon. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865811431330">Cohen (2001)</xref> suggests, denial may be a process rather than a single act and, like racism itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004865811431330">Babacan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004865811431330">Curthoys, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0004865811431330">Hage and Couch, 1999</xref>), can be accomplished through the use of coded as well as overt strategies. In the second half of 2009 there was negligible acknowledgement from Australia’s political leaders that racism was likely to be a factor in the victimisation reported by Indian students. This prevarication was coupled with a hesitancy to overtly deny racism, which, in effect, amounted to a refusal to even utter the ‘R’ word (<italic>avoidance</italic>). The silence produced around the question of racism was filled with opposing messages of tolerance and multiculturalism (<italic>opposing rhetoric</italic>). At the same time, the source of the problem was deflected away from racial dynamics towards less volatile issues of law and order (<italic>deflection</italic>). Collectively, these discursive manoeuvres disputed the ‘cognitive meaning’ given to the violence by the victims, FISA and a range of Indian and Australian commentators, thereby re-allocating it to ‘another class of event’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865811431330">Cohen, 2001</xref>: 8). In other words, the victimisation was reduced to a matter of everyday urban violence which effectively neutralised its racial element; it became a problem of crime not racism. This process of interpretive denial, in turn, served a wider defensive function by implying that Australians are ‘decent citizens’ and not racists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0004865811431330">van Dijk, 1992</xref>: 91). To be categorised as racist or even as intolerant is particularly face-threatening for a nation because it implies that this incivility is an ‘enduring characteristic’ of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0004865811431330">van Dijk, 1992</xref>: 90), or, as one <italic>Times Now</italic> online commentator from Calcutta bluntly put it on the day after the Melbourne demonstration, ‘STAY AWAY FROM THE BARBARIAN COUNTRY OF AUSTRALIA’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0004865811431330">Shreyoshi, 2009</xref>). This may explain why Australia’s political leaders appear to have assumed, at least throughout the second half of 2009, that it is less damaging for the nation to have a problem of crime than a problem of racism.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0004865811431330"><title>Countering denial</title>
<p>The wide reach of political discourse makes it one of the most influential and damaging forms of denial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0004865811431330">van Dijk, 1992</xref>). Such denial allows Australia to present itself as a ‘good, decent, courageous’ global citizen, the very ‘embodiment of egalitarianism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0004865811431330">Tsiolkas et al., 2008</xref>: 34). As a ‘major management strategy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0004865811431330">van Dijk, 1992</xref>: 87), denial justifies the absence of anti-racism strategies and helps ‘construct the dominant white consensus’ within global politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0004865811431330">van Dijk, 1992</xref>: 89). Yet, the power of denial to save Australia’s image as a good global citizen is not this simple. Racist discourse is neither totalising nor static but, instead, is subject to continual resistance and opposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0004865811431330">Foucault, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0004865811431330">Noble, 2009</xref>). These counter discourses may involve violent expressions of resentment, as in the Cronulla ‘revenge’ attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0004865811431330">Dunn, 2009</xref>) or well reasoned forms of ‘speaking back’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0004865811431330">Gelber, 2002</xref>) designed to contradict the unfounded premises of prejudice. If we accept that denial is integral to racism, such counter discourse must, however, do more than challenge racism. It also must tackle the denial of that racism.</p>
<p>As a nation that has recently ‘arrived at the world’s top table’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0004865811431330">Lak, 2008</xref>: 230), India has not hesitated to ‘speak back’ to Australia about its failure to acknowledge racism. The initial reticence of the Victoria Police to identify racism as an element in the victimisation of Indian students was one of the key motivations for the 2009 demonstration and analysis of documents in the study’s database over the following 12 months reveals escalating criticism in the Indian media of Australia’s political leaders for refusing to acknowledge a racial element to this victimisation; to the point where condemnation of this denial almost overshadows condemnation of the violence itself. This is best exemplified in a dedicated <italic>Times Now: The Newshour</italic> special on 16 September 2009, where much was made of the fact that then Victorian Premier John Brumby had been ‘forced to accept’ the racist nature of the attack against the Singh family in Melbourne (discussed above). Farrukh Dhondy, author and former commissioning editor for UK’s Channel 4, was scathing in an interview on this programme:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think they should have admitted long ago that Australia has a deep streak of racism running through it. I mean it doesn’t just start with their attacks on, their treatment of the Aborigines historically, it also was reflected for tens of years, for decades, in their immigration policy. They need the labour now. They’ve begun to open up to the world. And Australia is changing very slowly but still the population has been steeped in racist attitudes. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0004865811431330"><italic>Times Now</italic>, 2009c</xref>)</p></disp-quote>In November 2009, <italic>Times Now</italic> amplified this image of Australia as a nation in denial by claiming that Victoria’s criminal justice system was tardy in handing down a conviction for an attack upon an Indian taxi driver: ‘After months of <italic>living in denial</italic> a Melbourne court has sentenced an Australian man to six years for attacking an Indian taxi driver with a knife’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0004865811431330"><italic>Times Now</italic>, 2009e</xref>, emphasis added). These kinds of criticisms reached a peak in January 2010, following the killing of Indian graduate Nitin Garg in Melbourne, when the Delhi <italic>Mail Today</italic> published a cartoon depicting a Victoria Police officer as a member of the Ku Klux Klan with the caption ‘We are yet to ascertain the nature of the crime’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0004865811431330">Pearlman et al., 2010</xref>: 6). Although these examples suggest that sections of the Indian media dispensed with fairness or accuracy in their eagerness to highlight a perceived injustice, they also reveal that the injustice the media sought to expose was not simply racial violence but additionally the resistance of Australian institutions and politicians to publicly and consistently concede that racism may be implicated in this victimisation. As the Stephen Lawrence inquiry demonstrated in Great Britain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0004865811431330">Macpherson, 1999</xref>), State denial of racism inevitably leads to accusations of institutional or structural racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0004865811431330">Macpherson, 1999</xref>) which, in turn, tends to ‘entrench rather than redress the vulnerability and marginalisation’ of international students and other minority groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004865811431330">Babacan et al., 2010</xref>: 4).</p>
<p>India may have arrived at the world’s top table but, in many ways, it still awaits ‘due recognition’ from other nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0004865811431330">Lak, 2008: 230</xref>). This tension feeds concern amongst the country’s urban middle class about the imperialist nature of the global trade in tertiary education and the exploitation of its citizens as low paid labour in western nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0004865811431330">Mason, 2010</xref>). In his interview on <italic>Times Now</italic>, Farrukh Dhondy argues that India and the Indian community in Australia must ‘retaliate’ and ‘stand up’ to show that its citizens are not just victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0004865811431330"><italic>Times Now</italic>, 2009c</xref>). In this context, it is possible to read the unrelenting campaign of the Indian media – which certainly has a streak of ‘raw nationalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0004865811431330">Wade, 2011</xref>: 22) running through it – as a form of resistance or speaking back that has attempted to keep racism on the public agenda and thereby unmask Australia’s image as a champion of justice and civility. It has certainly prompted Australian agencies and institutions to scrutinise the problem of racism more closely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865811431330">Australian Human Rights Commission, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004865811431330">Babacan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0004865811431330">Graycar, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0004865811431330">Jakubowicz and Monani, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0004865811431330">Tasmania Law Reform Institute 2011</xref>). While the present study does not allow firm conclusions about the wider impact of this counter discourse, it is worth asking whether such scrutiny has exposed the weakness of denial as a national face-saving strategy. For instance, in February 2010, some eight months after the May demonstration and in the wake of the death of Nitin Garg in Melbourne, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Stephen Smith, made one of the few direct acknowledgements in federal parliament that racism may be involved in the victimisation reported by Indian students: ‘We have zero tolerance for racism in this country. If any of these attacks have been racist in nature – and <italic>it seems clear some of them have</italic> – they will be punished with the full force of the law’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0004865811431330">Commonwealth of Australia, <italic>Parliamentary Debates</italic>, Smith, 9 February 2010, emphasis added</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0004865811431330">6</xref></sup> If those who deny racism are no longer accorded the final word in a changing post-colonial world, we may speculate that this eventual acknowledgment from one of Australia’s political leaders reflects a concern that elite denial, once brought to light, is just as likely to harm as preserve national face. By impelling the State to take some responsibility for racism, exposure by the Indian media may have made a small contribution in the struggle to ‘contradict the message’ of denial and ‘counteract its effects’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0004865811431330">Gelber, 2002</xref>: 16).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0004865811431330" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Some of the victimisation reported during 2009 by Indian nationals studying in Australia had a racial element to it. Young, male Indian students often do not have access to private transport, well-located housing or safe employment, and are concentrated in shift work as taxi drivers or at late-night convenience stores and petrol stations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004865811431330">Babacan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0004865811431330">Joudo Larsen, 2011</xref>). While these factors may place them at greater risk of robbery, it is possible that inter-group tension, competition for public space and resentment have fanned the anti-Indian sentiment that has been expressed in some of the reported offences, irrespective of whether such offences are also, or even primarily, motivated by financial gain or other factors. While the label of ‘racism’ risks over-determining the multiplicity of drivers behind this victimisation, in the absence of more accurate descriptors, it is an important way of signalling the prejudicial element that motivates or accompanies some of this crime.</p>
<p>The vast majority of Australians believe that ‘there is racial prejudice in Australia’ (84.4%) and that ‘something should be done to minimise or fight’ it (85.6%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0004865811431330">Dunn et al., 2011</xref>). In 2009, Australia’s political leaders had the opportunity to ‘position themselves as advocates for the elimination of racism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004865811431330">Babacan et al., 2010</xref>: 4). Disappointingly, they largely chose to distance themselves from the problem of racism altogether – neither acknowledging nor denying it – and to fill the gap with nationalist and crime control rhetoric. Collectively, these attempts to ‘save face’ are tantamount to an interpretive form of denial that pays insufficient regard to India’s concerns about the racial, and not just violent, treatment of its citizens.</p>
<p>The harm of racial violence is not confined to the proportion of individuals directly victimised. It has a ‘ripple effect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0004865811431330">Perry 2002</xref>) that creates a sense of vulnerability and social exclusion in the target group as whole. This is why institutional and parliamentary acknowledgement is so important: it enables those who lead government and represent the State to condemn racism out of hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0004865811431330">Macpherson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0004865811431330">Perry, 2002</xref>). Arguably, a failure of political will to do so offers licence for the commission of further violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0004865811431330">Perry, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004865811431330">Babacan et al., 2010</xref>) and hinders the effectiveness of crime prevention and anti-racism programmes. In effect, the failure of Australia’s government to acknowledge and take racism seriously trivialises the harm to the victim community and impedes effective intervention.</p>
<p>India’s retort to the narrative of denial that runs through the responses of Australia’s political leaders to this problem has been acerbic. The sense of ‘tomorrow’ that pervades the country’s middle class, for whom life has become ‘increasingly sweet’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0004865811431330">Lak, 2008</xref>: 12), brings with it expectations and demands. As Australia’s third largest export market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0004865811431330">Wade, 2011</xref>), India’s citizens expect to be accorded respect as valued guests and potential citizens. The Indian media and others have highlighted not just the problem of racism in Australia but also the problem of denial. Once exposed, this denial may be as damaging to national image as racism itself. As Hage suggests, it is ‘more ethical to be a racist and acknowledge it than to be one and deny it’ (2003: 8). On a more hopeful note, we may ask whether this realisation has contributed to the Gillard government’s announcement in February 2011 of a new National Anti-Racism Partnership to ‘design and deliver an anti-racism strategy… to work to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0004865811431330">Bowen, 2011</xref>).</p>
