<title>Background</title>
<p>Singularity University (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.SingularityU.org">www.SingularityU.org</ext-link>) began with a founding conference in September 2008, and is now located in Mountain View, California, in the heart of Silicon Valley. It offers a ten-week Graduate Studies Program and four-day or seven-day executive programs, and claims to already have more than 1,000 graduates.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Each year, the graduate students are challenged to develop a company, product, or organization that will positively affect the lives of a billion people within ten years . . . While none of these startups has yet reached its mark . . . great progress is being made. Because of the exponential growth rate of technology, this progress will continue at a rate unlike anything we’ve ever experienced. (p. 73)</p>
<p>Eight exponentially growing fields were chosen as the core of SU’s curriculum: biotechnology and bioinformatics; computational systems; networks and sensors; artificial intelligence; robotics; digital manufacturing; medicine; and nanomaterials and nanotechnology. Each of these has the potential to affect billions of people, solve grand challenges, and reinvent industries. (pp. 57–58)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Diamandis is Chairman and CEO of the X Prize Foundation (dedicated to bringing about radical breakthroughs for the benefit of humanity), as well as co-founder of the International Space University. The other co-founder is prodigious inventor Ray Kurzweil, author of <italic>The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology</italic> (Viking 2005), <italic>The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence</italic> (Penguin 2000), and <italic>The Age of Intelligent Machines</italic> (MIT 1992). The back-cover blurb by Kurzweil announces that “this brilliant must-read book provides the key to the coming era of abundance replacing eons of scarcity. <italic>Abundance</italic> is a powerful antidote to today’s malaise and pessimism.” (Blurbs are also provided by Sir Richard Branson, Matt Ridley, Jeff Skoll, and, surprisingly, Arianna Huffington, who views the book as “a reminder of the infinite possibilities for doing good.”)</p>
<p>Kurzweil described <italic>The Singularity</italic> in his 2005 book as a future period during which technological change will be so rapid, its impact so deep, that human life will be irreversibly transformed. Two seasoned futurist critics described his book as “Toffler’s <italic>Future Shock</italic> raised by ten orders of magnitude” (Ted Gordon) and as “a secular religious tract” (Joseph F. Coates). Another futurist, Robert U. Ayres, warned of technological forecasts by technologists, most ranging “from bad to very bad to even downright silly” (<italic>Technological Forecasting &amp; Social Change</italic>, 73:2, February 2006).</p>

<title>The Basic Premise</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Humanity is now entering a period of radical transformation in which technology has the potential to significantly raise the basic standards of living for every man, woman, and child on the planet. <italic>Within a generation, we will be able to provide goods and services, once reserved for the wealthy few, to any and all who need them. Or desire them. Abundance for all is actually within our grasp</italic>. (p. 9, italics added)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is now possible to imagine “a world of 9 billion people with clean water, nutritious food, affordable housing, personalized education, top-tier medical care, and nonpolluting, ubiquitous energy. Building this better world is humanity’s grandest challenge” (p. 11). Everything outlined here “should be achievable within 25 years, with noticeable change possible within the next decade” (p. 25).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1946756713478580">
<title>The Argument Distilled</title>
<sec id="section4-1946756713478580">
<title>New Cooperative Capabilities</title>
<p>Information-spreading technology has traditionally been expensive, but because of cost reductions the rules are changing rapidly. Global deployment of information and communications technologies (ICTs) has democratized the tools of cooperation. The Internet brings together buyers and sellers, builds communities of interest, creates a global classroom, and sends messages to vast networks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1946756713478580">
<title>Water and Sanitation</title>
<p>Describes a distiller (the “Slingshot”) that can purify 250 gallons of water a day using the same amount of energy that runs a hair dryer (total cost: less than a penny per liter), applying nanotechnology to desalination, IBM’s smart grids for water to increase productivity, computer-assisted irrigation to lower water use by 35 to 40 percent while increasing yields by 25 percent, and techno-toilets that process all organic wastes and require no infrastructure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1946756713478580">
<title>Feeding Nine Billion</title>
<p>Use of genetically modified organisms is rapidly increasing, and many genetically engineered (GE) fears have been quieted; herbicide use is down, while yields are up. Vertical farming in cities, as promoted by Columbia University’s Dickson Despommier, offers huge promise and demands no new technologies: it requires 80 percent less land, 90 percent less water, and 100 percent fewer pesticides, with near-zero transportation costs. Protein can be supplied by still more aquaculture and by in vitro meat (growing cultured beef in bioreactors makes us less vulnerable to diseases and contamination, enabling the 30% of land currently used for livestock to be reforested). If we can radically increase productivity while protecting biodiversity, we can feed the hungry “in a truly abundant fashion.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1946756713478580">
<title>Energy</title>
<p>Arguably, the most important linchpin for abundance is energy. Comments on the solar potential of North Africa (enough to supply forty times the present world electricity demand), making solar panels cheap enough to hit subsidy-free grid parity in four years, a new generation of biofuels based on algae (which can produce thirty times more energy per acre than conventional biofuels; Exxon has partnered with Craig Venter’s Synthetic Genomics to explore the possibilities), pursuing the holy grail of grid-level storage that will give solar and wind a major boost, small-scale modular Generation IV nuclear reactors that are safe and easily maintained (Nathan Myhrvold’s TerraPower seeks a demonstration unit by 2020), and an intelligent network of power lines and sensors to replace today’s “dumb grid” (Cisco has made a huge commitment to build a smart grid, with the ultimate goal of integrated distributed generation and storage).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1946756713478580">
<title>Education</title>
<p>Comments on the education potential of computers, the One Laptop per Child initiative (which has delivered $180 laptops to three million children worldwide), self-organized learning environments (for places where good teachers cannot be found), obsolescence of the industrialized model of education, changing the way that progress is measured, and the importance of educating girls.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1946756713478580">
<title>Health Care</title>
<p>A “world of health care abundance” involves reducing preventable medical errors, ending curable ailments such as malaria, correct diagnoses, zero-cost diagnostics, technology to enhance surgery (e.g., special-purpose robots), robo nurses costing $1,000 to assist an aging population, growing replacement organs in the human body, stem cells to repair and replace failed organs, rapid DNA sequencing, RNA interference to turn off specific genes such as the fat insulin receptor, the Lab-on-a-Chip that can quickly run dozens if not hundreds of diagnostics from a sample of bodily fluid, participatory medicine (whereby the mobile phone becomes a mission control center in which the body’s real-time data are captured and analyzed), and empowering the entire world with basic resources (food, water, energy, and education).</p>

<title>Appendix</title>
<sec id="section12-1946756713478580">
<title>Dangers of the Exponentials</title>
<p>Provides an eleven-page “macroscopic overview” of the “grave dangers” that can be posed by exponential technologies (“discussion of these threats and potential mitigating factors put forward here is woefully inadequate, given the importance of the subject”). Imagining these dangers is not hard, and every year at Singularity U, workshops “try to list and prioritize near-term and medium-term doomsday scenarios.” Three near-term concerns consistently rise to the top:</p>
<list id="list2-1946756713478580" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Bioterrorism:</italic> As Do-it-Yourself (DIY) biotechnology becomes easier to use and cheaper to access, biological attacks and hacks are inevitable. Genetic engineering of viruses is far less complex and expensive than sequencing human DNA. Even the threat of a bioattack can be severely damaging. Yet there is little proof that more regulation will help, because banning anything simply creates a black market. A robust pathogen-monitoring system can help in biodefense, but may take a few years or even decades to realize.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Cyber crime:</italic> Attacks against banks could destroy all records, and hacking into hospitals could cost hundreds of lives by changing blood types. As the integration of biology and IT proceeds (e.g., pacemakers, diabetic pumps, cochlear implants), all will become the targets of cyber attacks. Equally alarming are threats against physical infrastructures hooked up to the Internet (e.g., bridges, tunnels, air traffic control, energy pipelines). Robots connected to the Internet will also be vulnerable. We may need some type of global liability law that covers software security and an international net-based police force.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Robotics, AI, and unemployment:</italic> Robots will soon make up the majority of the blue-collar workforce, and humans will have a hard time competing (robots work 24/7, and do not get sick, make mistakes, or go on strikes). One expert says that “exponential technologies may eventually permit people to not need jobs to have a high standard of living.”</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>But “putting the brakes on technology just won’t work,” especially if we are serious about future survival. There will always be a few holdouts (e.g., the Amish), but “the vast majority of us are here for the ride. And, as should be clear by now, it’s going to be quite a ride” (concluding words, p. 304).</p>

<title>Comment</title>
<p>This provocative book serves as a counterbalance to recent Book of the Month selections at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://GlobalForesightBooks.org">GlobalForesightBooks.org</ext-link>, all of which pay little or no attention to new and emerging technologies. The <italic>2052</italic> report to the Club of Rome by Jorgen Randers (Chelsea Green, 2012), <italic>Occupy World Street</italic> by Ross Jackson (Chelsea Green, 2012), the Worldwatch Institute’s annual <italic>State of the World Report</italic> on sustainable prosperity (W.W. Norton, 2012), and the <italic>Resilient People, Resilient Planet</italic> report of the UN High-Level Panel on Sustainable Development (United Nations, 2012) all emphasize “soft” innovations for governance and appropriate economics, in contrast to the Singularity University focus on “hard innovations.” Michael T. Klare’s excellent overview, <italic>The Race for What’s Left: The Global Scramble for the World’s Last Resources</italic> (Metropolitan Books/Henry Holt, 2012) describes “the end of easy everything” that will drive up costs for oil and gas, minerals, rare earths, and agricultural land. Some of the new technologies described in <italic>Abundance</italic> may offset these rising costs (e.g., new ways of growing food and conserving water) and even bring less scarcity. But, as Klare warns, some diminishing resources (notably vital rare earth elements) may be irreplaceable, thus creating bottlenecks to any progress, let alone the hyper- progress prophesied by Diamandis and Kotler.</p>
<p>The techno-ecstatic focus of Singularity thinking about hard technologies serves to obscure the need for “soft” social technology that is of equal if not greater importance, and it drives out gloomy reservations about downsides. True, the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1946756713478580">appendix</xref> on “Dangers of the Exponentials” does consider the threats of bioterrorism and cyber crime, but the treatment of AI and robotics leading to unemployment—and underemployment, which is not mentioned—does not even approach the level of superficiality. And sticky questions are ignored about how the new abundance will be distributed in a world of massive and increasing inequality, large and hungry multinational corporations, and many governments running huge deficits and hamstrung by ideological gridlock and obsolete ideas.</p>
<p>As inspirational futurism suggesting possibilities of a better world for all, there are certainly many good budding ideas here that may bloom. As a forecast of what is likely, the subtitle <italic>The Future Is Better Than You Think</italic> (perhaps forced by the publisher) is over the top. The future <italic>may</italic> be better than we think if some of these game-changing technologies come to widespread fruition. But it is unlikely that all or even most of them will be realized, at least in the next twenty-five years. Not impossible, but not probable, either. Indeed, one of the subsections of Chapter 1 is titled <italic>The Possibility of Abundance</italic> (p. 9), which is plausible and restrained. (Note: For detailed and relatively restrained tech forecasts from an expert panel, see William Halal’s <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.TechCast.org">www.TechCast.org</ext-link>.)</p>
<p>In any event, this book presents the techie side of the great “Pessimist–Optimist, Malthusian–Cornucopian” debate that has been with us for decades and will surely continue. Hopefully, the debate will grow even wider and deeper, with benefits to all.</p>
