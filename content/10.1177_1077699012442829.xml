<p>Robert Burgoyne’s <italic>Film Nation</italic> may be regarded as companion to his related work, <italic>The Hollywood Historical Film</italic> (2008), even though this 2010 volume is a revised version of a 1997 original and may be usefully studied after <italic>Historical Film.</italic> There is some overlap in the films analyzed—notably, <italic>JFK, United 93</italic>, and <italic>World Trade Center.</italic> Burgoyne is professor and chair of film studies at the University of St. Andrews. In the more introductory <italic>Historical Film</italic>, he discusses different categories of the genre, war, epic, biographical, “metahistorical,” and topical, focusing on their relationships to understandings of national identity, organized remembering, artistic ambition, and studio prestige. There is some overlap with <italic>Film Nation</italic> in application of key concepts, such as Bakhtin’s “genre memory,” and both books invite consideration of the relationship between film and public sphere.</p>
<p>In <italic>Film Nation</italic>, Burgoyne’s more specialized purpose is the interrogation of contemporary films that both provide a counternarrative to Rancière’s 1977 concept of the “dominant fiction” of American history, yet ultimately reinforce social belief by validating the cultural hybridity of American life, binding it to images of nation. These films rearticulate social identities as shaped as much by opposition, antagonism, fear, and hatred of the other, as by more positive traits. They address the fundamental contradiction that fractures notions of nation as social unisonance from race.</p>
<p>Foregrounding the “fissures and fault lines” between national myths and the experiences of those who have been excluded from dominant accounts, they induce an “emotional rediscovery” of America, drawing on official history as factual discourse while employing fiction to challenge it. Yet these “critical” films revivify basic tropes such as the image of mystic nationhood that is revealed only on the battlefield, adapting the rhetoric, imagery, and patterning of genre memory and “double voicing,” whereby genres shape and carry social experience across generations. Burgoyne applies Ignatieff’s 1993 distinction between ethnic and civic nationalism, or between inherited, genealogical passions of attachment and attachments to shared sets of political practices and values. He proposes that contemporary films define a new, polycentric nationalism, crystallized through “blood argument” to be sure, in preference to ethnocentric nationalism. In acknowledging an inclusive multitude of sometimes conflicting, open-ended histories in any given historical moment, these serve as counterarguments to ideas of globalization based on the presumption of the fading of nation.</p>
<p>Burgoyne analyzes the Civil War film <italic>Glory</italic> from the competing perspectives of national construction and race, recalling West’s 1992 “identity from above” and “identity from below,” and playing up the failure of social movements to cut across racial identities. <italic>Thunderheart</italic> illustrates how contemporary film rearticulates Native Americans as the bearers of alternative historical and national consciousness in opposition to the nation state. <italic>Born on the Fourth of July</italic> links the symbols of nationalism to an iconography of gender that transitions from an ideal of masculinity based on punitive agency to one acquired by the “rescue” of the nation, figured as a woman. <italic>JFK</italic>’s “fragmentary, atomized” form expresses the “rupture of a once-unified national text.” <italic>Forrest Gump</italic> severs formal history from individual experience, creating a “prosthetic memory” of history that can forgive historical debts and correct disabilities.</p>
<p><italic>The New World</italic> both challenges and reinforces the traditional story of the encounter between the Virginia Company and the Algonquian Indians. It portrays Jamestown as an environmental disaster while seeing in the relationship between Smith and Pocahontas a “tantalizing possible world of interlayered consciousness” that at once invites the audience to an emotional experiencing, from the “inside,” and also shocks it by the “otherness” of a very different time and culture. The film is radical in its insistence that the mythical “New World” of vacant, available space was a territory already long shaped by indigenous peoples, and that the colony’s appropriation of space (particularly in the case of tobacco) was treacherously counterproductive.</p>
<p>In <italic>Gangs of New York</italic>, rival <italic>ethnies</italic> fight both one another and the nation-state on a “primordial battleground of contested spaces” in a manner suggesting that the United States was engaged in “naked competition for control.” The film dramatizes ethno-symbolism in the construction of nation yet ultimately hints at the loss of ethnicity as the price for nationhood. <italic>Flags of Our Fathers</italic> and <italic>Letters from Iwo Jima</italic> refashion the war genre as the “haunting of the present by the past,” a present whose false history has hollowed out actual history.</p>
<p>These films contrast the appropriation by the nation-state of distinctive symbolic codes for the purpose of warfare, with the reality of lived experiences and the many performances of self-sacrifice. <italic>United 93</italic> and <italic>World Trade Center</italic> seek authenticity in detail, yet are so narrowly focused as to deflect historical understanding, “acting out” rather than “working through.” They seek instead to reframe national trauma as a narrative of historical agency and collective heroic action, one that is configured as a “variant of post colonialism, American <italic>exceptionalism</italic> or the imaginative mythology of the frontier.” The narrative time inhabited by the victims/heroes is that of the parallelism and simultaneity of modern life, while time as inhabited by terrorists is a sinister, teleological “Messianic time.” The rescue of policemen by a figure who himself is somewhat Messianic, Burgoyne suggests, becomes a preamble to a cultural remaking, “one dominated by the fantasy of America as a once and future promised land, whose refashioning will be conducted with boots on the ground . . . the past will now define the future.”</p>
<p>This very insightful and topical book is a powerful contribution to the study of film, nation, and identity and has many cross-disciplinary applications, including culture, media, and globalization studies.</p>
