<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 14-year-old male, with a past medical history of vitiligo was referred from an outside hospital for management of thrombocytopenia and left-sided numbness and tingling. The patient bumped the top of his head on a locker 5 days prior to presenting to an outside hospital emergency department. He denied any loss of consciousness, headache, or bleeding during the event. He complained of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, subjective fevers, and chills on the day prior to the visit. He was diagnosed with a “stomach virus” and given per oral Bactrim. The next day he returned to the outside hospital emergency department with increased bruising and short episodes of tingling and numbness lasting less than a minute on the left side of his body. Workup at the outside hospital was as follows: white blood cell count 7900/µL; hemoglobin(Hb) 8.9 g/dL; hematocrit (Hct) 25.1%; and platelets 8000/µL with a differential of 55.3% neutrophils, 31% lymphocytes, 12.3% monocytes, and 1% eosinophils. C-reactive protein was 3.9 mg/L (normal = 0.1-8.2 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 84 mm/h. Liver function tests revealed an elevated total bilirubin level at 2.1 mg/dL. Basic metabolic panel was unremarkable. Review of systems revealed fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. He denied any changes in weight, hematuria, arthralgia, seizures, epistaxis, or bleeding. The patient’s past medical history was significant for vitiligo and seasonal allergies. Current medications included Bactrim and topical treatments for the vitiligo. Family history was negative for hematologic and oncologic disorders.</p>
<p>The physical exam was significant for scattered petechiae on the trunk, back, and lower extremities. There were hypopigmented macular lesions on the posterior neck, fingertips, and at the hairline on the forehead. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable. Complete blood count showed thrombocytopenia with platelet count of 5000 and anemia (Hb = 7.3 g/dL). The basic metabolic panel was unremarkable. Uric acid level was 7.5 mg/dL with total bilirubin of 1.8 mg/dL. Coagulation studies were within normal limits. Lactate dehydrogenase was elevated at 901 U/L. Direct Coombs test was negative. His total bilirubin was increased to 2.1 mg/dL (normal &lt;1 mg/dL). Urinalysis was positive for 4+ blood, 10 to 20 red blood cells, and 2+ bacteria. The patient was negative for antinuclear antibody, cytomegalovirus IgG and IgM, Epstein–Barr virus IgM, and Monospot test. Epstein–Barr virus IgG was elevated indicating a past infection. Abdominal ultrasound showed hepatosplenomegaly. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was unremarkable.</p>

<title>Diagnosis</title>
<p>Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0009922812439246">
<title>Hospital Course</title>
<p>Because of the worsening thrombocytopenia and continued transient ischemic attack–like symptoms, the diagnosis of TTP was made. He underwent plasmapheresis for 3 consecutive days and also received 4 units of packed red blood cells during his stay in the hospital. ADAMTS13 activity was &lt;5 (normal &gt;67) and ADAMTS13 inhibitor level was elevated. His G6PD screen showed low activity and a quantitative assay was low at 1.3. Patient was discharged home in stable condition with a platelet count of 191 000/µL, Hb of 11.2 g/dL, and Hct of 32.6%. He had a recurrence of thrombocytopenia and anemia a week later and required 7 more days of plasmapheresis with excellent response. He was also given a short course of steroids and has continued to stay in clinical remission with normal Hb and platelet counts for a year.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, neurological abnormalities, renal dysfunction, and fever.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812439246">1</xref></sup> Deficiency of the von Willebrand factor–cleaving protease (vWF-CP) ADAMTS13 causes the formation of highly reactive high-molecular-weight multimers of von Willebrand factor, causing the microangiopathic disorder by the formation of platelet thrombi in the microcirculation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812439246">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812439246">3</xref></sup> TTP can be divided into 2 subtypes: idiopathic and congenital. Idiopathic TTP, which is 15-fold more common in adults than in children, occurs in previously healthy individuals. These patients usually have a less severe vWF-CP deficiency. Idiopathic TTP is treated with daily plasmapheresis until clinical symptoms resolve and the platelet count is at least 150 000 U/L. Congenital TTP, also called Upshaw–Schulman syndrome, is more common in children, often presenting as neonatal jaundice and thrombocytopenia. These patients have a more severe vWF-CP deficiency. Congenital TTP can be treated with plasma transfusions as opposed to plasmapheresis. Purified or active recombinant ADAMTS13 may become the mainstay of treatment in congenital TTP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812439246">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812439246">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is diagnosed clinically, as treatment needs to begin immediately, often before the knowledge of the ADAMTS13 activity level. TTP associated with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency commonly presents with gastrointestinal symptoms, neurological abnormalities, weakness, bleeding, purpura, and hematuria. The median Hct in one of the studies was 25% with median platelet count at 16 000/µL and the median lactate dehydrogenase at 97.2 U/L.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812439246">5</xref></sup> Our patient presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, neurological abnormalities, petechiae, and thrombocytopenia, making TTP high on our differential diagnosis.</p>
<p>Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) can be confused with TTP, because of similar presentation. But vWF-CP deficiency can help in making a definitive diagnosis. Veyradier et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812439246">3</xref></sup> found that ADAMTS13 activity was 89% sensitive and 91% specific for detecting TTP. HUS is relatively common in children, whereas TTP is more prevalent in adults. HUS typically presents with acute onset of hemorrhagic diarrhea and acute renal impairment. TTP rarely presents with severe renal failure and is more commonly associated with neurological impairments. Early diagnosis and initiation of appropriate therapy can decrease the mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812439246">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>High recurrence rate warrants close pediatric follow-up with hematology support as indicated. Association of TTP with autoimmune disorders especially systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis has been described. Our patient did have a history of vitiligo, which is thought to be autoimmune in nature. Another complication of TTP is minor cognitive abnormalities, such as problems with memory, concentration, and fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812439246">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Symptoms of abdominal pain, splenomegaly, and hemoglobinuria with a history of recent use of trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole raised concerns of G6PD deficiency. G6PD deficiency is an X-linked genetic defect caused by a mutation in the G6PD gene and usually presents as back pain, abdominal pain, jaundice, transient splenomegaly, hemoglobinuria, and scleral icterus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812439246">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812439246">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Diagnosis of TTP requires a high index of suspicion, especially in pediatric patients as most of the symptoms are vague and difficult to differentiate from other microangiopathic disorders. Given the serious nature of TTP and the high morbidity and mortality associated with undiagnosed TTP, it is important to include TTP on a differential diagnosis. Physicians should suspect TTP in children who present with petechiae, neurological abnormalities, and gastrointestinal symptoms, keeping in mind that only few patients present with the “classic pentad” of TTP—thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, neurologic abnormalities, renal dysfunction, and fever.</p>
