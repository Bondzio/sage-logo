<abstract>
<p>A cultural lens, which is used to explore girlhood in the Southern African context, provides insight into traditional practices like virginity testing. The call for ‘retraditionalization’ of African youth, which is enacted through controlling and monitoring girls’ sexuality, is explored. Within this context, four teenage girls from schools in KwaZulu Natal, a province in South Africa, talk about how they understand their sexuality in ways that suggest that girls shatter and then reassemble the heterosexual terrain, through hypersexualized performativity, by ‘being girl’ in different ways. These teenage girls demonstrate hypervisibility and hypersexuality, and as they resist and subvert hetero-patriarchal cultural contexts, they go beyond projecting hyperfemininty and are largely driven by hedonistic behaviour. Through the use of innovative methodology, where girls are trained to serve as co-researchers to generate and analyse data, power is creatively deployed to enter the heterosexual matrix and find sites which reveal its pliable nature. Ways in which research participants actively resist or comply with heteronormative sexuality are analysed through the conceptual ideas of ‘moments of rupture’ and ‘sustained lines of flight’.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1363460711433754" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Contemporary feminist inquiry into female subjectivity reveals an increased interest in female youth. Conferences (Alice in Wonderland, 1992; the Eighteenth Annual Women’s Studies Conference: ‘Girls, culture and girls’ studies: surviving, reviving, celebrating girlhood’, 2008) have attempted to, as Mary Celeste <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363460711433754">Kearney (1998</xref>: 844) suggests, ‘legitimate female youth as a subject worthy of critical inquiry and to chart the future direction not only of girlhood but also feminist epistemology’.</p>
<p>This article reports on findings from a study in which sexuality and girls’ culture in the South African context were explored. The article serves as an attempt to shed light on girls’ studies beyond the traditional focus on North America, the UK and Australia, which have been documented by writers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363460711433754">Pomerantz et al. (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363460711433754">Aapola et al. (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363460711433754">Wyn and Harris (2004)</xref>, and others. Included in this article is a brief description of an empowering methodology which was used to enable young people to conduct research about sexuality among other young people, thereby creating an environment in which disclosure about intimate issues was more likely.</p>
<p>This article attempts to contribute towards the field of girlhood studies in Southern Africa, by focusing on how four girls explore and navigate their sexual identities. It takes into account the challenge for feminist activists and scholars to employ strategies that will enable the understanding of girlhood from girls’ own perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363460711433754">Moletsane, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363460711433754">Prinsloo (2003)</xref> contends that the social identities of girls do not suddenly materialize in adulthood, but are constructed from birth. Moletsane calls for researchers to work towards understanding conditions of girlhood by engaging with girls’ experiences through structured, qualitative research. This work is informed by ways in which identity is conceptualized, which emphasize the ‘contradictions and ambiguity in multiple processes of (sexual) identity construction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363460711433754">Reddy and Dunne, 2007</xref>: 162). Reddy and Dunne drew on Judith Butler’s (1990) theory of performativity to explore the relatedness between girls’ sexual identity construction and their sexual practices. They concluded that gender identity as a performance should be understood in terms of ‘what you do’ in a particular context at a specific time, instead of ‘a universal who you are’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363460711433754">Reddy and Dunne, 2007</xref>: 162). This, they contended, could create a theoretical space to allow for movement beyond the fixed frames of the heterosexual matrix by rethinking gender, sexuality and sexual practices. An insight into African youth sexual culture, within ever-changing political landscapes, is necessary in order to navigate beyond the boundaries of the hetero-patriarchal matrix.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1363460711433754"><title>The politics of African girlhood</title>
<p>A reflection on the South African government’s policy on adolescent health is necessary to frame socio-cultural discourses on youthful sexuality in general and HIV and AIDS in particular. A sub-directorate for Youth and Adolescent Health has been established by the Department of Health to develop and implement policies for young South Africans (10 to 24 year olds). Under the previous apartheid state, this sector of the population was neglected. Health rights have been entrenched in the Health Rights Charter, which includes Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Rights. Among these is the ‘right to make free informed choices in matters relating to sexual expression, sexual pleasure and sexual orientation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363460711433754">Dickson-Tetteh and Ladha, 2000</xref>: 395). The Department of Health views young people as being particularly vulnerable to HIV and AIDS because they are more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviour and they find it difficult to negotiate safe sex practices. The sexual health challenges faced by young South Africans, which are directly related to the exceptionally severe HIV and AIDS epidemic in South Africa, are listed in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363460711433754">Government Gazette Notice 1384 (2008)</xref>. The AIDS Foundation of South Africa asserts that the government’s HIV and AIDS policy has focused on prevention, which includes the following interventions to promote change in behaviour:
<list id="list1-1363460711433754" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>abstention from sexual intercourse</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>use of condoms during every act of sexual intercourse</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>low risk sexual behaviour by having fewer sexual partners.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The government has not taken into account sociocultural dynamics of the HIV and AIDS pandemic which relate to deep-rooted gender inequalities. The inability to transform attitudes in this regard have resulted in a society where girls and women are more vulnerable to rape, unable to negotiate safe sex, and often in relationships with multiple partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363460711433754">AIDS Foundation of South Africa, 2010</xref>). What is required is an improved understanding of health and culture dynamics in the African context.</p>
<p>A cultural lens to explore what it means to ‘be African girl’ in Southern Africa is used to shed more light on youthful femininity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363460711433754">Harrison (2008: 177–179)</xref> provides insight into the ‘re-legitimisation of cultural pride’, which has encouraged people to return to cultural practices of the past, such as virginity testing, in order to solve current challenges like the HIV and AIDS pandemic. Virginity testing involves physically inspecting a girl’s hymen as a way to verify her chastity and ‘purity’, which are associated with her virgin status. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363460711433754">Ooman (2000)</xref> refers to this as ‘retraditionalisation’, which involves interpreting cultural practices as fixed, static beliefs as opposed to a dynamic, adaptive belief system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363460711433754">Harrison (2008</xref>: 178–179) offers an account of Zulu customary practices that are currently being revisited in order to manage girls’ sexuality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363460711433754">Harrison (2008</xref>: 178–179) describes how, in the Zulu ethnic group in South Africa, puberty rituals (<italic>umhlonyane</italic>), which involved singing songs about morally acceptable behaviour, sex, procreation as well as comportment and demeanour, shaped young peoples’ sexuality. When girls became eligible for courtship, older girls, referred to as <italic>amaqikisa</italic>, counselled them about sexual conduct. They also introduced young girls to suitors. Once the suitor was accepted as a potential husband, the unmarried girl was permitted to have ‘thigh sex’ (<italic>ukusoma</italic>) which, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363460711433754">Kendall (1998)</xref> explains, involves a man placing his penis between a girl’s thighs. Non-penetrative sex ensured that the girl maintained her virgin status before marriage. This account reflects the importance of peers in girls’ construction of their sexuality.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363460711433754">Kendall (1998)</xref>, the practice of virginity testing is rooted in the worship of the goddess Nomkhubulwani, who protects virgin girls and their communities. The belief that the refusal to carry out the practice will result in the departure of the goddess from the community, is widespread. Ill-fortune, in the form of violence, disease and natural disasters, would befall such a community which has lost its African identity. The increase in incidence of drought and the spread of incurable diseases, according to village elders, is proof of the consequences of neglecting cultural practices, and signals the need to ‘retraditionalize’ Zulu girls.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363460711433754">Magwaza (2006</xref>: 2) concurs that in South Africa, increasing rates of infection with HIV, especially among girls and women, has resulted in a call by some institutions to ‘go back to our culture’. The exposure of the girl’s genitals during the cultural practice of virginity testing involves hypervisibility; this is what is required for some girls to ‘prove’ that they are ‘good’ African girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363460711433754">Leclerc-Madladla, 2003</xref>). The practice of virginity testing is rooted in the widespread belief that teenage pregnancy and the rising incidence of HIV and AIDS during the past 15 years are a direct result of ‘moral transgressions’ of girls. These ‘social ills’, as observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363460711433754">Moletsane et al. (2008)</xref>, may be resolved by regulating girls’ sexuality. They explain that controlling, monitoring and policing girls’ sexuality happens in several ways which include the practice of virginity testing, the public assertion by girls of their virgin status, and the pledge by girls to continue to preserve their virgin status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363460711433754">Moletsane et al., 2008</xref>: 26).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363460711433754">Leclerc-Madlala (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363460711433754">Moletsane et al. (2008)</xref> provide insight into conflicts in the construction of youthful African sexuality. Maintenance of girls’ virgin status is associated with good health and fertility, and is believed to protect and honour the family and community, and also serves to fetch a higher bridal price. Girls are expected to remain silent on issues that pertain to sexual decision-making. They are also required to respect boys and men of all ages, and to yield to their requests. In sharp contrast, the construction of African masculinity involves the encouragement of boys and men to ‘freely, and if necessary, violently, express their sexuality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363460711433754">Moletsane et al. 2008</xref>: 27). These researchers argue that the South African social context, as well as the sexual cultures, are disempowering and dangerous to girls. What emerges is the impossibility of ‘being African girl’ within this cultural terrain.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363460711433754">De Robillard (2009</xref>: 88) adds to the debate about regulation of girls’ sexuality by reflecting on how several post-apartheid (post 1994) South African political institutions, including those that are ‘predicated on divergent political markers’, use girls’ bodies to promote their political vision. The South African State has legitimized virginity testing, which is regulated by the Children’s Act 38 of 2005. The figure of ‘girl-as-virgin’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363460711433754">de Robillard, 2009</xref>: 88) is mobilized and used as a political resource in debates that range from gender equality to defending of cultural rights. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363460711433754">De Robillard (2009</xref>: 89) asserts that girls’ virginity has become ‘fodder for moral debate’ (2009: 89). Surveillance of girls’ bodies has fused virginity-testing practices, which is deeply rooted in some African cultures, with the moral regeneration campaign, the latter which is the brainchild of the South African State. Some proponents of the moral regeneration campaign state that in addition to restoring a girl’s pride in her African heritage, virginity testing will promote girls’ celibacy until marriage, reduce the spread of HIV and AIDS, and serve as a way to detect sexual assault. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363460711433754">Kendall (1998)</xref>, who researched traditional practices of Zulu girls, reports that for some girls, virginity testing evoked fear of stigmatization and public humiliation, instead of pride in their heritage. Several self-appointed custodians of African culture assert that political transformation in South Africa should involve protecting the right to practice the tradition of virginity testing. Virginity testing is ritualized at the annual Reed Dance, where bare-breasted isiZulu-speaking girls (who are culturally assumed to be virgins) present themselves before the Zulu King. Mainstream South African media capture pictorial images of these girls and their hypervisibility, which is related to the identity of ‘being African girl’, is hereby endorsed.</p>
<p>The entanglement of girls’ bodies in issues of political correctness is a clear example of the adaptability of patriarchy. Legitimization of the practice of virginity testing as the right to practice one’s culture, is a politically shrewd strategy by the State to reduce the spread of HIV and AIDS and to detect sexual assault. Instead of effectively apprehending and prosecuting rapists, the State chooses reinscribe ideas of dominant South African manhood by using virginity testing as a way to detect evidence of rape. Girls’ submission to virginity testing as part of the moral regeneration campaign which ‘restores a girl’s pride in her African heritage’ is a guise used to perpetuate systems of patriarchal power.</p>
<p>What emerges are multiple ways in which girls become trapped in political debates and cultural practices, and how these influence their girlhood in the Southern African context. The impossibility of being African girl because of the social contexts and sexual cultures; the requirement that girls be hypervisible and hypersexual without being construed as sexually aggressive, are not peculiar to the formation of girl identities in Africa; this is a global phenomenon. Discourses of retraditionalization and ‘moral regeneration’ resonate with Harris’s views of how ‘patriarchy adapts to its most subtle and insidious form: a form that uses a variety of social disguises, one of which is the discourse of political correctness’ (2003: 92). In this way, patriarchy re-emerges to restabilize the heterosexual matrix.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1363460711433754"><title>Girls navigating treacherous, tricky, traditionally male spheres of power</title>
<p>This article engages with ways in which four girls destabilize and restabilize the heterosexual terrain, through hypersexualized performativity. Different ways of ‘being girl’ as research participants actively resist heteronomative sexuality, are examined. The ‘regulation and ruptures of heteronormative femininity’, referred to by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363460711433754">Renold and Ringrose (2008</xref>: 338), explores how girls stabilize and destabilize the rules that govern the heterosexual matrix. Renold and Ringrose refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363460711433754">Tamboukou (2004)</xref> to describe the following two ways in which the hegemonic heterosexual matrix is challenged, namely:
<list id="list2-1363460711433754" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Moments of rupture</italic>, which refers to minor ruptures of discourse of normative rules that govern the heterosexual matrix, which are quickly recuperated.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Sustained lines of flight</italic> characterized by significant, partially sustained rupture of discourse of normative rules of the heterosexual matrix.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Girls’ resistance to what appears as fixed, hegemonic gendered scripts, by attempting to locate, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363460711433754">Deleuze (1995)</xref> has referred to as ‘imperceptible’ movements, facilitates mapping of the rupture and destabilization of the heterosexual matrix. According to Deleuze, these movements are difficult to perceive because the ruptures of the heterosexual matrix are unexpected and not easily understood, and can be easily missed because they can be quickly restabilized to restore ‘normality’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363460711433754">Renold and Ringrose (2008</xref>: 341) concur with Deleuze and add to Butler’s conceptualization that girls ‘deterritorialize normative discourses of femininity, but then … reterritorialize the normative rules of the heterosexual matrix’. One way to map these imperceptible movements is to elicit and explore them through the research lens of other young people. This methodological strategy takes into account the ‘diverse cultural spaces which South African girls inhabit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363460711433754">Moletsane, 2007</xref>: 183). The methodology was influenced by Butler’s (2006: 533) suggestion to ‘creatively deploy power’ as a way of entering the regulated heterosexual matrix and finding sites that reveal its permeable and pliable nature.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1363460711433754" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<p>Power differentials when working with marginalized groups have been widely documented by, among others, Schratz and Walker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363460711433754">1995</xref>: 23), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363460711433754">Brunskell (1998</xref>: 40), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363460711433754">Holland and Ramazanoglu (1995</xref>: 284), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363460711433754">Moletsane (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363460711433754">Moletsane et al. (2008</xref>: 5). In this work, the aspect of power relations that manifest when a professional, adult, academic researcher works with young research participants, is addressed by training girls to serve as co-researchers to generate and interpret research data. In this way, this work became influenced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363460711433754">Gore’s (1992</xref>: 67) conception of power as energy, capacity and potential, not as domination. This methodology was informed by the Foucauldian concept of power, alluded to by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363460711433754">McHoul and Grace (1998</xref>: 89), as something that cannot be possessed but can be circulated. The lead researcher trained 10 volunteers to serve as co-researchers. This allowed for a ‘circulation of power’ from the lead researcher, through the co-researchers, to the research participants. This research strategy did not eliminate power differentials between the researcher and the researched. The subjective positioning of the co-researchers and the interviewees was influenced by interview power dynamics. A limitation of this methodology is that other potential sources of unequal power relations in the research context, such as social class and ethnicity, could not be analysed because the interviewees remained anonymous to the lead researcher. This research strategy did, however, challenge ‘dominant orientations to social research’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363460711433754">Francis and Hemson 2009</xref>: 224) by reducing domination of the researcher over the researched based on specific relations of gender, age, and language proficiency, since the co-researchers and the interviewees, who are selectively reported in this article, were 15- to 18-year-old girls who were linguistically adept.</p>
<p>The 10 volunteers (co-researchers) were a group of vibrant grade 10 learners, whose average age was 15 years. The group comprised seven girls and three boys and they attended a co-educational school in the province of KwaZulu Natal in South Africa. Research instruments were designed to respond to the following research question: How do young people relate to gender perceptions about sexuality in the context of HIV and AIDS?</p>
<p>This article focuses on the interpretation of two data sets (which were drawn from a wider study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363460711433754">Mudaly, 2006</xref>), namely, interview transcripts, which resulted from semi-structured interviews, and reflective journals, which were compiled by the co-researchers. The interview schedules were designed collaboratively by the co-researchers and the lead researcher. The co-researchers were trained by the lead researcher to conduct the interviews. Ten interviews were conducted with interviewees (four girls and six boys) who remained anonymous to the lead researcher. The interviewers (as co-researchers) and interviewees in four of the 10 interviews were girls; these four interviews with girl-only participants, will be the focus of this article. Although this may be construed to be a limited number of respondents, it enabled a deeper analysis of girls’ sexual identity formation from the standpoint of girls. This qualitative methodology optimizes understanding particular ways in which girls construct their sexual identities, and is not intended to ‘generalize beyond it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363460711433754">Stake, 2005</xref>: 443) The interview venues, interview times and interviewees were determined solely by the co-researchers. This creative strategy was employed to excavate silences that surround African girls’ sexuality.</p>
<p>Pseudonyms are used to refer to four African girl interviewees, who attended secondary schools in the same community as the co-researchers. They were Eliza, Patsy, Moonlight and Kurti. The identities of the interviewees were not disclosed to the lead researcher, and by listening to the interviews, the interviewees emerged as academically successful; they enjoyed visiting nightclubs (‘clubbing’), visiting the beach and going to restaurants. The interviewees were articulate and often became emotionally charged when they felt strongly about certain issues.</p>
<p>Discourse analysis of interviews revealed that the language of sexuality used by young people when they speak to their own age group is different from the more careful, sanitized language used when they are interviewed by adult researchers. The anonymity of the interviewees allowed for girls’ voices to be really heard, without the pressure of having to project the ‘good girl’ image.</p>
<p>This methodology also provided insights into the enablement of co-researchers in the field of research, through the promotion of knowledge networking among young people, dialogical engagement about issues of sexuality which are of direct concern to young people, and fostering youth social identity by providing interviewees with spaces to present their voices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363460711433754">Mudaly, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Several journal entries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363460711433754">Mudaly, 2009</xref>: 167–168) by the co-researchers provide evidence which points to their empowerment. One co-researcher wrote that if she were confronted with a difficult situation where the respondent was uncomfortable to answer a question, she would:<disp-quote>
<p>Maintain eye contact, allow the respondent time to speak, but then change the question so that we don’t hurt the respondent.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The co-researcher realized the importance of the ethical requirement of ensuring that no harm should come to the respondent. Another co-researcher wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>I think the interview was well done. I asked a lot of questions that were not on my sheet. I dug deeper into the situation and got more information. I leaned a lot when I did the interview. I also understand more about their lives. I think the interview was successful.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The co-researcher had developed her technique of asking questions in a semi-structured interview, which enabled her to confidently elicit information related to deeper understanding and analysis of youth sexuality.</p>
<p>The co-researchers as interviewees, were able, with seemingly little effort, to draw out issues which reflect an insatiable sexual appetite of the interviewees.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1363460711433754"><title>Findings</title>
<p>The findings emerge from attempts to chart the micromovements of girls (interviewees Eliza, Patsy, Moonlight and Kurti) as they did three things: firstly, they reinscribed the rules of the heterosexual matrix; secondly, they moved away from pre-established destinies of girlhood and destabilized the fixed order temporarily, in ‘moments of rupture’, and then quickly restabilized it; and thirdly, they broke with normative expectation, in ‘sustained lines of flight’, by sustaining the rupture of normative rules which govern the heterosexual matrix.</p>
<sec id="sec6-1363460711433754"><title>Reinscribing rules</title>
<p>The following excerpt from the interview with Kurti provided insight into one way in which gender is mapped onto heterosexuality.<disp-quote>
<p>Interviewer: How do you think young men can prevent the spread of HIV and AIDS?</p>
<p>Kurti: To stick to one sexual partner. Stop being playas.</p>
<p>Interviewer: How do you think young women can prevent the spread of HIV and AIDS?</p>
<p>Kurti: Abstain. And close their legs.</p>
<p>(‘Playa’ – player – refers to having more that one sexual partner. The use of the word ‘playa’ reveals that young people have a discourse that is peculiar to youthful sexuality: this gives young researchers added power to glean information).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>On ways to prevent HIV transmission, Kurti indicated that young men should remain with one sexual partner only, but that abstinence from sexual activity was a preventative strategy for young women. The South African government promotes abstinence as a key way to prevent transmission of HIV and AIDS, without considering cultural expectations from different genders. Kurti’s view is resonant with the assertions by Gomez in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363460711433754">Kumar et al. (2000)</xref> that according to the traditional femininity script, young women are not supposed to desire sex, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363460711433754">Butler (1999)</xref>, that desire is established as a heterosexual male pursuit. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363460711433754">New (1994</xref>: 3) sums up the alienation of young women from sexual pleasure when she declares: ‘Woman is not biologically, but culturally, the eternal other. Her biology is how we recognize her, but her exile is eternally ready-made’.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363460711433754">Harrison (2008)</xref>, in her study about traditional practices of Zulu youth, found that young people expected their boyfriends and girlfriends not to ‘misbehave’ by having numerous sexual partners. Young women who were sexually active indicated that ‘abstention (from sexual intercourse) was the right thing to do’. They perceived their own engagement in sexual activity as a transgression of accepted norms.</p>
<p>The ‘retraditionalization’ of African youth could involve encouragement for them to practice non-penetrative ‘thigh sex’. This would privilege male sexual gratification; the young woman would not receive comparable sexual gratification, and in this way, youthful sexual desire is perpetuated as a male pursuit.</p>
<p>The following excerpt reflects the views of another interviewee, Moonlight, on the use of condoms.<disp-quote>
<p>Interviewer: Do you use a condom every time you have sex? Moonlight: No. Not all the time. Interviewer: Why? Moonlight:’Cos it makes a guy feel kind of underpowered, and he feels like he is not in control. Interviewer: So, you say you are doing it for the guy, and not for yourself? Moonlight: To a certain extent.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>By organizing sexual activity in a way that made her male partner feel powerful and dominant, Moonlight reproduced the ideals of hegemonic masculinity. By ‘doing it for the guy’ she constructed a ‘sexually appropriate’ identity which was in keeping with heteronormative power relations.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363460711433754">Khau (2009)</xref> provides insight into ‘being African girl’ in Lesotho, a country which is nestled among the provinces of South Africa. She documents memories of several Basotho women, who are an ethnic group in Lesotho. These women recalled performing ‘normalized Basotho girlhood’ by using their thumbs and index fingers to elongate their inner labia. The enlarged labia partially blocked the passage to the vagina and retained body heat. The girls were told that this heat, together with the enlargened external genitalia, would enable their husbands to experience heightened sexual pleasure. They were not told that the clitoris retracted into enlarged labial folds and decreased their own sexual pleasure. Khau’s study shows the extreme measures, like genital modification, which some African girls engage in, in order to satisfy their male partner’s sexual needs. These women practised the custom of labial elongation ‘for the guy’.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363460711433754">Lorber (2003</xref>: 100–101), gender inequality involves the devaluation of women and the social domination of men, and this is embedded in social history. She explains that the moral imperatives of religion and cultural representations establish and maintain the boundary lines among genders and ensures that what is demanded, what is permitted and what is disallowed for people in each gender is known and followed by most.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1363460711433754"><title>Moments of rupture</title>
<p>Moonlight offered a contradictory stance on power relations when she asserted that young men are more complicit in the spread of HIV as compared to young women. She angrily indicated that young men ‘overpower’ and coerce young women into sexual activity, and concluded by saying: ‘I wish we (girls) can show those bastards (men) who is the boss in the relationship.’ She wanted men to experience power and control when it concerned decision-making about condom use; however in her views about HIV prevention strategies, she privileged her own yearning for power and control. She rejected the notion of female subordination by wanting to be ‘the boss’ in sexual relationships.</p>
<p>Moonlight insisted on speaking her anger at men, whom she perceived as being more culpable in the spread of HIV and AIDS. She refused to silence the intensity of her emotions by referring to men using offensive language, and in doing so, she ‘troubles the normative bounds of femininity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363460711433754">Renold and Ringrose, 2008</xref>: 347), as is evident in the following excerpt:<disp-quote>
<p>Interviewer: What do you think when you see a young man carrying a condom?</p>
<p>Moonlight: He’s a bastard because maybe he might try to force a girl – an innocent girl – into having sex with him.</p>
<p>Interviewer: What do you think when you see a young woman carrying a condom?</p>
<p>Moonlight: She’s one of my own. ‘Cos she’s a playa, a playa!</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Moonlight’s perception of condom-carrying men as potential rapists can be understood because South Africa has been shown to be the HIV and AIDS as well as the rape capital of the world. The high incidence of rape (with children, girls, learners at schools, girlfriends, ex-girlfriends and wives) is associated with ‘dominant patriarchal ideology’, which encourages men to believe that they are sexually entitled to women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363460711433754">Jewkes et al., 2005</xref>: 1809; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363460711433754">Jewkes et al., 2009</xref>). Rape is used as an act of punishment, as well as a means of communicating powerfulness and its association with masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363460711433754">Jewkes et al., 2005</xref>). In a survey conducted by the South African Medical Research Council (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363460711433754">Jewkes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363460711433754">Ubuntu now, 2010</xref>), one in four men disclosed that they had committed rape. Gang rape is considered a fun activity and is referred to as ‘jackrolling’ by several young South African men. Intersecting hierarchies of gender, age and class, in African cultures, where ‘desiring girls sexually is normal’, where girls believe that if they ‘stimulate men’s sexual desires’ by wearing pants then ‘ … if they rape me, I can’t blame them’, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363460711433754">Jewkes et al., 2005</xref>: 1812–1813), deepen girls’ vulnerability to sexual assault and HIV and AIDS.</p>
<p>Moonlight reveals spaces for radical dissent, which shatters regulative contexts (sexual passivity, being sexually naïve/ignorant) through which girls are expected to live their lives. Moonlight welcomed the notion of girls having multiple sexual partners (being players), but reinscribed hegemonic gendered and sexual scripts when she viewed a condom-carrying girl as one who had many sexual partners. She did not pathologize such a girl; on the contrary, she showed admiration for the girl, thereby engaging in what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363460711433754">Butler (2006</xref>: 532) refers to as ‘mobilizing the rules differently’. Moonlight claimed that her boyfriend’s popularity with other girls was not offensive to her because: ‘I can be a playa and one can get played by one’.</p>
<p>Moonlight believed that she could express her femininity by being a ‘playa’ and that this was not the exclusive prerogative of her male partner. She added that she had misled her boyfriend into believing that she was a virgin. Moonlight did not inscribe the discourse of prized feminine virginity to be ‘gifted’ to the ‘right’ man. She chose personally not to subscribe to the centrality of virgin to the constitution of valorized heterosexual femininities, although she indulged her male partner by convincing him that she was on the ‘correct’ side of the virgin/whore binary. Deceit, on her part, may be viewed as an unacceptable way of being girl, but what is clear is that youthful femininity is an impossible space to occupy. How does a girl engage with the double standard virgin/whore dichotomy, which demands that she guard her sexual reputation by remaining a virgin and simultaneously, comply with her boyfriend’s requests for sexual intercourse?</p>
<p>In the contemporary South African context, girls’ virginity has re-emerged as a major political, social, cultural and religious issue. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363460711433754">Kendall (1998)</xref>, interviewed Zulu girls who stated that they were taught to insist on <italic>ukusoma</italic> (‘thigh sex’) even when a boy wanted penetrative sex, to be responsible for their virginity, and simultaneously, to comply with the cultural expectation to obey and accede to men’s or boys’ requests.</p>
<p>On ‘proving one’s virginity’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363460711433754">Harrison (2008</xref>: 184) found that boys valued girls who were virgins. Boys, however, insisted on engaging in penetrative sex in order to verify the virgin-status of their girlfriends. Harrison highlights the ‘paradoxical nature of this practice’, whereby a young woman would lose her valued status as a virgin in the process of ‘proving’ virginity.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1363460711433754">Youdell (2005)</xref> sheds light on the ‘impossibly’ contradictory positions of being sexually knowledgeable and responsible, alongside being sexually passive and naïve, which girls are expected to perform. This is clearly illustrated by the excerpt from the interview with Kurti.<disp-quote>
<p>Interviewer: What do you think when you see a young man carrying a condom?</p>
<p>Kurti: [He is] Prepared for sex.</p>
<p>Interviewer: What do you think when you see a young girl carrying a condom?</p>
<p>Kurti: [She is] Very prepared [for sex]. No, actually, desperate for sex.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Initially, Kurti praised the girl for being prepared, and responsible about sexual decision-making (decision to carry a condom). Then Kurti felt pressured by the moral imperative for a ‘non-contradictory subjectivity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1363460711433754">Walkerdine, 1990</xref>) and she slipped back into the regulative dominant male discourse, where only the condom-carrying man is viewed in a positive light for being sexually responsible, while the condom-carrying girl is viewed as being ‘desperate for sex’. She displayed what Tamboukou (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363460711433754">Renold and Ringrose, 2008</xref>) refers to as ‘moments of rupture’, when she engaged in minor ruptures of discourse of normative rules which govern the heterosexual matrix which is quickly recuperated. Evidence of rapid reterritorialization ‘in ways that recoup heteronormative power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363460711433754">Renold and Ringrose, 2008</xref>: 341) bring to mind theories of sexual difference, which conceptualize masculine and feminine in binary terms, where feminine is the negative of and opposite to the positive masculine.</p>
<p>Contradictory views can easily be pathologized as being schizophrenic. Contradictions in girls’ account of issues about sexuality probably stem from their desire not to be hostage to gender socialization as a fixed static; not to collude with the restabilization of gender and social norms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363460711433754">Renold and Ringrose (2008</xref>: 351) contend that by navigating the schizoid subjectivity, ‘critical ruptures to the normative discourses of being girl’ are made possible. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363460711433754">Tamboukou (2004</xref>: 5) refers to these as ‘narrative lines of flight’ which may be used to escape constrained identity boundaries of ‘being girl’. Butler, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363460711433754">Renold and Ringrose (2008</xref>: 340) asserts that ‘schizoid subjectivity’ creates an avenue of resistance to gender normative practices.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1363460711433754"><title>Sustained lines of flight</title>
<p>Bhana et al., in conceptualizing theories of sexualities in Southern Africa, explain that men are constructed as having large numbers of sexual partners, while women are viewed as ‘passive recipients of sex and sexuality’ (2007: 134). Celebration of male sexual prowess through the engagement in sexual intercourse with multiple partners, contributes to the hypersexualized African masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363460711433754">Hunter in Bhana et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, each of the respondents broke the barriers of these established notions of sexuality by indicating that they had many sexual partners. These girls did not reflect traditional gendered positioning of young African women, who <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363460711433754">Bhana et al. (2007)</xref> describe as vulnerable, powerless in determining who to have sex with, and unable to negotiate sex and sexuality. This work revealed how the interviewees, Eliza and Moonlight, became bored with one sexual partner, and sought others. The following excerpts reveal that these girls construct their femininity by engaging with multiple sexual partners:<disp-quote>
<p>Interviewer: How often do you do it (have sex)?</p>
<p>Eliza: Meaning in a day, a week, a month?</p>
<p>Interviewer: A week.</p>
<p>Eliza: Maybe four or five.</p>
<p>Interviewer: And, are these different boys?</p>
<p>Eliza: Obviously, yes.</p>
<p>Interviewer: Do you know their names?</p>
<p>Eliza: Some of them I do, some of them I don’t.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Love, trust, virginity and marriage are among the central constructs of traditional ways of being girl. The girls in this study, however, did not allude to these constructs; on the contrary, their emotional investment into sexual relationships was minimized to the point of them not being able identify their partners by name.</p>
<p>Eliza shared her bisexual experiences when she asserted ‘I have been around the world with boys and I thought, maybe it’s time to change and I got sexually involved with girls’. She did not limit her ‘feminine desire in the service of and enslaved to the phallus’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363460711433754">Renold and Ringrose, 2008</xref>: 338). She actively ruptured the phallogocentric element of the heterosexual matrix. She refused to practice heteronormative femininity and in so doing, destabilized the fixed gender order. Eliza was uninhibited by the possibility of stigmatization which usually accompanies biphobic (term used to comprehend discrimination and marginalization which is peculiar to bisexuals) and promiscuity discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363460711433754">Klesse, 2007</xref>), probably because she was speaking to a co-researcher who was a girl, like herself.</p>
<p>Eliza referred to herself as ‘the superbitch of the millennium’; she revealed sustained lines of flight by breaking from normative expectation by positioning herself as a bitch/slut. She chose not to view the positioning of ‘bitch’ as part of a negatively classed discourse. Instead she felt powerful by engaging in the ‘bitch performance’. Her investment in the bitch performance granted her the power to rupture the regulation of universal narratives about pathological descriptors of girls. She did not resist the performance of sexual aggression, and in this way, she disrupted hypersexual normative femininity. By not resisting the ‘bitch stigma’ she inadvertently did not subject girl sexuality as something to be controlled by men’s desire.</p>
<p>Patsy demonized young men who did not use condoms by calling all boys ‘bastards, perverts and dogs’ because she accused them of spreading HIV and AIDS through unprotected sex. However, she indicated that she did not request condom use by her male partner because it dulled her sexual pleasure. The following excerpt reveals her views:<disp-quote>
<p>Interviewer: What are your views about using condoms during sexual intercourse?</p>
<p>Patsy: I don’t like it. It’s not very comfortable. It’s better skin on skin.</p>
<p>Interviewer: How many sexual partners have you had?</p>
<p>Patsy: I will say about five.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>She did not view her role in transmitting diseases by employing unsafe sexual strategies as problematic; her views reflected risk-taking as an aspect of female sexuality, and not a solely masculine trait. Patsy troubled the supposedly fixed boundaries of ‘normal’ femininity. Eliza’s sexual desires centred around neither male pleasure nor patrilineal procreation. When asked what she would do if she became pregnant, Eliza asserted that she would ‘obviously have an abortion’ because she did not need a baby. Unprotected sex, for her, was an avenue for ‘fun, and fun and fun’.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1363460711433754"><title>From hypersexual to hyper-hedonism</title>
<p>The girls in this study went beyond projecting hyperfemininity, and were largely driven by hedonistic behaviour which was implicit in their stories of being girl. The following excerpt from the interview with Eliza bears testimony: ‘My goal is to go from one boy to another, to another, to another, until I am satisfied … What I know is I am having fun and fun and fun, Well, it makes me feel good … ’cause I had boys. Now I have girls. So I have everything.’</p>
<p>When asked to describe what her idea of a good time was, Patsy volunteered the following response:<disp-quote>
<p>Oh! Let me think about this. Like a threesome, you know, like one girl and five boys. And something in the shower. It’s like overnight, and strawberries and cream and those body pastes and just licking them up! Oh! That’s like too good!</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Patsy perceived herself as an active sexual being and destabilized the androcentric structure of heterosexual relationships by privileging her feminine desire. This type of subversion allowed her to escape (perhaps temporarily) from the ubiquitous force of the heterosexual matrix.</p>
<p>Eliza’s response to the question about why she engaged in unprotected sexual intercourse was:<disp-quote>
<p>I think let’s just enjoy it [sex]. I’m talking from experience … ooh! It’s like … Oh! My word! I can’t explain it,’cause it’s so much fun … Sexual intercourse is so much fun … You just can’t get enough … It is like eating ice cream or what … it’s fun.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The importance of the fun and pleasure aspect of sexual intercourse was highlighted by all four interviewees. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363460711433754">Butler (1999)</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1363460711433754">Youdell (2005</xref>: 253) asserts that sex and desire are deeply intertwined in prevailing discourses and that they remain fundamental to the constitution of intelligible subjects. Sex and desire are the central constituents of gender and sexuality, that is, sex, gender and sexuality are combined in complex constellations. The girls in this study privilege their own sexual desires, their self-indulgence as young women. During this process, they turn their gaze away from heteropatriarchal discourses by organizing their sexuality outside the restrictive frames of masculine domination. They focus on ways to maximize their pleasure as they traverse the impossible spaces of youthful femininity.</p>
<p>In the African context, sex, as a source of joy and pleasure for women, is not new. Tamale and Anfred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363460711433754">Anfred, 2007</xref>) studied groups of African women in Uganda and Mozambique respectively. Their findings revealed cultural practices that were aimed at enhancing sexual pleasure for women through specific practices. They found that ‘sex for enjoyment’ was not restricted to heterosexual practices, and individuals were not required to suppress same-sex desires.</p>
<p>Harrison’s study of youthful sexuality in South Africa (2008: 183) revealed that young people get together to have fun, and this may include casual sex. The isiZulu word <italic>ukujola</italic> describes these fun relationships where young men are expected to be sexually active. Young women, on the other hand, need to declare their relationship as <italic>ukuqoma</italic>, a commitment to marry, once they engage in sexual activity. For girls, casual sex is inappropriate; sexual relationships are only accepted in more serious relationships.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec10-1363460711433754" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The innovative methodology illustrates how research can be designed about girls, by girls and for girls, and contributes to the area of Southern African Girlhood Studies. The methodological window granted by the co-researchers and the interviewees created a lens to view girls’ agency and resistance as they constructed their sexual identities. The complexity of girlhood is revealed as girls in this study shattered pre-established assumptions about blackness, femininity and youth. What emerged was a shifting of power in gendered sexual relationships. These girls’ views matched the more radical and modern views of young urban women. They reinscribed and subverted the hegemonic rules of the heterosexual matrix, by enacting a multiplicity of contemporary girl identities. Partial and total resistance to norms through hypersexual and hyper-hedonistic performance enabled them to ‘do girl’ differently. These findings revealed that the power relations of youthful sexuality in South Africa may be different from what powerful patriarchs may want to believe. Despite the pressure for girls to ‘go back to their culture’, and the consequences of being marginalized if they did not comply, these girls expressed ideals of sexual pleasure and power, ideals that reflected the notions of urban youth through continual self-reflection. The girls in this study demanded to be in control of their sexuality, as opposed to being subjected to control of their sexuality by adults and other figures of authority through ‘retraditionalization’. Current strategies that restrict sexuality and reinscribe gender inequalities, which are underpinned by fear of consequences of non-compliance, need to be replaced by a positive discourse about youthful sexuality.</p></sec>
