<abstract>
<p>Data on adolescent reproductive health (ARH) are required to inform evidence-based policies and programs. The reports of national-level household surveys such as the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) are important sources of such data in developing countries. The aim of this study was to map data on ARH from DHS and MICS reports from selected countries in the Asia and Pacific regions. The DHS and MICS reports for Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Vanuatu, and Vietnam were reviewed. Data on 128 indicators, including ARH outcomes, outcomes for babies of adolescent mothers, and adolescents’ access to health information and services, were mapped. Available data are limited because of the omission of cohorts such as young adolescents (10-14 years old) and, in many surveys, unmarried women; the omission of important indicators; and failure to report data disaggregated by age. DHS and MICS reports have limited capacity to inform policy and programs to improve ARH. A review of DHS and MICS sampling strategies and reporting templates, and a consideration of alternative data collection strategies, are warranted.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adolescence (10 to 19 years old)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539511417423">1</xref></sup> is a time of rapid physical, psychosocial, and emotional development. For the 1.2 billion adolescents globally, it is a unique period characterized not only by the increasing physical capacity to be sexually active and conceive a child but also by less than fully developed cognitive and psychosocial capacity to assess the unintended consequences of sexual activity and negotiate safe and consensual sex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539511417423">2</xref></sup> The developmental influences on sexual decision making are, for many adolescents, complicated by challenges such as poverty, gender inequity, early marriage, low educational attainment, limited employment opportunities, and sociocultural and regulatory barriers to accessing reproductive health information and services. This combination of factors increases adolescent pregnancies while creating barriers to care-seeking behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539511417423">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Pregnancy has significant implications for adolescents. Girls aged 15 to 19 years are twice as likely to die from pregnancy-related causes as women in their 20s; girls aged 10 to 14 years are 5 times more likely to die.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539511417423">4</xref></sup> Globally, maternal mortality is the most common cause of death among adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539511417423">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539511417423">5</xref></sup> This excess mortality is likely because of a combination of biological factors, poorer access to antenatal, delivery and postnatal care, and more frequent recourse to unsafe abortion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539511417423">4</xref></sup> Babies born to adolescent girls are also at a higher risk of death than babies of adult women, with neonatal mortality 50% higher in the first week and 50% to 100% higher during the first month of life. Higher rates of preterm birth, complicated delivery, and low birth weight, as well as lower access to contraception for birth spacing, skilled attendance at birth and postnatal care are likely contributing factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539511417423">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Early pregnancy also adds to the socioeconomic burden of individual girls, their families, and communities. In much of Asia and the Pacific, adolescents girls are expected to leave school on becoming pregnant, or they leave school to marry and become pregnant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539511417423">6</xref></sup> Lower educational attainment is associated with poorer health outcomes for girls and their children, increases women’s dependence on their husbands and families, and exacerbates gender inequities in their communities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539511417423">3</xref></sup> Leaving school also limits a girl’s livelihood opportunities, which reinforces her own cycle of poverty and lessens the productivity of her community.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539511417423">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 5 commits the international community to reduce the maternal mortality ratio (MMR, the ratio of maternal deaths per 100 000 live births) by three quarters between 1990 and 2015, and ensure universal access to reproductive health by 2015.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539511417423">7</xref></sup> Interventions required to achieve these targets include access to family planning, quality antenatal and postnatal care, skilled attendance at birth, and safe abortion and postabortion care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539511417423">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539511417423">8</xref></sup> However, adolescents experience unique barriers to accessing reproductive health information and care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539511417423">9</xref></sup> and are unlikely to benefit from reproductive health interventions targeted at the overall population. Policy and programs that target adolescents are therefore vital.</p>
<p>Developing evidence-based policies and programs targeted at adolescents requires data regarding their reproductive health outcomes, health-risk and protective behaviors, and access to and utilization of health information and services. In most developing countries, policy makers and program designers rely on data collected by 2 national-level household surveys: the <italic>Demographic and Health Survey</italic> (DHS) supported by USAID and UNICEF’s <italic>Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey</italic> (MICS). Both DHS and MICS report reproductive health indicators relevant to monitoring progress toward MDG 5 and have gained reputations for being accurate and representative.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539511417423">10</xref></sup> However, the extent to which they are able to inform evidence-based reproductive health policy and programs targeted at adolescents has not previously been determined.</p>
<p>This review aims to map the available DHS and MICS data in 9 countries in Asia and the Pacific to assess whether these surveys report reproductive health outcomes for adolescents, outcomes for the babies of adolescent mothers, and adolescents’ access to health information and services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1010539511417423" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Nine countries were chosen for the review: Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Philippines, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Vanuatu, and Vietnam. The inclusion of countries with different rates of progress toward MDG 5,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539511417423">7</xref></sup> variable sociocultural and economic contexts, and different methodologies for conducting household surveys was intended to maximize the breadth of the findings.</p>
<p>Information about health outcomes and access to health information and services can be conveyed through a wide variety of indicators. For this reason, 128 indicators that could potentially inform comprehensive evidence-based reproductive health policies and programs for adolescents were selected following informal consultations with policy makers and health professionals working in adolescent reproductive health in Asia and the Pacific. The indicators were not intended to represent a minimum data set for adolescent reproductive health but to maximize the capacity of the review to identify relevant data. As shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1010539511417423">Figure 1</xref>, the indicators were divided into four categories: sexual and reproductive health, maternal health, neonatal health, and access to reproductive health information and services. Standard definitions for each indicator were developed, and a standard format (proportion, rate, or ratio) determined. Where appropriate, data were sought for both females and males.</p>

Available data for each indicator were entered into a purpose-built Access database and disaggregated by age, gender, marital status, geography (urban/rural), wealth quintile, and education level. All data entered into the Access database were exported into Excel and mapped by country and by indicator to develop a picture of the data available for each country and the extent to which data are disaggregated by age and other social determinants of health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1010539511417423" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The sampling strategies adopted by DHS and MICS in the 9 countries reviewed limit the information available about adolescents. Neither DHS nor MICS in any of the 9 countries routinely collect data from very young adolescents aged 10 to 14 years.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1010539511417423">*</xref> Never-married women are excluded from DHS surveys in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam, and never-married men are excluded from DHS surveys in Bangladesh and Timor-Leste. Furthermore, in Bangladesh and Vietnam, questions relating to contraception are asked only of currently married females. Disaggregation of data by marital status, urban/rural location, wealth quintile, and education level is only reported for the overall 15- to 49-year age group; the one exception being age-specific fertility, which DHS disaggregates by urban/rural location.</p>
<p>Data are available from at least one country for 90 of the 128 indicators (70.3%). However, there are only 8 indicators (6.3%) for which data are available for all 9 countries, highlighting significant variation in content between surveys (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1010539511417423">Table 1</xref>). For 38 indicators, there are no data available for any of the countries, and there are no indicators for which data are available through MICS but not DHS. The 38 indicators not collected by either DHS or MICS are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1010539511417423">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Data disaggregated by age are limited.

<sec id="section4-1010539511417423" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This review reveals that national level household surveys commonly relied on to inform the development of evidence-based policy and programs to improve adolescent reproductive and maternal health have limited capacity to provide this information. Three specific limitations are highlighted by this review.</p>
<sec id="section5-1010539511417423">
<title>Omission of Important Cohorts</title>
<p>The first relates to the sampling strategy chosen by DHS and MICS, particularly the omission of adolescents aged 10 to 14 years, the exclusion of unmarried women from many DHS, and the failure of all MICS and many DHS to sample males. Reasons for these omissions are likely to be historical, sociocultural, and logistic. Very young adolescents and unmarried women are often assumed not to be sexually active and therefore not relevant to reproductive health policies and programs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539511417423">24</xref></sup> Choosing to collect data from these groups may therefore be perceived as condoning behaviors that are not culturally acceptable. Concerns are also raised that premarital sexual behavior for girls is so stigmatized that obtaining accurate information from very young adolescents or unmarried women would be very difficult and that the sample size required to draw statistically significant conclusions would therefore be prohibitively large.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539511417423">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although valid concerns, they do not outweigh the benefits of having this information collected. It is clear that marriage prior to 15 years remains common in the region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539511417423">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539511417423">25</xref></sup> and that rates of premarital sexual activity are increasing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539511417423">20</xref></sup> It is likely that sexually active adolescents face sociocultural and structural barriers to accessing reproductive health information and services. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that providing young adolescents with the skills to negotiate safe sexual and reproductive behaviors, especially prior to the commencement of sexual activity, has protective health effects throughout their lifetime.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539511417423">25</xref></sup> As such interventions will be effective only if based on comprehensive information, the development of methodologies that enable data for all adolescents to be collected while minimizing potential risks should be prioritized by donors, governments, and technical agencies supporting the creation of survey tools.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539511417423">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539511417423">24</xref></sup> This is consistent with the recent recommendation by the New Zealand Parliamentarians’ Group on Population and Development that data collection in the Pacific should be widened to include 10- to 14-year-olds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539511417423">26</xref></sup> A review of the purpose of DHS and MICS surveys, and cost effectiveness studies to determine whether or not they are the most appropriate mechanisms through which such data should be collected, for example, through the development of specific modules, are therefore warranted.</p>
<p>Reproductive health is often considered to be “women’s business” and not of importance to males.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1010539511417423">27</xref></sup> Yet boys and men, irrespective of their marital status, have their own reproductive health needs, and their knowledge and attitudes may be important determinants of women’s reproductive health and whether women are able to access reproductive health care. Lack of data about these issues is a missed opportunity to create an evidence base for supporting women and men to share responsibility for reproductive health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1010539511417423">27</xref></sup> The collection and reporting of male data would also enable gender comparisons to be made, helping inform policy and programs targeted specifically at either adolescent girls or boys. Once again, an evaluation of whether the scope of DHS and MICS surveys should be expanded to include more comprehensive inclusion of male data, or whether such data could better be collected through alternative mechanisms such as separate surveys or strengthening of routine health information systems, should be prioritized.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1010539511417423">
<title>Omission of Important Indicators</title>
<p>The second limitation of DHS and MICS is their failure, either entirely or in certain countries, to collect data on indicators considered important to inform evidence-based reproductive health policy and programs. Important indicators relating to reproductive health for which there are little or no data relate to direct and indirect causes of maternal mortality, prevalence and causes of morbidity during pregnancy and delivery, nutritional status prior to and during pregnancy, diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections, knowledge of reproductive health issues, and abortion. Although indicators on reproductive health knowledge and abortion are collected by some non-government organizations, these surveys cannot replace household surveys as they are rarely repeated and cannot track health outcomes over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539511417423">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The challenges in collecting data related to maternal mortality and abortion in household surveys are well recognised.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539511417423">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1010539511417423">29</xref></sup> Where facility-based births are uncommon, the causes of maternal mortality are difficult to determine and rarely known by household members. Even in facilities, limited diagnostic capacity makes distinguishing between direct and indirect causes of death a challenge. Grouping all causes of maternal death together, as occurs in both DHS and MICS, fails to provide information about whether the causes of maternal mortality in adolescents are different to those for adult women. It also risks policy makers focusing on the more easily identified direct causes of death to the exclusion of indirect causes, which may be common in adolescents and require different interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539511417423">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whether household surveys should collect data on abortion remains a vexed issue. Although unsafe abortion contributes significantly to maternal mortality, and evidence suggests that adolescents face additional barriers to accessing safe abortion where it is legal and postabortion care where it is not,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1010539511417423">29</xref></sup> there are ethical concerns about potential harms to women who report abortions in surveys. These harms include legal consequences, stigma and discrimination, and lack of referral systems for women who become distressed while completing a household survey.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1010539511417423">29</xref></sup> There is also the possibility that women will be reluctant to admit to abortions, thereby reducing the validity of survey findings.</p>
<p>These challenges are valid but not insurmountable. Countries should be supported to identify a “minimum set” of indicators necessary to inform policy and programs in line with their national health priorities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539511417423">10</xref></sup> Advocacy is required to ensure that this “minimum set” of indicators includes information relevant to adolescents that is not currently collected. A review of whether specific DHS and MICS modules are the best mechanisms for collecting data on these indicators, or whether other targeted data collection strategies focusing on, for example, health facilities providing maternal health services and postabortion care would be more appropriate, should then be conducted. For countries where collecting information on abortion in household surveys is considered inappropriate, efforts should be directed toward refining the many innovative methodologies proposed to overcome this important data gap.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1010539511417423">29</xref></sup> Work on community- and facility-based maternal mortality audits should also be prioritized to better understand the causes of adolescent maternal mortality.</p>

<sec id="section7-1010539511417423">
<title>Failure to Report Disaggregated Data</title>
<p>The third limitation of DHS and MICS reports is the lack of disaggregation of data. Despite surveys actually recording age for each respondent, data relating to nearly 30% of indicators included in the review are not age-disaggregated in the reports. Most of these indicators relate to access to and quality of care during pregnancy, including the MDG 5 indicator on the proportion of women who attend 4 antenatal care visits. These are significant omissions and advocacy is required to promote all indicators being reported age-disaggregated using 5-year intervals in order to highlight adolescent-specific issues.</p>
<p>Marital status, urban/rural location, wealth quintile, and education level are also recorded for each respondent, but are not presented in a disaggregated format. This reduces the capacity of reported data to identify at-risk groups and inform targeted policy and programs. The failure of DHS reports to disaggregate data by marital status is a particular shortcoming as, without reviewing each survey’s sampling strategy, it may not be apparent that unmarried women are not included, or that only currently married women are sampled for certain indicators. This leads to the potential for data to be misinterpreted and emphasizes the need for overall and age-specific data to be clearly disaggregated by marital status and other social determinants of health. If it is not cost effective for this to be done routinely in DHS and MICS reports, donors should consider the value of producing additional reports targeted at policy makers and programmers.</p>

<sec id="section8-1010539511417423">
<title>Useful Information on Family Planning</title>
<p>Despite these limitations, DHS and MICS provide large amounts of useful information. Of particular value are the data on contraceptive prevalence, exposure to family planning information and services, and access to general health services; all of which are collected by most countries and are reported disaggregated by age. These are of direct relevance to policy and programs aimed at promoting healthy sexual decision making, delaying first pregnancy, increasing birth spacing, and empowering young women to choose when to commence childbearing and how many children to have. Given that family planning alone can reduce approximately one third of maternal deaths,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539511417423">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1010539511417423">30</xref></sup> and that its benefits extend beyond health to the improvement of educational attainment, gender equality and livelihood opportunities,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539511417423">6</xref></sup> the collection of these data are essential for improving reproductive health outcomes for adolescents and should continue.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although DHS and MICS report data on reproductive health indicators, the limitations described in this review restrict their capacity to inform the development of evidence-based policy and programs for adolescents. The challenge now is to address these limitations so as to either increase the utility of DHS and MICS to advocate for the specific needs of adolescents, or formulate and promote alternative mechanisms for collecting the required data.</p>
