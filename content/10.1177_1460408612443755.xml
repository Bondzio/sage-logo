<abstract>
<p>Blunt trauma is a rare cause of pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm. We report a case of a pseudoaneurysm of the right pulmonary artery sustained after a high speed motor vehicle accident, identified on multidetector CT imaging of the chest. After initial resuscitation, the patient remained haemodynamically stable and surgical management, with patch repair, was undertaken 4 days after the trauma. The patient was discharged without complication and follow-up imaging revealed no residual pseudoaneurysm. This case report highlights the need to assess both the aorta and pulmonary arteries on CT of the chest for potential sites of vascular injury.</p>

<p>High-speed motor vehicle accidents are unfortunately a common occurrence in today’s society. Acute intra-thoracic arterial injury is a potentially life threatening sequelae. CT imaging is now commonplace for the investigation of patients who have suffered acute trauma. The indications for chest CT imaging after blunt trauma are an abnormal chest X-ray or severe mechanism of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408612443755">Omert et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Although acute injury of the thoracic aorta is a well recognised injury, pseudoaneurysms of the pulmonary artery after trauma are rare. There have been 15 previously reported cases – only four of which have been after blunt trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408612443755">Dillon et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408612443755">Hornaersche, 1924</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408612443755">Kasai and Kobayashi, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408612443755">Reade et al., 2006</xref>). The case report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408612443755">Reade and colleagues (2006)</xref> is the only case of pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm identified on CT at the time of initial assessment. In the remaining cases, the patients did not undergo an initial CT of the chest and were diagnosed at least 1 week after their initial trauma. We report a case of a right pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm sustained after blunt trauma and managed surgically with a patch repair.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1460408612443755" sec-type="cases"><title>Case report</title>
<p>A 60-year-old man collided with a telegraph pole while travelling at 100 km/h in his antique motor vehicle. Although he was wearing a seatbelt, the car was not fitted with airbags. While trapped at the scene (30 min), he was haemodynamically stable with a GCS of 14. Immediately after extrication from the vehicle by the emergency services, he developed rapidly progressive facial plethora, stridor, bilateral chest and neck subcutaneous emphysema with associated shortness of breath with decreased air entry throughout the right lung. A large bore cannula was inserted to relieve a presumed right-sided tension pneumothorax, followed by a pleural drain while still at the scene. He was transferred to hospital via helicopter.</p>
<p>On arrival at hospital, he was hypotensive (88/55 mmHg), tachycardic (115 beats per minute) and mildly tachypnoeic (26 respirations per minute). Dislocation of the right hip joint was evident on clinical examination. Plain film radiograph of the chest demonstrated a widened mediastinum, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema overlying both hemithoraces and the neck. Dislocation of the right hip joint was confirmed with an X-ray of the pelvis. Subcutaneous emphysema/swelling of the neck rapidly worsened on arrival in the emergency department and the patient’s voice became increasingly hoarse. He was transferred to the operating room for fibreoptic intubation and reduction of the right hip dislocation. The intubation was unsuccessful and the patient underwent an awake tracheostomy.</p>
<p>The patient was transferred to radiology for post-contrast multi-detector CT (MDCT) imaging (LightSpeed VCT – 64 slice, GE medical systems, Milwaukee, WI) of the head, chest, abdomen, pelvis and spine for further assessment due to his distracting injuries immediately after his tracheostomy. CT imaging revealed – a comminuted fracture of the larynx, a large pneumomediastinum, moderate mediastinal haematoma, moderate haemopericardium, small residual right pneumothorax despite the intercostal catheter, bilateral fractures of the right first and third ribs and fracture of the right acetabulum.</p>
<p>A pseudoaneurysm of the right pulmonary artery (RPA) was identified on review of the imaging the following day. The pseudoaneurysm measured 3 cm, involved the anterior wall of the right pulmonary artery and abutted the ascending aorta. This was best appreciated on axial and sagittal images (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1460408612443755">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1460408612443755">2</xref>). No active extravasation of contrast into the mediastinum was identified.

</fig></p>
<p>Although the MDCT imaging findings of the pseudoaneurysm were definite, the treating cardiothoracic surgical team requested formal digital subtraction angiography of the pulmonary arteries for further assessment, due to the rare nature of this injury and its proximity to the ascending aorta. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) confirmed the RPA pseudoaneurysm and excluded an aortic intimal injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1460408612443755">Figure 3</xref>).

</fig></p>
<p>The pseudoaneurysm was managed surgically 4 days after the initial trauma with a midline sternotomy and synthetic patch repair. CT of the chest 4 days after the operation demonstrated no residual pseudoaneurysm, a moderate residual mediastinal haematoma and no complicating feature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1460408612443755">Figure 4</xref>). The patient’s post operative course was uneventful. The fractures of the larynx and right acetabulum were managed conservatively. He was discharged from hospital 3 weeks after the initial injury.

<p>Pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm after traumatic injury is a rare occurrence despite the high incidence of chest trauma in today’s society. There are four previously reported cases of pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm following blunt trauma. The first case was reported from Uruguay in 1924, which was identified three months after a fall. The patient was not treated and subsequently died.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408612443755">Dillon and colleagues (1982)</xref> reported a case of a pedestrian who was struck by a car and who was haemodynamically stable at presentation. The chest X-ray demonstrated a widened mediastinum and an arch aortogram was normal. One week after the presenting injury, a pulmonary arteriogram was performed to assess for a pulmonary embolus. The arteriogram demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery and the patient underwent a thoracotomy and pneumonectomy. The patient died 3 days after the operation due to a pulmonary embolus.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408612443755">Kasai and colleagues (1992)</xref> described a patient who sustained bilateral pneumothoraces, a pneumomediastinum, and bilateral pulmonary contusions after a motor cycle accident. These diagnoses were made on chest X-ray. Three months after the initial presentation, the patient represented with haemoptysis. Pulmonary arteriogram showed bilateral upper lobe pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysms. Bilateral thoracotomies with ligation of the feeding arteries to pseudoaneurysm on the left and right upper lobectomy were performed.</p>
<p>The most recent case is by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408612443755">Reade and colleagues (2006)</xref>, who described an unrestrained passenger involved in a head-on motor vehicle accident. The chest X-ray revealed minimal widening of the superior mediastinum. CT was performed for further investigation of the mediastinum, which revealed an 18-mm pseudoaneurysm of the left superior margin of the main pulmonary artery and a small mediastinal haematoma. Subsequent pulmonary angiography also identified the pseudoaneurysm. The pseudoaneurysm was managed conservatively. Follow-up chest CT scan 3 weeks after injury showed the pseudoaneurysm had decreased in size from 18 mm to 12 mm. The considerations for non-operative management in this patient included pseudoaneurysm location, size, lack of symptomatology and interval reduction in size of the pseudoaneurysm.</p>
<p>Pseudoaneurysms form after damage to the vascular intima which causes unilateral dilation of the vessel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408612443755">Reade et al., 2006</xref>). The aneurysmal “sac” is comprised only of the outer arterial layers (such as the adventitia) or the surrounding connective tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408612443755">Savage et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The low incidence pseudoaneurysms of the pulmonary artery may be due two factors. Firstly, large pseudoaneurysms may lead to exsanguination at the scene of the trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1460408612443755">Symbas and Scott, 1963</xref>). In the case of smaller pseudoaneurysms, lower pressure in the pulmonary artery, may result in tamponade of the arterial injury by surrounding haematoma, and subsequent fibrosis. This may be sufficient to resist progressive aneurysmal dilatation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408612443755">Savage et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The formation of a pseudoaneurysm after pulmonary artery injury has been reported to occur anywhere between minutes to months after the precipitating event and carries a significant risk of rupture which may be fatal in 50% of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1460408612443755">Podbielski et al., 1997</xref>). These pseudoaneurysms may also be asymptomatic and therefore may not be diagnosed for many years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408612443755">Savage et al., 2001</xref>). The most common symptom at the time of presentation is haemoptysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408612443755">Reade et al., 2006</xref>), however, shortness of breath, chest pain, cough and hypoxia may also be the presenting complaint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1460408612443755">Podbielski et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The findings on a chest X-ray after blunt trauma that may represent an acute mediastinal haematoma and therefore an intra-thoracic vascular injury include a widened mediastinum and apical pleural “capping”. Signs of pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm on chest X-ray may include enlargement of the hilum and pulmonary nodules.</p>
<p>CT imaging of the chest at the time of injury will ensure vascular injury, both artierial and venous, is identified. The routine use of CT in this setting may also identify greater numbers of pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysms.</p>
<p>Previously, the “gold standard” for the assessment of traumatic aortic injury has been formal DSA. Several studies demonstrate that the use of multi-detector CT angiography in the setting of blunt trauma is a highly sensitive (100%) and specific (81.7–83%) modality for the diagnosis of aortic injury in comparison is DSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408612443755">Fabian et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408612443755">Melton et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>DSA is invasive and in patients with multiple injuries, confirmation of aortic or pulmonary artery injuries using DSA may delay management of other potentially life threatening injuries. New generation multi-detector CT provides excellent quality image acquisition and anatomic detail and therefore DSA may not provide any further diagnostic information.</p>
<p>There is currently no accepted management of pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysms. One case report describes non-operative management of a pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408612443755">Reade et al., 2006</xref>), while the remaining cases have been surgically managed with lobectomy/pneumonectomy, ligation of vessels, local resection and endoluminal embolisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408612443755">Block et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408612443755">de Jonge et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408612443755">Donaldson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408612443755">Savage et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1460408612443755" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Pseudoaneurysm of the pulmonary artery is a rare injury after blunt trauma. This case highlights the need for not only review of the aorta but also the pulmonary artery in blunt trauma. With the aorta and pulmonary arteries as routine “check areas” on trauma chest CT imaging in cases of blunt trauma, acute injuries of the great vessels may be diagnosed and managed acutely, thereby minimising significant potential mortality and morbidity.</p>
