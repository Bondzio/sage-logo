<abstract>
<p>Researchers are increasingly interested in the psychological and sociological processes by which college students develop competence and confidence as musicians. We surveyed 454 undergraduate music majors enrolled in one of three NASM-accredited music schools in the US. Participants completed a questionnaire that addressed beliefs about influential people and experiences, occupational roles within music, and music career commitment. Studio teachers were viewed as the strongest musician and teacher role models, studio teachers and parents had the most positive influence on pursuit of a music degree, and most performance-related activities were considered extremely important. People and experiences merged to exert influence through multiple contexts (both within and outside the music school environment), and occupational identity was multi-dimensional in nature (corresponding to different musical roles/occupations). Social influences, as well as teacher and musician identity, contributed to music career commitment prediction. We found evidence of some institutional differences and strong degree program effects, implying that decisions about which music school to attend and degree program(s) to pursue may have important consequences for socialization and occupational identity construction. We concluded that the presence of diverse but mutually supportive socialization structures may facilitate the integration of music, teacher and scholar identities among undergraduate music majors.</p>

<p>The college years are a time of intense personal development. College is often depicted as a transition ‘… from dependence to independence, from being a mere product of one’s upbringing to being a responsible individual who makes real choices, practical and philosophical, about one’s path in life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0305735610381886">Cohen, 2009</xref>, p. 8). Despite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0305735610381886">Kroger’s (2007)</xref> observation that ‘institutional contexts for late adolescents, such as the world of work or tertiary education, provide important settings for examining, exploring, developing, and later consolidating competencies and values’ (p. 109), limited research directly addresses the undergraduate experience as it relates to the socialization and occupational identity of music majors. We drew on established theories and related research conducted in Europe, Australia, Canada and the US in designing a multi-institution study of music school culture as it relates to the inner psychology of undergraduate students.</p>
<sec id="section1-0305735610381886">
<title>Theories of socialization and occupational identity</title>
<p>Socialization is the process by which an individual acquires the beliefs, values, skills and resources needed to live and participate in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0305735610381886">Handel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0305735610381886">Musolf, 2009</xref>). Important social agents (parents, siblings, peers, teachers, significant others) may work in consort or in conflict to influence the socialization process, depending on the degree to which they share goals and expectations for the individual. Many psychologists and sociologists acknowledge that socialization is a lifelong process. Separate periods of socialization however, have been delineated to help better understand the shift in influence occurring when children move to adolescence and begin to consider the possibility of new roles in society. The early period of socialization, extending from preschool through high school is commonly referred to as primary socialization. Secondary socialization occurs when people enter the workforce or enroll in higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0305735610381886">Wallace &amp; Wolf, 1999</xref>) and begin to adopt the roles and responsibilities of a smaller or more specialized group within the larger culture. It is during this period of secondary socialization that young adults learn to display actions and behaviors typical of a particular profession and begin to establish an occupational identity.</p>
<p>Many researchers exploring occupational identity have adopted a symbolic interactionist perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0305735610381886">Blumer, 1969</xref>). According to this perspective, individuals inherently seek to understand why other people act in certain ways, and based on this understanding they may or may not align their own actions with a particular role or identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0305735610381886">McCall &amp; Simmons, 2009</xref>). Symbolic interactionism – the process of interacting with and defining the actions of others – is mediated by people’s interpretations of their surroundings and the symbolic meaning derived from their experiences. This process is highly personalized in the sense that two people may draw distinct meanings about a particular occupation from the same situation or experience.</p>

<title>Socialization, identity and the music school culture</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0305735610381886">Nettl (1995)</xref> observed how social hierarchies within major music schools in the US are organized both vertically (administrators, faculty/teachers, students) and horizontally (i.e., some roles are more central or peripheral to the mission, values and image of the school, while others are more peripheral). In Nettl’s view, ‘a small and specific set of principles of social organization’ governs relationships among members of the music school culture, while class structures and social boundaries, though sometimes imprecisely defined, determine specific roles that members of each class may occupy.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Within the Music Building, the center, the people who do is largely comprised of performing faculty and student majors, and the periphery consists of those who – broadly speaking – teach without performing, ordinarily faculty and students of music education, musicology, and music theory. (p. 56)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nettl has also suggested that within the ‘center’, there may be struggles for dominance between groups of performers, as each group (vocalists; wind string or keyboard instrumentalists) may think of itself as being the most important element within a music school’s social hierarchy. The distinct social structures and status hierarchies that characterize many music schools implies that researchers must consider how social influences may vary depending on the institutional milieu, as well as one’s degree program and major applied area.</p>
<p>Several researchers have explored secondary socialization as it functions within the bounds of music school culture. There is some evidence that the culture surrounding music schools inhibits or negatively influences music teacher identity development. In studying music teacher education within Canadian universities, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735610381886">Roberts (1991)</xref> reported that music education majors often felt stigmatized by being labeled as teachers and struggled within a Faculty of Music culture that awards social status on the basis of musicianship rather than teaching expertise. As a result, students developed idealized notions of themselves as musicians or ‘musicians as teachers,’ attempted to legitimize these views among others in the culture, and did not truly adopt a music teacher identity until after the undergraduate experience had concluded and they had entered the teaching profession.</p>
<p>Similar to Roberts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0305735610381886">Bouij (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0305735610381886">2004</xref>) found that Swedish music student teachers struggled to build a musical role-identity. Cultural negotiations that surround status and influence within the university music school in Sweden resulted in students adopting role-identities that differ not only in terms of the traditional musician versus teacher distinction, but also in terms of how broadly or narrowly one defines the goals associated with making and/or teaching music. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0305735610381886">Bouij (1998)</xref> noted that many students who desired to be a performer, with time, adopted the identity of a content-centered teacher who, in many respects, emulates the performer by establishing artistic ideals, modeling musicianship, and inspiring students to become outstanding musicians.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0305735610381886">Froehlich and L’Roy (1985)</xref> investigated the occupational identity and values of undergraduate music education majors at a major university music school in the US. Regardless of the teaching specialization (band, orchestra, choir), the proportion of students choosing to be a professional performer increased from the freshman year to senior year, indicating a lessoning of commitment to music education. Froehlich and L’Roy concluded that the students in their study showed little commitment to occupational norms and values that are associated with being a music educator. Moreover, undergraduate teacher training did not appear to produce or contribute to an identity that resembled that of a professional teacher.</p>
<p>These studies by Froelich and L’Roy, Roberts, and Bouij depict areas of dissonance within the realm of identity construction. The views of students majoring in music performance or other specialties within music, however, are clearly under-represented. Moreover, the possibility that students might successfully integrate musician and teacher identities or draw on both in a complementary fashion has received little consideration. The fact that these studies were conducted in single institutions also does not allow for consideration of inter-institutional factors that may uniquely contribute to socialization and/or identity construction.</p>
<p>Recent multi-institution studies conducted by Mills and Isbell have provided some new insights and nuance as to the dynamic nature of music major socialization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0305735610381886">Mills (2004)</xref>, in a study of young conservatory students in the UK, found that most of the musicians were already experienced as instrumental teachers, expected and looked forward to engaging in instrumental teaching during their career, believed they would benefit from being trained as a teacher, and viewed being a teacher as an opportunity to improve their playing. In a related investigation of professional identity within Australian conservatory and university contexts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0305735610381886">Mills (2006)</xref>, observed that ‘it [made] little difference to an aspiring class music teacher, in terms of their experience and beliefs as an instrumental teacher, whether they are taught in the same institution as aspiring performers/composers or not’ (p. 386). Aspiring performers/composers who attended institutions that also included education students, however, were actually less enlightened in their beliefs about teaching, implying that simply being in the presence of aspiring music teachers (rather than being taught in matters of pedagogy alongside them) may not alter the beliefs of conservatory-trained performers and composers.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735610381886">Isbell (2008)</xref> found evidence of positive music school cultures that support the development of both musician identity and teacher identity. A nationwide sample of undergraduate music education majors in the US rated the influence of various people and experiences (operational facets of secondary socialization) on their decision to continue studying music education during college. Virtually all people were viewed as having a positive influence, including ensemble directors, private studio instructors, and music school peers outside of music education. Similarly, experiences related to performing music and taking lessons had just as positive, if not more positive, an influence on music education study as teaching-related experiences. Overall, secondary socialization influence was significantly related to both teacher identity and musician identity.</p>
<p>Collectively, these studies of secondary socialization and occupational identity point to the possibility of cultural differences enveloping music schools, thereby mediating social interactions among undergraduate music majors (who may be pursuing varied career paths and adopting different identities) and music faculty (who, as role models, often assume a prominent position in the social milieu). In music schools, applied faculty are typically the primary musician role model and the relationship music students have with their applied music instructor takes on a special place of importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735610381886">Isbell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735610381886">Roberts, 1991</xref>). There is less clarity, however, as to which music faculty members serve as teacher role models. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735610381886">Isbell (2008)</xref>, for example, found that music students identified music education faculty, applied studio faculty, and ensemble conductors as teacher role models, depending on the school context. Additional research is needed to clarify how people and experiences function as part of the socialization process endemic to music schools, how occupational identity might best be conceptualized given the diverse career goals that music majors may adopt, and whether socialization and occupational identity are connected to important psychological constructs or education outcomes such as persistence and career commitment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0305735610381886">Sinclair, 2008</xref>, for a review of factors related to teaching career commitment).</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine secondary socialization and occupational identity among music majors enrolled in one of three NASM-accredited music schools in the US. The following research questions were considered:</p>
<list id="list1-0305735610381886" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Who do music majors identify as their strongest musician and teacher role models, and which day-to-day activities do music majors consider most important?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Are there conceptual dimensions that underlie music major beliefs about secondary socialization influences and, if so, do those dimensions mirror or differ from common a priori classifications (people, experiences)?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Are there conceptual dimensions that underlie music major beliefs about occupational identity and, if so, do those dimensions mirror or differ from the self–other framework posited by symbolic interactionism theory.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Do secondary socialization influences and occupational identity vary on the basis of music school attended, student gender, major applied area, degree program, or class standing?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Do secondary socialization influences and occupational identity predict music career commitment?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Most related research has involved the use of descriptive or qualitative methodologies to study small samples of music majors in single institutions and has focused exclusively on music education majors. Our investigation is important in the sense that we collected data from a large and diverse sample of music majors attending different types of music schools, employed psychometrically sound multi-item measures to assess a range of psycho-social factors, and used sophisticated analyses to explore underlying constructs and relationships.</p>

<title>Data source, measures and method</title>
<p>Undergraduate music majors from three university-affiliated music schools participated in the study. The music schools differ with respect to several characteristics, including geographic location, total undergraduate enrolment in music, the mix of music degree programs offered, and the ratio of music performance majors to music education majors.</p>
<p>Music School A, situated in the Western US, operates as an autonomous college within a public, doctoral degree-granting university with very high research activity. It has an enrolment of 285 undergraduate majors and offers professional degrees in music performance (Bachelor of Music) and music education (Bachelor of Music Education) along with a liberal arts degree in music (Bachelor of Arts) at the undergraduate level. There is a 2:1 ratio of performance to education majors.</p>
<p>Music School B, which is located in the Southern US, operates as a department of music within a college of arts and sciences at a public, doctoral degree-granting university with high research activity. There are 238 undergraduate majors with a 1:2 ratio of performance to education majors. The School offers professional degrees in music performance and music education (both with the designation Bachelor of Music) and a liberal arts degree in music (Bachelor of Arts).</p>
<p>Music School C, which is located in the Eastern US, is an autonomous school within a private college that primarily awards undergraduate degrees along with some masters degrees and which has limited research activity. There are 469 undergraduate majors in the School with a 1:1 ratio of performance to education majors. The School offers a liberal arts degree in music (Bachelor of Arts) along with professional degrees in music performance and music education (both with the designation Bachelor of Music) at the undergraduate level.</p>
<p>The survey sample (454 music majors out of a combined population of 992, margin of error = +/− 3.4%) was highly representative of the combined music major population with respect to student gender (46% males, 54% females), major applied area (27% woodwinds, 28% brass and percussion, 14% strings, 6% piano, 25% voice), degree program (32% music performance, 37% music education, 16% music performance and education combined, 15% liberal arts or other specialized degrees), and class standing (37% freshmen, 25% sophomores, 19% juniors, 19% seniors). All participants completed a 115-item survey instrument, the Undergraduate Music Major Questionnaire (UMMQ).</p>
<p>A pool of sample items for the UMMQ was drawn from established measures developed by other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0305735610381886">Borich &amp; Tombari, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0305735610381886">Broyles, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0305735610381886">Cox, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735610381886">Isbell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0305735610381886">L’Roy, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0305735610381886">Schonauer, 2002</xref>). Our goal, in adapting items, was to further enhance the reliability and construct validity of measures representing various socialization and identity-related beliefs. We followed the recommendations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0305735610381886">Burke and Tully (1977)</xref> by incorporating the multidimensional character of key variables (for example, musician and teacher facets of occupational identity) into the questionnaire, using multi-item ratings scales to adequately capture underlying dimensions, establishing precisely defined scale points so as to bring clarity and meaning to quantitative scores, and employing multivariate data analyses as a means of clarifying relationships among key constructs and other variables. In the final version of the questionnaire, a total of two items (10 responses) address musician and teacher role models, two items (23 responses) address the influence of people and experiences, two items (26 responses) address occupational identity, one item (12 responses) addresses the importance of various musical, educational and social activities, and one item (12 responses) addresses career commitment. Five additional items solicit demographic information (gender, major instrument/voice, degree program, class standing).</p>
<p>Secondary socialization was assessed by asking participants to identify their strongest musician and teacher role models during college, and then rate the direction and magnitude of influence (using 5-point bipolar scales where 1 = very negative, 2 = negative influence, 3 = no influence, 4 = positive influence and 5 = very positive influence) that specific people and experiences have had on their decision to continue studying music. To measure occupational identity, participants indicated the degree (using 6-point Likert-type scales where 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = somewhat disagree, 4 = somewhat agree, 5 = agree, 6 = strongly agree) to which they see themselves assuming varied music identities/roles (e.g., teacher, musician, conductor, composer, scholar, entrepreneur, entertainer), as well as the degree to which they believe most other people see them assuming such identities/roles. As an extension of occupational identity, participants also rated the amount of importance (5-point rating scale where 1 = not important, 2 = somewhat important, 3 = moderately important, 4 = very important, 5 = extremely important) they attach to various activities, goals or outcomes. Career commitment was assessed by having participants report the extent to which they agree or disagree (6-point Likert-type scale) with positively-phrased (e.g., I am fully committed to a career in music) and negatively phrased (e.g., I worry a lot about being a musician) statements about being a musician or making a career out of music.</p>
<p>The UMMQ was administered to participants at each institution during regularly scheduled classes or convocations in late September through mid-October. To maximize the truthfulness, accuracy, and completeness of participant responses and minimize the risk of social desirability bias (i.e., students worrying that music faculty might review and/or recognize their responses), the researchers or their research assistants distributed the questionnaires, reviewed ethical guidelines, addressed questions about instructions and/or item response formats, and placed completed questionnaires in sealed envelopes for collection prior to data coding and analysis.</p>
<p>As part of a preliminary data screening procedure, 13 questionnaires were eliminated because of extensive or systematic missing data (i.e., responses missing for entire sections of the questionnaire). Random missing values were evident for 324 data points. While this represented less than 1% of all data, we anticipated that the number of cases and variables affected might negatively impact the results of multivariate analyses. Therefore, data missing at random were substituted with estimated values based on a regression method of data imputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0305735610381886">Meyers, Gamst, &amp; Guarino, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Descriptive analysis</title>
<p>Almost one out of two music majors (48%) identified the studio teacher as their strongest musician role model. Other important musician role models frequently identified include music major peers (14%), former high school music teachers (12%), community/professional musicians 12%), and college ensemble directors (8%). The studio music teacher also was most often identified (by 48% of participants) as the strongest teacher role model. Ensemble directors (13%), former high school music teachers (12%), music education professors (11%), and music professors in academic areas such as theory and history (6%) were other commonly identified teacher role models. Music education majors’ responses differed somewhat from those of other music majors in that they more often identified high school music teachers and college ensemble directors as musician role models, and music education faculty as teacher role models. Nonetheless, studio teachers were the role model of choice, regardless of degree program.</p>
<p>Participants reported that the vast majority of people and experiences (constituting secondary socialization) exerted a somewhat positive or very positive influence on their decision to continue majoring in music (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0305735610381886">Table 1</xref>). Applied studio teachers and parents were considered the most positively influential people, while taking lessons and performing in ensembles were viewed as the most positively influential experiences. College faculty and academic classes outside of music, as well as teaching-related experiences, were viewed as having a negligibly positive influence.</p>

<p>As an extension of occupational identity, music majors were asked to rate the importance of varied activities and goals. On average, music majors viewed learning more about music, doing well in lessons and studio classes, and practicing their major instrument/voice as extremely important activities (M &gt; 4.5). Winning major auditions was considered only a moderately important activity or goal (M &lt; 3.5). All other activities/goals were seen as being very important.</p>

<title>Factor analysis</title>
<p>Factor analysis is a statistical technique used to test theoretical constructs, develop research measures, and otherwise organize, conceptualize or reduce empirical data into coherent structures or variates – weighted combinations of variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0305735610381886">Meyers, Gamst, &amp; Guarino, 2006</xref>). We used exploratory factor analysis (principal axis factoring with promax rotation) to assess the dimensionality of secondary socialization and occupational identity in relation to established theories, and to determine the reliability and construct validity of our measures. A five-factor solution accounted for 51% of the variance in secondary socialization. Factors (combinations of people and experiences) represented different contexts in which secondary socialization may be situated (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735610381886">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The Music Classroom (Factor 1) encompasses music faculty influence (other than that of applied studio teachers) and peer music student influence, as well as experiences germane to academic and ensemble classes in music. The Applied Studio (Factor 2) includes the influence of applied teachers as well as the experience of taking lessons and auditions. The Performance Hall (Factor 3) reflects attendance at or participation in major music school performance events. The Teaching Laboratory (Factor 4) involves teaching- or leadership-related activities that may occur within or outside of the music school environment. Influences typically associated with people and experiences outside of the music school environment comprise the Campus/Community context (Factor 5). Inter-factor correlations ranged from .12 (applied studio and teaching laboratory) to .45 (teaching laboratory and campus/community context) with a median coefficient of .30. Subscale scores (responses averaged across items associated with each factor) yielded reliability coefficients (α = .64 to .71) acceptable for exploratory research involving psychological constructs.</p>
<p>The factor analysis of music major responses to the 26 occupational identity items produced a four-factor solution that accounted for 67% of the variance in occupational identity (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0305735610381886">Table 3</xref>). The four factors, which reflect a merger of self- and other-perceptions rather than a separation of the two, were interpreted as corresponding to Teacher Identity (Factor 1), Musician Identity (Factor 2), Conductor/Composer Identity (Factor 3), and Entrepreneur/Entertainer Identity (Factor 4). Music scholar items did not load sufficiently on any of the factors. Teacher Identity and Conductor/Composer Identity factors were moderately correlated (.60); all other inter-factor correlations were below |.27|. Occupational identity subscale scores representing each factor were highly reliable (α = .96 for Factor 1, .82 for Factor 2, .86 for Factor 3, and .80 for Factor 4).</p>

<title>Multivariate analysis</title>
<p>Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to determine whether the institution attended and individual difference variables (gender, major applied area, degree program, class standing) nested within each institution had an effect on secondary socialization and occupational identity. Because of our sample size, the number of related subscales constituting the dependent variable sets, and the number of follow-up univariate and post-hoc tests required, we established a more conservative statistical significance level of .01 and also considered effect size estimates (partial η2) as a matter of practical significance.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section8-0305735610381886">
<title>Between-institutions analysis</title>
<p>For the multivariate analyses of secondary socialization and occupational identity, we began by examining institutional effects. Institution (music school attended) served as the grouping variable; the five facets of socialization (music classroom, applied studio, performance hall, teaching laboratory, campus/community) constituted the dependent variable set for one MANOVA, while the four facets of identity (teacher, musician, conductor/composer, entertainer/entrepreneur) were the dependent variables for a second MANOVA. Assumptions related to sample size and normality, homogeneity of variance (Levene’s test), homoscedasticity (Box’s M test), and sphericity (Bartlett’s test) were met.</p>
<p>Significant multivariate institution effects emerged for both secondary socialization (∧ = .910, p &lt; .001) and occupational identity (∧ = .863, p &lt; .001). Follow-up univariate ANOVAs were conducted for each dependent variable separately to determine the nature of the multivariate effects. For secondary socialization, significant institutional differences were evident for influence associated with the music classroom (F = 13.651, p &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .057), applied studio (F = 5.800, p = .003, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .025), and performance hall (F = 5.333, p = .005, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .023). Post-hoc Scheffé tests revealed that students attending Music School C (1:1 ratio of performance to education majors) reported significantly more positive music classroom influence than students attending Music School A (2:1 ratio of performance to education majors), and significantly more positive applied studio and performance hall influence than students attending Music School B (1:2 ratio of performance to education majors).</p>
<p>Univariate ANOVAs for occupational identity provided evidence of significant institutional differences in teacher identity (F = 16.319, p &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .070) and conductor/composer identity (F = 10.212, p &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .045). Students attending Music School C (1:1 ratio of performance to education majors) and Music School B (1:2 ratio of performance to education majors) expressed stronger teacher identities than students attending Music School A (2:1 ratio of performance to education majors), and students attending Music School B expressed stronger conductor/composer identities than students attending Music School A. There were no significant differences in musician or entertainer/entrepreneur identity across institutions.</p>
<p>The between-institutions analysis implies that socialization and identity development may function least constructively for students attending Music School A (which has a preponderance of music performance majors) and most constructively for students attending Music School C (where the number of music education majors equals the number of performance majors). Effect sizes associated with significant institutional differences for secondary socialization and occupational identity, however, were small (partial η<sup>2</sup> = .023 to .070). A summary of univariate and post-hoc tests for the between-institutions analysis appears in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0305735610381886">Table 4</xref>.</p>
<p>Because of significant institutional effects found for secondary socialization and occupational identity, data were disaggregated and subsequent multivariate analyses of effects due to individual differences variables were conducted separately within each institution. Though we were interested in exploring interactions as well as main effects, it was not possible to run factorial MANOVAs without violating statistical assumptions. Therefore, a series of one-way multivariate analyses were used to determine the effects of gender, major applied area (winds and percussion, strings, keyboard, voice), degree program (music performance, music education, music performance/education combined, liberal arts in music), and class standing (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior) on secondary socialization and occupational identity.</p>

<title>Within-institutions analysis – secondary socialization</title>
<p>Gender and applied major had no significant effect on secondary socialization, regardless of the institution. Degree program had a significant effect on secondary socialization within Music School A (∧ = .792, p = .001) and Music School C (∧ = .709, p &lt; .001), but not Music School B (∧ = .709, p &lt; .001). Within Music School A (2:1 ratio of performance to education majors), there was a significant univariate effect for the teaching laboratory context (F = 7.347, p = .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .105), with music education majors reporting significantly more positive influence than liberal arts music majors. Within Music School C (1:1 ratio of performance to education majors), there were significant univariate effects associated with music classroom influence (F = 7.896, p &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .116) and teaching laboratory influence (F = 5.411, p = .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .082). Students working on either a music education degree or dual degree in music performance and education reported significantly more positive music classroom and teaching laboratory influence than music performance majors.</p>
<p>Secondary socialization was significantly affected by class standing at Music School A (∧ = .728, p = .001) and Music School B (∧ = .663, p &lt; .001), but not music school C. Freshman attending Music School A reported significantly more positive music classroom influence than seniors (F = 14.075, p = .008, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .089), while seniors and juniors in Music School B reported significantly more positive teaching laboratory influence than freshman (F = 11.832, p &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .216).</p>
<p>Overall, there was no consistent pattern to individual difference variable effects on secondary socialization within institutions. Influence associated with music classroom and teaching laboratory contexts appears more likely to be impacted by degree program affiliation and class standing than other facets of secondary socialization. Within-institution effects on secondary socialization were larger than those reported for between-institution comparisons, but still relatively modest in size (partial η<sup>2</sup> = .082 to .216).</p>

<title>Within-institutions analysis – occupational identity</title>
<p>There were no significant gender or class standing effects for occupational identity. Applied major had a significant effect on occupational identity within Music School C (∧ = .833, p = .001). The follow-up univariate tests showed that voice majors had a significantly stronger entertainer/entrepreneur identity than instrumentalists (F = 7.680, p &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .114); no other significant differences in occupational identity were attributable to applied major.</p>
<p>Significant degree program effects on occupational identity (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0305735610381886">Table 5</xref>) emerged within all three institutions (∧ = .624, p &lt; .001 for Music School A; ∧ = .532, p &lt; .001 for Music School B; ∧ = .455, p &lt; .001 for Music School C). At Music School A (2:1 ratio of performance to education majors), there were significant univariate effects for teacher identity (F = 24.806, p &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .296) and conductor/composer identity (F = 13.008, p &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .181). Music education majors reported significantly stronger teacher and conductor/composer identities than music performance majors or liberal arts majors in music. Results for Music School B (1:2 ratio of performance to education majors) paralleled those for Music School A. There were significant univariate effects for teacher identity (F = 24.394, p &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .367) and conductor/composer identity (F = 13.180, p &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .239). Music education majors and students completing a dual major in music performance and education reported significantly stronger teacher and composer identities than music performance majors and liberal arts majors in music.</p>

<p>Degree program effects on occupational identity were somewhat more dynamic at Music School C (1:1 ratio of music performance to education majors). We found significant differences for teacher identity (F = 47.071, p &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .441), musician identity (F = 5.053, p = .002, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .078), and conductor/composer identity (F = 13.448, p &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .184). Music education majors and dual majors (music performance and education) exhibited stronger teacher identities than music performance majors and liberal arts majors, and stronger conductor/composer identities than music performance majors. Conversely, music performance majors and dual majors reported stronger musician identities than liberal arts majors in music.</p>
<p>It is important to note that most effect sizes associated with these analyses are of moderate to large magnitude, accounting for roughly 20% to 45% of the variance in occupational identity. This suggests that the degree program with which a music student is affiliated has important consequences for identity construction, regardless of the institution.</p>

<title>Regression analysis</title>
<p>The 12-item Career Commitment Scale provided highly reliable (∧ = .87) estimates of participants’ interest, confidence and intent with regard to pursuing a music career. Stepwise regression analysis was used to investigate whether secondary socialization and occupational identity would predict music career commitment. The five subscales representing secondary socialization influences and the four subscales representing different facets of occupational identity served as the predictor variable set, and total music career commitment scores served as the dependent variable. The regression analysis showed that music career commitment is best predicted by a combination of secondary socialization and occupational identity variables. The four variables, which accounted for 41% of the variance in music career commitment were (in order of importance): music classroom influence, musician identity, teacher identity, and campus/community context influence (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0305735610381886">Table 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
<p>Descriptive analyses related to our first research question suggest that socialization processes may be driven, to a noteworthy extent, by the music school performance culture. Studio teachers were the most commonly identified musician and teacher role models and were viewed as having a very positive influence on the decision to major in music. Other positively influential people commonly identified as musician and teacher role models were college ensemble directors and high school music teachers (who, for the most part in the US, are ensemble directors). Participants also considered most performance-related activities (doing well in lessons and studio classes, practicing major instrument/voice, participating in major performance events) to be extremely important. These findings closely mirror those reported by other researchers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735610381886">Roberts (1991)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0305735610381886">Bouij (1998)</xref>. Factor analyses of secondary socialization and occupational identity, however, provided more nuanced and contrasting interpretations.</p>
<p>We found evidence that secondary socialization influence functions as a set of interrelated but distinct contexts – contexts that include both important social agents and experiences. Applied studio teachers may be considered important role models and highly influential by a significant number of music majors, but their status and influence is only part of the larger music school culture, one dimension of influence among several that include people and experiences germane to the music classroom (e.g., teachers of academic classes and ensembles), performance hall (e.g., concert and recital event experiences), teaching laboratory (e.g. experiences related to teaching private lessons and classes in elementary or secondary schools), and the larger campus/community outside of the music school.</p>
<p>Our findings also confirmed that occupational identity has underlying dimensions, but those dimensions reflect different musical roles/occupations more so than a divergence of self and other perceptions as previous research has suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735610381886">Isbell, 2008</xref>). Study participants viewed being a musician as distinct from being a teacher, but other dimensions of occupational identity (conductor/composer, entertainer/entrepreneur) proved salient as well. The multidimensional nature of occupational identity, as reflected in the responses of study participants, supports the notion that people may hold multiple identities or envision ‘provisional selves’ as they negotiate identity construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0305735610381886">Ibarra, 1999</xref>). No research, of which we are aware, addresses the question of whether it is more beneficial for college-age music majors to claim a single identity, navigate among identities as situations and personal development necessitate, or move toward a thoughtful integration of identities. While it is true that specific career paths in music require somewhat unique blends of knowledge and skill, and undergraduate music curricula seldom encourage students to make connections across sub-disciplines, the notion of facilitating holistic identity development is one that we find intriguing and potentially valuable as a mechanism for addressing oppositional thinking about musicians/artists and teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0305735610381886">Mark, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0305735610381886">Stephens, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Given Nettl’s depiction of music school culture in America, we were particularly interested in determining how socialization influence and occupational identity might vary across institutions, and whether these constructs are impacted by gender, applied major, degree program, or class standing within institutions. We found evidence of significant institutional differences for both socialization and occupational identity – differences that seemed to reflect how performance and education ideals may or may not be reconciled. Students attending Music School A (which has a preponderance of undergraduate majors in music performance, few students pursuing a dual degree in performance and education, and a culture where performance and education are often juxtaposed) reported less positive music classroom influence and weaker teacher and conductor/composer identities. Students attending Music School C (where the number of music education and performance majors is relatively balanced, the dual degree in performance and education is quite popular, and performance skills are considered a vital part of teacher preparation) reported more positive music classroom, applied studio, and performance hall influence, and stronger teacher identities. Yet, the effect sizes associated with these difference were rather small which, given a multi-level analytical framework, hints at the importance of within-institution factors in explaining additional variance.</p>
<p>Gender was not a potent variable with respect to either socialization or occupational identity. Responses provided by female and male students were virtually identical across all socialization and identity subscales, implying that social stereotyping and gender bias may not be particular relevant where these psychological variables are concerned. Nettl’s assertion that instrumentalists and vocalists may jockey for social status and support also was not substantiated in our study. More often than not, students reported very similar levels of support and comparable identity strength across applied majors. Class standing effects for socialization were along predictable lines (music classroom influence being more positive for freshman, teaching laboratory influence being more positive for upperclassmen than underclassmen). We were surprised to find no class standing effects for occupational identity, given how theorists often describe identity as being a very malleable and developmental construct. The absence of a class standing effect suggests that occupational identity, if left unchallenged, may change very little as undergraduate music majors progress through school.</p>
<p>In contrast to results for gender, applied major and class standing, we found very robust effects for degree program affiliation on both secondary socialization and occupational identity. Socialization influence associated with the music teaching laboratory was more positive for music education majors than music performance majors or liberal arts majors in music. This is a logical outcome in the sense that, beyond the possibility of teaching private lessons or leading occasional ensemble sectionals, performance and liberal arts majors have far fewer opportunities to engage in sustained teaching experiences and field work than music education majors.</p>
<p>The pattern and strength of degree program effects on occupational identity was relatively consistent. Music education majors and students pursuing a dual degree in education and performance reported stronger teacher and conductor/composer identities than music performance majors and liberal arts majors in music. Once again, we suspect there is a curricula connection at work, as students with extensive training and experience in teaching and conducting should be expected to adopt stronger identities in those realms than students who lack such training or experience.</p>
<p>Perhaps most surprising is the fact that there was only one significant degree program effect on musician identity, and that effect showed that music performance and dual majors in Music School C reported stronger musician identities than liberal arts majors. There were no significant musician identity differences that separated music education majors from performance majors. One interpretation is that this finding confirms the tendency of music education majors to aspire to a performer identity before ‘settling’ for a teacher identity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610381886">Woodford (2002)</xref>, for example, has speculated that music education majors identify strongly as performers due to the robust music socialization processes, high social status and recognition for music performance achievement, and the wide variety of skills (including performance skills) involved in music teaching. Alternatively, it is possible that music education majors and students pursuing a dual major in education and performance are simply more successful than performance majors in achieving an integrated identity that embraces the importance of being both a good musician (performer, conductor or composer) and a good teacher.</p>
<p>Music career commitment is, arguably, the end goal associated with most undergraduate music programs. We found that music career commitment is best predicted on the basis of musician and teacher identity, as well as music classroom influence and the larger campus/community influence. Applied studio influence, to our surprise, did not account for unique variance in music career commitment. This finding implies that career commitment is enhanced when students are able to see themselves as both strong musicians and strong teachers, and when support for music endeavors comes from complementary contexts within and outside of the music school culture. Further improvement of career commitment would seem to depend upon the willingness of music faculty to adopt a multidimensional view of the student as musician and teacher, while recognizing that they are but one source of support/influence for students.</p>
<p>Researchers who harshly critique music school cultures within higher education seldom offer constructive solutions to the social status gaps that so often divide music performance and music education majors. Based on our findings, we conclude that the culture of music schools, at least as represented by the American institutions included in this study, are largely positive and functional environments – environments in which music majors find support from many sectors as they negotiate multiple identities. Yet, we also believe there are opportunities for improvement. While much is written about the psychological deficits endured by music education majors, one can hardly ignore the need for music performance majors to embrace pedagogy and teaching as social and occupational realities they will encounter sooner rather than later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0305735610381886">Fredrickson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0305735610381886">Mills, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0305735610381886">Purves, Marshall, Hargreaves, &amp; Welch, 2005</xref>). Maintaining reasonably equitable performance standards and access to high quality studio instruction for all students regardless of degree program, offering and encouraging students (when appropriate and economically feasible) to pursue a dual degree in music education and performance, and requiring more extensive pedagogical studies for performance majors are viable near-term strategies for bridging social divides and moderating social class differences that, all too often, negatively impact identity construction and career commitment. Given how many study participants identified music peers as important role models, it also seems prudent to consider how formalized peer mentoring relationships might be used to both inspire and support music majors in ways that temper or complement studio teacher influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0305735610381886">Davidson &amp; Burland, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Clearly, our findings are most applicable to music school and higher education contexts that are similar to those included in this investigation. Additional multi-institution survey studies targeting highly competitive conservatories, for example, might yield different results. Our findings also are inexorably connected to the particular theoretical lens that we chose to employ (i.e., secondary socialization viewed as the collective impact of people and experiences most connected to the individual or context; occupational identity viewed as a merger of teacher-musician and self-other dimensions; career commitment viewed as a critical outcome for institutions that offer undergraduate degrees in music), as well as our choice of methodology (survey), data type (quantitative) and analytical approach (multivariate and multilevel techniques). Additional single-institution case studies, studies that address emotional facets of socialization and identity construction, and cross-cultural comparative studies also are needed to provide new insights and a deeper understanding of the connections that exist among music school culture, degree program affiliation, socialization, and identity.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we favor an interpretation and policy position that advocates for thoughtful integration of musician, teacher and scholar identities through mutually supportive socialization structures. Dichotomous theories that necessitate denigrating one particular identity or social group in an effort to elevate another seem self-defeating for the profession. The music profession needs teachers who are reflective thinkers and strong musicians, just as it needs musicians who are knowledgeable about the music they are performing and capable of drawing upon pedagogical principles to elevate their own performance or provide education in music to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0305735610381886">Mark, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0305735610381886">Stephens, 1995</xref>). In the final analysis, labeling oneself as ‘musician’ or ‘teacher’ may not be nearly as important as committing to habits of mind and building meaningful relationships that optimize the teaching, learning, performing, and appreciation of music in all of its manifestations.</p>
