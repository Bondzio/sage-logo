<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> The use of service users’ views as performance indicators highlights the trend to make services more responsive to patients’ needs. However, recent research indicates that there is a lack of clear understanding about specialist CAMHS and the outcomes that children, adolescents and their parents hope to achieve from treatment differ.</p>
<p><bold>Aims:</bold> To explore children/young people’s and parents/carers’ expectations of CAMHS in Leicestershire, England.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Sixty children/young people and their parents/carers were asked to identify goals they want to achieve following contact with CAMHS. Qualitative thematic analysis in relation to Hoagwood’s SFCES model (Symptoms, Functional, Consumer perspectives, Environment and Systems) was used.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The question was answered by 46.7% of children and young people and 60% of carers. Overall, children, young people and parents/carers agreed that symptomatic modification and functional aspects were the most important goals. However, internalising items seemed more important for parents/carers than children and adolescents, who in contrast hoped for improvement in externalising factors. Goals outside the scope of CAMHS were also noted for both groups.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Attention to children/young people and their parents/carers’ expectations of services is needed to improve therapeutic relationships and engagement. Improvement in mental health literacy and practitioners’ guidance is required to allow service users to set realistic and achievable treatment goals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The growing emphasis on the rights of the consumer, the Children’s Rights agenda and the understanding of children as an active agent in social change underpin the increasing interest in making healthcare services more responsive to users’ expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020764010397093">Sinclair, 2004</xref>). The need for active patient involvement is also highlighted by national and international policy as an important element of service development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764010397093">American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764010397093">Bramesfeld et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764010397093">Coad and Shaw, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764010397093">Commission for Health Improvement, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020764010397093">Department of Health, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764010397093">2004b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020764010397093">2004c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764010397093">2004d</xref>), with patients’ views increasingly being used as performance indicators of healthcare satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764010397093">Cleary, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764010397093">Hoagwood et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>However, it has been argued that better information is needed to ensure that informed choice is exercised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764010397093">Appleby et al., 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764010397093">Coulter and Ellins (2006)</xref> state that health literacy is fundamental to patient engagement, because if individuals do not have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information, they will not be able to look after themselves effectively or make appropriate health decisions. This information needs to be sensitive to children’s age and state of development, and a partnership needs to be developed with parents and carers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764010397093">AACAP, 2007</xref>) as they themselves are important sources of information for their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764010397093">Beresford and Sloper, 1999</xref>). For instance, the National Service Framework for Children’s Services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764010397093">Department of Health, 2004b</xref>) states that there is strong evidence that poor attendance rates in child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) are closely associated with whether parents understand and agree with the referral.</p>
<p>Recent research demonstrates that generally there is a lack of clear understanding about specialist CAMHS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764010397093">Dogra, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020764010397093">Dogra et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764010397093">Dogra et al. (2005)</xref> found that neither children and young people, nor their parents, had a consistent understanding of the terms mental health or mental illness. Evidence about views of child mental health from the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764010397093">Garland et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764010397093">Pescosolido et al., 2007</xref>) and Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020764010397093">Jorm et al., 2007</xref>) found that parents tend to be poorly informed about child mental health disorders, child mental health services and treatments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764010397093">Pescosolido et al. (2007)</xref> concluded that mental health specialists face challenges in gaining family participation. Unless systematically addressed, the public’s lack of knowledge, scepticism and misinformed beliefs signal continuing problems for providers, as well as for caregivers and children seeking treatment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, children and adolescents are infrequently asked about their views but can make useful contributions when they are asked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020764010397093">Dogra, 2004</xref>). It is suggested that a balance needs to be found between their perspectives and those of the carers, whose views are often given prominence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764010397093">Yeh and Weisz (2001)</xref> explored differences in perceptions of problematic areas between 381 parent–child pairs to child and adolescent mental health outpatient clinics. They found that more than 60% of the pairs failed to agree on a single problem for which the child needed help. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764010397093">Garland et al. (2004)</xref> investigated the discrepancy between children and young people’s expectations of services and that of parents and therapists. They established that children, their parents and therapists often had very different hopes and expectations of service involvement. Almost two thirds of the 170 triads did not agree on even one of the desired outcomes for the adolescent’s treatment when desired outcomes for individual cases were compared.</p>
<p>Lack of knowledge and consensus between parents and their children’s desired outcomes in treatment need to be addressed as they may limit engagement in treatment and the ability of working together in the pursuit of therapy goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764010397093">Garland et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764010397093">Yeh and Weisz, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Objective</title>
<p>This paper focuses on one component of a project which aimed to improve the access and experience of CAMHS by children, young people and their families, to ensure they are active partners in the decision-making process. The project collected pre-assessment data to establish baselines from which basic outcome data could be collected. This paper reports on the part that explored children and parents/carers’ hopes and expectations of CAMHS in Leicestershire, England.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0020764010397093" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Data were collected from non-urgent referrals to Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust CAMHS.</p>
<p>Sixty children and young people, aged 6 to 18 years old, and their parents or carers were given a multidimensional data collection questionnaire during their first attendance to CAMHS. This included demographics information, the parent and appropriate child Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and Adolescents (HoNOSCA), the parent and appropriate child Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the parent and child goals. Furthermore, children, young people and their parents/carers were asked, prior to their initial assessment at CAMHS, ‘In coming to this service, what are some of the problems you want help with or goals you want to get to?’. In this paper, only the latter qualitative aspects of the project will be discussed in detail.</p>
<sec id="section4-0020764010397093">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive data were entered onto SPSS and simple frequency counts were undertaken.</p>
<p>Regarding qualitative data, open-ended answers obtained were initially separated and tabulated and later grouped into categories. Qualitative thematic analysis was undertaken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020764010397093">Joffe et al., 2004</xref>). For categorization, the five domains used were those defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764010397093">Hoagwood et al. (1996)</xref> as part of the SFCES model. They include ‘symptoms’ (any emotional or behavioural symptoms), ‘functional’ (ability of children to adapt to the demands of home, school and community) and ‘consumer perspectives’, subjective experience of the consumer such as quality of life or the effect of difficulties on family’s ability to provide for the child. In addition, the ‘environment’ domain refers to features of the children’s environment that are also modified by the primary intervention (e.g. decrease in family tension or discord that was a consequence of the child’s symptoms, classroom stability, etc.). Finally, ‘systems’ outcomes are those related to services (e.g. type and duration of the intervention) or to the relationship between two or more sectors or agencies. The main benefits of the SFCES model are that it takes into consideration the dynamic relationship between the individual and the environment, allowing for the analysis of such relationship and aiming for integration between research and clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764010397093">Hoagwood et al., 1996</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Sixty children/young people–parent/carer dyads were approached. Thirty eight (63.3%) children were male and 22 (36.7%) female, with an age range between six and 18 years old (median = 13) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0020764010397093">Figure 1</xref>). Most children were aged 13 (15%) or 15 (15%) years old, followed by 12 (13.3%) and 16 (13.3%). Six (1.7%) and 18 (1.7%) were the least represented.</p>

<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0020764010397093">Figure 2</xref> shows interim diagnoses following the initial assessment. Thirty eight children and young people (63.3%) received an interim diagnosis based on the ICD-10; 3.3% were diagnosed as depressed (F.32), 6.7% with anxiety disorder (F.41), 1.7% with obsessive-compulsive disorder (F.42), 10% with severe reaction to stress and adjustment disorder (F.43) and 1.7% with habit and impulse disorder (F.63). Moreover, 8.2% received a diagnosis of mild mental retardation (F.70), 11.7% of pervasive developmental disorder (F.84), 10% hyperkinetic disorder (F.90), 5% conduct disorder (F.91), 3.3% emotional disorder (F.93) and 1.7% tic disorder (F.95). Of the above, 25% received more than one diagnosis.</p>

</fig>
<p>Conversely, 25% of children and young people did not meet ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for any disorder, having presented with issues such as low self-esteem, anger and family problems.</p>
<p>Finally, in 11.7%, a diagnosis was not recorded.</p>
<p>The majority of ICD-10 diagnoses were made on children older than 10 years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020764010397093">Table 1</xref>). Most of them were aged 12 (13.4%) and 15 (13.4%), with the most prevalent diagnosis being anxiety disorders (F.41) and conduct disorder (F.93), respectively. Furthermore, PDD (F.84) was the most common ICD-10 diagnosis of all (11.7%), being present across most ages except 9, 11, 13, 17 and 18 years. Depression (F.32) was seen in two cases (3.3%), both aged 17 years.</p>

<p>For the qualitative aspect of the study, participants were asked, ‘In coming to this service, what are some of the problems you want help with or goals you want to get to?’. Twenty eight children and young people (46.7%) and 36 parents/carers (60%) answered the question. Thirty percent of qualitative answers came from children aged 8 to 12 years, whereas 70% were from young people between 13 and 17 years old. No answers were given by children/young people aged 6, 7 or 18 years.</p>
<p>Parents/carers more frequently expressed multiple goals to be achieved from contact with CAMHS than children and young people. For instance, while 28 children/young people and 36 parents/carers stated at least one goal to be achieved, 21 children/young people (75%) and 33 parents/carers (97.7%) did so for two goals, 15 children/young people (53.6%) and 24 parents/carers (66.7%) for three, and 2 children/young people (7.1%) and 8 parents/carers (22.2%) stated four goals. A total of 166 items from both groups were obtained, 66 (39.8%) from the children/young people’s groups and 100 (60.2%) from the parents/carers’ group.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0020764010397093">Figure 3</xref> presents the frequency of desired treatment outcomes expressed by both groups.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020764010397093">Table 2</xref> shows that on the whole, children/young people and their parents/carers agreed that symptom reduction was the main domain to be modified by treatment (56% and 48%, respectively), followed by functional aspects (26% and 22%, respectively). Similar agreement between children/young people and parents/carers was found for the environmental domain (15% and 16%, respectively) as the third most preferred outcome.

<p>Concerning the symptoms domain, children and young people expressed that a reduction in anxiety symptoms (28.6%) and a reduction in anger (28.6 %) were the most important treatment outcomes to be achieved. These two were also the most frequently mentioned items of all by children/young people. Additionally, they stated that an improvement in behaviour (21.4%), mood (17.9%) and self-esteem (14.3%) were also important goals. Likewise, parents/carers also agreed that a reduction in anxiety (25%) and improvement in self-esteem (25%) were the most important treatment goals, followed by an improvement in mood (22.2%), a reduction in anger (19.4%) and improvement in behaviour (11.1%). In contrast to their children, parents/carers also highlighted an improvement in sleep (11.1% vs. 7.1%) as an important outcome. Neither children/young people nor parents/carers expressed a reduction in self-harming behaviour as an important goal to be achieved from contact with CAMHS (3.6% and 8.3%, respectively).</p>
<p>Although overall functional items were mentioned less frequently than modification of symptoms, for the parents/carers’ group, an improvement at school was the most popular treatment outcome (27.8%). Children and young people also identified this item as an important outcome (21.4%), although less frequently. In addition, both children/young people and their parents/carers agreed that having more friends was a desired outcome (14.3% and 11.1%, respectively). While children and young people also expressed that by contact with CAMHS they hoped to be able to find a profession to suit them (21.4%), this was not mentioned by any of the parents/carers. Instead, parents/carers identified that becoming more independent was important (13.9%), compared to none of the children/young people.</p>
<p>Regarding the environmental domain, children and young people hoped to improve peer relationships following contact with CAMHS (21.4%), whereas this was not a frequently stated desired outcome by parents/carers (8.3%). They considered instead that an improvement in family relationships was more important in this domain (22.2% of parents/carers vs. 10.7% of children/young people).</p>
<p>Finally, only parents/carers expressed items in the consumer perspective domain as outcomes to be achieved from contact with CAMHS, hoping for a better quality for life for their children following treatment (16.7%).</p>

<sec id="section6-0020764010397093" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Overall, this study suggests that the majority of children/young people and parents/carers agreed that a symptomatic modification and functional aspects were the most important goals to be achieved from contact with CAMHS. However, when analysing individual items within each domain, similarly to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764010397093">Garland et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764010397093">Yeh and Weisz, 2001</xref>), it becomes apparent that there is no consistent agreement between both groups. For instance, internalising items seem more important for parents/carers (improvement in anxiety, self-esteem, mood and better quality of life) than children and young people, who in contrast, more frequently highlight the importance of externalising factors, such as reduction in anger and improvement in behaviour. This is consistent with previous actor–observer literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764010397093">Compas et al., 1982</xref>) in that when individual actions are being scrutinised by an observer, it is common to find that actors (in this case children and young people) make more attributions to situational or environmental circumstances, while observers (parents or carers) tend to attribute actors’ actions to internal characteristics. This lack of consensus between parents and their children may limit engagement in treatment and the ability of working together in the pursuit of therapy goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764010397093">Garland et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764010397093">Yeh and Weisz, 2001</xref>). In order to overcome this, an initial independent assessment of parent and child, to be followed by a joint formulation of goals, may be a useful step toward encouraging shared therapy goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764010397093">Compas et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764010397093">Yeh and Weisz, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Although in the minority, answers that expressed goals outside the scope of CAMHS were also noted, such as hoping mental health services would help children to find a profession, or would make children obey rules, becoming more responsible or even allow parents to have more time for themselves. This coincides with the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764010397093">Dogra (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764010397093">Dogra et al. (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020764010397093">2007)</xref> in the UK, and Pescosolido et al. in the USA (2007), in that generally, there is a lack of clear understanding about the role of specialist CAMHS. Moreover, the fact that approximately 53% of children/young people and 40% of parents/carers did not state any goals or expectations of treatment may indicate that service users do not know what to expect from CAMHS. Therefore, by improving mental health literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764010397093">Coulter and Ellins, 2006</xref>) and by developing (in partnership with children and parents) age and developmental sensitive information regarding the service’s role and objectives, unrealistic expectations could be avoided, thereby improving service users’ disappointment and disengagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764010397093">AACAP, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764010397093">Beresford and Sloper, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764010397093">Department of Health, 2004b</xref>). In this respect, previous research suggested that children and young people believe that information regarding CAMHS should be given to all and not just those referred, detailing what would happen at the initial assessment, by whom they will be seen and what types of interventions are likely to be implemented. Children and young people also identified school lessons, CAMHS open days, media (television and magazines) and leaflets as the best way to disseminate information, particularly if these are left at school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020764010397093">Paul et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, more answers were given by teenagers than by younger children. Cognitively, teenagers start to find a sense of self, becoming more outspoken and clearer about what their needs are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764010397093">Fadem, 2008</xref>). However, it is important to remember that all children and young people have a vital role to play in tailoring services to their needs. Although there is some evidence of children and young people’s consultation, there is less so of their views being incorporated in service commissioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020764010397093">McDougall et al., 2008</xref>) and delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764010397093">Coad and Shaw, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764010397093">Worral-Davies, 2008</xref>). Consequently, although children and young people are not frequently consulted about the services they attend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020764010397093">Dogra, 2004</xref>), they expect to be asked and their opinions to be taken seriously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020764010397093">Paul et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section7-0020764010397093">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study is limited by several factors. First, although not unusual for this type of study, the low response rate obtained may affect the validity of the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764010397093">Robson, 2002</xref>). However, this could be interpreted as a useful outcome reflecting, for instance, service users’ lack of understanding of the role of CAMHS.</p>
<p>Second, the data analysed were collected opportunistically in that the questions asked were part of the CAMHS Outcomes Research Consortium (CORC) standard pack and not further refined. The study is based on a small convenience sample, which may not represent the wider population served by CAMHS. In spite of this, the results represent valid views of Leicestershire service users, which could be initially used to address local policy issues, serving as a platform for future, wider and more robust projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764010397093">Davidson et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, although the data highlight disagreement between parents/carers and their children, the strength of these disagreements and the reasons behind them cannot be inferred. Nevertheless, this study was primarily centred on children/young people’s and parents/carers’ perspectives of CAMHS and the way they understand the service, rather than their differences. However, the latter are acknowledged as valuable findings and it could be hypothesised that parents and their children are not communicating effectively regarding what is important to them, which may be reflected in the different expected treatment outcomes. Furthermore, it could be possible that a lack of understanding of the role of CAMHS underlies the significant number of unrealistic hopes for treatment outcomes.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Part of the challenges faced by mental health practitioners during the process of formulation and treatment rely on the degree of service users’ understanding of, and agreement with, the information that is available to them. Therefore, attention to children and young people’s expectation of services appears to be an important factor to improve therapeutic relationships and treatment engagement, as they expect to be heard, valued and their views contemplated in the delivery of services. Nevertheless, parents/carers’ desired treatment outcomes also play a vital role as they are an important source of information among their children. Hence, it is important to allow time during consultation to arrive at a joint formulation of treatment goals between children/young people and their parents/carers.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that service users have realistic expectations of CAMHS, mental health literacy needs to be improved, based on information that is age appropriate and relevant to them. This would allow for early negotiation between CAMHS practitioners and service users of common, realistic and achievable goals to be achieved from treatment.</p>
