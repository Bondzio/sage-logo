<abstract>
<p>This research concerns the Malaysian Multimedia Super Corridor project. Part of the project is a construction of a future intelligent city named Cyberjaya. This is a utopian city. The dream encompasses constructing working and living spaces for information communication technology professionals and experts from all over the world. Based on an ethnographic approach, this article seeks to explore what happens when utopian ideas are implemented. That is, rather than testing whether or not the dream has become true, the authors investigate the “materiality” of <italic>dreamwork</italic> in the development of a “planned city.” They show that the utopian globalized information communication technology city is built on the principles of zoning, sterility, and security. These principles are at the core of engineering a global community of knowledge workers. The authors argue that the ordering of this particular version of utopia—discursively anchored in a specific hybridization of (hyper)modernity, Malaysian culture, and Islam—has resulted in a proliferation of “non-places” that inhibit binding associations and thus prevent the development of a sense of “belonging.”</p>

<title>Cruising Cyberjaya: Superficial Encounters in Empty Spaces</title>
<p>This study, conducted between 2004 and 2009, has deployed an ethnographic approach.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1206331212453676">1</xref></sup> The methods involved are ethnographic interviewing, structured interviewing, participant observation, and document analyses. Most important for this research, however, has been “cruising the city,” a method based on the work of Edgar Morin (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1206331212453676">Paillard, 1998</xref>). I spent a lot of time in my car, driving around the empty streets of Cyberjaya. I also spent a lot of time on foot, “loitering” in the barren but clean public spaces. Finally, I spent a lot of time waiting in lobbies of organizations, finding it difficult to pass the formal barriers of security. These multiple methods helped the researchers understand the nuances of the lifeworld of informants in the city. By employing different interviewing methods, we found 55 main informants. Observation was done with the usage of a structured fieldwork journal. Official and commercial documentation has been used to reflect on the lived experiences of the spaces in the city. In what follows, it will be clear that there is a discrepancy between the idealizations of the Malaysian Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC; the <italic>dream-</italic>work) and Cyberjaya (the dream-<italic>work</italic>). To get a better sense of the difference between <italic>dream</italic>-work and dream-<italic>work</italic>, ethnography has been deployed as a means to provide detailed accounts of “being” in the city from the viewpoints of its inhabitants and users.</p>

<title>A Short History of Cyberjaya</title>
<p>The MSC is a visionary project initiated by Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohammed when he was the Prime Minister of Malaysia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1206331212453676">2</xref></sup> The project aimed at enabling Malaysia to become a major player in the global knowledge economy. Specifically, the MSC project represents an attempt by the state to construct a planned community in one of the MSC’s “intelligent cities,” namely, Cyberjaya. The MSC is a planned national project (one of the major landmarks) to establish the infrastructure of a knowledge-based economy for Malaysia. Located in central peninsular Malaysia, this project claims to provide a social setting for the integration of human beings, environment, and technology. The MSC project is an audacious dream to transform Malaysia into a modern nation with a powerful economy, a nation whose populace are members of a knowledge-based society, a nation that has the capacity to “become global.”</p>
<p>From the state’s viewpoint, the realization of the MSC project is akin to interpreting a vision for a new Malaysia. Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad summed this up in his speech at the opening of the Multimedia Conference on the Multimedia Super Corridor in Kuala Lumpur on August 1, 1996:
<disp-quote>
<p>I see the MSC as a global facilitator of the information age, a carefully constructed mechanism to enable mutual enrichment of companies and countries using leading technologies and the borderless world. Other plans may sound similar because they use “IT,” “Cyber,” or “Multimedia” to market one development or another. But we are not adding new facilities to existing ones; we are building and installing the latest on a huge 15-by-50 km greenfield site. We are not just upgrading. We are talking here about something much more far-reaching. We are talking about changing the way we live and work within the MSC. This special area will be <italic>a global testbed for the new roles of government, new cyberlaws and guarantees, collaborations between government and companies, companies and companies, new delivery of healthcare, and applications of new technologies</italic> [italics added]. We are taking a single-minded approach to developing the country using the new tools offered by the information age. The MSC will be the R&amp;D centre for the information based industries, to develop new codes of ethics in a shrunken world when everyone is a neighbour to everyone else, where we have to live with each other without unnecessary tension and conflicts. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1206331212453676">Mahathir, 1996</xref>, p. 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The vision of the MSC project is to change Malaysia from being a manufacturing-based economy to become an information-based economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1206331212453676">Yusof, 2010</xref>). In other words, this project is an attempt to link Malaysia to global economic structures of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1206331212453676">Castells (1996)</xref> called “the Network Society.” To initiate the MSC project, the Malaysian government incorporated an information communication technology (ICT) plan into the Sixth Malaysia Plan (1991-1995). The primary aim of this policy was to lay the foundation of a knowledge-based economy through a national discourse of propagating the benefits of information technology (IT) in civil administration and management. In this Plan, ICT issues were highlighted as a priority national agenda, and this would serve as a catalyst to the MSC project. Among the ICT issues highlighted in the Sixth Malaysia Plan were ICT usage and applications for the purposes of enhancing managerial effectiveness, improving the productivity of government departments by reducing red tape, promoting more public access to sources of information, and developing more ICT infrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1206331212453676">Economic Planning Unit, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1206331212453676">Harris, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1206331212453676">Raman &amp; Yap, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The idea of the MSC was introduced as such in the following Seventh Malaysia Plan, which was the next 5-year national strategic plan spanning the years 1995 until 2000. With the allocation of two chapters in the Plan on matters covering ICT, namely, Science and Technology and Information Technology, the government made clear its intention to pursue a knowledge economy. Under this Plan, the government had allocated “RM5.2 billion<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1206331212453676">3</xref></sup> to the ICT fund in 2000 to provide financing for high-technology and ICT based firms” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1206331212453676">Economic Planning Unit, 2001</xref>, p. 378). Among the primary targets of this Plan were strategies to expand and upgrade the telecommunications infrastructure and to develop the knowledge and skills of local IT professionals so as to be able to provide quality human resources for the IT sector. This meant the government had to invest heavily in constructing ICT facilities and train a larger workforce for the IT field. In its effort to accelerate IT development in Malaysia, the Plan was underpinned by two main targets. First, Malaysia would be transformed into an IT hub with the realization of the MSC. Second, Cyberjaya would be a major social experiment in constructing a new model city for Malaysia. To ensure the smooth flow of progress in IT development under this Plan, the government invested RM2.3 billion<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1206331212453676">4</xref></sup> in ministries and agencies that participated in ICT-based industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1206331212453676">Economic Planning Unit, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In the Eighth Malaysia Plan, the MSC project was given priority as it is seen as a catalyst to accelerate the development of ICT in Malaysia. The state introduced a social planning agenda in Clause 13.17 of the Plan through its proposal to construct five cybercities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1206331212453676">5</xref></sup> The plan emphasized that only Cyberjaya would be designed and developed for living and working purposes for employees in IT industries (knowledge workers; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1206331212453676">Multimedia Development Corporation, 2003</xref>). The state-led project of Cyberjaya is a major attempt at the social and cultural engineering of a community in Malaysia—“a new Malaysian identity”—in a global context.</p>
<p>To implement the MSC project, the Multimedia Development Corporation was established. This agency is now located in the heart of Cyberjaya. Its role is to attract foreign ICT companies to invest in the MSC project. In addition, its purpose was also to provide help in finance and investment and to oversee the general development of Cyberjaya. The job of supervising the development of Cyberjaya is shared between a private developer (Setia Haruman) and the local state council. Cyberjaya is built and managed on the basis of a multistakeholder administrative structure, where by joint powers manage this city.</p>
<p>The concept of an intelligent city has been intensely debated across various fields such as geography, urban planning, and sociology, usually in relation to debates on the knowledge economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1206331212453676">Agar, Green, &amp; Harvey, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1206331212453676">Kavanaugh, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1206331212453676">Komninos, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1206331212453676">Massey, Quintas, &amp; Wield, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1206331212453676">Mitchell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1206331212453676">Rosenberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1206331212453676">Saxenien, 2006</xref>). The making of intelligent cities embraces different configurations of spatial and digital factors that are realized in various forms, such as business incubators, R&amp;D centers, science parks, technopoles, and innovation centres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1206331212453676">Castells &amp; Hall, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1206331212453676">Komninos, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1206331212453676">Massey et al., 1992</xref>). The officially stated goal in the setting up of Cyberjaya is to create an intelligent city, a “model” city for the other states in Malaysia. Underpinning this effort is the top-down approach of interweaving high-class ICT facilities and urban infrastructure with the aim of attracting the experts in a broad spectrum of fields—engineers, researchers, and professionals in ICT fields—to live and work in Cyberjaya.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the spatial setting for the MSC project consists of several “cybercities.” They serve as research and development nodes and business-oriented centers. However, Cyberjaya is the only city planned to encompass both working and living spaces. The city is a social experiment by the state in creating a newly constructed community. Cyberjaya echoes the most ambitious projects such as the construction of Brasilia and Pu Dong in Shanghai: but with a “postindustrial” twist. It does not model itself on being the hub of a national economy but sees its vitality in bringing together global <italic>technotribes</italic> whose modalities of association are deemed to be professional rather than national and work-based rather than based on ethnicity.</p>

<title>Experiencing Cyberjaya</title>

<title>The First Axis: Zoning</title>
<p>The city is based on three main concepts, which are zoning, sterility, and community. Drawing on the concepts of the Garden City (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1206331212453676">Howard, 1965</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1206331212453676">2003</xref>) and the City of Tomorrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1206331212453676">Le Corbusier, 1971</xref>), Cyberjaya is designed with the idea of providing balance in city life.</p>
<p>In the true spirit of modernism, Ebenezer Howard’s design of the Garden City encapsulates a utopian plan that he sought to transform into a real city. Howard’s experimental cities emerged in Japan, Australia, and Britain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1206331212453676">Bridge &amp; Watson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1206331212453676">Oshima, 1996</xref>). What might have appealed to modernist planners in general are, perhaps, the ideas of order and perfection, with which they have been infatuated in their aim to build an ideal city. Cyberjaya does share quite a few features of the Garden City as it contains generous allocations of space to (mostly) cultivated plantations, which are meticulously maintained by a team of garden workers. In today’s global political climate that is occupied by concerns over ecological devastation and climate change, no urban design can go without such an integrated “ecological” provision.</p>
<p>Whereas Le Corbusier was more concerned with (unobstructed) flow and functional symmetry, there is also an ecological dimension to his utopian model. The clear open spaces between high-rise buildings, the centrality of (the possibility for) public transport, the capacity for including green zones, all betray an organic allegory as the basis of his city of the future. Cyberjaya resembles quite a bit of this thinking: with a network of wide access roads, a key concern for the central role played by transport, but above all, the notion of a clear separation of zones and flows, all of which betray a deeply modernist sense of ordering. The city planners interpret the concept of balance in life through the physical segregation of functional spaces marked by visible zoning. This resembles in more than one way the 1990s versions of the once-popular game Sim City. In the official Cyberjaya website, maps, and marketing brochures, it becomes clear that the city is made up of four main zones:
<disp-quote>
<p>The first zone is the Enterprise Zone which hosts both large multinational corporations as well as small to medium-sized enterprises involved in high-technology industries such as IT and multimedia. The Commercial Zone is designated for retail and office activities. Facilities include shopping malls, restaurants, hotels and business amenities. The Residential Zone is designed to offer high quality smart homes. Lastly is the Recreation Zone which is designed to provide conducive and aesthetic passive and active recreational activities for the Cyberjaya community. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1206331212453676">MSC, 2005</xref>, p. 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This idea of specific zoning is an approach in modernist planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1206331212453676">Boyer, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1206331212453676">Holston, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1206331212453676">Scott, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1206331212453676">Henri Lefebvre (1974/1991)</xref> suggests that one of the ways to understand how space is engineered in urban planning is via the concept of representations of space. He further argues that this idea involves top-down planning in which urban growth is constructed by a powerful (technocratic; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1206331212453676">Touraine, 1971</xref>) elite group. In his argument, this elite group consists of legislators, urban planners, architects, economists, engineers, and rulers who intervene in urban development to mark the social order imposed by the exercise of authority (Lefebvre, 1974/199). For Lefebvre, the central issue of representations of space is how this specific group is able to translate their ideology through construction of physical infrastructure in a city. In Cyberjaya, this spatial ideology is illustrated through award-winning architectures such as the Street Mall and the Cyberjaya Command Center buildings, wide roads, monitored playgrounds, gated apartments, and zoning strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1206331212453676">Setia Haruman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1206331212453676">Yoong, 2005</xref>). These material artifacts and planning systems dominate the city space and they symbolize the central role of the planners in determining the landscape of the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1206331212453676">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Zoning is an example of significant intervention from above. From the planners’ viewpoint, zoning is a mechanism of order to avoid social disorder in the city and the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1206331212453676">Talen, 2005</xref>). On the other hand, it underpins the idea of spatial and social segregation or <italic>functional differentiation</italic> that constitutes the idea of a modern city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1206331212453676">Jacobs, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1206331212453676">Scott, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1206331212453676">Talen, 2005</xref>). This segregation discourages human diversity within functional units and insists on nonambiguous differentiation between functional units.</p>
<p>Zoning, however, is not universally applied in urban planning. Indeed, even in his time Le Corbusier was seen as a radical modernist. Critics of his approach pointed out from the start that his strict functional differentiation may disintegrate the organic life of a city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1206331212453676">Boyer, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1206331212453676">Talen, 2005</xref>). The dilemma of urban intervention such as zoning is not new. It is not uncommon for critics to associate social discrimination with the zoning principle. For example, in the case of suburban development, high-income groups are separated socially and physically from low-income groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1206331212453676">Davis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1206331212453676">Keith &amp; Pile, 1993</xref>). Most of these critics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1206331212453676">Davis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1206331212453676">Jarvis, 1993</xref>), argue that zoning leads to social imbalance by creating an exclusive space for elite groups. The idea of zoning in the case of “gated communities” in Cyberjaya manifests the idea of attempting to segregate rather elite inhabitants from the noninhabitants—the city visitors and users. Moreover, balancing between social order and diversity is a never-ending task for the urban planner. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1206331212453676">Jarvis (1993)</xref> argues that the tension of balancing these two extremes is unavoidable:
<disp-quote>
<p>For the urban planner, the problem of diversity is reflected in the tension between unity and variety, between safety and excitement, and between convenience and separation, all of which are opposing qualities that must be balanced. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1206331212453676">Jarvis, 1993</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1206331212453676">Talen, 2005</xref>, p. 215)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This tension attracts debates from theorists, practitioners, and the public about the right way to plan a city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1206331212453676">Benjamin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1206331212453676">Fenster, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1206331212453676">Landau, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1206331212453676">Lefebvre, 1974/1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1206331212453676">Sennett, 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, in most cases in the Asian region, and to a certain extent in some Western countries, the power to plan and govern a city rests in the hands of a group of experts—a long time ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1206331212453676">Touraine (1971)</xref> had already criticized this as technocracy. Countries such as Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia are primarily driven by a centralized bureaucracy that coordinates and shapes their urban landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1206331212453676">Chang, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1206331212453676">Cybriwsky &amp; Ford, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1206331212453676">Douglass, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1206331212453676">Kishiue, Cal, Amano, &amp; Lidasan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1206331212453676">Lo &amp; Marcotullio, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1206331212453676">Regnier; 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1206331212453676">Tokunaga &amp; Takahashi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1206331212453676">Yeoh, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>More specifically, the extent to which zoning affects social and cultural engineering in Cyberjaya has been influenced by the inherited colonial urban system in Malaysia. The spatial stratification of the major communities in Malaysia is because of the traditions handed down by the British system of economic and social planning. Historically, in Peninsular Malaysia, the major ethnic groups (Malays, Chinese, and Indians) were divided according to the economic needs of the colonist. As a result, each community occupied a specific settlement that is zoned and marked by the economic force of colonialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1206331212453676">Andaya &amp; Andaya, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1206331212453676">Bowie &amp; Unger, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1206331212453676">Harper, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1206331212453676">Jin-Bee, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1206331212453676">Turnbull, 1980</xref>). The influence of colonial power did not suddenly cease after independence. English law is incorporated in the legal system and this shapes the trajectory of urban growth in the country. For example, the Town and Country Planning Act of 1976 is still used by the federal and local governments to plan towns and cities based on the functional roles of each town to serve the overall development of the nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1206331212453676">Hassan &amp; Salleh, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding that imperialist zoning is much criticized by anthropologists, sociologists, economists, and policy planners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1206331212453676">Bunnell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1206331212453676">Harper, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1206331212453676">Mahathir, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1206331212453676">Shamsul, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1206331212453676">2005</xref>), the zoning of Cyberjaya reveals a similarity to this hypermodernist ideal of “the perfect city.” The attempt to create an elite residential community reflects the concept of the gated community, where accessibility is defined through membership and ownership of the living facilities. Therefore, the implication of constructing this elite community would mean physically and socially separating the nonprivileged from the privileged. In terms of the physical implications, this elite zoning is characterized by the separation of work, leisure, and living areas. The working area has a prominent position in this city. The centralization of the central business district suggests that in this zoning process, office work–related activities are highly prioritized. As pointed out by Mr. Sham, a local council representative,
<disp-quote>
<p>This place focuses more on the office area. That is my impression when I first enter this place. The office area is prominent. (Personal communication, September 15, 2005)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Supporting this primary zone are commercial, living, and leisure zones. Housing areas are designed and designated to be at the periphery of the city, which indicates separation of life and work and the (literal and figurative) centrality of the latter. A one-stop public space that caters for dining, shopping, postal, and transportation services is located near the business district so that these facilities are easily accessible to its inhabitants and users. In addition, recreational places, such as the cultural centre, the lake, and the mosque (the latter is under construction), are located at the periphery of the city.</p>
<p>This city zoning has taken into account the idea of a “Malaysian mould” (<italic>acuan sendiri</italic>), as embedded in Vision 2020. This Malaysian mould represents an attempt to construct a cosmopolitan society that is “knowledgeable and morally sound” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1206331212453676">Gomez &amp; Jomo, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1206331212453676">Mahathir, 1991</xref>). The planners have assumed that zoning and physically separating different areas will make it more attractive for the knowledge industry workers to populate the city. From the planners’ viewpoints, specific area zoning will be attractive because it offers systematic spatial order for the city. What is de-emphasized, therefore, is the facilitation of diverse sociality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1206331212453676">Boyer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1206331212453676">de Certeau, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1206331212453676">Jacobs, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1206331212453676">Latham, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1206331212453676">Low, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1206331212453676">Rossiter &amp; Gibson, 2003</xref>). The ability to engage in activities such as shopping, eating, going to movies, and running errands in one place is what usually makes a city attractive to its inhabitants and visitors. People often express a need to feel at ease when they are in a city. They want to enjoy the city experience where access to various facilities is convenient. In contradistinction, zoning in Cyberjaya makes it difficult to gain access to various facilities. Among the main problems associated with zoning is the distance from one area to another. For example, the distance between CyberHeight Villa (a housing area) to the Lake and Mini-Park is about 2 to 3 kilometers, which is quite far if a person considers walking to reach those recreational places. This physical constraint, which is the direct consequence of zoning, leads to the phenomenon of a limited social experience among its inhabitants and visitors.</p>

<title>The Second Axis: Sterility</title>
<p>Apart from zoning, a significant aspect of planning propagated and implemented in this place is <italic>sterility</italic>. In <italic>Purity and Danger</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1206331212453676">Mary Douglas (1966)</xref> argues that the idea of purity is associated with order. Invoking the concepts of boundary and cleanliness, she draws up a link between the management of corporeality and sociality. To be clean is to be in order and to be dirty is disruptive to the system of order. As Douglas points out, the sterility concept is not new. It has been practiced by primitive and religious communities throughout history. The link with religion is made explicit in the dream-work of Cyberjaya, as orderliness and cleanliness are positioned as hallmarks of Islamic morality. At the same time, similar notions of sterility, that is, the associations between dirt, shame and disorder, are key to the modernist utopian city.</p>
<p>In the case of Cyberjaya, the concept of sterility can be associated with a particular doctrine of Islam. In the city’s planning, the state introduced the Total Planning Doctrine (TPD)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1206331212453676">7</xref></sup> as an attempt to overcome the potential degradation of the environment as a result of a city growth. TPD has its roots in Islamic ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1206331212453676">Bunnell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1206331212453676">Salleh &amp; Meng, 1999</xref>). This doctrine upholds four main criteria in urban planning: “Man and His Creator,” “Man and Man,” “Man and Nature,” and “Man and Technology” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1206331212453676">Bunnell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1206331212453676">Salleh &amp; Meng, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1206331212453676">Setia Haruman, 2002</xref>). However, we are going to focus only on the concept of “Man and His Creator” in association with the discussion of the issue of sterility here. In Islam, man is a vice-regerent of God and is responsible for abiding by God’s rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1206331212453676">Ahmad, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1206331212453676">Hamid, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1206331212453676">Hathout, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1206331212453676">Islahi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1206331212453676">Mawdudi, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1206331212453676">Norcliffe, 1999</xref>). One of the pivotal principles of practicing Muslims, according to Quranic teachings and the Traditions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon Him), is cleanliness or purity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1206331212453676">Ahmad, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1206331212453676">Hamid, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1206331212453676">Hathout, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1206331212453676">Islahi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1206331212453676">Mawdudi, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1206331212453676">Norcliffe, 1999</xref>). Cleanliness in the Islamic perspective could be categorized into two dimensions: physical cleanliness and spiritual cleanliness. An illustration can be drawn from the verses in the Quran. The first reflects on physical cleanliness:
<disp-quote>
<p>O ye who believe! When ye prepare for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; rub your heads (with water); and (wash) your feet to the ankles. If ye are ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from offices of nature, or ye have been in contact with Women, and ye find no water, then take for yourself clean sand or earth and rub them therewith your faces and hands, Allah doth not wish to place you in a difficulty, but to make you clean, and to complete his favour to you, that ye may be grateful. (Al-Maidah [The Table Spread], 5: 6; Ali [Trans.], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1206331212453676">1997</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And on spiritual cleanliness:
<disp-quote>
<p>Remember He covered you with a sort of drowsiness, to give you calm as from Himself, and he caused rain to descend on you from heaven, to clean you therewith; to remove from you the stain of Satan, to strengthen your hearts, and to plan your feet firmly therewith. (Al-Anfal [Spoils of War, Booty], 8:11; Ali [Trans.], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1206331212453676">1997</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is without question that TPD is inspired by the history of Islamic urban planning. The philosophy of Islamic urban planning is reflected in the establishment of Medina, the first capital city of the Muslim world, after the migration of the Prophet Muhammad from Mecca to Medina in <sc>a.d</sc>. 622 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1206331212453676">Omer, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1206331212453676">2005</xref>). In Medina, the concept of sterility (cleanliness) was introduced in urban planning through the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon Him), who was the state leader for the new Islamic nation. To illustrate our point regarding urban planning and sterility in Islamic history, we will use the case of a market location in the city of Medina.</p>
<p>Medina was a prosperous trade city even before the migration of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon Him) from Mecca. In this city, most of the trading activities took place in various thriving markets in different parts of the city. When the Prophet took control of the capital, he instructed that the markets should be relocated to the center of the city for easy accessibility and close monitoring and also because of hygienic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1206331212453676">Omer, 2003</xref>). The location had to be neither too far from nor too close to the mosque and the housing areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1206331212453676">Omer, 2003</xref>). This was because of the odor, noise, and sanitation problems associated with market activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1206331212453676">Omer, 2003</xref>). During this period, the mosque was the central administrative centre for the state. Most of the policy was planned, discussed, and decided in the mosque. Instead of requiring the authorities to constantly monitor the cleanliness of the city, the relocation placed the market under the watchful gazes of the public who helped monitor the physical cleanliness of the vicinity. In tandem with the ideology of cleanliness in Islamic urban planning, the planners of Cyberjaya attempted to incorporate the concept of a “sterile” environment in the city.</p>
<p>Cyberjaya is built on the concept of complete sterility, with state intervention in maintaining the cleanliness of the city. As is being promoted in the marketing brochures, this city attempts to offer a zero-pollution environment. This promise reflects the serious intent of the state to be completely vigilant of the problems of urban pollution, such as littering on the streets and graffiti at bus stops<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1206331212453676">8</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1206331212453676">Setia Haruman, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1206331212453676">MSC, 2004</xref>). This obsession with cleanliness is linked to the commercial aspect of the city, whereby the state attempts to sell an image of a city that is a hygienic and healthy place for people to work and live in. Thus, the sterility element has been repeatedly used as one of the marketing selling points for the state in promoting Cyberjaya to potential investors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1206331212453676">MSC, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1206331212453676">Setia Haruman, 2002</xref>). To achieve the goal of a zero-pollution environment, not only is the local state council involved in the general cleanliness of the city, the state also employs private companies to maintain the cleanliness of specific locations in the city, such as at the bus station, the shopping mall, the open-air food centers, the playground, and the lake.</p>
<p>It is clear how the concepts of sterility and zoning intersect. Absolute functional differentiation is traditionally a means to reduce ambivalence. Overlaps are considered to be problematic because they prevent a univalence of space and purpose. Moreover, sterility is an antidote for ambiguity. When it is clear what belongs where, there is no question about borderlines; there is no issue of conceptual pollution. Anything that is “matter out of place” (waste) immediately shows up and can be removed.</p>
<p>Most of the public places are clean but are also devoid of life as there is almost nobody hanging out at the coffee shops during the weekends. However, without ambiguity, there is no place for strangers. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1206331212453676">Benjamin (1999)</xref>, loitering made the modern city inhabitable. Litter creates a certain degree of homeliness; representational spaces emerge from the waste left behind others as traces that “someone has been here before.” Perhaps it is because of this that when everything is so clean, people feel less welcome in the city.</p>
<p>On a practical level, this is exacerbated because every movement is being monitored; there is no privacy as one is constantly visible. The cleaners who work for 12 hours every day are very concerned about the cleanliness of the vicinity under their responsibility, as they in turn are being monitored and scrutinized daily by their supervisors. The cleaners are provided with daily timetables and they have only 2 hours of break daily. They work 6 days per week. Because of the constant surveillance from their supervisors, the cleaners are very particular about the condition of the place. Their almost super efficient efforts to ensure the cleanliness of the space under their watch has, perhaps, contributed to the uneasiness felt by members of the public in using the public places in the city.</p>

<sec id="section6-1206331212453676">
<title>The Third Axis: Community</title>
<p>A planned city like Cyberjaya starts from the idea of providing order in a community through its priorities of zoning and sterility. Nevertheless, a city without a community is a ghost city. Drawing on the concept of “Man and Man” in the TPD, which is the basis of community planning in Cyberjaya, the planners try to incorporate <italic>kampong</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1206331212453676">9</xref></sup> that is, community values, in building a community in this city.</p>
<p>In English, the closest translation of kampong is the term <italic>village</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1206331212453676">10</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1206331212453676">Asrul, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1206331212453676">Bunnell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1206331212453676">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1206331212453676">Khoo, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1206331212453676">Mahathir, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1206331212453676">Thompson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1206331212453676">Wall &amp; Callister, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1206331212453676">Wan Hashimah, 2005</xref>). A kampong community here refers to a traditional community where most of its members adhere to and practice specific cultural values. In the Malaysian context, a kampong can be associated with Malay, Chinese, or Indian communities; however, it is most commonly associated with the Malay culture rather than the other cultures, as historically, Malay peasants occupied most of the rural areas, which were known as kampong.</p>
<p>The concept of kampong, or perhaps “folk,” resembles the idea of <italic>Gemeinschaft</italic>, in which people are closely bonded through blood, marriage, and/or friendship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1206331212453676">Tönnies, 1935/2001</xref>). Collective values are celebrated, and the welfare of the majority supersedes individual priority. In the context of the MSC, particularly in the Cyberjaya project, the planners try to reinvent the concept of <italic>kampong</italic>. The ethos of kampong is thus re-created. They are trying to re-create the atmosphere of face-to-face (closeness), personal intimacy, belongingness, and homeliness in the completely artificial urbanized environment that is Cyberjaya. This attempt apparently contradicts the nature of the traditions of kampong itself, as they are normally practiced in a specific location by a specific kind of people (groups of people) who are connected socially and there is usually a form of moral binding—or solidarity in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1206331212453676">Durkheim’s (1984)</xref> terminology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1206331212453676">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>To bring out or transfer the kampong traditions into a completely different environment is a huge task. However, astonishingly, this is exactly what the planners are trying to do experimentally in Cyberjaya. The city, although being the physical embodiment of alienation in the most profound way, has been constructed to be linked to the ethos of kampong. Leisure spaces such as the CyberView Lodge Resort and Spa, for example, have been constructed to be a commodity space. Yet these are privatized leisure spaces that attempt to be consolidated and harmonized with the kampong experience for those who can afford it.</p>
<p>Ironically, the idea of the MSC itself is but the idea of individualization. Thus, it might be an uphill struggle to articulate an ethos of collectivism. The spirit of individualization is different from the very essence of kampong values. It creates a different kampong, one that is viewed as a “contract kampong” (a form of association based on an explicit agreement sealed with signatures) where the social relationship has no long-term obligations and only occupation marks social status, whereas in the <italic>traditional</italic> kampong, it is about religious, moral obligations and family well-being (one cannot formally sign up to these relationships, the repeated work of “being obliged” has to be done on an everyday basis). Thus, the idea of Cyberjaya as a modern city is incongruent with the “basic” traditional concept of the kampong where collectivist values are adhered to and practiced religiously.</p>
<p>Zoning, sterility, and community define the utopian ideology of Cyberjaya. It is not difficult to see that these do not add up, and this becomes more evident when we consider empirically one specific phenomenon that is ubiquitous in Cyberjaya: gated communities.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section7-1206331212453676">
<title>Gated Communities</title>
<p>Like most of the residential areas in this city, Cyberjaya is monitored by security guards. However, in a residential vicinity such as the “Cyberia” development, the security is quite relaxed as most of the residents are students and young professionals. In contrast, The “D’Melor” building, for example, is tightly secured with a security guard monitoring the entry, and a resident would need a smart card to enter the living premises. Historically, the concept of a gated community—or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1206331212453676">Ellin (1997)</xref> usefully phrased an “architecture of fear”—entails living in a place that is designed to protect the residents from potential urban criminals (who are always on the outside). This architecture of fear has been implemented in Malaysia since the early days of British occupation. During the colonization era, most of the British officers and colonists lived in protected private enclaves or in bungalows located in rubber estates, with security guards who monitored the surroundings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1206331212453676">Azlinor, 2005</xref>). Nowadays, the gated communities are more subtle (e.g., an absence of armed guards) with the help of technology (surveillance as well as simple physical restrictions such as fences and gates). It is clear that Cyberjaya is part of a wealthy, developing modern state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1206331212453676">Azimudin, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Embedded in the construction of gated residential areas is the fear of “the others”—the strangers who might turn out to be potential criminals (murderers, robbers, rapists, drug dealers, street prostitutes, and burglars) and therefore must not be allowed near the living premises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1206331212453676">Davis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1206331212453676">Ellin, 1997</xref>). In other words, the priority of safety inhibits the possibilities to mingle with urban visitors and users of the city. Indeed, Cyberjaya is but one example of the spreading of the commercialized gated community, which has been popular in the United States, to the continents of Asia and Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1206331212453676">Azlinor, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1206331212453676">Blakely &amp; Synder, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1206331212453676">Landman &amp; Schönteich, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1206331212453676">Wu, 2005</xref>), even though it is clear that the roots of this lies not in the United States but in the colonized continents themselves. It is therefore very appropriate that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1206331212453676">Virilio and Lotringer (1997)</xref> refer to gated communities as forms of <italic>endocolonization</italic>. Principles of colonial rule have returned to the heartlands of the imperial order and are now “repackaged” as modern inventions and transported back to their places of origin as modern Western ideals.</p>
<p>Presently in Malaysia, the housing realtors or developers are banking on urban gated residential premises that feature security as one of the essential facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1206331212453676">Azlinor, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1206331212453676">Singh, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1206331212453676">Ying, 2005</xref>). Gated and guarded residential areas attempt to offer a different lifestyle from the normal urban lifestyle available in a city. For example, in suburban gated communities in Malaysia, the developers offer a “revitalized urban lifestyle”—superb landscape settings and views, generous and spacious living spaces, high surveillance systems, and privacy-guaranteed spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1206331212453676">Singh, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1206331212453676">Ying, 2005</xref>). However, the problem with these wall-and-fence gated communities is the exclusive social experiences that prevent nonmembers from establishing social contacts or interactions with the dwellers and discriminate against them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1206331212453676">Blakely &amp; Synder, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1206331212453676">Davis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1206331212453676">Ellin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1206331212453676">Marcuse, 2003</xref>). To a certain extent, these fortress communities seal themselves from “the others”—nonmembers—and constantly bank on “fear of strangers because of security reasons” as their defense in erecting the walls and fences around their houses. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1206331212453676">Davis (1998)</xref> reminds us,
<disp-quote>
<p>This obsession with physical security systems, and, collaterally, with the architectural policing of social boundaries, has become a zeitgeist of urban restructuring, a master narrative in the emerging built environment of the 1990s. (p. 223)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nonetheless, the obsession with this type of high-surveillance gated community has continued until now, and its implications or practices may vary from one country to another. In a city like Cyberjaya, the gated community leads to social isolation.</p>
<p>Before we argue further on the issue of social isolation in Cyberjaya, we would like to reflect on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1206331212453676">Mumford’s (1961)</xref> illustration of “loneliness in suburbia”:
<disp-quote>
<p>The town housewife, who, half a century ago . . . knew her butcher, her dairyman, her various other local tradesmen, as individual persons, with histories and biographies that impinged on her own, in a daily interchange, now has the benefit of a single weekly expedition to an impersonal supermarket, where only by accident is she likely to encounter a neighbour. If she is well-to-do, she is surrounded with electric or electronic devices that take the place of flesh and blood companions: her real companions, her friends, her mentors, her loves, her fillers-up of unlived life, are shadows on the television screen or even less embodied voices. She may answer them but she cannot make herself heard; as it has worked out, this is a one-way system. The greater the area of expansion, the greater the dependence upon a distant supply centre and on remote control. (p. 152)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even though the housewife who led the suburban lifestyle described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1206331212453676">Mumford (1961)</xref> did not live in a gated enclave such as those in Cyberjaya, both share a similar suburban living environment—less social contact with outsiders compared with those who live in terrace and semidetached houses, flats, and apartments in the Malaysian cities or close-knit communities like in the villages. In this city, lack of social interaction in these living areas is revealing, especially when most of the neighbors do not know each other well. Bearing in mind that this city’s economy is generated by IT professionals who are mostly in their late 20s and mid-30s, life seems to be dominated by young, ambitious, hardworking IT professionals with less time for leisure. One of the informants, Mr. Raju, an IT engineer from India, described life in this city as tailored for singles and not families. His statement intrigued me and led me to ask further about this, and he responded,
<disp-quote>
<p>In this city, it is quiet. People are more focusing on works rather than social life. If you are single, it is fine as you can adapt with the working lifestyle. But, if you have a family, it is rather different. My wife feels quite isolated here. She spends most of her time at home and sometimes she feels quite bored. We do not have a car and we do our grocery once a week. It is the only time when she can go outside and do some shopping. (Personal communication, July 14, 2005).</p>

<title>Minicities</title>
<p>Life is quiet in this city because there are “minicities” within the city. The phenomenon of the minicities emerged because of self-sustaining office buildings. Consequently, most of the social facilities are available in these organizational private spaces—refectories, rest areas, prayer rooms for Muslims, playing rooms, kitchens, and sometimes even gymnasium facilities. Thus, the office workers tend to spend more time consuming the private “social” spaces available in their organizations rather than in the public spaces in the city and outside of the organization’s physical boundaries. Those who do not belong to the organizations, or more specifically the non–office workers, such as the wife of Mr. Raju, need to find a Cyberjayan to hang out with. This has turned out to be quite a challenge, as most of the office workers rarely use the public spaces. On the other hand, Mrs. Hani, a retired librarian who lives with her younger son in the city, was trying to curb this social isolation by being mobile:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have a car which makes my life easier. I feel free to move around, for example, to do grocery and to run my errands. Yes, I stay most of the time at home but I am mobile each time I need to be. (Personal communication, July 27, 2005)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To her, the ability to be mobile makes her life bearable in this city. At least, in the case of Mrs. Hani, being mobile would make her life socially connected with others: shopkeepers in the city and friends and relatives in the nearby cities. There was one occasion when the developer had organized a ping-pong tournament and she tried to participate. However, the organizer subtly rejected her application by ignoring her phone calls, and when she turned up at the tournament, the officer in charge refused to talk to her. A few minutes later, one of the officers mentioned to her that, perhaps because of the vast number of participation responses, her phone application “might have been overlooked.” However, when we witnessed the tournament, there were less than four women players: The officer’s statement was clearly not true. It turned out that the main intention of organizing the tournament was not to promote integration among the community in the city but to attract the office workers to use or consume the public space in the city. There was no real interest to consider others (non–office workers) to be part of Cyberjaya. Contrary to the officially propagated community spirit, this one-off event is created for inhabitants of the minicities called “businesses organizations” and not for those on the outside. Thus, individuals like Mrs. Hani are further detached from “organized” social activities in the city. Critically speaking, therefore, community-building in the city is not a material node where kampong can be engineered through a table tennis tournament, as not all citizens are invited and included (let alone welcome) to join these “social” activities designed to provide a platform to establish associations.</p>
<p>This phenomenon of social isolation also affects single people who live in this city. Nonetheless, as most of the singles who stay in the city are IT professionals, they spend most of their time in their office buildings—working and socializing. John, an IT professional of Indian nationality who has been working in the city since its inception, described his experience:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is not like I don’t have anything to do at my apartment. When I go home, I usually prefer to rest—watch television or listen to radio. I spend most of my time in the office with my colleagues. On the weekend, sometimes, the company organizes salsa (i.e., dancing event) for those who are interested and I join the event whenever possible. The company always tries to organize social activities for the staff who are interested to join in. (Personal communication, July 27, 2005)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Perhaps, recognizing the lack of social activities or events in the city, the company where John works attempts to accommodate the social needs of the office workers by organizing salsa events on the weekend. Most large corporations adopt a similar approach to John’s company. These social events, which were exclusive to office workers, tended to detach them from their neighbors as they were presented with the opportunities to socialize with their colleagues through specific events—visiting tourist spots, attending company dinners in hotels, joining intercompany sports competitions, and even entering singing competitions in the company. As a result, the IT professionals seemed to be more attached to their office colleagues than to their neighbors. The implication for the engineering of “sociality” in this city (in this case as anchored in communal spaces) has been rather negative. Building kampong remains a privatized affair.</p>

<title>Exclusive yet Lifeless Urban Space</title>
<p>While cruising Cyberjaya, I could see that most of the commercial areas were not vibrant enough for the residents and users of the spaces in the city. One example is the Street Mall—the “must visit” commercial space in the city. It was easily accessible from D’Melor, Cyberjaya Mini Park, the Multimedia University, and Cyberia. The Street Mall is the most frequently used social place in the city. It mainly attracts visitors, office workers, and inhabitants of the city to stop for a break. It houses restaurants, cafeterias, a laundry, a photo shop, a florist, a beautician, a stationery shop, a printing shop, a bakery, a boutique, a DIY (do-it-yourself) hardware store, and a property agent office. There is a 24-hour restaurant that keeps the place alive at all times. It is full mainly during lunch breaks on the weekdays when most office workers come to have their lunch. Outside of lunch hours, most of the restaurants and cafés are usually quiet, without much happening.</p>
<p>Opposite the Street Mall is Perhentian Cyberjaya. Apart from being a bus station in the city, this complex also houses food outlets, a small convenience store, and a post office. A similar pattern can be seen at this place: It is usually busy during the lunch hours on weekdays. Most of the commercial areas, including Perhentian Cyberjaya, are empty during weekends. Only the food outlets at the Perhentian Cyberjaya offer affordable prices for food and drinks, whereas other eating outlets were just, simply put, rip-offs. It is obvious that these areas are not designed for everybody. The developers of these areas have mainly targeted an elite group of high-level office workers who could afford a meal here.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the concept of the elite as relating to the upper-most class in the social stratification system in Malaysia is normally defined via accumulation of wealth, family prestige, and political power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1206331212453676">Hirschman, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1206331212453676">Klitgaard &amp; Katz, 1983</xref>). However, nowadays, the concept of the elite has changed. Rather than focusing on family prestige and political power, it tends to be molded by two main factors: accumulation of wealth and career achievement of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1206331212453676">Abdul Rahman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1206331212453676">Gomez, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1206331212453676">Shamsul, 1998</xref>). In the context of Cyberjaya, we use the term <italic>elite</italic> to refer to highly skilled individuals in their areas of expertise, such as software engineers and telecommunication analysts. Usually they are highly educated in their fields and enjoy lucrative salaries.</p>
<p>The food center at the Century Square office building, the Chinese restaurant at the Cyberview Garden, and the coffee house in the Cyberview Lodge Resort and Spa offer food and drinks at rather high prices. As voiced out by one of the users of the Street Mall, Miss Tina, an office worker in a multinational company in the city,
<disp-quote>
<p>This place is not for everyone. Not everybody could afford to dine in the restaurants and cafés. Compared to Perhentian Cyberjaya, the food prices were more affordable. Nevertheless, the quality of the food, the convenient atmosphere, i.e., the air-conditioned cafés and restaurants, and the service always come with the price. (Personal communication, October 14, 2004)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The above statement suggests exclusivity of the commercial space in the city, specifically the restaurants and the cafés. The construction of these elite eating outlets could be seen as a reflection of segregating the non-elite, as observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1206331212453676">Latham (2003)</xref>: “Bars, cafes and restaurants have been recognized as playing a significant role in the accounts of gentrification” (p. 1706). Such a statement perhaps is not too strange to urban ethnographers. In her ethnographic account of public space in Costa Rica, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1206331212453676">Low (1999)</xref> argues that urban social space such as cafés are a part of the important promotional assets that are used by the city council to attract local elites and tourists.</p>
<p>Although one could suggest that the Cyberjaya planners’ aim in creating exclusive eating places is to establish an elite identity of the city, as indicated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1206331212453676">Low (1999)</xref> for Plaza de la Cultura (an elite public space in Costa Rica), not everyone could afford to dine in these places. Furthermore, those office workers who work in large companies are provided with “in-house” refectories that, according to the customers—the employees, the neighboring office workers, and the company’s visitors—offer tasty meals at cheaper prices.</p>
<p>Recognizing the problem of empty social spaces, the users and the residents have urged the developer to consider opening more affordable shopping outlets or at least cafeterias for people who want to hang out and take a break after their exhausting working hours or for those who want to socialize and spend their free time in social spaces. Especially those who do not work in self-contained office buildings would appreciate more affordable eating outlets compared with their colleagues who work in those office buildings. Miss Zura, who works in shared office buildings, argued,
<disp-quote>
<p>I think the planners need to consider building up cheaper coffee shops, food courts or food stalls which are relatively affordable for many. At the moment, the only place which I and my friend could think of to hang out is the Street Mall but as you know the cost of a cup of coffee is pricey! (Personal communication, October 14, 2004)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She was not alone in believing that by opening more affordable social places, the city would attract more businesses in the future and eventually encourage more visitors and users to use these places. In the absence of this, the Cyberjayans seem to choose other social spaces. For example, Miss Chan and her colleagues travelled to the nearby towns’ food stalls for lunch. Or in the case of Miss Tina, she would stick to eating in the company cafeteria, which according to her is more affordable compared with certain eating places in the city.</p>
<p>What is more, there are not many social activities available in these social spaces. There is no cinema, no bowling alley, and no affordable or cheap cafeterias for people to hang around. During the evening, there is no social life in this city. It seems to sleep as night descends. The question is, how to breathe life into a city without widely accessible, affordable facilities?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1206331212453676">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The findings from the fieldwork reveal that there are conflicting expectations among planners, citizens, and the business community in interpreting the appropriate social experience of the city. On one hand, the planners attempt to create a self-sustained city by providing working, housing, shopping, and relaxing areas and facilities. These areas are explicitly zoned, with great emphasis on cleanliness and in certain places on rather high surveillance to mark the state of order that characterizes the city. However, the impact of rigid zoning, extreme urban sanitation, and rather tight surveillance imposes rather negative social experiences on the city inhabitants, users, and visitors. First, spatial separation of areas through zoning leads to difficulty in consuming commercial and recreational facilities. This phenomenon then contributes to car culture and silent pedestrian streets. For example, the distance from CyberHeight Villa to the Street Mall is about 2 kilometers; thus, instead of walking, most dwellers prefer to drive. Second, exclusive commercial spaces—restaurants and cafés—are mostly empty except during lunch time. The business communities are feeling the heat and the office workers seem to choose eating at comparatively cheaper places, that is, the companies’ refectories or other towns’ food stalls. Third, the phenomenon of social isolation among the city inhabitants who live in the “fortressed communities” affects mostly individuals who are not working or who are deprived of transport facilities. However, for those who are working in the city, social isolation is seemingly not a huge problem. The companies are quite active in organizing social activities to occupy their nonworking hours.</p>
<p>Actually, our findings bring to mind the ideology of “non-place,” as illustrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1206331212453676">Augé (1992/1995)</xref>. Augé described a non-place as a place without history, memory, and identity, as opposed to the anthropological idea of “place,” where history, memory, and identity play significant roles in understanding the meaning of the place. He further argued that non-places are not the end of places but rather complement the existence of places. The non-place exists in the form of standardized architecture and facilities such as “airports and railway stations, hotel chains, leisure parks, large retail outlets . . .” (p. 79). It serves a functional purpose for its users and acts as impersonal space that does not confer any sense of belonging on the users. Having said that, Cyberjaya city is like a non-place but with different flavor; it is not like a regular non-place. It is like a lifeless non-place as it has no social life; it has only limited or “pocketed” social life.</p>

<p>TPD is state intervention urban planning that tries to incorporate a spiritual/religious element in shaping the urban development of cities in Malaysia and, in this particular case, Cyberjaya city. This doctrine attempts to attain a balanced and sustained development from economic, social, spiritual, and environmental aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1206331212453676">Salleh &amp; Meng, 1999</xref>).</p>

Although this has not been a key part of the research, it can be argued that the very fact that Cyberjaya was being explicitly associated with kampong as part of the discourse of planning suggests that Tarde was right: Sociality is the <italic>consequence</italic> of acts of association, which are in actual fact forms of repetition and imitation (Cyberjaya as an imitation of kampong), and not a preexisting entity.</p>
