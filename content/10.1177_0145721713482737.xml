<title>Purpose</title>
<p>This research evaluated the level of influence that having type 1 diabetes (T1DM) has on responses to questions about food choices, eating concerns, dietary restraint, and others that are included on two widely used, validated eating disorder (ED) questionnaires and examined responses to these two questionnaires from patients with T1DM and an eating disorder (ED-T1DM) and an ED-no-diabetes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0145721713482737">
<title>Method</title>
<p>An expert panel rated each item on the Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and Eating Disorders Inventory, version 3 (EDI-3) regarding T1DM level of influence on item interpretation. These questionnaires were completed by 2 matched samples (ED-T1DM, n = 48 and ED-no-diabetes, n = 96); responses were compared between the samples with particular attention to items of high T1DM influence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0145721713482737">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The expert panel identified that 50% (19/38) of the items on the EDE-Q and 6.6% (6/91) on the EDI-3 could be highly influenced by having T1DM. Before Bonferroni correction, the 2 groups responded statistically different on 9 out of 38 items on the EDE-Q and 27 out of 91 items on the EDI-3; generally responses were healthier for those with ED-T1DM than ED-no-diabetes. Of these items, on the EDE-Q, 5 were rated high T1DM influence and on the EDI-3, 3 were rated high.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0145721713482737">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Having T1DM influences responses on ED questionnaires developed for the general population. This influence may be greater when questionnaires focus on eating, weight, and shape and result in misinterpretation of total and subscale scores by even well-trained clinicians. A careful review of individual item responses by the treatment team is warranted.</p>

<p>Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) requires a careful balance of monitoring food intake, activity level, and insulin dosing to achieve glycemic control and prevent weight gain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721713482737">1</xref></sup> Such careful attention to food intake and body weight paired with the emphasis on thinness portrayed in the media and adopted by Western cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721713482737">2</xref></sup> may unduly lead those with T1DM to develop an eating disorder (ED).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721713482737">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721713482737">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many clinicians are not trained in the assessment of eating disorder behaviors and concerns and instead may rely on validated self-report questionnaires to provide a barometer of patient functioning. However, standard ED questionnaires designed for the general population may not be sensitive enough for use with individuals with diabetes. Specifically, the currently available questionnaires for assessing ED symptomatology may not discriminate between the necessary attention to food, body weight, and exercise required to manage diabetes compared to the unusual attention to eating, weight, shape, and unhealthy weight control behaviors experienced by someone with an ED.</p>
<p>In a recent study, Powers and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721713482737">5</xref></sup> looked at differences in total and subscale scores on 2 common validated ED questionnaires completed by persons with an ED and type 1 diabetes (ED-T1DM) and those with an ED with no diabetes (ED-no-diabetes). The 2 questionnaires were the Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721713482737">6</xref></sup> and the Eating Disorders Inventory, version 3 (EDI-3).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721713482737">7</xref></sup> They found that there were only a few significant differences in total and subscale scores between ED patients with and without diabetes. Curiously, the findings suggested that ED patients with diabetes were healthier than their peers without diabetes on the items measuring dietary restraint, shape concerns, and drive for thinness, as well as assessment of mood. The authors concluded that the perceived “healthier” profile for ED patients with diabetes may be reflective of appropriate attention to the diabetes regimen or may indicate a temporary better position at the beginning of treatment compared to those without diabetes.</p>
<p>To further investigate this finding and determine whether these 2 commonly used, psychometrically sound ED questionnaires are appropriate for measuring the presence and severity of ED symptoms in patients with diabetes, the researchers sought to (1) determine, by expert panel, if having T1DM would influence how one responded to individual items on the 2 questionnaires and (2) identify, on completed questionnaires, what items are responded to differently by those with T1DM versus those without diabetes. For example, would having T1DM influence one’s response to statements such as “Have you been afraid of losing control over eating?” or “Have you tried to avoid eating any food which you like in order to influence your shape or weight?” differently than the general population who may or may not have an eating disorder.</p>
<p>Thus, the current investigation aimed to examine the utility of widely used self-report ED questionnaires in patients with an ED and diabetes by understanding how T1DM might influence individual items on the questionnaires. Despite the number of individual items that relate to eating behaviors and body weight, no one, to our knowledge, has systematically conducted such a detailed review and determination about the influence of T1DM on responses.</p>

<title>ED Questionnaires</title>
<p>This research focused on individual items in 2 commonly used validated ED questionnaires that specifically address food and body shape/weight issues.</p>
<p>The Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721713482737">6</xref></sup> is a 38-item self-report questionnaire that asks specific questions pertaining to the presence and frequency of ED behaviors, thoughts, and feelings about the respondent’s body over the past 28 days. The EDE-Q is derived from the interview version of the Eating Disorders Examination and has 4 subscales: Dietary Restraint, Eating Concern, Weight Concern, and Shape Concern. Mean scale scores (and standard deviations) among young Australian adult women are: 1.30 (1.40) for Dietary Restraint, 0.76 (1.06) for Eating Concern, 1.79 (1.51) for Weight Concern, and 2.23 (1.65) for Shape Concern;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721713482737">8</xref></sup> mean scores (and standard deviations) among undergraduate women in the United States are similar: 1.29 (1.41) for Dietary Restraint, 0.87 (1.13) for Eating Concern, 1.89 (1.60) for Weight Concern, and 2.29 (1.68) for Shape Concern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721713482737">9</xref></sup> Higher scores indicate greater pathology across the 4 subscales. The EDE-Q has been found to have good concurrent validity and criterion validity among community samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721713482737">10</xref></sup> and good internal consistency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721713482737">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721713482737">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Eating Disorders Inventory version 3<sup>7</sup> is a reliable and valid 91-item multidimensional self-report instrument that assesses characteristics of eating disorders and related psychological concerns across 12 primary scales: Drive for Thinness, Bulimia, Body Dissatisfaction, Low Self-Esteem, Personal Alienation, Interpersonal Insecurity, Interpersonal Alienation, Interoceptive Deficits, Emotional Dysregulation, Perfectionism, Asceticism, and Maturity Fears.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721713482737">7</xref></sup> On a 6-point Likert scale, individuals indicate how often they engage in the queried characteristics, with higher scores indicating worse symptomatology.</p>

<sec id="section7-0145721713482737">
<title>Expert Panel: Influence of T1DM on Individual Items</title>
<p>An expert panel was convened to evaluate all items in 2 validated ED questionnaires to determine if having T1DM would influence one’s response to an item. The panel included a pediatric endocrinologist, psychologist specializing in ED treatment and research, research scientist with a specialization in diabetes, nurse with specialization in diabetes and ED treatment, dietitian with specialization in diabetes and ED treatment, statistician with a specialization in ED, and research assistant. Two members of the expert panel personally have T1DM and 2 specialize in providing treatment for patients with both EDs and T1DM.</p>
<p>The panel met a priori to discuss and categorize questionnaire items by level of T1DM influence (low, moderate, high). They established criteria for each level, which is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721713482737">Table 1</xref>. The 7 experts independently rated each item using a 1 to 4 Likert response scale (not at all influenced by having T1DM to strongly influenced by having T1DM). Then, the panel met to discuss disparate results and make final determinations using the 3 categories of low, moderate, or high level of influence. This established a level of T1DM influence for each item in the 2 ED questionnaires by expert panel consensus.</p>

<title>Patient Responses to Individual Items</title>
<p>To determine if items of high influence were responded to differently by those with ED-T1DM versus ED-no-diabetes, a 1:2 case-controlled matched sample was used. The patient sample consisted of 48 patients with ED-T1DM who had an intake assessment at Park Nicollet Melrose Institute (a specialized ED treatment center) between January 1, 2005, and October 31, 2008, and 96 matched controls with ED-no-diabetes, previously described in more detail.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721713482737">5</xref></sup> Individuals with ED-no-diabetes were matched to the ED-T1DM sample on the following data points from initial ED assessment: gender, age at and date of assessment, recommended ED treatment milieu (ie, inpatient, outpatient), body mass index (BMI) at assessment, and ED behaviors (ie, restriction of food, vomiting, laxative use, withholding insulin). This study was approved by Park Nicollet Institute Institutional Review Board.</p>
<p>The mean ages at initial assessment of those with ED-T1DM and ED-no-diabetes were 26.2 years (SD = 10.3) and 26.1 years (SD = 10.3), respectively, and median BMI measurements were 23.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range, 10.4-45.2) and 22.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range, 9.0-40.2), respectively. Gender was 47 female (97.9%) and 1 male in ED-T1DM versus 94 female (97.9%) and 2 male in ED-no-diabetes. Recommended treatment milieu for ED-T1DM was 35 (72.9%) inpatient, 10 (20.8%) outpatient, 3 (6.3%) other; treatment milieu for ED-no-diabetes was 72 (75.0%) inpatient, 21 (21.9%) outpatient, 3 (3.1%) other. Those with ED-T1DM were diagnosed with diabetes at 13.9 years (SD = 9.8). Average time between diabetes and ED diagnoses was 10.2 years (SD = 9.4 years), with the vast majority (93.8%; n = 45) diagnosed with T1DM prior to being diagnosed with an ED. The average A1C value at initial assessment was 11.0% (SD = 3.2%; range, 5.8%-19.0%).</p>

<sec id="section9-0145721713482737">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>For the expert panel, the panelists’ ratings were tallied for each questionnaire item and an average level calculated for each item. Items were then discussed until majority agreement was reached on the final level of T1DM influence. The items of high influence were identified for each questionnaire and the distribution identified.</p>
<p>For the patient responses, analyses compared individual item responses of the ED-T1DM and ED-no-diabetes groups using the paired <italic>t</italic> test or Wilcoxon signed rank test if normality assumptions were not met. Testing was 2-sided with a significance level of α = 0.05. To adjust for multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni correction was applied (EDE-Q, α = 0.0013; EDI-3, α = 0.0005). Those items that were significantly different between groups were identified.</p>

<title>Patient Responses to Individual Items</title>
<p>The 2 groups (ED-T1DM and ED-no-diabetes) responded differently to individual items on each of the ED questionnaires. Before Bonferroni correction, statistical differences on 9 of 38 individual items (23.7%) of the EDE-Q and on 27 of 91 items (29.7%) of the EDI-3 were found. All differences indicated that those with ED-T1DM scored lower (less pathological) than those with ED-no-diabetes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0145721713482737">Table 3</xref> for EDE-Q and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0145721713482737">Table 4</xref> for EDI-3 findings). The greatest number of differences between the 2 patient groups suggest that those with diabetes have: a healthier dietary regimen; less engagement in extremely unhealthy means of losing weight; fewer concerns about dietary patterns; fewer concerns about satiety; fewer feelings about eating with body image, weight, bodily experiences, and emotions; and less extreme expectations for themselves.</p>

<p>After Bonferroni correction, 2 items remained significantly different between the 2 patient groups: EDE-Q item 2 (“Have you gone for long periods of time [8 hrs or more] without eating anything in order to influence your shape or weight?”) and EDI-3 item 40 (“I get confused as to whether or not I am hungry”<sup>a</sup>).</p>
<p>Of the 9 items on the EDE-Q that were found to be statistically different prior to Bonferroni correction between the 2 ED groups (patients with and without diabetes), 5 were rated by the expert panel to be of high and 4 of low influence that T1DM might have on the interpretation of the item. Three of these statistically significant, high levels of influence items were from the Dietary Restraint subscale and 1 was from the Eating Concern subscale; the additional high level of influence item that was significant between groups was for an item on the frequency of overeating.</p>
<p>Of the 27 significant items (before Bonferroni correction) on the EDI-3 between the 2 groups, 3 were rated by the expert panel to be high, 14 medium, and 10 low influence.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Due to the emphasis on careful monitoring of food intake and weight management in diabetes treatment and recent research that suggests that those with ED-T1DM might have a healthier relationship with food, weight, and shape than those patients with ED-no-diabetes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721713482737">5</xref></sup> we explored differences in individual item responses on 2 frequently used, validated ED questionnaires between those with ED-T1DM and ED-no-diabetes. Not surprisingly given the patient population, both ED groups’ total and subscale scores reached levels indicative of ED clinical impairment, and there were no overall statistically significant differences between groups. However, inspection of individual item responses suggest that those ED patients with diabetes engage less frequently in unhealthy behaviors and had fewer negative feelings about eating.</p>
<p>This inspection of the direction of individual items of difference suggests that diabetes treatment can positively influence a pattern of healthy eating in ED-T1DM patients. However, “healthier” responses to some items on standard ED questionnaires may more accurately reflect attention to recommended diabetes regimens versus a healthy attitude toward weight and shape, thus making it appear that the patient is healthier than he or she may be. Conversely, a lack of difference may be attributable to the integral, healthy tenets of diabetes care—awareness of food properties, appropriate intake limits, and healthy weight management.</p>
<p>The expert panel found that 50% of items on the EDE-Q, compared to only 6.6% on the EDI-3, could be highly likely to be interpreted differently depending on whether the respondent has diabetes or not. This particular finding is not surprising given that the EDE-Q items concentrate specifically on eating and weight and shape concerns whereas the EDI-3 assesses a broader spectrum of ED and related concerns that are not specific to eating, weight, and shape. Nonetheless, it is interesting that the items in which we believed T1DM could have a high level of influence concentrated around how and what to eat (including amount and quantity, frequency of eating, attention to carbohydrates, engagement in overeating, and eating in secrecy), interpretations of hunger, and feeling different and self-aware.</p>
<p>The expert panel discussion noted that most of the items that were considered to have a high T1DM influence on the interpretation of the item were those that could have more than one interpretation—one being more eating disorder focused and the other being more diabetes focused. For example, attention to the abdomen could be related to body shape/size dissatisfaction or, if the responder had diabetes, could be associated with the abdomen being a common injection site for individuals with diabetes.</p>
<p>As such, interpretation of scores on ED questionnaires, without consulting the patient, could yield false positives and false negatives. More specifically, a patient with diabetes may “seem” eating disordered if an ED questionnaire not specifically designed for patients with diabetes is scored traditionally and healthy diabetes management practices are not considered as one possible explanation for why the patient is paying attention to certain dietary practices. Alternatively, a patient with diabetes may “not seem” eating disordered if too many of his or her responses are attributed to healthy dietary management without further exploration of individual items.</p>
<p>As found in a recent study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721713482737">5</xref></sup> patients with ED-T1DM appeared healthier than their peers with ED-no-diabetes. Symptoms among patients with both an ED and T1DM may worsen during the course of treatment as they work toward normalizing their dietary intake and learn what can happen to their weight, shape, body image, and psychological concerns when their diabetes is more properly managed after a period of insulin misuse, binge-eating, or other ED symptom without significant consequence. However, no study to date has compared ED symptomatology among patients with and without diabetes over the course of ED treatment.</p>
<p>One possible solution to the problem of assessing EDs among patients with T1DM might be to design a diabetes-specific measure for capturing disordered eating information. While there are a number of self-report questionnaires available that gather information specific to an ED, such as the EDE-Q,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721713482737">6</xref></sup> the EDI-3,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721713482737">7</xref></sup> the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721713482737">12</xref></sup> and the Questionnaire of Eating and Weight Patterns–Revised (QEWP-R),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721713482737">13</xref></sup> these questionnaires are designed to capture general, diagnostic information on ED behaviors and related issues such as body dissatisfaction and concerns about eating. These questionnaires were not specifically designed (nor validated) for persons with diabetes, nor do they tease apart food-focused practices that are healthy for diabetes management from those that are unhealthy and considered an example of disordered eating.</p>
<p>The authors are aware of 2 ED questionnaires, the Diagnostic Survey for Eating Disorders–Modified (DSED-M<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721713482737">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721713482737">15</xref></sup>; modified from the Diagnostic Survey for Eating Disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721713482737">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721713482737">17</xref></sup>) and the Diabetes Eating Problem Survey (DEPS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721713482737">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721713482737">19</xref></sup> that have been tailored for use with individuals with diabetes. The DSED-M and DEPS were created to screen for ED symptomatology among individuals with diabetes mellitus and include diabetes-related items, such as intentional omission or underdosing of insulin for weight control purposes. Although the DSED-M and DEPS offer significant utility for assessing eating disturbances among individuals with T1DM, they are not widely used within this population and their items could influence the adoption of unhealthy behaviors among individuals who otherwise would not have engaged in insulin manipulation for weight control. Because the DSED-M and DEPS are tailored for use with the persons with T1DM, they were not appropriate for use in the current study as the comparison sample was patients with eating disorders but without diabetes.</p>
<sec id="section16-0145721713482737">
<title>Clinical Implications</title>
<p>We suggest that individual item responses on ED questionnaires by persons with T1DM be reviewed in the context of diabetes treatment rather than relying on each questionnaire’s subscale scores to best identify areas of unhealthy behaviors and treatment focus. Additionally, we advocate that clinicians and researchers in the field of EDs and diabetes not solely use questionnaire results, but rather include interviewing for optimal assessment. Furthermore, future research should seek to develop a diabetes-sensitive, non–symptom-suggestive screening tool for eating, weight, and shape disturbances that could be valuable in identifying those patients with diabetes at risk for the development of an ED.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0145721713482737">
<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>Strengths of the study include the use of a treatment-seeking, case-controlled sample of ED-T1DM patients with diverse symptoms, strictly matched to ED-no-diabetes patients on key variables from psychometrically sound eating disorder questionnaires, thus reducing the likelihood that the individual item differences are related to variability in ED presentation. Noteworthy limitations that can guide future research are the absence of a diabetes only (no ED) comparison group and the absence of questionnaire reassessment during the course of treatment, which could help to identify further or alternate differences in item responses as ED symptoms change.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0145721713482737" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In conclusion, individual item responses on the EDE-Q and EDI-3 for patients with ED-T1DM tend be lower (healthier) than those with ED-no-diabetes. However, these results do not diminish the need for appropriate, specialized treatment, as results for both groups suggest clinical impairment. We stress that the scores on many individual items, particularly those that could be highly influenced by having diabetes, be interpreted with caution or ultimately be discussed with the patient to accurately understand how the patient interpreted the item and came to his or her response. Continued research into the screening and identification of EDs in persons with diabetes is warranted.</p>
