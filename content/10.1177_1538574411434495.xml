<bold>Purpose:</bold> To compare the accuracy of inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement using a bedside technique guided by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) with a concurrent experience of filter deployment with fluoroscopic venogram imaging. <bold>Methods:</bold> From November 2006 to December 2009, 195 consecutive IVC filters were placed to prevent pulmonary embolism in 120 high-risk patients without lower limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and 75 patients with DVT and anticoagulation contraindications. Filter insertion techniques included bedside IVUS-guided (n = 97) and fluoroscopic-guided (n = 98) procedures. Before mid-2008, 2 bedside IVUS-guided protocols were used evolving from a single-puncture, pullback technique (n = 48), in which the measured distance from the venous access site to the IVC landing zone then allowed a calibrated reinsertion of a 7F delivery sheath and filter deployment. After mid-2008, a single puncture 8F sheath technique (n = 48) using IVUS to position the delivery sheath tip within the IVC landing zone without catheter or sheath measurement or reinsertion was used. Venous access was via the right femoral (84 IVUS and 56 fluoroscopy), left femoral (10 IVUS and 16 fluoroscopy), or right internal jugular vein (3 IVUS and 26 fluoroscopy). The 3 filter insertion techniques were compared for “optimal” IVC placement defined as the filter positioning between L1 and L4 vertebrae with tilt &lt;15° based on postprocedure abdominal x-rays or venography. <bold>Results:</bold> Filter malposition occurred with 6% (6 of 97) bedside IVUS-guided procedures with no malpositions during fluoroscopic imaging. Malposition was lower with the evolved sheath (4%, 2 of 48) compared with the earlier pullback (8%, 4 of 48) insertion technique (<italic>P</italic> = .03). The incidence of the filter malposition during IVUS-guided deployment was highest using left femoral access (4 of 10) compared with right femoral (2 of 84) or internal jugular (0 of 3) vein access (<italic>P </italic>&lt; .01). Filter tilt occurred more after IVUS-guided procedure (10 of 97) than fluoroscopic procedure (3 of 98; <italic>P </italic>= .05) and was most frequent for left femoral access (5 of 10 IVUS and 1 of 16 fluoroscopy; <italic>P </italic>&lt; .01) and was not related to filter type (<italic>P</italic> = .13). <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our current bedside IVUS-guided IVC filter technique using a single venous puncture and single sheath positioning has improved the placement accuracy. Left femoral venous access should be avoided to minimize the occurrence of filter malpositioning and tilt.</p>

<p>The placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter device to prevent life-threatening pulmonary embolism has evolved from a procedure performed in the operating room (OR) or angiography suite using fluoroscopic guidance to a bedside procedure using either duplex ultrasound, portable fluoroscopy, or intravascular ultrasound.<sup>

</sup> A bedside procedure using ultrasound imaging is advantageous, especially for the patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), since the risk associated with in-hospital transport of critically ill patients is eliminated, as is the need for intravenous contrast or radiation exposure to staff. Bedside procedures can be performed at any time and can avoid scheduling conflicts in the OR or angiography suite. The use of duplex ultrasound to image the IVC and guide catheter-sheath placement for filter deployment has been shown to be a safe and cost-effective technique, but large abdominal girth or bowel gas can interfere with adequate IVC imaging for accurate filter deployment and thus limits the application of this technique in many ICU patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574411434495">5</xref>
</sup> The application of IVUS for iliac vein and IVC imaging is not subject to limitations imposed by transcutaneous ultrasound imaging. Proper intraluminal cross-sectional image interpretation allows anatomic landmarks (hepatic parenchyma, renal vein origins, and crossing right renal artery) to be reliably identified for IVC filter deployment caudal to the renal veins. The application of IVUS-assisted IVC filter placement has been demonstrated in clinical reports dealing with care of the trauma and bariatric patient.<sup>

</p>
<p>Use of IVUS guidance during filter placement requires a minimum 8F introducer sheath for the 8-12.5 MHz transducer catheters to provide complete cross-sectional IVC and adjacent retroperitoneal structure imaging (ie, field of view &gt;4 cm). Use of smaller diameter filter delivery systems (6F and 7F) has necessitated either a double femoral venous puncture technique (parallel placement of IVUS and filter sheaths) or a single puncture with pullback of the IVUS catheter to measure the length from intended filter landing site in the IVC to the groin access site with the reinsertion of the filter delivery sheath to this measured length (with or without some length adjustment for different mechanisms of filter unsheathing/release). A newer and simpler technique utilizes a single venous puncture, introduction of a long 8F sheath for initial IVUS localization of the IVC landing site and sheath tip positioning, and final filter delivery and deployment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574411434495">10</xref>
</sup> Since mid-2008, we have employed this evolved technique (single puncture and single sheath) exclusively for bedside procedures. The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of IVC filter placement (location and tilt) guided by 2 different IVUS techniques against a concurrent experience of filters deployed with conventional fluoroscopy and contrast venography.</p>

<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-1538574411434495">
<title>Patient Cohort</title>
<p>A retrospective review of medical records, including abdominal x-rays obtained following IVC filter deployment, was conducted on 195 consecutive patients who underwent IVC filter placement by our vascular surgery service at a level 1 trauma, tertiary care institution from November 2006 to December 2009. Patient demographics were recorded, including underlying medical condition/injury, indication for filter placement (prophylactic and therapeutic), venous access site, filter type, and imaging technique used. Of them, 95% were hospital “in-patients” and the majority had vascular consults for IVC filters generated from an ICU. Our management algorithm during the study interval was based on implementation of bedside IVUS-guided techniques for IVC filter placement in November 2006. The selection of optimal hospital location for ICU patients for filter procedures was based on the assessment of the clinical status and relative physiological stability determined by critical care, trauma and vascular surgery staff, and the need for other operative procedures (eg, orthopedic, general surgical, and neurosurgical procedures). Hospital inpatients on medical/surgical wards, outpatients, and clinically stable ICU patients had IVC filters placed under standard fluoroscopy with contrast iliocaval venography (&lt;40 mL) in an angiographic suite. Patients requiring other surgical procedures had IVC filters placed in the OR with C-arm fluoroscopy and venography after initiation of general anesthetic and preceding other interventions. Clinically stable patients with renal insufficiency (serum creatinine of &gt;2.0 mg/dL) had filters positioned with both IVUS and fluoroscopy without contrast administration and performed in the OR or angiographic suite. Critically ill ICU patients with tenuous cardiac (eg, severe hypotension and shock), pulmonary (eg, high ventilator settings), neurological (ie, spinal cord injury or significant intracranial hypertension from closed head injury or intracranial hemorrhage), general surgical (eg, open packed abdominal wound), or orthopedic status (eg, complex traction for traumatic fractures or dislocations) were deemed temporarily unfit for in-hospital transport and considered instead for bedside IVC filter placements.</p>
<p>Lower limb venous duplex ultrasonography was performed in most of the patients before filter procedures to detect deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and aid selection of an uninvolved venous access site. If computed tomography (CT) imaging of the abdomen or pelvis had been performed prior to the requested IVC filter placement, the study was reviewed to assess for caval or iliofemoral thrombus, aberrant iliocaval anatomy, and to measure IVC diameter (the major axis dimension of an elliptical shaped IVC cross-section). However, CT imaging was not required prior to filter placements. The right common femoral was the preferred insertion site in all the patients but if the right lower limb or iliac DVT was found on ultrasound or preprocedural CT imaging then left femoral access was used. In 3 patients receiving bedside filters, a right jugular approach was used because of severe truncal/groin obesity precluding safe femoral access. The majority of jugular insertions in the fluoroscopy group were prophylactically done immediately before the bariatric procedures with the placement of a jugular central venous catheter after filter deployment.</p>

<sec id="section3-1538574411434495">
<title>IVUS-Guided Procedures</title>
<p>Bedside IVC filter placements were all performed in the ICU on monitored patients under sterile conditions with local anesthesia at venous access sites. An accompanying OR nurse assisted with skin preparation, sterile side-table and catheter set-up, and IVUS imaging adjustments. A single venous puncture was used in all but one of the 97 cases. A “pullback” technique was used before mid-2008 and began with the placement of a short 8F introducer sheath and advancement of a floppy-tip of 0.035 inch guidewire of at least 35-40 cm into the patient in the absence of any resistance. An 8.2-F, 10-MHz IVUS catheter (Visions PV 8.2, Volcano Corp, Rancho Cordova, California) was placed over the guidewire. Any persistent resistance encountered with wire or IVUS catheter advancement that could not be corrected by withdrawal/reinsertion mandated bedside termination and instead use of fluoroscopic guidance. Real-time IVUS cross-sectional imaging allowed the identification of hepatic parenchyma and veins, renal vein origins, the posteriorly crossing right renal artery, IVC, iliac veins, and the adjacent aorta and iliac arteries. Luminal diameters of the infrarenal IVC (the major axis dimension of an elliptical shaped IVC cross-sectional image) and the presence of any mural thrombus were noted. If significant aberrant venous anatomy (ie, transposed positions of IVC and aorta potentially related to IVC transposition or duplication or absence of clearly defined renal origins related to a retroaortic left renal vein) was suspected, then fluoroscopy and venography were performed instead. For the pullback technique, the length along the IVUS catheter was withdrawn from the lowest renal vein to the exit hub of the 8F sheath access site (measured in centimeters). This was done by placing a sterile circumferential sticker on the IVUS catheter at the hub of the 8F sheath, while the IVUS tip was positioned at the lowest renal vein. The IVUS catheter was slowly withdrawn over the guidewire, until the transducer tip exited the 8F sheath and a tape ruler measured the withdrawn length along the IVUS catheter. This length was then transposed onto the 7F filter delivery sheath measured from its open tip to a newly placed sterile circumferential sticker closer to the hub-end. The 7F filter sheath was then reinserted cephalad over the guidewire until the circumferential sticker on the sheath was at the skin puncture site at the venous access thus marking the proximal extent of the desired filter IVC landing site (average 32 cm from right femoral insertion site). Either Bard G2 filter (Bard Inc, Covington, Georgia) or Gunther Tulip (Cook Inc, Bloomington, Indiana) filters was deployed by a “pin-and-pull” method through the delivery sheath. After filter placement, the guidewire was carefully readvanced no more than 35 cm into the patient, the 7F delivery sheath was exchanged for the short 8F introducer, and the IVUS catheter reinserted to view only the lower portion of the expanded filter struts in the mid-distal IVC. The IVUS catheter was purposely not advanced into the more proximal filter or pararenal IVC to avoid potential filter dislodgement. A completion flat abdominal radiograph was obtained after sheath, catheter, and wire removal from the access site.</p>
<p>An “evolved” IVUS-guided technique<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574411434495">10</xref>
</sup> was used since mid-2008 through a single venous access site and employed the Celect filter (Cook Inc, Bloomington, Indiana) and its 8F delivery sheath. Over a guidewire, the filter sheath is inserted for a distance of 10-15 cm into the iliac vein from a femoral puncture site. The IVUS catheter is then advanced over the guidewire to identify iliocaval and adjacent structures as is described above. The IVUS catheter is positioned at the lowest renal vein origin, and the Celect delivery sheath is advanced over the IVUS catheter until the bright IVUS image at the intended IVC landing site darkens when the delivery sheath covers the IVUS transducer tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574411434495">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574411434495">2</xref>). With the sheath end at the planned proximal filter deployment location, the IVUS catheter and guidewire are removed, the Celect filter is introduced into the sheath, and the sheath is withdrawn to deploy the filter (pin-and-pull technique). The IVUS catheter is then reinserted through the sheath in the mid-distal IVC to confirm expanded filter struts abutting the IVC wall but not advanced further proximally to avoid filter dislodgement. A completion abdominal radiograph was performed after IVUS-guided procedures to assure proper device positioning.</p>

<title>Study Protocol</title>
<p>Since intraoperative and completion imaging differed between the patients having fluoroscopy-guided (caval venogram and final abdominal radiograph) and IVUS-guided (IVUS reinsertion after deployment and abdominal radiograph) procedures, review of all imaging was done to assess accuracy of filter positioning. A technically successful deployment was defined as a filter location between the L1 and L4 lumbar vertebra on plain radiograph without observed malpositioning during completion venography or IVUS reinsertion. Excessive device tilt of &gt;15° relative to the IVC wall (fluoroscopy-guided procedures with completion venogram) or a vertical line along the edge of the lumbar vertebral column (IVUS-guided procedures and fluoroscopy procedures without venography) was also deemed technically unsuccessful. Adverse events including access site hematoma or deep vein thrombosis, device malposition, need for filter retrieval/reposition or a second filter insertion were assessed from blinded review of all completion abdominal radiographs and review of hospital medical records. These procedural outcome measures are consistent with current recommended reporting standards.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574411434495">11</xref>
</sup> Contingency table analyses (Chi square) were used to compare the incidence of filter malpositioning and excessive tilt between fluoroscopy-guided and the 2 IVUS-guided techniques, between access sites for IVUS procedures and between 3 filter types used in the entire cohort.</p>

<p>Using IVUS or fluoroscopy guidance, IVC filter deployment was achieved in all the patients during the study interval. Of all the patients, 98% had filters placed under fluoroscopic guidance in an angiographic suite or in the OR. Of them, 12 were done in patients with significant renal insufficiency using both IVUS (to localize the IVC landing site and assess venous anatomy) and fluoroscopic guidance (to confirm correct radiographic positioning and proper filter expansion) to avoid contrast venography. These patients were considered in the fluoroscopy group for the outcome analyses. Of the 97 bedside filter procedures, 48 were done using the IVUS pullback technique, 48 were accomplished via the single puncture, single sheath technique, and a single patient required double puncture access and parallel IVUS and filter delivery/deployment. This latter patient was considered a technical failure of the pullback technique due to inability to accurately define the sheath reinsertion distance for intended IVC landing of the filter. No IVUS-guided procedures were abandoned due to difficult access, resistance to catheter/wire manipulation, suspected aberrant anatomy, inadequate imaging or equipment malfunction. No patients were noted to have significant aberrant anatomy (IVC transposition or duplication) or a severely enlarged IVC (&gt;28 mm diameter) precluding optional filter placement in the study cohort. In 1 patient, IVUS identified extensive iliocaval mural thrombus that had not been known by preprocedural imaging and allowed intentional suprarenal placement of the IVC filter. No access site hematomas were observed after deployments as all in-patients were reexamined the day following the filter placements. No venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolic events was documented in the medical records within 30 days of the procedures.</p>
<p>Six (3%) filters were judged to be malpositioned based on the location with 2 filters deployed above L1 vertebra (ie, suprarenal) and 4 filters below L4 vertebra (ie, iliac vein placements) with all filter malposition events occurring under IVUS guidance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1538574411434495">Table 3</xref>). The incidence of filter malposition was higher after bedside IVUS procedures using the pullback technique (8%; 4 of 48) than with the single sheath technique (4%; 2 of 48) or after fluoroscopy-guided procedures (0%; 0 of 98; <italic>P </italic>= .03). Use of left femoral vein access was associated with an increased incidence of filter malposition (40%; 4 of 10) with 3 devices deployed caudal to L4 and 1 proximal to L1 vertebra (<italic>P </italic>&lt; .01). Right femoral access resulted in only 2% (2 of 84) deployed outside (1 caudal and 1 proximal) the desired L1 to L4 landing zone. One filter deployed proximal to L1 was retrieved via a right internal jugular vein approach and repositioned in the IVC caudal to the renal veins. Three patients with iliac vein deployments had second filters placed in proper IVC locations.</p>

The incidence of tilt &gt;15° was not different between the 3 filter types used (Bard G2 4%, Cook Celect 11%, Gunther Tulip 14%, <italic>P </italic>= .13). As was seen for filter malposition, use of left femoral venous access was associated with the highest incidence of excessive tilt, especially for IVUS-guided procedures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1538574411434495">Table 4</xref>). Half (5 of 10) of IVUS-guided procedures done via left femoral access were associated with excessive tilt compared with right femoral (5%) or right internal jugular (33%) punctures (<italic>P </italic>&lt; .01). This tendency was not observed for filters placed via the 3 access sites done under fluoroscopic guidance (<italic>P </italic>= .35).</p>
<p>During follow-up, no episodes of filter or IVC thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (PE) were recorded in subsequent hospital or clinic records. However, only 20% of patients had documented medical follow-up beyond their incident hospitalization. One filter was retrieved as part of planned staged procedure 3 months following sarcoma resection when the patient was no longer deemed at high risk for venous thromboembolism.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The use of IVUS imaging to guide bedside IVC filter placement is associated with a learning curve. The first obstacle is in gaining familiarity with the cross-sectional IVUS images within the iliocaval venous system and identifying important axial landmarks (ie, iliocaval confluence, crossing right renal artery, and renal vein orifices). We recommend performing 5 or more initial procedures in the angiographic or operating suite using fluoroscopy to correlate radiographic axial positioning of the IVUS catheter tip with the real-time IVUS cross-sectional images within the iliocaval system. Localization of renal vein origins and the crossing right renal artery should correlate with radiographic IVUS tip positioning in the L1-L2 vertebral body region to assure proper IVUS image interpretation necessary to begin performing bedside filter procedures. While concern exists regarding recognition of aberrant venous anatomy during IVUS-guided procedures, infrequent occurrence as noted in this series did not negatively impact outcomes. A fraction of patients considered for bedside filter placements (eg, polytraumatic injuries) have existing abdominal/pelvic CT scans that should be reviewed for aberrant venous anatomy and IVC sizing. Recognition of normal venous anatomy and proper device positioning is assured through familiarity with expected cross-sectional IVUS appearance of the iliocaval segment, knowledge of typical insertion distances from groin to infrarenal IVC landing zones (30-35 cm), and ability to accurately measure major and minor IVC and iliac vein diameters to avoid treatment of megacavas (&gt;32 mm) and inadvertent iliac deployments (do not confuse a distended-appearing iliac vein for the IVC, measure it to assure diameter fits the vessel location). IVUS also accurately identifies significant mural thrombus in the iliocaval system that was not recognized on preprocedural venous duplex ultrasound in one of our bedside patients and facilitated safe suprarenal filter placement. Resistance encountered with initial guidewire or IVUS catheter advancement may indicate aberrant anatomy and should mandate abandonment of bedside approach and conversion to a fluoro-guided technique. Suspicion of IVC transposition or duplication during initial IVUS inspection should also mandate conversion to a fluoroscopic procedure.</p>
<p>The second obstacle lies in implementing a reliable IVUS-guidance method to accurately place filters within the infrarenal IVC. Our preferred technique has evolved to the use of IVUS imaging, a single vein puncture via the right femoral vein, and use of an 8F sheath as part of the Cook Celect or Tulip delivery systems. The “single sheath” technique was more precise in localizing the IVC segment caudal to the renal veins in which to position the sheath end based on real-time IVUS imaging when compared with the earlier pullback catheter technique. Potential error in sheath reinsertion distances with the “pullback” technique derive from inaccurately measured withdrawal lengths along the IVUS catheter especially in obese patients with redundant skin folds and abdominal pannus in groin access regions. Use of a double puncture technique allowed confirmation of proper IVC sheath positioning in 1 case, where difficulty assessing sheath insertion distance was encountered with the pullback technique. These potential errors are avoided with the use of the single sheath and single puncture technique.</p>
<p>Choice of venous access site also significantly influenced the accuracy of IVC filter placement done with bedside IVUS-guidance. Surprisingly, a high incidence of both filter malpositioning outside of the intended infrarenal IVC landing zone and excessive filter tilt occurred with left femoral access. This tendency was observed for both pullback as well as single puncture and single sheath techniques and suggests that the added angulation of the left iliofemoral venous system relative to the more vertically aligned IVC and right iliofemoral veins can adversely affect catheter and sheath tracking and positioning over standard softer guidewires used for bedside procedures. Filter deployments that are done blindly after sheath positioning under IVUS-guidance are more prone to malpositioning and excessive tilt especially from the left femoral access compared with real-time fluoroscopic deployments where minor sheath/filter positioning adjustments can be made during deployments to correct potential malpositioning or filter tilting. Many of these subtle maneuvers maybe unrecognized by the operator during “live” fluoroscopic imaging but similar “visual-tactile feedback” is not possible during “blind” bedside filter deployments after IVUS-guided sheath positioning. Similarly, because of the inability to reproducibly and safely direct the guidewire and IVUS catheter across the right atrium and into the IVC from a right jugular access site, we would recommend IVC filters needing placement from a jugular insertion to be performed under fluoroscopic guidance to avoid injury to the right atrium and ventricle. Our results support the safe delivery of bedside IVC filters under IVUS-guidance from a right femoral access site with the avoidance of left femoral or jugular insertions. Preprocedural venous duplex imaging is recommended to assure patency of right femoral access. Venous thrombosis of the right femoral vein or suspected within the more proximal iliac system requires left femoral access usage and filter placement done under fluoroscopic guidance.</p>
<p>Bedside placement of IVC filters using IVUS imaging represents an important management adjunct to treat critically ill patients within the ICU who are deemed unstable for transport within the hospital. The supplies (venous access catheter kits, injectable saline and syringes, guidewires, filter system, IVUS catheter, skin prep, and draping) required for sterile venous access and endovenous filter placement can be assembled as prereadied procedure packs that are stored in the OR. In our institution, an OR nurse accompanies the surgeon to perform patient and site verification as well as assist in the procedure. The availability of a portable IVUS imaging cart and sterile IVUS catheters allows the procedure to be taken to the ICU patient whenever the need is requested including at night and on weekends. However, this procedural portability could allow expansion of the technique to other patient care locations not necessarily possessing fluoroscopic imaging equipment (ie, imaging table with fixed or portable C-arm radiographic unit) such as the preoperative evaluation suite, office-based procedure rooms, or an out-patient surgical center. The other adjunctive benefit of IVUS-guidance for IVC filter placement occurs in patients with severe renal insufficiency, where standard venography is contraindicated. The IVUS-guidance with fluoroscopic imaging allows accurate IVC landing site identification and filter deployment without contrast dye administration.</p>
<p>As our institution is fairly conservative regarding the use of prophylactic retrievable filters, over one third of the filters placed in this cohort were done therapeutically after PE or lower torso deep vein thrombosis. All patients had severe contraindications to anticoagulation (ie, polytrauma and intracranial pathology) or had suffered hemorrhagic complications of anticoagulation. The safety of bedside filter placement in our series justifies application of the technique for prophylactic and therapeutic indications with later consideration of potential filter retrieval made on a “case-by-case” basis after the reevaluation of the patient to 1-3 months postprocedure. Efforts to maintain contact with patients receiving filters after their hospitalization are necessary and may include creation of a practice or office database of filter patients that requires periodic review and follow-up patient phone calls or mailings.</p>
<p>Our experience with bedside IVUS-guided filter placements mirrors that of other vascular groups in terms of safety, efficacy, and convenience (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1538574411434495">Table 5</xref>). Our 6% incidence of filter malposition is similar to the reported series (0-7%) using double puncture, pullback or single puncture, and single sheath techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574411434495">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574411434495"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574411434495"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574411434495"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574411434495"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574411434495"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574411434495"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574411434495"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574411434495"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574411434495">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574411434495">12</xref></sup> Filter tilt was recorded in only 3 of these institutional series, but we have shown that filter excessive tilt and malpositioning were most prevalent with procedures done via left femoral access and can be minimized with a single puncture, single sheath technique through a right femoral access site. Use of preprocedural duplex ultrasound to evaluate the right common femoral vein is recommended. Although previous studies have not included concomitant filter placements done with fluoroscopic guidance, we have included this group in this retrospective consecutive series as an important control to compare procedural outcomes and identify technical factors associated with adverse events after bedside IVUS-guided procedures.</p>
