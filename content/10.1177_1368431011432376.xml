<abstract>
<p>The key theme in this essay is the rethinking of the human, as inspired by the work of Giorgio Agamben and Hannah Arendt. The human here is not a model or concept to be realised, just as community to which the human is linked is not an ideal, but a ‘community to come’. This is revealed only by paying close attention to modes of bearing witness to the human, as instanced, for example, by Agamben’s text, <italic>Remnants of Auschwitz</italic>. Current notions of political community and the human thus need to be reassessed. Only by doing this will it be possible to address the crucial issues that currently confront human rights—issues such as the tension between the principle of universal human rights and that of state sovereignty, the growing problem of statelessness, and the reduction of human rights to biopolitical humanitarianism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In this essay, we attempt to rethink the human as prompted, in the first instance, by Hannah Arendt and Giorgio Agamben. Only by doing this will it be possible to address the crucial issues that currently confront human rights—issues such as the tension between the principle of universal human rights and that of state sovereignty, as well as the continual reduction of human rights to biopolitical humanitarianism. We recognise that ‘thinking the human’ is just the first step in a process that must include rethinking community, equality, politics and justice. A deeper understanding of these terms may ultimately constitute a challenge to a certain conception of the possibility of human rights. For the latter are commonly understood as the rights intrinsic to humanity as biological life, but are only capable at the present time of being actualised within the confines of the nation-state and a viable political community, or public sphere.</p>
<p>This paradox, whereby the proclaimed universality of human rights is belied by the fact that these rights are only meaningful if one is included within a particular political community,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1368431011432376">1</xref>
</sup> forms the basis of two major critiques of human rights put forward by Arendt and Agamben. For Arendt, as is well known, the plight of refugees and stateless people between the World Wars revealed the very impotence of human rights at a time when they were most needed. Because they lacked the protection of membership of a political community, stateless people had nothing to fall back on but their intrinsic rights as human beings, and yet this reliance on ‘bare life’ as a basis for the recognition of their rights confirmed their vulnerability and helplessness all the more, as there were no institutions or laws to enforce these rights. As Arendt concludes, what stateless people lacked was the fundamental ‘right to have rights’, in other words, the political and legal recognition that would come with being a member of a political community (see 1968).</p>
<p>For Agamben, whose critique of rights parallels, but also goes beyond Arendt’s, human rights, in their current form, are merely biopolitical rights (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368431011432376">Agamben 1998</xref>; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1368431011432376">Whyte 2009</xref>). That is, rather than emancipating us or protecting us from sovereign power, rights have the effect of further inscribing us—on the basis of our ‘bare life’—within the mechanisms of the biopolitical state, a state whose <italic>raison d’être</italic> in modernity is the government and regulation of the biological life of the population.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1368431011432376">2</xref>
</sup> Agamben, then, sees human rights (as currently invoked) as leaving us just as defenceless as they did for Arendt. Yet, they do so in a different way: rather than simply being the mark of exclusion from a political community, human rights define a field of subjectivity which, in a more intricate sense, is included (within the sovereign state order) <italic>in the form of its exclusion.</italic> Human rights, because they define the subject in terms of his or her ‘bare life’, situate him or her within a politico-legal field characterised by the ever-present possibility of the sovereign state of exception—the suspension of the normal constitutional order and the withdrawal of legal protections. Here, the subject is neither included nor excluded but, rather, held in what Agamben calls a ‘zone of indistinction’ between the two orders, and is thus entirely at the mercy of sovereign power. Thus, the other side of the subject of human rights is, for Agamben, <italic>homo sacer</italic>, the figure who may be killed with legal impunity and whose most extreme expression could be found in the Nazi camps (see 1998).</p>
<p>As a result, any serious reflection on human rights today must, we believe, engage with these critiques and reconsider the question of the human in relation political community and belonging.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1368431011432376">
<title>Agamben, Arendt and human rights</title>
<p>Both Agamben and Arendt agree that, under existing conditions, the nation-state determines who will benefit from the implementation of human rights, and that the status of merely being human (as implied by the human rights tradition) is not enough to ensure human rights protection. Unlike Arendt, for whom the category of <italic>zoē</italic> always points to what is not yet in the public sphere—and perhaps can never be, as it evokes necessity—and for whom it is only <italic>bios</italic> as a form of life that can give rise to the political properly speaking, Agamben sees contemporary politics being intimately related to the category that Arendt sidelines—<italic>zōē</italic>, which Agamben interprets as ‘bare life’. Thus, it is the reduction of politics to a concern with <italic>zoē</italic> in Agamben’s interpretation, that fuels political struggles, and is inextricably related to the way that state power is exercised. What Arendt assumed was essentially prior to politics, Agamben situates at the very heart of politics—a secret complicity that becomes ever more visible with the emergence of the modern biopolitical state. An implication of this is that the idea of a clearly defined public sphere, as the sphere of political action proper and distinct from the private sphere—a distinction which Arendt adopts from the Enlightenment—is, for Agamben, no longer credible. Instead, for the theorist of ‘bare life’, public and private become quite indistinct, with the result that a defence of human rights (about which Agamben is sceptical) would have to take place at the level of biopolitics—the level at which bodies become the focus of attention, not action and artifice, as Arendt proposed.</p>
<p>Clearly, unlike Arendt, Agamben believes that <italic>zoē</italic> is appropriated by the mechanisms of sovereign political power even as the excluded and abandoned entity, caught, as he puts it, in the relation of the <italic>ban</italic>. In other words, to be subject to the ban or to be consigned to the status of <italic>homo sacer</italic>—the ‘sacred’ man who may be killed but not sacrificed—is to not be placed on a terrain of radical freedom (as in the State of Nature), but, on the contrary, to be abandoned by the law and removed from its protections, and thus to be subject to lawless sovereign violence. As Agamben puts it, ‘What has been banned is delivered over to its own separateness and, at the same time, consigned to the mercy of the one who abandons it —at once excluded and included, removed and at the same time captured’. (1998: 110) We could say that this relation of the sovereign ban applies exactly to the stateless, as well as to denaturalised citizens, deported asylum seekers and ‘illegal’ migrants, and even terrorist suspects —those who in one way or another have been removed from the protections of the legal system and excluded from the polity, and whose condition is of extreme vulnerability. To be abandoned, then, is not inevitably to be thrown back into a condition of <italic>zoē</italic> (despite the fact that this is often assumed to be possible); for the human, <italic>qua</italic> human, is marked by the fact that it is never a pure <italic>zoē</italic>—even if the tradition of human rights theory has often rested on the claim to the contrary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1368431011432376">
<title>Witness, remnant and the human</title>
<p>Bearing witness to the human, as distinct from positing what is essentially human, is an important part of our contention that a new approach to human rights is needed. Here, it must be understood that bearing witness is not just about producing explicit testimony about conditions of life, such as those produced by inmates of concentration camps. Rather, it is what is disclosed in the sense that it is impossible to bear witness, which is crucial. This is particularly so once it is realised that statelessness and human rights call on us to re-think the human—the human understood in terms that transcend the nation-state and civil society but which do not then collapse back into notions based on birth and biology (bare life).</p>
<p>In his <italic>Remnants of Auschwitz</italic> (2002), Agamben presents the human not as an essence but as a <italic>quasi</italic>-paradoxical being who survives the very destruction and seeming loss of humanity. The figure who, in the Nazi death camps, most approximates the human as such is the <italic>Muselmann</italic>, a figure represented by Bruno Bettleheim as someone who has reached ‘the point of no return and the threshold beyond which one ceases to be human’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368431011432376">Agamben 2002</xref>: 63), but whom Agamben literally resurrects as the one who embodies what it means to be human most profoundly. In Agamben’s eyes, therefore, being at the point of death is not equivalent to having lost one’s humanity. Instead, the <italic>Muselmann</italic> has ‘moved into a zone of the human where not only help but also dignity and self-respect have become useless’. But, Agamben goes on to say, ‘if there is a zone of the human in which these concepts make no sense, then they are not genuine ethical concepts, for no ethics can claim to exclude a part of humanity, no matter how unpleasant or difficult that humanity is to see’. (2002: 63-64).</p>
<p>Agamben thus shows, in a profound way, that existing notions of the human are limiting and form the basis of exclusions. It is time now to make the notion of the human inclusive, even to the point where pure survival and being a mere remnant can be a mark of the human as such—where, indeed, silence and non-communication do not negate one’s humanness, for they do not negate one’s capacity to speak. “On the contrary”, says Agamben, “only if language is not always communication, only if language bears witness to something to which it is impossible to bear witness, can a speaking being experience something like a necessity to speak” (2002: 65). Consequently, the silence of the <italic>Muselmann</italic> at Auschwitz is not an indication of a loss of humanity because silence is embedded in speaking itself.</p>
<p>So, while the <italic>Muselmann</italic>—the one, let us recall, who has lost every trace of a civil identity—is the figure invoked by those who wish to give an example of the non-human, on the basis that civil death is death as such, Agamben, by contrast, embraces this figure as an instance of how the notion of the human can be re-thought and enriched. To do so, Agamben acknowledges the loss of dignity to which camp inmates were subjected, but then puts dignity, as an historical figure, in its place as it were. For dignity, as Agamben points out, has a “juridical origin” (2002: 66) and refers specifically to the public persona—of the King, most notably; “Lower classes […] are by definition excluded from every political dignity” (68). Certain situations—such as making love—do not lend themselves to dignity precisely because dignity is essentially public. Thus, Agamben says:<disp-quote>
<p>This is why Auschwitz marks the end and the ruin of every ethics of dignity and conformity to a norm. The bare life to which human beings were reduced neither demands nor conforms to anything. It itself is the only norm; it is absolutely immanent. And ‘the ultimate sentiment of belonging to the species’ cannot in any sense be a kind of dignity. (2002: 69)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The <italic>Muselmann</italic>, then, “bears witness” to this loss of dignity, to “having become inhuman”, as he also bears witness to the impossibility of “death as death” in light of the endless production of corpses thrown into mass graves and crematoria. There is, in fact, no end to what the <italic>Muselmann</italic> will bear witness to, including the impossibility of bearing witness itself. Thus, this figure is the stark reminder that nothing faced by the human—however degrading and dehumanising—is condemned to oblivion without trace while there is a witness.</p>
<p>Finally, Agamben provides us with an encapsulation of the key point as regards the survival of the <italic>Muselmann</italic>: “<italic>the human being is the inhuman</italic>; <italic>the one whose humanity is completely destroyed is the truly human”</italic> (2002: 133; Agamben’s emphasis). And Agamben adds that because the identity between the human and the inhuman is never perfect, there is “something that always <italic>remains</italic>. <italic>The witness is this remnant</italic>” (2002: 134; Agamben’s emphasis).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1368431011432376">3</xref>
</sup></p>
<p>This ‘bearing witness’ also occurs at the disjunction of the living being and the speaking being. There is no pure living without speaking—or, as we have seen, the potential to speak—just as there is no pure speaking without a living, vital aspect. This is equivalent to the irreducibility of the human to either ‘bare life’ or to language. It testifies, we say, to the infinite complexity of the human (which includes the inhuman) and to the fact that there is no occurrence for the human—including the fall into statelessness —which is not also a bearing witness to the human. That this is not an empty abstraction is shown through the invocation of Auschwitz, but it can also be shown with reference to other actual situations, such as the sewing of lips together by inmates of immigration detention centres.<sup>

<title>The problem of political community, or public sphere</title>
<p>If the human is a ‘bearing witness’ to the human, what does this imply with regard to the state of political community, or public sphere—for the human as such is now beyond the inclusion-exclusion opposition of political community? In this regard, we know that Arendt—whom we regard as entirely representative here—argued that the human rights of the stateless between the wars could not be defended outside the confines of a political community contained within a nation state. In short, the first step in defending the human rights of stateless people would be to enable them to become part of a political community. For it is only within such a community that one has the ‘right to have rights’. For a commentator such as Serena Parekh, the recognition of the importance of political community is Arendt’s “biggest contribution to the philosophy of human rights” (2008: 148). And, echoing Arendt, Parekh continues by claiming that “belonging to a political community means that you have a place in the world where you can speak and act meaningfully” (148). Indeed, to belong to a political community “is the most basic right” (148).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in our view, Parekh does not see the negative implications of what she is supporting, as we will endeavour to show. For political community falls on the side of the ‘Citizen’ in the French Declaration of 1789, in contrast to ‘Man’ or humanity as such. We will argue, then, that despite Parekh’s and many other commentators’ faith in political community,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1368431011432376">5</xref>
</sup> the focus needs to be brought back to the ‘human’ in relation to human rights. Indeed, we suggest that taking political community as a non-negotiable principle is the main obstacle to achieving any progress in defending human rights in the world today. This implies that rather than trying to understand statelessness in both its <italic>de jure</italic> and de facto forms<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1368431011432376">6</xref>
</sup> as being subordinate to political community, the latter should be entirely re-thought in relation to statelessness. In short, it should not be a matter of how stateless people can be forced or encouraged to adjust to existing political communities, but of rethinking the very idea and reality of the human and political community in light of statelessness. Indeed, statelessness means that political community has become entirely problematic.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1368431011432376">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>For Arendt, then, the very concept of the human <italic>qua</italic> natural being as the bearer of rights is open to the objection that it is human artifice as the mode of articulation of human freedom, conducted in a given public sphere amongst a given community of actors, which constitutes what is essential in being human. To be human in virtue of natality, Arendt claims, is not an adequate basis for rights. For this is simply the realm of necessity or biological existence, an existence akin to animal existence.</p>
<p>An Arendtian strategy with regard to the enforcement of rights thus means ensuring that every individual <italic>who qualifies</italic> belongs to a political community, even if this entails providing access to some sort of public sphere to groups and individuals hitherto thought of only in terms of exclusion. The problem with such an approach, though, is that it assumes that those outside a political community are deprived of freedom, are unlikely to have a written history of their actions and are condemned to remain in the realm of necessity, or subsistence existence. Such people are, as a result, less than human —even if this is for reasons beyond their control.</p>
<p>By way of further illustrating her position (a position reflected in the political theory tradition), we find that in her work, <italic>The Human Condition</italic> (1958), Arendt, following, as she sees it, the Ancient Greeks, famously defines the political community, or <italic>polis</italic>, as the space of freedom and action, and she contrasts this with the private realm of the household, or the realm of necessity. There can be no true freedom, action or work as a created product in the household:<disp-quote>
<p>What all Greek philosophers, no matter how opposed to <italic>polis</italic> life took for granted is that freedom is exclusively located in the political realm, that necessity is primarily a prepolitical phenomenon, characteristic of the private household organization, and that force and violence are justified in this sphere because they are the only means to master necessity – for instance, by ruling over slaves – and to become free. Because all human beings are subject to necessity, they are entitled to violence toward others; violence is the prepolitical act of liberating oneself from the necessity of life for the freedom of world. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368431011432376">Arendt 1958</xref>: 31)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Our author thus claims that ‘all human beings are subject to necessity’. And yet we also know that to be truly human is to be part of the political community. This community, then, itself derives from a prior act of violence (which, strictly speaking, is not an act in the fullest sense, as this is only possible in the <italic>polis</italic>) which separates necessity from freedom. Somehow, necessity itself, paradoxically, gives rise to freedom. Violence is characteristic of animal existence yet also liberates human beings from pure animality. Violence, essentially deriving from the realm of necessity, is where biological needs are satisfied. In it, too, the body is dominant over the mind and evocative of man’s stupid, natural existence. The latter, Arendt tells us, is not a fully human existence; only a life that participates in human artifice is human in the fullest sense. Indeed, Arendt’s explication of the Greek situation, we can now see, is an elaboration of the remark made at the end of Part 2 of <italic>On the Origins of Totalitarianism</italic> to the effect that political life occurs against the ‘dark background of mere givenness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368431011432376">Arendt 1968</xref>: 181), the background, too, of necessity and natural difference. When such conditions are found in a more or less pure form as in ‘savage tribes’, or in those ‘who have been forced out of all political communities’, it means that people end up like ‘savages’. For they<disp-quote>
<p>have lost all those parts of the world and all those aspects of human existence which are the result of our common labor, the outcome of human artifice. If the tragedy of savage tribes is that they inhabit an unchanged nature which they cannot master, yet upon whose abundance or frugality they depend for their livelihood, that they live and die without leaving any trace, with having contributed anything to a common world, then these rightless people are indeed thrown back into a peculiar state of nature (Arendt 1951: 181).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>We can see from this that even though Arendt valorises civil identity and political community over the human as equivalent to life in a state of nature, or natural givenness, she still puts forward a clear picture of the human. To be human—to be fully human—is to avoid, at all costs, falling back into animality—the extreme form of necessity. However, as the idea of a certain political community based in human artifice (i.e. which is freed from nature) is inextricably implicated in an Arendtian (and European) notion of the human, we argue that it is absolutely essential that the human be re-thought. David Chandler succinctly sums up the traditional view of politics and the human as reflected in Arendt, echoing the formative nature of the private (necessity)/public (freedom) distinction:<disp-quote>
<p>Politics has been considered important because community was constituted not through the private sphere but through the public sphere in which shared interests and perspectives were generated through engagement and debate with the goal of building and creating collective expressions of interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368431011432376">Chandler 2009</xref>: 64)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In another revealing and oft-cited passage from <italic>The Origins of Totalitarianism</italic>, Arendt consolidates the link between the human and community with regard to rights:<disp-quote>
<p>The calamity of the rightless is not that they are deprived of life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness, or of equality before the law and freedom of opinion – formulas which were designed to solve problems <italic>within</italic> given communities – but that they no longer belong to any community whatsoever (1968: 175).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The deprivation of community is, for Arendt, even more disastrous for the rightless than the failure to enforce their human rights. For without belonging to a political community, those deprived of human rights are ‘deprived, not of the right to freedom, but of the right to action; not of the right to think whatever they please, but of the right to opinion’ (1968: 176). In effect, stateless people are essentially deprived of the benefits of a thriving public sphere. Not having a community was what enabled Aristotle to think of slaves as not being human. And Arendt concludes that: ‘Only the loss of a polity itself expels [someone] from humanity’ (1968: 177).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1368431011432376">8</xref>
</sup> It is a matter, then, of re-thinking the human outside of the traditional, European frame of freedom and necessity.</p>
<p>Directing attention to the human as such must not, however, result in the return of the objectifying concept of human nature. Indeed, objectifying the human, as Agamben after Heidegger points out, is also part of the problem. This, of course, includes the objectification of the human as ‘bare life’ (<italic>zoē</italic>) in biopolitics. We say that Agamben’s argument is not that there is objectively something called ‘bare life’, but that political power, as it is articulated today, acts as though there were such a reality. In other words, ‘bare life’ is part of a ‘way of governing’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1368431011432376">9</xref>
</sup> It is this which is crucial to the possibility or otherwise of re-invigorating human rights.</p>
<p>We see, then, that ‘political community’ in the work of Arendt and others refers specifically to the public sphere and is distinct from the private sphere. In effect, it is the space of politics as traditionally understood. It is also a space dependent for its existence on the auspices of the state within the nation state, and is the target of our critique because it is also based on the play of exclusion and inclusion. Our aim, certainly, is to move towards a form of community not based on the inclusion opposition, one that is, in part, indebted to the notion of community as found in French thinking on this issue in the 1980s. Thus, following in the steps of both Georges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368431011432376">Bataille (1988</xref>) and Jean-Luc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368431011432376">Nancy (1991</xref>), Maurice Blanchot in <italic>The Unavowable Community</italic> (1983) points out that any attempt to name or to represent community results in a homogenisation, in a ‘sameness’ or ‘oneness’, and the obliteration of the other. Community has to be grasped as essentially composed of one and other, not of one and the same. This is what Blanchot calls a negative community, or what Roberto <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368431011432376">Esposito (2010</xref>) would call a community freeing itself from immunity, or the negative aspect of exclusion. An indication of what is at stake here is given in Bataille’s notion of a ‘community of those without community’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368431011432376">Blanchot 1983</xref>: 9). The work of Immanuel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368431011432376">Levinas (1987</xref>; 1998) is also important in that he, perhaps more than any other thinker, makes it clear that a true community must be understood as a complete openness to the other, not as a union of egos (the order of the same or what is similar).</p>
<p>Moreover, of those who problematise the current understanding of community as belonging and exclusion, we have Agamben himself, who seeks a conception of community as situated beyond the borders of existing nation-states and who, indeed, would challenge the viability of political arrangements based on the nation-state. It is a matter, as Jessica Whyte indicates, of describing the ‘dynamic, which, in Agamben's view, nullifies substantive identities, making possible, for the first time, a community of pure singularity <italic>without exclusion</italic>’ (Whyte 2010; our emphasis).</p>
<p>Not the least of the difficulties in presenting such a community is that it does not conform to any particular model,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1368431011432376">10</xref>
</sup> nor is it a concept to be rendered concrete. In fact, it cannot be readily objectified as would be normal practice in analytical thought. Instead, it more closely approximates an emergent state in complexity theory, where the exact outcome (the actual forms of community at a given moment) is indeterminate. The real problem is that current ways of thinking do not allow for community as a synthetic entity (non-objectifiable) to appear. It is thus a matter of shaking current thinking to its very core.</p>

<title>Statelessness and human rights</title>
<p>We now see that both Agamben and Arendt, albeit for different reasons, reject the definition that: ‘human rights are the rights one has simply because one is a human being’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368431011432376">Donnelly 2003</xref>:1). And we accept that they are right to do so because, as it stands, this definition begs key questions, most notably the one relating to the meaning of the ‘human’. The pragmatist might argue, of course, that the meaning of the human is self-evident and that to raise philosophical and theoretical questions about it simply results in diverting attention and energy away from where these are needed, namely, in the fight to preserve the human rights of those who are victims of all kinds of oppression, and that, in any case, it will never be possible to reach any meaningful consensus on the question.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1368431011432376">11</xref>
</sup> Such a stance would be fine if statelessness had not revealed the inadequacy of the theory and reality of political community. We say that statelessness is an authentic mode of being human—and in the fullest sense, even if, in many circumstances, it is not a strictly desirable mode. This is to say that an expression of the human can be external to the state; the state, after all, being an historically determined entity that has arisen and may well fade away, as Marx predicted.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1368431011432376">12</xref>
</sup> But the existing emphasis on being a member of a specific type of political community in order to qualify as being fully human means that stateless people must continually be at a supreme disadvantage when it comes to claiming their human rights. While Arendt saw the Nazi effort to erase the civil identity of camp inmates as evidence of the fundamental importance of this identity, it could also be said that the fact that so much social, psychological and political investment went—and goes—into it, makes it ripe to be exploited by various forms of power.</p>
<p>This suggests that if the fact of being human is the basis of human rights, a more complex notion of the human, as indicated above, is required, one that not only refuses a notion of the human as essentially a form of biological life and the idea thus implied of mere physical survival, but also the notion of the human as essentially a form of civil identity. Let us acknowledge, then, that it is not just a matter of opposing the reduction of the human to the biological, but also of recognising that, for the human, there is no pure biological domain or—contra Arendt—there is no realm of pure necessity; for the biological is always inscribed within a social and cultural complex. Life is always a <italic>way</italic> of life. In any event, the refusal to accept that the meaning or being of the human goes without saying and can be taken for granted becomes fundamental, because it is the narrowing of the possibilities of the human within this paradigm which goes to the heart of the problem of how to expand the benefits of human rights.</p>
<p>While the exclusion from human rights protection is at its most brutal and visible when applied to those at the borders of the nation state—as seen in draconian security and border control measures, the consignment of thousands to refugee camps or detention centres, and so on—we should obviously not lose sight of the fact that the rights of citizens are also violated by their governments <italic>within</italic> the borders of states, even liberal democratic states, in the name of security and public order. Indeed, we can, in many instances, refer to an internalisation of ‘statelessness’, where certain marginalised individuals and groups who are, nevertheless, legal citizens or residents, have been stripped of their legal status and deported. The recent mass expulsion by French authorities of members of a Roma community—who are European Union (EU) citizens and therefore had the right to reside anywhere within the EU—illustrates this condition of internal statelessness.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1368431011432376">13</xref>
</sup> The borders of the state polity are mobile, shifting; certain people who are currently included within this polity can find themselves suddenly and brutally excluded from it.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1368431011432376">14</xref>
</sup> The ‘public sphere’, as defined within with nation state framework, is riven through with external and internal constraints and lines of division and exclusion which depend on the arbitrary determinations of sovereign power.</p>
<p>Of course, any radical reconfiguration or rejection of the public sphere carries its own risks: creating a new vision of the public sphere for the stateless can so easily turn into a form of colonisation (i.e. Europeanisation); so it is necessary to tread extremely carefully here. A further risk is that certain ‘beneficiaries’ of a public sphere might be seen as human in the most minimal—that is, biological—sense. Indeed, the latter opens the way to the fundamental definition of the human as <italic>zoē</italic> in the Greek sense, as <italic>animalitas</italic> in the Latin tradition—or to ‘bare life’. Thus, as we have indicated, when looking for a minimum definition of the human, modernity has chosen animal—or biological—existence. Indeed, modern biopolitics could be characterised as, in Foucault’s words:<disp-quote>
<p>a kind of bestialization of man achieved through the most sophisticated political techniques. For the first time in history, the possibilities of the social sciences are made known, and at once it becomes possible to both to protect life and to authorize a holocaust (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368431011432376">Agamben 1998</xref>: 3).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This duality central to biopolitics and its relation to human rights goes to the heart of our concern: to what extent is the life-protecting, life-enhancing function of a pragmatic human rights approach at the same time complicit in what would seem to be its absolute opposite—the practices of state violence and exclusion to which bare life is often subjected? The basis of Agamben’s critique of rights is centred here; it is a critique, as we have noted, which says that declarations, such as the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, mark the biopolitical foundations of the modern state, a process in which life is integrated into the structures and mechanisms of sovereign power, where it is ‘protected’ and ‘secured’ through its nakedness and vulnerability; where it is always caught up in the potential moment of sovereign exception.</p>
<p>In this light, the idea of rights, far from being universally applicable, opens up a new set of divisions between those ‘included’ in this way within the order of the nation state, and those outside its borders: those within are accorded the rights of the citizen; those outside are given, like a set of cast-off clothes, human rights.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1368431011432376">15</xref>
</sup> This division—not only between citizens and humans, but between these two orders of rights—finds its low point in the contemporary ideology of global humanitarianism, a discourse and set of practices and institutions consciously divorced from politics. While it is important to make a distinction between human rights and humanitarianism, Agamben’s critique points at least to the potentially depoliticising nature of human rights - the way they encourage a view of the rights-recipient as a helpless victim of state violence - while at the same time discouraging a more genuine politicisation of the background in which this figure of the victim appears. This is why Agamben insists that we separate the concept of the refugee from the concept of the rights of man, in that the current practice of these rights not only do not protect refugees but render them politically impotent, without agency, a helpless victim requiring the intervention of humanitarian relief operations (which are in any case often conducted by self-interested sovereign states). We should thus think about the refugee in a very different way, as ‘a limit concept’ calling into question the very category of the nation state and, at the same time, calling for a ‘bearing witness to the human’ and new conception of community. The position of the refugee or stateless person is, in this way, a kind of threshold for a new understanding of politics: considering the refugee in these terms ‘makes it possible to clear the way for a long-overdue renewal of categories in the service of a politics in which bare life is no longer separated and excepted, either in the state order or in the figure of human rights’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368431011432376">Agamben 1998</xref>: 134).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The chief aim of this paper has not been to develop a new theory of human rights, but to set out what is at stake in developing a new conception of the human as ‘bearing witness to the human’—a bearing witness that brings to light the presuppositions and <italic>aporias</italic> characteristic of the current way of understanding politics and the human and thus opens the way to a different experience of human equality. We see Agamben as extending the boundaries of the possibility of being human to the point of impossibility, as he simultaneously extends the boundaries of testimony to the ‘absolute impossibility of bearing witness’, for which the <italic>Muselmann</italic> is the incarnation (2002: 164). Testimony also includes the impossibility of speaking. By way of elaboration in the final chapter of <italic>Remnants of Auschwitz</italic>, Agamben states that: ‘The human being is the speaking being, the living being who has language, because the human being is capable of <italic>not having</italic> language’ (146). To reinforce this point, Agamben invokes Émile Benveniste’s distinction between <italic>énonciation</italic> (act of stating) and <italic>énoncé</italic> (statement made, as in an existing text).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1368431011432376">16</xref>
</sup> Traditionally, the level of the <italic>énoncé</italic> has been privileged both in relation to the archive, and in linguistics and the philosophy of language. Agamben, then, wants to bring the <italic>énonciation</italic> to centre stage and show that it is the basis of not having language—for language might not be enacted. Not to take account of the level of <italic>énonciation</italic> is to treat language as such as a dead language—a language that is not enacted. This is why, ‘the possibility of speech, bears witness to an impossibility of speech. This is why subjectivity appears as <italic>witness</italic>’ (2002: 146).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1368431011432376">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This point we consider to be absolutely crucial. To be a subject and to bear witness are one and the same. To be a subject, to bear witness and to experience the impossibility of these, together with the impossibility of speaking, are all intimately connected. Here, it is important to understand that ‘impossibility’ does not refer to a logical category such that to posit the possibility of impossibility is a logical contradiction and thus unacceptable. For, even to pose the notion of impossibility is to go beyond the limits of logic.</p>
<p>We have already acknowledged the difficulty of Agamben’s thinking here. But whether or not it is possible to follow it in every detail is less important than recognising that Agamben goes beyond any definition or constitution of the human that reduces it to a civil identity—an identity underpinned by law and ineluctably indebted to the opposition between the animal and the human, as well as all oppositions evoking some kind of natural (therefore non-human) existence, namely: nature/culture; necessity/freedom; <italic>zoē/bios</italic>; primitive/civilized; private/public; ‘man’/citizen, and the opposition that depends on all of these—tradition/modernity. These oppositions have hobbled thought about the human. They have, in particular, made bearing witness to the horror of Auschwitz something not even attempted, because this place has stood for the erasure of civil identity, which in turn has stood for the erasure of the human as such. The latter point is echoed by Arendt, as we saw earlier, when she invokes the question of rights. It is not, let us remind ourselves, the loss of specific rights that is important, for: “Only the loss of a polity itself expels him [man] from humanity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368431011432376">Arendt 1968</xref>: 177). This passage warrants a still lengthier exegesis (is Arendt saying, for example, that the loss of rights can occur in a political community?); but the significance we attribute to it at this moment is that there is a fundamental and inextricable link, for Arendt—and the European tradition she can be seen to represent —between the human and political community, a community which is circumscribed and articulated in a particular way, so that it is not essentially open to the other as stateless person, as refugee, as asylum seeker.</p>
<p>By contrast we have argued, in light of Agamben, that not only is the human not reducible to civil identity, but that a key index of the human is the impossibility of bearing witness to the erasure of civil identity. More than this, however, Agamben’s thought enables the notion of rights to be taken out of a predominantly legal context, even if the tradition of European thought (cf. Hegel) has tried to make this link the basis of thinking about rights. In this context, the first thing that a new approach to human rights must do is recognise that the most fundamental of all rights is the right to bear witness to one’s humanity beyond civil identity. This will never be a right that is simply enacted by birth unless it is recognised that birth itself is never an entirely natural occurrence, that to be born as a human is also partly to bear witness to being human.</p>
<p>In light of the model of <italic>énonciation</italic>, we will discover that the ways of bearing witness to the human beyond all state borders are endless. Language as such is, after all, not at all contained by state borders, which are drawn up in light of contingent historical events. They are, assuredly, not the outcome of any immutable and natural laws, even if the practice of biopolitics in nation-states implies that it is so. On this basis, human rights are defendable in the name of the human. But the task before us is to provide instances of how this has occurred and can occur as part of the potential inscribed in humanity. The greatest suffering, in other words, can be both testimony to the human and a call to make the human something other than this suffering. This, we believe, is the lesson to be drawn from the practice of Agamben’s thought.</p>

<p>This understanding of biopolitics Agamben takes—with some important modifications—from Foucault, who in several places explored the emergence of biopolitics as a rationality of government during the eighteenth century (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368431011432376">1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368431011432376">2003</xref>)</p>

<p>Ewa Ziarek makes the important distinction between ‘bare life’ from <italic>zoē</italic>: “To avoid misunderstanding, I would like to stress the point that is made sometimes only implicitly in Agamben’s work and not always sufficiently stressed by his commentators: namely, the fact that bare life—wounded, expendable, and endangered—is not the same as biological <italic>zoē</italic>, but rather it is the remainder of the destroyed political bios” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1368431011432376">2008</xref>: 90).</p>

<p>On 19 November 2010, 10 asylum seekers in the Australian detention centre on Christmas Island sewed their lips together as a protest against the conditions of their internment. This confirms that the refusal to speak is part of the possibility for the human speaking. As Agamben says: “The human being is the speaking being. The living being who has language, because the human being is capable of <italic>not having</italic> language” (2002: 146).</p>

<p>See, for example, Seyla Benhabib who credits Arendt for making the “recovery of the public […] a central category for all democratic-liberal politics” and for the “insight that the public and the private are interdependent” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368431011432376">1996</xref>: 211).

<p>As Ayten Gündogdu points out in a commentary on Arendt, <italic>de jure</italic> statelessness refers to those who have no formal legal status and who do not belong to any nation-state, whereas <italic>de facto</italic> stateless people would be those, such as refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced persons, who might have formal legal status in a country but whose actual position has become untenable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368431011432376">2006</xref>: 6).</p>

<p>Statelessness is but one—albeit the most important—of the indicators of the increasing mobility of people in the world today, a mobility that has the potential to transform the idea of national sovereignty. Agamben points out that the increasing numbers of refugees today “put the originary fiction of modern sovereignty in crisis” (1998: 131).</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-1368431011432376">

<p>Agamben, by contrast, appears to loosen the bond between the political and community: “If anything characterizes modern democracy as opposed to classical democracy, then, it is that modern democracy presents itself from the beginning as a vindication and liberation of <italic>zoē</italic>, and that it is constantly trying to transform its own bare life into a way of life and to find, so to speak, the <italic>bios</italic> of <italic>zoē</italic>” (1998: 9).</p>

<p>Esposito succinctly characterises the issue here: “<italic>Zōē</italic> itself can only be defined problematically: what, assuming it is even conceivable, is an absolutely natural life?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368431011432376">2008</xref>: 15).

<p>What is at stake, in effect, is a ‘community to come’, which, like the ‘democracy to come’ proposed by Derrida, has no ideal form, is not a regulative idea in the Kantian sense, nor is it typically circumscribed in order to make an object for an observing subject that it is always prior to it.

<p>This is, indeed, Michael Ignatieff’s position in <italic>Politics and Idolatry</italic>.

<p>In this regard, Ayten Gündogdu reminds us of the earlier plight of the ‘<italic>sans papiers</italic>’ who, in March 1996, occupied the Church of St. Amboise in Paris, protesting against their ‘illegal’ status (see 2006).</p>

<p>We borrow this metaphor from Jacques Rancière, who argues that human rights, which in the West increasingly assume an abstract empty form, are ‘donated’, along with humanitarian aid, to the excluded and impoverished of the world, in other words to those without the right to have rights. Thus, human rights become humanitarian rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368431011432376">Rancière 2004</xref>: 307).</p>

<p>Pronouns, both personal and impersonal, are indices of the level of <italic>énonciation</italic>. For they only have meaning within the discourse in which they are used. Thus, Benveniste asks: “What then is the “reality” to which <italic>I</italic> or <italic>you</italic> refer? It is uniquely a ‘reality of discourse’, something quite singular. <italic>I</italic> cannot be defined in terms of a “locution”, nor in terms of objects, as is the case with a nominal sign. <italic>I</italic> signifies the person who utters [<italic>énonce</italic>] the present instance of discourse containing <italic>I</italic>’. This instance is unique by definition, and has validity only in its uniqueness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368431011432376">1966</xref>: 252. Trans. J. Lechte).</p>

<p>The importance of Benveniste’s theory for Agamben confirms the validity of the point by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368431011432376">Watkins (2010</xref>) that a full appreciation of Agamben’s approach to politics depends on understanding his approach to language. Indeed, in <italic>Language and Death</italic>, Agamben brings the notion of <italic>énonciation</italic> to bear a theory of the “ungroundedness of all human praxis” (1991: 105). This reinforces the point that Agamben is ever engaged in showing that there is no human essence.</p>
