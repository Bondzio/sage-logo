<p>I consider it a special privilege to be Scientific Convenor in this 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary year of the College. The program in structure and content reflects the theme of looking back but also looking forward.</p>
<p>The keynotes start each day followed by themed symposia. John Sadler’s keynote addresses the ethical and moral issues that are the process of the development and revision of the DSM – the ‘Bible’ of psychiatric classification for most of the English speaking world and beyond. Matcheri Keshavan will discuss the neuroscience of schizophrenia and evidence-based cognitive remediation programs, including cognitive enhancement therapy, that aim for neurocognitive and social cognitive improvements and which have been demonstrated to be effective in schizophrenia. Continuing a broad theme of innovations in therapy, Janet Treasure will speak on new directions for care in eating disorders. These include approaches based on self-determination theory and those that focus on remediating core emotional anomalies (use of oxytocins and brain stimulation) or intensive new learning of emotional habits such as attentional bias training. Charles Scott has the challenging topic of ‘Treatment of Antisocial Personality Disorder and Psychopathy: Is it hopeful or hopeless?’. In particular he will review the development of ‘Dangerous and Severe and Dangerous Units’ in the UK and evidence for their efficacy. Brian Hodges will explore different conceptions of competence and the implications for programs of continuing education for physicians. Gordon Parker will close the Congress with a return to classification and its relevance to clinical practice in his talk on clinical reasoning and pattern analysis in psychiatric diagnosis and management.</p>
<p>Science is strongly represented. Scientific papers are grouped by themes and have an increased presence in the form of dedicated poster sessions linked to brief daily orals just prior to lunch. Where neuroscience may (or may not!) be taking us will be discussed in a plenary led by Cyndi Weickert. Other highlights include a symposium on neurostimulation led by Cherrie Galletly and another on youth mental health led by Patrick McGorry.</p>
<p>A major event will be the Asia-Pacific Forum, with over 15 international guests and speakers. We are also delighted that Professor Takeda, President of the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology and Dr Suzane Renaud, President of the Canadian Psychiatric Association will be contributing to our Congress.</p>
<p>There are also very reflective and salutary presentations from the History and Philosophy stream and others which include a paper from the first examination-entry member of the College (former President, and a pivotal figure in the RANZCP) Joan Lawrence AM speaking on professional standards and her unique experience. There will also be a thought-provoking symposium on vice and mental disorder led by three experts including the keynote speaker Professor Sadler.</p>
<p>Last, but by no means least (!), the creative arts are present in the form of an art exhibition, film, and scholarly sessions. The film (session facilitated by Robert Kaplan) is ‘Malariotherapy at Mont Park’ and is the oldest surviving film of psychiatric treatment in Australia. For music lovers there is a presentation from Loyola McLean incorporating sung music (seven songs) and their application to facets of psychological therapies.</p>
<p>In closing, the diversity and calibre of this year’s program is impressive. It reflects the past and the future of scholarship in our region and beyond and the ensuing benefits to psychiatric science and practice.</p>
