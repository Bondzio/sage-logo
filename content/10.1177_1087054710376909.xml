<title>Introduction</title>
<p>ADHD is known as a developmental disorder of childhood and consists of persistent symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054710376909">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000</xref>). Although it is widely known that the disorder does not only affect children but also adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054710376909">Davidson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054710376909">Lara et al., 2009</xref>), there have only been a few large-scale epidemiological studies with a focus on the co-occurrence of psychiatric problems and stressful life events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054710376909">Fayyad et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054710376909">Kessler et al., 2006</xref>). More population-based research regarding the adult form of ADHD is still needed, especially to obtain information regarding the pattern of comorbidity that is not constrained by referral bias. To this point, the pattern of comorbidity across the different subtypes of ADHD is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054710376909">Sprafkin, Gadow, Weiss, Schneider, &amp; Nolan, 2007</xref>). Therefore, we aimed to answer the following questions with our population-based study: What comorbidities and functional problems are associated with ADHD symptoms? Does the pattern of comorbidities and functional impairment differ among ADHD subtypes? Is there a difference in comorbidities for male and female adults with ADHD? The present study will be, to our knowledge, the largest population-based study in a European population so far, studying comorbidities of ADHD with regard to subtypes and sex differences.</p>
<p>Two recent large-scale epidemiological studies have provided data on the pattern of comorbidity in adult ADHD. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054710376909">Kessler et al. (2006)</xref> used data from a subsample of 3,199 respondents aged between 18 and 44 enrolled in a large nationwide study (<italic>N</italic> = 9,282) in the United States to assess the prevalence and correlates of adult ADHD. Specifically, 154 participants of this sample were interviewed by trained interviewers to assess ADHD and comorbid psychiatric disorders and to account for functional problems. Multiple imputations were used to estimate diagnoses for the participants who did not participate in the interviews. The prevalence of ADHD in this study was estimated at 4.4%. Odds ratios for mood disorders ranged from 2.7 to 7.5, for anxiety disorders from 1.5 to 5.5, and for alcohol dependence from 1.5 to 7.9. Adults with ADHD also had an elevated risk for functional problems with odds ratios from 2.1 to 3.9. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054710376909">Fayyad and coworkers (2007)</xref> explored the prevalence of ADHD and risk for psychiatric comorbidity in a sample of 11,422 participants aged between 18 and 44 from 10 countries (Belgium, Colombia, France, Germany, Italy, Lebanon, Mexico, The Netherlands, Spain, and United States) using the method developed in the American study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054710376909">Kessler et al., 2006</xref>); that is, the prevalence of adult ADHD as well as the risk of comorbidity with other <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed.; <italic>DSM-IV</italic>) disorders was estimated using multiple imputations from the sample of 154 clinically interviewed participants from the U.S.-American study. The estimated prevalence was 3.4% in the total study, ranging from 1.9% in Colombia to 7.3% in France. The pattern of comorbidity was similar within the countries and to the findings of the U.S. survey. However, several limitations of these studies are noteworthy.</p>
<p>First, both studies used multiple imputations to estimate diagnoses and comorbidities. The indirect estimations of prevalence of ADHD and comorbidities rely on a relatively small sample size of 154 participants and the multiple imputation strategy is based on several critical assumptions, such as “missing-at-random” data. Thus, it is unclear how accurately these studies can calculate prevalence and correlates of the disorder for the whole sample.</p>
<p>Second, neither of the studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054710376909">Fayyad et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054710376909">Kessler et al., 2006</xref>) analyzed potential differences in the pattern of psychiatric comorbidity among the three <italic>DSM-IV</italic> subtypes of ADHD; that is, the combined type, primarily hyperactive-impulsive type, and the primarily inattentive type. Other recent studies of adult ADHD have been inconclusive in their results. Some showed a higher rate of comorbidities, especially substance abuse disorders, for adults with combined type of ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054710376909">McGough et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054710376909">Murphy, Barkley, &amp; Bush, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054710376909">Sprafkin et al., 2007</xref>), whereas others found no significant difference among the subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054710376909">Hart, Lahey, Loeber, Applegate, &amp; Frick, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054710376909">Sobanski et al., 2008</xref>). Research on children and adolescents indicates that the increased risk for internalizing disorders, such as anxiety and depression, may be more closely linked to the combined and inattentive subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054710376909">Willcutt, Pennington, Chhabildas, Friedman, &amp; Alexander, 1999</xref>). Additional research on the association among different ADHD subtypes in adults and psychiatric comorbidities is needed, especially when the symptoms of inattention tend to persist into adulthood to a greater extent than the symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054710376909">Hart et al, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054710376909">Lara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710376909">Todd et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, neither of the two studies explored the role of sex differences underlying the associations between the three subtypes of ADHD and comorbid psychiatric disorders. Several earlier studies have shown that women manifest fewer ADHD symptoms and less externalizing problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054710376909">Gaub &amp; Carlson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054710376909">Gershon, 2002</xref>). Other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054710376909">Biederman, Faraone, Monuteaux, Bober, &amp; Cadogen, 2004</xref>) report no differences regarding comorbidities between both the sexes. One potential explanation to the mixed results may be that longitudinal studies based on clinical populations suffer from referral bias, that is, as externalizing behavior is most often the cause for clinical referral, girls are less likely to be reported. Therefore, the prevalence of female ADHD in childhood is underestimated and the effect of gender on the association of ADHD and psychiatric comorbidities remains unclear.</p>
<p>With these limitations of the previous studies in mind, the purpose of the study was to explore the risk for coexisting psychiatric and functional problems for the three <italic>DSM-IV</italic> subtypes of ADHD and for both the sexes.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1087054710376909">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>A target population of 42,582 Swedish twins was recruited from the population-representative <italic>Swedish Twin Registry</italic>. The inclusion criteria were all twin pairs born in Sweden between 1959 and 1985 and both of them surviving their first birthday. Of this sample of eligible participants, 25,321 (59.5%) individuals took part in <italic>The Study of Twin Adults: Genes and Environment</italic> (STAGE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710376909">Lichtenstein et al., 2006</xref>). Twins were sent a letter inviting them to participate in the study and were given a personal login to the study web page. Nonresponders were approached with up to three reminders. They also had the possibility to choose a telephone interview supplemented with a trained telephone interviewer using a computer-based data collection method.</p>
<p>We examined 17,899 participants who provided information about ADHD diagnosis or symptoms, 7,178 (40.10%) were men and 10,721 (59.90%) women. Men were aged <italic>M</italic> = 33.7 (<italic>SD</italic> = 7.7, range = 20-47) years and women <italic>M</italic> = 33.5 (<italic>SD</italic> = 7.6, range = 20-47) years. This sample consisted of 5,741 (37.76%) monozygous and 9,462 (62.24%) dizygous twin pairs. For 2,696 (15.06%) of 17,899 participants with ADHD data information for zygosity was missing. Zygosity was established using standard physical similarity questions that were previously validated through genotyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710376909">Lichtenstein et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the 17,899 participants, 64% participants were married or living together with their partner; 5% had a stable relationship without living together; 27% were single; and 4% were separated, divorced, widowed, or did not answer, respectively. Five percent completed or attended elementary school; 41% high school; 12% vocational education, military college, or other; and 42% college or university as their highest academic degree. By definition no respondents were first-generation immigrants.</p>
<p>STAGE participants and nonparticipants did not differ by age or birth weight. However, nonresponders had a significant higher proportion of having at least one parent born outside of Sweden, being convicted of any type of crime, or being diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder.</p>
<p>The project has been reviewed and approved by the regional ethics committee of the Karolinska Institutet. All participants provided informed consent electronically during the web-based survey or orally during the telephone interview.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section5-1087054710376909">
<title>ADHD Symptoms</title>
<p>ADHD symptoms were assessed via a self-report questionnaire containing the 18 <italic>DSM-IV</italic> symptom items (i.e., nine inattentive items and nine hyperactive-impulsive items). All items had a 3-point answer format (0 = <italic>no</italic>; 1 = <italic>yes, to some extent</italic>; and 2 = <italic>yes</italic>). On the basis of these items, we classified participants into the three <italic>DSM-IV</italic> ADHD subtypes (i.e., the primarily inattentive subtype, the primarily hyperactive-impulsive subtype, and the combined subtype) using a criterion-based and a norm-based approach.</p>
<p>Our criterion-based approach basically reflects the diagnostic criteria of the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054710376909">APA, 2000</xref>). That is, a primarily inattentive subtype diagnosis was made if a participant answered “yes” on six out of nine inattentive items; a primarily hyperactive-impulsive subtype diagnosis was made if a participant answered “yes” on six out of nine hyperactive-impulsive items; and finally the combined subtype diagnosis was made if a participant answered “yes” on six or more inattentive items and “yes” on six or more hyperactive-impulsive items. In the norm-based approach, we classified participants into the three subtypes of ADHD using a cutoff imposed at 2.0 standard deviations (<italic>SD</italic>) above the mean (i.e., above the 98th percentile) on the symptom count scales of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity. It should be noted that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054710376909">Barkley, Fischer, Smallish, and Fletcher (2002)</xref> suggested a norm-referenced diagnosis based on a 2 <italic>SD</italic> cutoff as the most useful diagnostic method in adults compared to other criterion-based approaches. Specifically, a norm-based primarily inattentive subtype diagnosis was made if a participant scored 2 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean on the inattention scale but below 2 <italic>SD</italic> on the hyperactivity-impulsivity scale; a primarily hyperactive-impulsive subtype diagnosis was made if a participant scored 2 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean on the hyperactive-impulsive scale but below 2 <italic>SD</italic> on the inattentive scale. The combined type was classified if a participant scored 2 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean on both the inattentive and the hyperactive scales.</p>
<p>Information regarding childhood onset before age of 7 years, significant impairment in different environments, as well as the diagnostic hierarchy criterion was not included in the analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1087054710376909">
<title>Psychiatric Symptoms</title>
<p>We used self-reported symptoms of six relevant major psychiatric disorders: generalized anxiety disorder, major depression, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and substance-related disorder with respect to alcohol. The participants answered the questions regarding these symptoms at the same time as the questions regarding symptoms of ADHD.</p>
<p>We used <italic>DSM-IV</italic> symptoms of major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and alcohol dependence to create a diagnosis, in line with <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054710376909">APA, 2000</xref>), using the following algorithms:</p>
<list id="list1-1087054710376909" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Major depression was diagnosed if five or more of the following symptoms were present: (1) depressed mood, (2) loss of interest or pleasure, (3) significant weight loss or gain, (4) insomnia or hypersomnia, (5) psychomotor agitation or retardation, (6) fatigue, (7) feeling of worthlessness or guilt, (8) diminished ability to think or concentrate, and (9) recurrent thoughts of death. Of these items, at least one of symptoms (1) or (2) as well as a significant impairment in social or vocational activities had to be present. Moreover, the symptoms were not better accounted for by the loss of a loved one (“Did these periods happen after the loss of a loved one?”).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Generalized anxiety disorder required excessive anxiety or worry and at least three out of six positive answers regarding symptoms of (1) restlessness, (2) fatigue, (3) difficulties concentrating, (4) irritability, (5) muscle tension, and (6) sleep disturbance.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Alcohol dependence was scored if at least three of seven of the following items were answered positive: (1) development of tolerance such as an increased amount of the substance necessary to have the desired effect or diminished effect of the same dosage of the substance, (2) symptoms of withdrawal such as characteristic withdrawal symptoms or avoidance of withdrawal symptoms by means of continued substance use, (3) substance consumption for a longer time or in higher amounts than was originally intended, (4) persistent desire to control substance use, (5) great amount of time spent to obtain the desired substance, (6) decrease in social activity due to the substance use, and (7) continued use of the substance despite proven negative effects of the substance.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Bipolar affective disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder were evaluated by single-item self-report questions, such as “Do you have or have you ever had any of the following problems: manic depression, bipolar disorder, or manic-depressive symptoms?” or “Have you ever been diagnosed as having an obsessive-compulsive disorder?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1087054710376909">
<title>Stressful Life Events</title>
<p>The questionnaire in the study comprised five questions on stressful life events as indicators of functional problems in everyday life. They concerned (1) divorce or breakup with the partner, (2) serious family problems, (3) loss of a job, and (4) financial loss. The instruction was “Think of your whole life and mark all events you ever have experienced.” In addition, (5) information about sick leave with medical certificate during the last 12 months was obtained (“Have you sometimes during the last 12 months been on sick-leave with a medical certificate?”).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1087054710376909">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>To describe the strength of associations between ADHD symptoms and the psychiatric outcomes and stressful life events we calculated odds ratios. Associations between the binary criterion (psychiatric or functional outcome) on the one hand and binary and continuous predictors (sex, age, socioeconomic status, ADHD) on the other hand were estimated using Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models (GLMM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054710376909">Littell, Milliken, Stroup, Wolfinger, &amp; Schabenberger, 2006</xref>). Dichotomous outcomes were assumed to be distributed binary with a logit link function. Sex, age, socioeconomic status, and ADHD were modelled as fixed effects. We used the norm-based definition of ADHD with a 2 <italic>SD</italic> cutoff value instead of the criterion-based definition as a predictor to avoid computational problems. To take dependencies within monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs into account two different variance-covariance matrices, which means correlation patterns, were modelled using R-side random effects with an unstructured variance-covariance matrix. To evaluate the statistical significance of sex differences of ADHD correlates the interaction term of sex and ADHD symptoms was estimated. Generalized linear mixed effects models were implemented using PROC GLIMMIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054710376909">Satterfield, Hoppe, &amp; Schell, 1982</xref>). All statistical analysis was performed using the <italic>Statistical Analysis System</italic> (SAS), Version 9.1.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054710376909">SAS Institute Inc, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Nominal statistical significance was evaluated by 95% confidence intervals corresponding to a local α error of .05. No adjustment for multiple testing was applied, such as the Bonferroni method, as this approach is biased if applied to correlated outcomes. As psychiatric symptoms, such as depression and anxiety, often occur together, we did not find this approach appropriate. However, all applied tests are reported as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054710376909">Proschan and Waclawiw (2000)</xref> to enable the reader to evaluate the overall significance of the findings.</p>

<p>The prevalence of ADHD symptoms, both criterion-based and norm-based, is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054710376909">Table 1</xref>. The total prevalence according to the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria was 1.27% for total ADHD (including all three ADHD subtypes), 0.15% for combined ADHD, 0.70% for hyperactive-impulsive ADHD, and 0.42% for inattentive ADHD. There were no substantial differences in prevalence of various ADHD types between sexes. The prevalence for the norm-based approach with a 2 <italic>SD</italic> cutoff was considerably higher. Given the low prevalence for the criterion-based approach all the remaining analyses were based on the norm-based criteria.</p>

In general, odds ratios ranged between 1.30 (ADHD hyperactive) and 7.98 (ADHD total, bipolar disorder) in the overall sample.

<title>Sex Differences</title>
<p>In general, odds ratios ranged between 1.27 (ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive, obsessive-compulsive disorder) and 12.12 (ADHD, combined, bipolar disorder) in men and between 1.38 (ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive, major depression) and 9.19 (ADHD inattentive, bipolar disorder) in women.

<title>ADHD in General</title>
<p>The strength of the associations between ADHD and stressful life events is reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1087054710376909">Table 3</xref>. Fifty-three of all 60 odds ratios (88%) were nominally significant (α = .05) showing converging evidence for a greater risk for stressful life events of individuals with ADHD. The odds ratios were between 1.15 (ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive, and job loss) and 2.60 (ADHD, combined, and financial loss) in the overall sample, between 1.10 (ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive, and job loss) and 3.15 (ADHD, combined, and sick leave) in men and between 1.19 (ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive, and job loss) and 2.38 (ADHD, combined, and financial loss) in women. When comparing different stressful life events, individuals with ADHD seem to be at highest risk for financial loss (OR = 2.10; CI<sub>95%</sub> = [1.82; 2.42]), family problems (OR = 1.88; CI<sub>95%</sub> = [1.67; 2.12]), or sick leave (OR = 1.82; CI<sub>95%</sub> = [1.58; 2.12]), whereas the risk for divorce or a breakup of one’s partnership (OR = 1.64; CI<sub>95%</sub> = [1.45; 1.84]) and the risk of losing one’s job (OR = 1.43; CI<sub>95%</sub> = [1.26; 1.63]) appear to be of less importance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We conducted a population-based study in a large sample of adult Swedish twins to analyze the associations among the three <italic>DSM-IV</italic> subtypes of ADHD, other psychiatric conditions, and stressful life events. In general, we found that symptoms of ADHD were associated with an increased risk for psychiatric problems and stressful life events. The risk was particularly high for bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Comparisons across the three <italic>DSM-IV</italic> subtypes of ADHD revealed a significantly lower risk for generalized anxiety disorder and major depression for the hyperactive-impulsive type only. We found little evidence of sex-related difference pattern for women and men. In line with previous research on comorbidities of ADHD in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054710376909">Biederman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054710376909">Fayyad et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054710376909">Kessler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054710376909">Sobanski et al., 2007</xref>), we observed an increased risk for symptoms of major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and substance use disorder. The most striking result in our study was the high risk of participants with ADHD for bipolar disorder. The comorbidity of bipolar disorder and ADHD is controversially discussed. There is a considerable overlap in symptoms among adults with ADHD, especially the primarily hyperactive-impulsive type and the manic phase of bipolar disorder, such as talkativeness, restlessness, increased activity, and loss of social inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087054710376909">Wingo &amp; Ghami, 2007</xref>). However, given that the estimated risk was lower for the hyperactive-impulsive type compared with the inattentive type, it is unlikely that the high risk for comorbid bipolar disorder in our study was caused by an overlap of symptoms. Some authors suggest that coexisting mania and ADHD indicate a distinct disorder; that is, a subtype of bipolar disorder with earlier age of onset, features of ADHD, and poorer prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087054710376909">Tamam, Karakus, &amp; Ozpoyraz, 2008</xref>). Together with our results, this clearly suggests that further studies should explore the nature of relationship between the two disorders.</p>
<p>Studies regarding functional impairment and stressful life events are difficult to compare because there is no generally accepted way to measure these impairments. However, our findings of greater risk for stressful life events regarding social, occupational, and financial events for individuals with ADHD confirmed the findings of previous research. Biederman and colleagues (2006) found that adults with ADHD significantly more often lost or changed their jobs, were more often divorced and had lower incomes than the control group. Other studies found similar results, though with different methods of assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054710376909">Able, Johnston, Adler, &amp; Swindle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054710376909">Biederman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054710376909">De Graaf et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054710376909">Sobanski et al., 2007</xref>). In addition to previous research, we found a similar pattern for stressful events for all subtypes and for both sexes, suggesting a corresponding burden for all adults with ADHD.</p>
<p>We observed a lower risk for comorbidities in the hyperactive-impulsive subtype of ADHD, especially for anxiety disorder and major depression. This is the general pattern observed in studies of children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054710376909">Mannuzza, Klein, Bessler, Malloy, &amp; LaPadula, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054710376909">Murphy et al., 2002</xref>). This might indicate that internalizing disorders are more closely linked to the inattentive component of ADHD, even among adults. Previous research has observed strong associations between the hyperactive-impulsive type of ADHD and substance use problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054710376909">Elkins, McGue, &amp; Iacono, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054710376909">Kollins, McClernon, &amp; Fuemmeler, 2005</xref>). We were not able to replicate these findings. One possible explanation for the observed difference might be that our study was based on an adult population, whereas previous research has most often relied on childhood and adolescent samples. This issue is critical given that previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054710376909">Hart et al., 1995</xref>) suggest a decline in hyperactive-impulsive symptoms over development, whereas symptoms of inattention tend to persist into adulthood. Further longitudinal research on the stability of ADHD subtypes across the development and the link to comorbid psychiatric disorders is recommended.</p>
<p>Consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054710376909">Biederman and coworkers (2004)</xref>, we found a similar pattern of subtype distribution among male and female participants with ADHD. Adult females with ADHD report as much symptoms of ADHD as their male counterparts. They also report similar levels of psychiatric comorbidities and stressful life events. These findings might indicate that the higher prevalence of ADHD in boys, often observed in childhood, is partly due to a gender-based referral bias. That is, girls might be underrepresented in childhood ADHD because they tend to exhibit less externalizing comorbidities, conditions that usually lead to clinical referral in youth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1087054710376909">
<title>Strengths and Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>The present study has several strengths. First, we conducted a large size study, which, to our knowledge, is the largest population-based survey on adult ADHD in Europe so far. Second, the sample was based on the population-representative <italic>Swedish Twin Registry</italic>. Therefore, we were able to analyze correlations of psychiatric disorders, stressful life events, and ADHD without the potential referral bias of studies of clinical populations. Third, we studied even the different pattern of correlation for ADHD subtypes. Finally, we also examined sex differences for the associations of ADHD, other psychiatric symptoms, and stressful life events.</p>
<p>The study is also limited in several aspects. First, we were not able to diagnose ADHD as a clinical disorder due to limitations in the assessment of the data. The validity and reliability of the questionnaire we used are not yet established. The use of self-report questionnaires is controversially discussed. Some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710376909">Kooij et al., 2008</xref>) show that self-report questionnaires based on the diagnostic criteria of the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> are the most reliable source for information of ADHD in adults, whereas others caution against the use of this method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054710376909">Barkley et al., 2002</xref>). We did not have information regarding impairment caused by inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms in different settings such as social or occupational environments. Moreover, information regarding childhood symptoms of ADHD was not available. Both aspects are formally required to diagnose ADHD following the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> diagnostic rules and can be obtained by a clinical interview. This was, however, not possible in our study because of the nature of the data collection. The feature of impairment is rarely obtained in large surveys as it is difficult to obtain and validate in self-report questionnaires. In studies without a clinical interview to diagnose ADHD the criterion of impairment is often omitted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054710376909">Faraone &amp; Biederman, 2005</xref>). The age-of-onset criterion is currently debated. Several studies show that when compared between a group older than 7 years at the onset of ADHD symptoms and a group younger than 7 years at the onset, there were no significant differences in comorbid conditions or impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054710376909">Rohde et al., 2000</xref>). It is therefore questionable whether childhood symptoms define an essential characteristic of ADHD.</p>
<p>Second, prevalence of ADHD in adults varies depending on the applied diagnostic method. There are currently two major approaches to calculate the prevalence of ADHD: Criterion-based solutions understand the disorder as a dichotomous phenomenon and define absolute criteria for the diagnosis of ADHD. Norm-based methods, however, consider ADHD as a multidimensional construct consisting of continuous traits. They define ADHD as deviation relative to the population average of ADHD symptoms (the “norm”). A discussion is still going on about what diagnostic approach is to be preferred. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054710376909">Barkley and coworkers (2002)</xref>, for example, suggested a norm-based approach, whereas others recommend the criterion-based approach of the <italic>DSM-IV</italic>. We decided to apply both diagnostic approaches to take into account the current discussion, to compare those methods, and finally to select the best method for our primary goal that was to examine associations between ADHD and other psychiatric problems. We used the norm-based approach for the following reasons: The prevalence values from the criterion-based approach were considerably lower than those of the similar studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054710376909">Fayyad et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054710376909">Kessler et al., 2006</xref>) and would also have caused computational problems in the association analysis because of the low frequency of cases. By using the higher prevalence of ADHD from the norm-based approach these problems were avoided. Since we consider ADHD as a multidimensional construct consisting of continuous traits, different cutoff values can be justified. In addition, the determination of the actual prevalence of ADHD in the population was not our primary goal, and therefore a norm-based approach seemed to be the best choice within the scope of our study.</p>
<p>Third, we were not able to diagnose psychiatric comorbidities in clinical terms, similar to the limitations regarding the diagnosis of ADHD. Especially bipolar disorder and anxiety disorder can overlap in symptoms and a psychiatric assessment is needed to provide the correct diagnosis. This is especially true for bipolar symptoms and their differentiation from ADHD symptoms. Due to the nature of the data collection, we were not able to perform an interview to assess the clinical relevance of the different symptoms. Therefore, the presented results, especially on correlations between ADHD and bipolar symptoms, should be taken with caution.</p>
<p>Fourth, although the sample is based on the population-representative <italic>Swedish Twin Registry</italic>, we observed a considerable number of nonresponders. Assuming that participants with relevant symptoms of ADHD are less willing to participate, the prevalence of ADHD or comorbidities might be underestimated. This might also reduce the variability of this and other disorders in the sample leading to lower correlations among these clinical entities. Nevertheless, we were able to show several statistical significant correlations.</p>
<p>Finally, the number of conducted tests can lead to false positive results due to multiple testing as we did not statistically control the global Type I error rate. However, conventional methods, such as Bonferroni method, for adjustment of the overall α error were not appropriate because of the correlations between psychiatric symptoms. Instead we applied a hypothesis-guided approach by carefully selecting the most relevant comorbid psychiatric and functional outcomes based on present evidence. Furthermore, we reported the number of applied tests to enable the reader to evaluate the significance of the findings.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have observed a higher risk for adults with ADHD symptoms for psychiatric problems, especially bipolar disorder. The hyperactive-impulsive subtype had a lower risk than other subtypes. We found no differences across subtypes regarding functional impairment and no sex differences for psychiatric and stressful life events.</p>
<p>These results clearly indicate that adults with ADHD often suffer from other psychiatric problems. The high overlap for comorbid bipolar symptoms is important to consider for clinicians, as it has impact on the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD. Further studies are needed to clarify the association between ADHD and bipolar disorder. Our finding of lower risk for the hyperactive-impulsive subtype with regard to anxiety disorder and major depression is consistent with studies on children and adolescents, which provide support for the existence of ADHD subtypes even among adults. The functional impairment across subtypes and sexes shows clearly the burden for adults with ADHD, regardless whether hyperactive, impulsive, or inattentive symptoms prevail.</p>
<p>Thus, future research needs to further investigate the linkage of bipolar disorder and ADHD, focusing on the question, if it in fact substitutes a distinct subtype of bipolar disorder or a true comorbidity. Furthermore, the stability and change of ADHD subtypes across the development should be examined.</p>
