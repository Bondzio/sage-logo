<abstract>
<p>Information and communication technology has increasingly gained importance in marketing of the tourism and travel industry. Social media have literally become an integral part of the society and as such have gained increasing interest beyond industries such as tourism. In higher education, we have seen a trend towards a rather slow adaptation of new technologies for instance in online instruction; however, the opportunities for creating and sharing knowledge in an education context should not be neglected. Social network sites are the fastest growing and most popular of the Internet-based technologies; recent statistics show that many Facebook users are students and that a great deal of communication between students happens online. This article investigates a higher educational institution in Austria, which actively links with their students on a social network site for marketing purposes, presents its development and provides the results of an online user survey. Results indicate that among social network sites, Facebook is the most popular site students use; however, they spend more time observing than actually posting content.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356766712449368">Holloway (2004</xref>) had already noted that<disp-quote>
<p>Information and communication technology, as it is now known, has come to play a key role in all elements of the marketing mix, and the new term recognizes the importance of communication in the interface between a business and its customers. Electronic, or ‘online’ communications have become affordable and practicable for even the smallest SMEs, and no sector of the travel industry is unaffected by this revolution. (pp. 197–198)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Nowadays, social media have become an integral part of the society and have also gained increasing importance in tourism education, as students are thought to be motivated to use the new technologies not only in their private but also in their academic life (Dohn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1356766712449368">2009</xref>). Recent statistics show that of approximately 500 million Facebook users, 28% are college students, 22% are graduates and 21% are high school students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356766712449368">Digitalsurgeons, 2011</xref>; Facebook, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356766712449368">2011</xref>). Many higher education institutions have started to communicate with their students via social network sites (SNSs) (Flynn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356766712449368">2009</xref>; Stansbury, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1356766712449368">2009</xref>; Young, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1356766712449368">2009</xref>); they have set up their own Facebook page and seek to actively link with their students. Social media therefore provide opportunities for higher education institutes to increase their presence within the student community, their effectiveness in fulfilling their educational goals and the efficiency of their marketing actions towards potential students (Forkosh-Baruch and Hershkovitz, 2012).</p>
<p>Basically, SNSs are designed to foster social interaction in a virtual environment. Use of SNSs is a relatively new trend in higher education institutions, and little research has been done on this topic so far. Popularity of SNS in formal and informal educational settings and beyond them, however, is constantly growing (Forkosh-Baruch and Hershkovitz, 2012; Mason and Rennie, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356766712449368">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1356766712449368">2008</xref>). Since it is common to find students and faculty in the same social space, it is important to examine the implications for educational institutions (Mendez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1356766712449368">2009</xref>). This article reports a single case study of a tourism programme at a higher education institution in Austria. The descriptive research at hand covers the planning, initiating and maintaining phases of social media marketing of an education institution via SNS. Besides reporting each step in the development process of the SNS, the research design includes a quantitative analysis of all tourism students of that institution not only to reveal the ratio between different user profiles (such as potential students, active students and alumni) but also to disclose motivations to interact. The aim of this research therefore is to explore SNS as an effective marketing tool and to answer the following research questions:</p>

<title>Literature review</title>
<p>Following this introduction, there are three areas of the literature that serve as a foundation of this study – social media and social media marketing, SNSs and social media marketing and SNSs in higher education – and will be briefly discussed in this section.</p>
<sec id="section3-1356766712449368">
<title>Social media and social media marketing</title>
<p>Social media are tools that provide people with the ability to collaborate and communicate with one another online. Social media tools facilitate the creation and sharing of knowledge, information, media, ideas, opinions and insights, and allow people to actively participate in the media itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356766712449368">Campbell, 2010</xref>). Based on a literature review, Kaplan and Haenlein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1356766712449368">2010</xref>: 61) define social media as media ‘that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content’.</p>
<p>Social media marketing signals the move from passive consumption of marketing messages to facilitating interaction with messages. Rust and Oliver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356766712449368">1994</xref>) propose that the emergence of new technologies has caused traditional advertising to become increasingly obsolete. They argue that the era of social media will be enduring. And while traditional media allow a company to retain control over their marketing message and broadcast it to the consumer, social media have contributed to the development of the prosumer by empowering consumers, allowing them to participate and assess content, share content with other consumers and share opinions, attitudes and beliefs with one another in relation to that content, including company messages (Kozinets, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356766712449368">1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1356766712449368">
<title>SNSs</title>
<p>Social media tools include social networking sites, blogs, wikis, podcasts, content aggregators and content communities (Dabbagh and Kitsantas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356766712449368">2012</xref>). Of all social media tools, SNSs have experienced the most prolific growth (Boyd, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1356766712449368">2006</xref>). SNSs began in 1997 with the launch of SixDegrees.com, which ‘allowed users to create profiles, [and] list their friends’ (Boyd and Ellison, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356766712449368">2008</xref>: 214). SNS are<disp-quote>
<p>web-based services that allow individuals to construct a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system, articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection and view and transverse their list of connections and those made by others in the system. (Boyd and Ellison, 2008: 210).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Now, SNSs account for nearly 17% of the total Internet time with people nowadays spending more time on SNSs than on traditional media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356766712449368">Diffley et al., 2011</xref>). According to Nielsen.com (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356766712449368">2009</xref>), the top five sites of 2009 are Facebook, Myspace, Twitter, Classmates and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Facebook is one of the most popular SNSs for students (Boyd and Ellison, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356766712449368">2008</xref>; Kitsis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1356766712449368">2008</xref>). Facebook was created by Mark Zuckerberg in 2004 while he was a student at Harvard with the general concept ‘to digitalize the freshman-year “Facebook” and to allow students not only to gawk at one’s photos, but also to flirt, network and interact’ (Hirschhorn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356766712449368">2007</xref>: 154). Given the popularity of Facebook with students, it is not surprising that it has become an area of interest to researchers involved in higher education (Dabner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356766712449368">2012</xref>; Subrahmanyyam et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1356766712449368">2008</xref>). Facebook now has a diverse community of users of all levels of education and background with more than 500 million users. Terms like ‘net generation’ or ‘digital natives’ are often used to label the generation born after 1980 – those people who have grown up with these tools as an inherent part of their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356766712449368">Bennett et al., 2008</xref>; Palfrey and Gasser, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1356766712449368">2008</xref>; Prensky, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1356766712449368">2001</xref>; Tapscott, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356766712449368">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the level of connectedness facilitated by SNSs, Enders et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356766712449368">2008</xref>) highlight the potential these sites offer in terms of reaching a greater number of consumers by building upon Anderson’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356766712449368">2006</xref>) model of the ‘long tail’ (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1356766712449368">1</xref>).</p>

<title>Social media marketing and SNSs in higher education</title>
<p>The social media have also added a new dimension to learning and education, as they give learners the chance to actively participate in the learning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356766712449368">Hrastinski, 2009</xref>). SNSs in particular make it easy to proactively find like-minded people (Moskaliuk et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1356766712449368">2009</xref>). Higher education institutions are beginning to embrace social media and realize the potential power and implications for using it as a component of their overall marketing mix.</p>
<p>Although designed for social and marketing uses, SNSs appear to be in the process of transitioning to other areas, including higher education (Danciu and Grosseck, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356766712449368">2011</xref>). According to Karlin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356766712449368">2007</xref>: 7), ‘almost 60% of students who use social networking talk about education online and more than 50% about specific school work’. Hence, Facebook and other SNSs are becoming more prevalent in educational environments (Arnold and Paulus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356766712449368">2010</xref>; Schwartz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356766712449368">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>For creating a SNS, one usually follows a certain procedure. Tasner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1356766712449368">2010</xref>) developed a four-step model for setting up an effective social media strategy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1356766712449368">2</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig2-1356766712449368" position="float">

</fig>
<p>According to Tasner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1356766712449368">2010</xref>), first one has to define the overall goal and audience for the social media strategy to be developed. Second, one has to decide upon the appropriate tool or platform. Third, one needs to establish a social media presence, which, fourth, one needs to keep vital and up to date. This four-step model was applied to the tourism programme with the aim to develop a SNS for tourism students.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>The use of case studies as a research methodology has grown in recent years, as case studies reveal interesting results and provide real-world situations. According to Yin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1356766712449368">2009</xref>), three types of case studies are differentiated as follows:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">

</list-item>
</list>
<p>This research is a descriptive case study that describes the process of setting up a SNS and reports on a small-scale quantitative research among students.</p>
<sec id="section7-1356766712449368">
<title>Development of the SNS</title>
<p>Following the four-step model of Tasner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1356766712449368">2010</xref>), step 1 was to identify the core objectives for a social media page and its audience and decide which ones make sense based on our institution’s quantifiable goals. According to the case study at hand, the main objectives were the following:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>To establish a professional network with the alumni;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>To provide a communication platform for potential and active students and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>To present research activities of the tourism department.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The main audiences in terms of target group for the page were potential students, active students, alumni and faculty. Step 2 was to identify the appropriate platform. According to the high user rate of Facebook and the considerable number of students using it according to former research (Facebook, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356766712449368">2011</xref>; Flynn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356766712449368">2009</xref>; Stansbury, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1356766712449368">2009</xref>; Young, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1356766712449368">2009</xref>), Facebook was identified as the appropriate platform.</p>
<p>Step 3 was to set up the page according to content guidelines and to establish a consistent presence on the site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1356766712449368">3</xref>). The Facebook fanpage was finally launched in April 2011.</p>
<fig id="fig3-1356766712449368" position="float">

<p>Screenshot of the Facebook fanpage.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1356766712449368-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Step 4 is that the provider of the page needs to keep the content vital and to make contributions to the network, as user-generated content is successful only if users are regularly attracted to the site to contribute (Mason and Rennie, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356766712449368">2007</xref>). With regard to the Facebook fanpage, we found that the contributions to the network, the measuring of the effectiveness of the fanpage and a comparison of the results with our defined goals would be crucial information for the successful development of our SNS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1356766712449368">
<title>User survey</title>
<p>To investigate the social media behaviour of students and to investigate the effectiveness of the Facebook fanpage, an online survey was carried out among all active tourism students (N = 340) in October 2011. Among the 340 students, 250 active students were studying in the 6-semester bachelor’s programme; the other 90 active students were enrolled in the 4-semester masters’ programme.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1356766712449368">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The response rate was 51.5% (n = 175). At that time, the Facebook fanpage had 274 fans, of which 126 were graduates (graduates in total: 478), 72 were active students (active student total: 336) and 76 were other stakeholders.</p>
<p>The first question in the questionnaire dealt with the period for which students have already been using social media in general. The outcome shows that 64.12% of the participants have been using social media for more than 3 years, 25.53% have been using it for 2–3 years, 9.41% have been using it for 1–2 years and 2.94% have been using it for 6 months to 1 year (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1356766712449368">4</xref>). Already, 57% of respondents use smartphones for social media activities beside their personal computers.</p>

</fig>
<p>Regarding the use of platforms, Facebook is heading the list with 97.66%, followed by YouTube, StudiVZ, XING, Google+ and Twitter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1356766712449368">5</xref>). Facebook is the SNS most often used by 110 students (M = 1.05, standard deviation (SD) = 0.25), followed by YouTube used by 47 students (M = 2.32, SD = 0.86) and StudiVZ most often used by 40 students (M = 3.10, SD = 1.26).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1356766712449368-fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The main reasons for using social media in general, and Facebook in particular, is to stay up to date with friend’s life (86.5%), to be up to date with social events (50%), to find general information (45%), to share videos/pictures (36%) and to find study information (35%).</p>
<p>Regarding the developed SNS itself, 63% of the respondents are not aware of our SNS on Facebook, 37% know the SNS and 85% of them are fans. The main motivation for respondents to join the SNS is to get interesting/relevant information (67%), to get connected with other students (53%) and out of curiosity (29%). The main reason for respondents not to join the SNS is because they do not want to mix student and private life (37.50%), due to data security issues (25%) and due to a lack of interest (25%). Generally, a one-way communication can be observed, that is, there is hardly any community activity.</p>
<p>On a 5-point Likert scale (1 = very unlikely and 5 = very likely), we then asked how likely it is that the respondents will become a fan of the SNS in the future. A total of 24.76% said it is very likely, 37.14% said it is likely, 25.71% were neutral, 8.57% said it is unlikely and 3.81% said it is very unlikely.</p>
<p>Asking respondents what content a social media fanpage of a higher education institution should provide, respondents rated job/internship opportunities with 79%, followed by information on social events with 73% and relevant information on the tourism industry with 66% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1356766712449368">6</xref>).</p>

<title>Interpretation of results</title>
<p>Social media in education can be a great marketing resource, as it gives us the opportunity to humanize stories of students and alumni of the institutions, which can create loyalty in both active and future students as well as in alumni (Solis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1356766712449368">2008</xref>). Results showed that Facebook seems to be the most frequently used SNS for our students, heading the list of various SNSs with 97.66%. This confirms our decision to develop a SNS for our tourism programme on Facebook and to communicate with our target audience via this social media tool.</p>
<p>However, there is a wise saying about social media: social media require that you give in order to receive. Until now our SNS is really a one-way communication tool, which means high time commitment of our institution to keep the SNS up to date. Adding social media into one’s marketing mix can become very intense and result in huge efforts of staff to manage the SNS effectively. The active usage of our SNS still is a big challenge, which needs to be overcome in the future. The main aim therefore must be to get into the mindsets of our users, to make them aware of the existence of the page and its benefits and to animate them to proactively contribute content.</p>
<p>According to our findings, we could see that privacy and security are the issues for respondents. This result is congruent with the findings of Junco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356766712449368">2011</xref>) and Roblyer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356766712449368">2010</xref>), who found that 15% of the students reported that they would feel their privacy invaded by communicating with each other on a Facebook site of their educational institution. However, it seems as if security and privacy related to SNSs are fundamentally behavioural issues not technology issues. The more information a person posts, the more information becomes available for a potential compromise by those with malicious intentions. Although this will continue to be a future challenge, a solid configuration of one’s privacy settings and discretion before posting information or commenting about anything should help to reach a responsible use of the SNS.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The present study has certain limitations that need to be taken into account before considering the results of the study and its contributions to using SNSs in tourism education. One limitation relates to the single case study methodology applied in the research. It would be interesting to compare several cases according to a multiple case research methodology in order to derive basic or general results for the use of SNSs at other higher education institutions. Moreover, a cross-cultural study with students would be interesting to reveal if there are cultural differences in students as regards SNS use. A second limitation arises from the small-scale nature of the study that does not allow generalizing results to the population at large. The conclusions on the findings therefore warrant caution.</p>
<p>Marketing of higher education institutions has changed over the last decades due to the advent of social media. As the use of key marketing strategies should focus on the customers’ or students’ needs and wants, social media have changed the marketing strategies to reach today’s students, who are eager to use the latest social media tools to communicate. The power of social media, however, has just scratched the surface, and its use in higher education is controversially discussed. However, education marketing is starting to change with higher education institutions finally embracing the use of social media as a way of directly communicating with their students.</p>
<p>Social networks were established initially for creating a circle of acquaintances for people with similar fields of interest; this is in concurrence with the fact that socializing online has become an important part of young adult life (Gemmill and Peterson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356766712449368">2006</xref>). However, academic institutions have lagged behind in joining social networks, although SNSs like Facebook provide new venues for students to express themselves and to interact with each other (Pempek et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1356766712449368">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The current case study shows that it will be necessary to increase the awareness of the SNS, to post jobs/internships and to generally foster communication between different stakeholder groups in the form of discussions, polls and so on. Interaction is at the heart of every virtual community, as it often facilitates a member’s need to learn and/or solve problems. Therefore, one of the main tasks will be to proactively encourage members to contribute content, rather than assuming that such contributions will arise organically. As a next step, the focus should be on potential students and the communication between alumni and active students. A positive result of the survey was that the awareness was raised and 27 new active students could be generated as fans.</p>
<p>In general, SNSs in tourism education will increasingly gain in importance when it comes to state-of-the-art communication methods at higher education institutions. Higher education institutions should be the ground-breakers and pilots of any new communication experience. The study at hand helps understand the pros and cons of a SNS for a higher education institution with the example of a single case study on social media marketing in the field of tourism higher education. Results of the study therefore are of interest for the academic communities involved in tourism higher education. Within higher education, future research should investigate the notion of Facebook friends, personality traits of profile owners, as well as the content of the profiles of the fans, in order to differentiate between various options enabled by social media, the intended use of those applications and what users actually make out of it.</p>
