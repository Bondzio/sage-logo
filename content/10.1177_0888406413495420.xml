<abstract>
<p>A survey of special education teachers in one state was conducted to determine their perceptions on the performance of tasks in the Response to Intervention (RTI) process. We asked teachers to identify professionals who completed or were involved in these tasks at each tier. Participants were asked to check who (a) refers students, (b) assesses individual needs, (c) plans instruction, (d) selects curriculum, (e) delivers instruction, (f) collects data, (g) graphs data, (h) interprets the data, and (i) makes decisions to move students to another tier of instruction. Overall, special education teachers perceive that general education teachers are involved in the majority of tasks throughout the tiers. They perceive the general education teachers’ involvement as decreasing from Tier 1 to Tier 3. Special education teachers perceive themselves as increasing in involvement from Tier 1 through Tier 3.</p>

<p>Response to Intervention (RTI) is a tiered service delivery system of instruction used to provide early, systematic assistance to students who have difficulty in school with functional and academic tasks. The process was designed to prevent academic failure using increasingly rigorous and focused research-based instructional interventions prior to referral to special education. As an early intervention system, RTI has the potential to provide data on which to base eligibility decisions. In the 2004 reauthorization to the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Congress responded to long-standing criticisms and dissatisfaction with the IQ-achievement discrepancy model for identifying students with specific learning disabilities (SLD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0888406413495420">Burns, Jacob, &amp; Wagner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0888406413495420">Division for Learning Disabilities, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0888406413495420">Fuchs, Mock, Morgan, &amp; Young, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0888406413495420">Proctor &amp; Prevatt, 2003</xref>). A number of authors explored alternative processes of identifying students by their levels of responses to the interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0888406413495420">Carney &amp; Stiefel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0888406413495420">Fuchs, Fuchs, &amp; Compton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0888406413495420">Reschly, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0888406413495420">Reschly &amp; Ysseldyke, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0888406413495420">Torgesen et al., 2001</xref>). The RTI process provides the opportunity to intervene prior to a determination of eligibility for special education.</p>
<p>RTI was proposed as a process for identification of students with SLD. It is based on the theory that some students who are struggling academically may not have been exposed to rigorous, research-based teaching methods. Therefore, they have not yet learned some of the content. As proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0888406413495420">IDEA 2004</xref>, the process could complement or supplant the discrepancy model. An operational definition of SLD has generally included a discrepancy, that is, an unexpected or unexplained failure to benefit from typical instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0888406413495420">Bateman, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0888406413495420">Kauffman &amp; Hallahan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0888406413495420">Kirk, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0888406413495420">Kirk &amp; Bateman, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0888406413495420">Willson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0888406413495420">Zigmond, 1993</xref>). In a discrepancy model, a student’s expected response to instruction and his actual response would help determine a label of learning disabilities. This determination almost always included an IQ score and standardized achievement scores along with performance measures. Placement teams continue to struggle with how much of a discrepancy would be needed to identify a student who may need to receive special education services.</p>
<p>Core characteristics that define RTI include (a) implementing research-based instruction in classrooms, (b) conducting universal screening of students to determine educational progress or formative assessment, (c) intervening with more intense instruction for students who are not making adequate progress (tiered interventions and supports), (d) maintaining fidelity of instruction, and (e) making instructional decisions based on data collected on individual progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0888406413495420">Bradley, Danielson, &amp; Doolittle, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0888406413495420">Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0888406413495420">Fuchs et al., 2003</xref>). The multiple tiers of instruction generally include three or four tiers of instructional intensity in which the student receives more or more intense services, if their skills or behaviors have not shown adequate responses to the intervention currently in place. This process of determining an individual student’s needs, determining response to teaching, and adding intensity to see if the student will respond to research-based interventions, has grown in acceptance. Even with some agreement, many issues related to implementation of RTI remain unresolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0888406413495420">Hollenbeck, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0888406413495420">Hoover &amp; Patton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0888406413495420">Kavale &amp; Spaulding, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0888406413495420">Mellard, Byrd, Johnson, Tollefson, &amp; Boesche, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0888406413495420">Reeves, Bishop, &amp; Filce, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0888406413495420">Reynolds &amp; Shaywitz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0888406413495420">Zirkel &amp; Thomas, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A considerable number of studies in the past few years explored the process of identifying students with disabilities by the students’ response to the interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0888406413495420">Barnes &amp; Harlacher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0888406413495420">Carney &amp; Stiefel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0888406413495420">Fuchs et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0888406413495420">Reschly, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0888406413495420">Reschly &amp; Ysseldyke, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0888406413495420">Torgesen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0888406413495420">Vaughn, Linan-Thompson, &amp; Hickman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0888406413495420">Vellutino et al., 1996</xref>). Other studies have explored the use of RTI in instruction and in delivering intervention to students prior to referral to special education services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0888406413495420">Lipka &amp; Siegel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0888406413495420">Orosco &amp; Klingner, 2012</xref>) and the efficacy of the assessment procedures used in an RTI framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0888406413495420">Speece et al., 2011</xref>).There are numerous models and no single paradigm is accepted as the “right way to do RTI” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0888406413495420">Werts, Lambert, &amp; Carpenter, 2009</xref>, p. 246).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0888406413495420">Wiener and Soodak (2008)</xref> surveyed special education administrators representing local educational agencies nationwide. They found that respondents generally viewed RTI as a regular education initiative. Specifically, about a third of the administrators stated that general education teachers would be responsible for implementation, a slightly larger group perceived implementation as a collaboration between general and special educators, and about 10% indicated that RTI was a special education assignment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0888406413495420">Werts et al. (2009)</xref> surveyed district-level special education administrators in one state. These administrators indicated that many persons would be responsible for the day-to-day tasks involved in an RTI model. Administrators predicted that school psychologists would be closely involved with day-to-day Curriculum Based Measurement testing and analysis of the data. General and special education teachers would also be involved in collecting data during teaching sessions. Administrators perceived teachers and school psychologists, along with parents, principals, and guidance counselors, as those who would determine whether a student is responsive to instruction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0888406413495420">Santosti, Noltemeyer, and Goss (2010)</xref> conducted a survey and concluded that high school principals perceived RTI as important, but that significant changes would be necessary. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0888406413495420">Pyle (2011)</xref> conducted focus groups with teachers who were involved in a pilot RTI project. The teachers stated that they were overwhelmed. Time, extra duties, and increased amounts of testing were barriers to successful implementation.</p>
<p>Because RTI was proposed in special education law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0888406413495420">IDEA, 2004</xref>), it may have been seen originally as a special education initiative. There is a movement to promote the initiative as a general education process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0888406413495420">Fuchs, Fuchs, &amp; Stecker, 2010</xref>).Of the stakeholders in RTI, the individuals who work with students who are at risk, those who work with students who are considered for referrals, and those who collaborate with multiple teachers in multiple grade levels are the special education teachers. They are also involved with school psychologists, administrators in the schools, and in the larger district. This gives special education teachers a unique perspective on the RTI process.</p>
<p>The study involved teachers in North Carolina, therefore, it is salient to identify the structure of RTI in the state. The state uses a problem-solving model in four tiers. The first three tiers are identified as pre-referral, with the fourth tier as special education referral. Tier 1 interventions are those given to all students and the data are drawn from Universal Screening, accountability assessments, grades, classroom assessments, referral patterns, and discipline referrals. Tier 2 interventions are delivered in smaller groups and data to assess the effectiveness include assessment used in Tier 1 with the addition of systematic progress monitoring. Tier 3 instruction is more individualized and data collection is more frequent and more intensive.</p>
<p>To this end, we conducted a survey of special education teachers in one state to determine their perceptions of the assignment of roles in a multi-tiered system of intervention with the research question: What are the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in RTI? Specifically, who (a) refers students, (b) assesses individual needs, (c) plans instruction, (d) selects curriculum, (e) delivers instruction, (f) collects data, (g) graphs data, (h) interprets the data, and (i) makes decisions to move students to another tier of instruction. We asked teachers to identify professionals who completed or were involved in these tasks at each tier.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Web sites for each of the 117 districts in one state were searched. Within districts, school web sites were searched for staff or faculty directories. Names of special education teachers were identified, and the e-mail addresses were listed in our database. From an initial list of 4,521 possible e-mail addresses collected, we had a list of 3,570 deliverable (i.e., not returned as undeliverable) e-mail addresses that were used in the initial distribution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0888406413495420">
<title>Instrument</title>
<p>A questionnaire containing three sections was formatted in SurveyMonkey (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.surveymonkey.com">http://www.surveymonkey.com</ext-link>) to fit three screens plus a screen for a cover letter and one for a thank you. In the first section, respondents were asked to indicate if they had RTI in their schools and if they were involved in RTI. If the participant indicated yes to either question, they were directed to questions about RTI, and then to demographic questions. If they answered no to both questions, they were directed to demographic questions. The second section contained multiple-choice questions, with an opportunity for open-ended comments, on referral processes, key personnel, and ratings of perceptions of success. Participants were asked to list benefits and barriers to RTI. The final section contained demographic items about current position, number of years as an educator, highest degree earned, size of the student body in their districts, and training in RTI.</p>

<sec id="section4-0888406413495420">
<title>Questionnaire Development and Description</title>
<p>The questionnaire was developed through a systematic process of reviews. Based on the responses to an earlier survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0888406413495420">Werts et al., 2009</xref>), investigators’ classroom and research experiences, and on the existing literature in RTI, a questionnaire was written. This draft was sent to 10 university faculty in special education for review. They were asked to suggest additional items, recommend deletion of items, and make revisions in the wording of items. From their comments, a second draft was written and distributed to a five-member panel consisting of a principal, a special education teacher, and three university faculty in special education and early childhood education, who made additional suggestions for revisions, deletions, and additions. Based on the panel’s feedback, a final draft was written by the authors.</p>
<p>A multistage distribution procedure was used following protocols for Internet-based surveys provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0888406413495420">Dillman, Smyth, and Christian (2009)</xref>. First, participants were sent a prenotice e-mail to establish the importance of the following survey and to validate the e-mail addresses. Two days later, the questionnaire link was sent to 3,570 validated addresses. The letter stressed the importance of individual participation in the process. Two weeks after the initial mailing, a reminder e-mail was sent to all nonrespondents along with another link to the questionnaire. Four weeks after the original mailing, another reminder was sent asking the nonrespondents to assist in the research by responding. Six weeks after the original link was sent, a third reminder was sent. A final reminder was sent 3 weeks later.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0888406413495420">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>For all questions, data were entered automatically from the returned questionnaires into a database by the computer survey program. From there, data were compiled for this study as percentages of persons responding to each option in the multiple-choice questions. For this report, analyses are centered on responses to the questions of which educators (general education teachers, special education teachers, psychologists, reading teachers, or principals) are involved in tasks in each tier of the RTI process.</p>

<sec id="section6-0888406413495420" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>We sent 3,570 e-mail invitations to participate in the survey. Of these, 280 persons opted not to participate, and 1,754 teachers answered the questionnaire, resulting in a 57.0% overall response rate. When we calculate the rate using only those who responded to the questionnaire, the return rate is 49.1%. The first few questions asked respondents to identify if RTI was used in their schools and if they were involved in RTI. A total of 44.2% (<italic>n</italic> = 775) teachers reported RTI was used in their schools. Of these, 470 were involved in the process. Persons who answered yes to either of these questions were directed to questions about RTI followed by demographic questions. Those without RTI in the school or involvement in RTI were directed to the demographic questions only. Based on these responses, we divided the participants into two groups: those with experience with RTI and those without experience. Demographically, the groups were similar. The characteristics are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0888406413495420">Table 1</xref>. Almost half of each group had earned graduate degrees. There was no majority of persons teaching in any type of special education setting. Most had taught between 2 and 15 years. More than half of the respondents were from larger school districts. Those with RTI in the schools reported having more training than those who were not exposed to the initiative.</p>

<p>The participants were asked to define role assignments for each tier: which educators (a) refer students, (b) assess individual needs, (c) plan instruction, (d) select curriculum, (e) deliver instruction, (f) collect data, (g) graph data, (h) interpret the data, and (i) make decisions to move students to another tier of instruction.

Special educators perceived that general education teachers were more involved in all tasks in all tiers. The percentage of respondents who stated that general education teachers were involved decreased over tiers but to a small degree. Special educators perceived that they, special education teachers, were involved in all tasks in each of the tiers second to general education teachers with perceived increasing involvement over tiers. In no case did the amount of involvement in any task in any tier exceed the perceived amount for general education teachers. The differential diminished over tiers. Reading teachers’ involvement in the tasks increased over the three tiers. Their perceived involvement was still less than special education teachers, even in Tier 1, where they may be expected to have contact with students who are not identified as qualified or eligible for a special education label. Psychologists and principals were perceived by fewer than half of the respondents as involved in most tasks with increasing amounts for tasks that would occur during building a team or IEP (Individualized Education Program) meetings (interpreting data and making decisions to move students to other tiers.)</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The research question for this study concerned the roles and responsibilities of individuals responsible for tasks in the pre-referral tiers for RTI. The special education teachers we surveyed indicated several patterns of role assignment. First, special educators indicated a perception that general education teachers are primarily the agents of RTI. In each of the three tiers, general education teachers were perceived as having a major contribution to the tasks and activities of RTI. In all response categories (tasks by tiers), a larger percentage of special education teachers stated that general educators were more involved than any other group—including themselves. This indicates that RTI is seen as a general education initiative and that general education teachers are seen as the primary agents. Many authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0888406413495420">Bender &amp; Shores, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0888406413495420">Crepeau-Hobson &amp; Sobel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0888406413495420">Lenski, 2011-2012</xref>) have predicted that all educators will be responsible for RTI activities in their classrooms. Changes in how educators work together are as yet undefined but may include an increased presence for special educators as consultants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0888406413495420">Bryant &amp; Barrera, 2009</xref>). Those instructing will continue to include special education teachers as well as many others with changing roles in RTI models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0888406413495420">Lenski, 2011-2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0888406413495420">Robins &amp; Antrim, 2012</xref>). Because the process depends on effective interventions and the assessment of these interventions, the idea that many of the tasks of RTI fall on a team of persons including the general education teacher is reasonable. The process is designed to find students who are struggling and those who need assistance in the general education classrooms. General education teachers interact with these students every day and are in a good position to see those who may need more assistance than is regularly provided.</p>
<p>Effective instruction is integral to the RTI process. In the early tiers, this instruction is, necessarily, in the general education classrooms. Ensuring the instruction is appropriate for the developmental levels and for the chronological age ranges, as well as maturity levels is in the purview of the classroom teacher. The implementation of instruction and the assurance of the fidelity of that implantation are critical.</p>
<p>Progress monitoring is linked to the taught curriculum. The general education teacher is cognizant of the daily variations in what is taught. There are multiple reasons a student may show a lack of progress on an informal measure including variations in delivery of curriculum and sequencing of content.</p>
<p>Finally, the inclusive nature of many educational programs for students in special education is based on the philosophy that these students, who are identified as eligible for services, belong in the Least Restrictive Environment. Collaborative processes are important for all teachers who are instructional leaders and those who are delivering effective instruction. The general education teacher assesses to determine what is needed, instructs using effective methods and strategies, determines the effectiveness of the interventions, and reassesses to determine the next steps for the individual students. Subsequent to classroom instruction in many tiers, the general educator collaborates with other educators.</p>
<p>We do not know how much training in aspects of the tiered process is available to all teachers. Slightly more than 60% of this sample of special education teachers who were involved in RTI had received some training. Of those not yet involved, less than 30% had been exposed to any in-service session, workshop, formal or informal training. We do not have a measure of how much or the nature of the training general education teachers or reading teachers have received. It is imperative that all teachers, particularly general education teachers, receive training for RTI to be successfully implemented.</p>
<p>Second, special education teachers see themselves as increasingly involved as students move through tiers and move closer to referral and placement processes. In an earlier study, administrators were asked who would be involved in day-to-day tasks, and although the consensus was low, it was predicted that special education teachers and psychologists would be more involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0888406413495420">Werts et al., 2009</xref>). The perception of teachers confirms the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0888406413495420">Wiener and Soodak (2008)</xref>, who found that administrators did see RTI as a part of regular education. Furthermore, the perception of increasing involvement is repeated for reading teachers. They are seen by the surveyed special educators, as increasing in involvement over the tiers. Their involvement is not perceived as surpassing the general educators or the special educators in any task in any tier. Therefore, collaboration among specialists and classroom teachers becomes more critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0888406413495420">Benedict, Park, Brownell, Lauterbach, &amp; Kiely, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0888406413495420">Dulaney, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0888406413495420">Fuchs &amp; Bergeron, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0888406413495420">Murawski &amp; Hughes, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, the number of persons who perceive principals and psychologists as involved is static across tiers within tasks. The percentage of persons nominating psychologists, and principals, is lower than that predicted by the administrators in an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0888406413495420">Werts et al., 2009</xref>). The main area of perceived involvement was in making decisions to move students to a different tier. Perceived involvement with this decision increases in Tiers 2 and 3. Additional areas included interpreting graphs, selecting curriculum, and making curricular suggestions. It is possible special educators perceive principals and psychologists as involved primarily as agents making decisions in meetings and in working collaboratively with teachers as students move toward special education referral. This would be consistent with multidisciplinary practices using building teams and IEP teams. Principals, as fiscal agents, and school psychologists, as individuals with expertise in data interpretation, are appropriate and important for these decisions. The numbers of persons nominated as involved in making decisions and interpreting graphs is higher for later tiers, especially Tier 3. It would seem that as students move through tiers, more decision makers are seen as involved in interpreting data, making decisions, and participating in more meetings.</p>
<p>The results of the current study should be interpreted in light of its limitations. Only one constituent group, special education teachers, in one state were queried. The generalizability of the results is not assured. All survey results, this set of data included, are self-report data and this limits the generalizability of conclusions. Furthermore, although our response rate was good at 57% overall, the number of persons contributing to each question was lower because we had asked only those who were exposed to RTI to answer selected questions. We did take responses from those in a position to form an opinion based on experience but this does limit the percentage of those in the sample who contributed to the responses.</p>
<p>For future research efforts, we suggest that the perceptions of special education teachers are salient, but these should be contrasted with general education and reading teachers. In addition, the perceptions of principals and school psychologists would be instructive. After the collection of perceptions, it is important to determine if the perceptions are valid; that is, do the perceptions match the actual practices. Large-scale implementation of RTI impacts the roles of many persons in the schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0888406413495420">Fuchs &amp; Deshler, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0888406413495420">Hoover &amp; Patton, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, it is imperative to recognize and determine what time commitments may be necessary for teachers to learn, implement, and refine the process of tiered instruction.</p>
<sec id="section8-0888406413495420">
<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>As the roles are defined and refined, collaboration among educators and training become issues. We, collectively and within local education agency sites, should determine who has responsibility for tasks and who will receive training. The content and form of the training become issues to consider. We need to determine the knowledge base of general education teachers and those who are involved in tiered instruction and ensure that persons designated for tasks are given opportunities for professional development. The type of professional development should be carefully considered for efficacy and efficiency. It should be delivered to those who are involved in the process of using tiered instruction, delivering scientifically based instruction, and assessing student growth. Collaboration among educators to accomplish tasks and make salient decisions is vital to the use of RTI if it is to be used to further educational goals and objectives of individual students.</p>
