<abstract>
<p>This is a paper based on qualitative focus group interviews with 33 boys in early childhood (ages 5 to 7). The basis of the interviews was originally to understand the way in which boys come to perceive issues around masculinities, physical activity, sport and health. However, given the naturalistic manner of qualitative focus group interviews, additional themes were uncovered around boys’ understanding of oral health, in particular the relationship between their teeth and health. At an age where the boys are gaining increasing levels of autonomy in terms of personal hygiene and individual health it appears that dental health is being neglected. The need to address this concern through developing functional health literacy is imperative for boys at this age. Schools are the ideal site in which such an initiative can occur with concomitant knowledge transferred back to the family home.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Research suggests that the way in which masculinity is socially constructed plays an important role in the development of health-oriented behaviours later in a man’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367493511435427">Courtenay, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493511435427">Drummond, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493511435427">Drummond and Drummond, 2010</xref>). Attending to one’s health needs is often perceived as a feminized practice by some groups of males, particularly those in adolescence where masculinity is heavily influenced by potentially self-destructive or harmful attitudes and behaviours around personal health and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493511435427">Mahaliket al., 2007</xref>). In other instances, while not necessarily overtly engaging in harmful behaviours, a general apathy towards personal health can sometimes be regarded as the antithesis of femininity and therefore also regarded as masculinized practice. That is, anything that is not feminine is perceived to be masculine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493511435427">Drummond, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to recognize the significance of developing positive attitudes and behaviours around health in boys to ward off potentially detrimental long-term implications around health. While the symptoms of ill health associated with lifestyle disease do not generally present themselves in childhood and adolescence they are often grounded in the attitudes and behaviours developed early in life and present during adulthood and early ageing. For example, evidence suggests that an overweight or obese adolescent will likely become an overweight or obese adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493511435427">Willerhausen et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, given the high association with lifestyle disease and men’s poor heath status later in life, the need to address these issues early in a boy’s life is paramount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493511435427">Drummond and Drummond, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that poor dental health among males is linked with overweight and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493511435427">Willerhausen et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493511435427">Willerhausen et al (2007</xref>) identify that being overweight or obese has a greater potential to lead to dental caries. Attending to the dental and health hygiene practices of young males could positively affect dental health, and it can be speculated that other health-oriented behaviours, particularly those around nutrition and lifestyle disease could be positively influenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493511435427">Willerhausen et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367493511435427">Kawamura et al. (2008</xref>), in their study on health attitudes amongst young people, identified that girls had significantly higher scores than boys in their desire to improve oral health care (for example with teeth brushing) as well as their concern over the number of cavities. The study indicated that girls’ overall oral health behaviour was better than that of boys and that the tendency to postpone visits to the dentist increased markedly with age. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493511435427">Hallett and O’Rourke’s (2002)</xref> study found that boys within the region of Brisbane, Australia, exhibited significantly higher caries severity compared with girls of similar age. However, the reason behind this was not clear and articulated the need for further research.</p>
<p>This paper discusses findings from a study on boys aged 5 to 7 years and is designed to provide insight on the types of issues boys in early childhood raise with respect to their teeth and dental hygiene. It should be noted that the school at which this research took place had no formal curricula around dental hygiene, therefore the boys had little guided influence around oral health at school. The paper also takes into consideration issues of gender and masculinities as being an important aspect of health among young males.</p>

<title>The research</title>
<p>The data for this paper has been taken from the third year of an eight-year longitudinal qualitative research project on boys from early childhood through to completion of primary school in year seven. Given the project has been running for three years, data in this paper specifically relates to boys in early childhood between the ages of 5 and 7 years. The parents of 44 boys in a middle-class suburban school in Adelaide, South Australia (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367493511435427">Glover et al., 2006</xref>) were contacted to provide consent for their boy to be involved in this longitudinal project based on sport, health and masculinities. Consent was achieved for 33 boys to be involved in the project for the duration of the eight years. Institutional ethics approval was also attained.</p>
<p>Children were interviewed in focus groups of between four to six children per group. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493511435427">Fontana and Frey (2000</xref>) contend that a focus group interview is a technique for gathering rich, descriptive qualitative data in a systematic manner. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493511435427">Patton (2002</xref>) concurs, adding that the objective of the focus group is to use a social context where people consider their own views and those of others in order to gain high quality data. In the current study, the interviewing techniques adopted successfully elicited open discussion around specific aspects of nutrition, physical activity and health across all age groups from early childhood through to middle primary school.</p>
<p>The interviews were audio-recorded with a digital voice recorder and lasted between 20 and 30 minutes. An interview guide was used in each of the focus group sessions to assist the interviewer to adopt a specific line of enquiry (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367493511435427">Table 1</xref>). A phenomenological interviewing approach was also taken whereby the children’s responses were further questioned and clarified to ensure that all aspects were fully explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493511435427">Patton, 2002</xref>). The interview guide was used to bring the interview back to a specific focus to ensure that all children were posed the same core questions, thereby enhancing research reliability, and was constructed through knowledge of contemporary literature in the area. However, being an early childhood cohort the group of boys required a slightly more structured approach with respect to an interview schedule.</p>

<p>The project was designed to develop a sense of understanding of how boys construct their knowledge of health around notions of masculinities. Using familiar topics of discussion was crucial for this early childhood cohort, enabling them to focus on specific elements of health. Requiring the children to limit their memory recall to several points of focus around specific areas of health enhanced the reliability of the data. Similarly, suggestibility was limited given that discussion was focused upon socially endorsed topics upon which children were likely to have opinions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493511435427">Drummond et al., 2009</xref>). This was based on the first author’s 15 years experience in researching the field as well as relevant literature. However, the open nature of the qualitative interviews did not necessarily restrict the boys from discussing a topic. If a topic was raised and deemed relevant to the overall research it was discussed until the boys felt they had adequately addressed the issue, in conjunction with researchers believing that there was no more prompting required in order to attain additional information. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367493511435427">Table 1</xref> shows the interview guide for this study.</p>
<p>The boys were interviewed in a variety of settings within the school environment. It was crucial that all of the participants were comfortable in the setting that was selected. Each of the interview sites was in relatively close proximity to the teacher but not within ‘ear shot’. It was imperative that the participant could feel they could speak without fear of retribution from a teacher in positional power. The majority of interviews were conducted outside sitting around lunch tables. The boys’ data are contextually relevant to their age cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493511435427">Drummond et al., 2009</xref>) and provide a unique looking glass through which we can understand the way in which boys in early childhood years perceive health within the context of their lives.</p>
<p>Drummond et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493511435427">2009</xref>) have claimed, that although there is a wealth of literature on children and health, what is absent from the literature are the voices of the children themselves; the majority of studies in this area are <italic>about </italic>children and <italic>on</italic> children, but rarely <italic>include </italic>children’s voices. In contrast to the dominant adult discourse that reflects on children’s health, this paper will present the voices of children, in particular those of boys in early childhood on issues relating to oral health. Evidence suggests that this is an under-represented area of boys’ health and one that has been identified as being a significant issue for boys in early childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493511435427">Harris et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The interviews were transcribed verbatim and then open coded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367493511435427">Strauss and Corbin, 1998</xref>) and analysed using inductive analysis. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493511435427">Patton (2002</xref>) inductive analysis allows for categories to emerge from open-ended observations as the researcher comes to understand patterns that exist. Patton further states that this type of analysis involves identifying categories, patterns and themes in data by means of interaction with the data. Similarities and differences in the data were documented based on the authors’ personal understanding, professional knowledge, and the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367493511435427">Strauss and Corbin, 1998</xref>). The coding was conducted by the authors independent of one another and compared and contrasted. It was this independent coding that provided trustworthiness in the data while allowing the authors to feel confident and comfortable in both the process and outcome of the data analysis.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>As previously identified, the interviews were developed to investigate masculinities within the context of health, sport and physical activity among boys. Given the context in which health is socially constructed within contemporary Western culture issues such as nutrition, dietary behaviours and food were all discussed within the broader framework of health. Oral health was an aspect of heath that was raised alongside such dietary behaviours as sugar intake and poor nutrition habits, where a number of the boys appeared proud of their penchant for sweet foods and their disregard for oral health. Given the boys’ awareness of sugar laden foods labelled as being ‘fun foods’, ‘sometimes foods’, or ‘party foods’, it is possible to suggest that this disregard for oral health and a snubbing of health messages at this early age provides a looking glass through which older boys’ and men’s health conventions may be viewed. The following extract is from one of the interviews with the boys:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Boy (B):</speaker>
<p>    I have 5 sweet teeth, one, two, three, four and five.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer (I):</speaker>
<p>5 sweet teeth, what do you mean sweet teeth?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(B):      </speaker><p>Like lolly tooth.</p>
<p>      I like sweet stuff, like junk stuff.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(I):</speaker>
<p>     Yeah, why is there something on your teeth?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(B):</speaker>
<p>      No I just like junk stuff.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(I):</speaker>
<p>     Oh do you? Have any of you gotten fillings or anything like that?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(B):      </speaker><p>I’ve got fillings, I have 2.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(I):</speaker>
<p>     Really, why is that?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(B):</speaker>
<p>      Because I don’t know, I don’t brush my teeth well.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(I):     </speaker><p>You’ve got to brush your teeth.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(B):</speaker>
<p>      I don’t brush my teeth ever.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(I):</speaker>
<p>     Really?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(B):</speaker>
<p>      I like keeping junk stuff in my teeth.</p>
</speech>
<p>A similar type of discussion emerged from another group of boys when they claimed:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>(B1):</speaker>
<p>     I don’t clean my teeth and I don’t care about the stuff in them</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(I):</speaker>
<p>     Don’t you clean them before you come to school?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(B1):     </speaker><p>No, I don’t care about the stuff in them.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(I):</speaker>
<p>     Don’t you?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(B2):     </speaker><p>Sometimes, but I don’t clean them properly, that’s why I have fillings.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(I):</speaker>
<p>     Don’t you? Well who cleans them? Does your mum and dad help you clean your teeth?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(B3):</speaker>
<p>     I never clean my teeth.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(I):</speaker>
<p>     Do you forget to clean your teeth?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(B3):</speaker>
<p>     Kind of, I don’t brush them at all.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(I):</speaker>
<p>     Do you brush them before you got to bed?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(B):</speaker>
<p>      No</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(I):</speaker>
<p>     Why not?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(B3):</speaker>
<p>     No one tells me to.</p>
</speech>
<p>This final comment by B3 in relation to cleaning his teeth and stating that, ‘no one tells me to’ is a fundamental issue that requires immediate attention and is situated at the heart of parental health literacy. While this is a group of middle-class boys with parents who are likely to be somewhat health literate given the socio-demographic in which they live, it is apparent that these boys require a degree of coercion or at the very least a reminder to brush their teeth on a regular basis. The boys do not appear to have developed the necessary skills to undertake regular teeth brushing of their own accord. Nor, in most cases, do they seem to care. Therefore the role of parents in maintaining a degree of influence over the boys’ dental health is crucial in the development of behaviours such as cleaning teeth and oral health. Further, given that there was no formal school class time devoted to the issue of dental hygiene this may also raise the question as to introducing some form of dental hygiene education within the school curriculum to support parent instruction at home.</p>
<p>The following discussion from another set of boys vindicates such a claim.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>(I):</speaker>
<p>  Tell me, do you clean your teeth much?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(B1):</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(B2):</speaker>
<p>No.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(B3):</speaker>
<p>No.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(B2):</speaker>
<p>I fake it.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(I):</speaker>
<p>  You fake?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(B2):</speaker>
<p>I go down there and I get my toothbrush, I put it in my mouth without any toothpaste on, I just pretend.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(I):  </speaker><p>Really. Why is that?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(B2) </speaker><p>Because I want to.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>(B3):</speaker>
<p>Sometimes I forget to do it.</p>
</speech>
<p>Having the capacity to clean one’s own teeth is perceived as somewhat of a milestone of independence and can be seen as reducing the adult control over a child’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367493511435427">Mayall, 1993</xref>). Additionally, it is arguable that dental hygiene at home is one of the first independent acts of health management to occur within a child’s life. Therefore faking one’s own teething-cleaning regime by these boys may be seen as a form of autonomous defiance and may be the foundations of hegemonic masculine behaviours associated with adolescent and adult male health. There is a wealth of literature surrounding socially constructed masculinized attitudes and behaviours towards health, which have negative implications for males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367493511435427">Courtenay, 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493511435427">2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493511435427">Drummond, 2002</xref>). Given that dental hygiene is one of the initial independent health-oriented acts the need to understand why some boys choose to fake cleaning their teeth as opposed to those boys who adopt a regular dental hygiene regime is of significance. The links between the social construction of masculinity and health behaviours can play a part in this understanding, particularly as the boys move through the developmental periods of childhood and adolescence.</p>
<p>While we have highlighted some of the negative issues and barriers around dental hygiene that emerged from the boys’ interview data, there were also some encouraging aspects that need to be recognized. By providing facilitators as well as barriers, health promoters will gain a deeper understanding of the potential programmes that can be implemented for successful health outcomes around dental hygiene among boys in early childhood.</p>

<p>In this previous line of enquiry it is clear that some boys do have the potential to heed the messages about dental hygiene and act upon them. However, there is a possibility that too much responsibility is handed over to the boys in early childhood to maintain their teeth brushing and dental hygiene regime. The final comment by one of the boys is arguably testament to such a claim. It is recommended that parents should assist in cleaning their children’s teeth until the age of six (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493511435427">Oulis et al., 2000</xref>). For these boys only one of the 33 boys gained assistance from their parents in terms of brushing once or twice a week. It was claimed by this boy that:<disp-quote>
<p>My dad comes in about a twice a week to make sure that I am cleaning my teeth OK. I’ve got one of those electric toothbrushes and he makes sure that getting the tops and bottoms and the backs and the fronts. It buzzes off after two minutes. It always needs recharging. But that’s OK. We have a charger.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>There are a number of assumptions one can make in regard to the reasons underpinning the desire of independence around the boys’ teeth cleaning practices. One could assume that the boys themselves are seeking independence around an act, which is conceivably attainable at their age. Alternatively, it could be a parental desire to hand over a personal responsibility to their child, which they perceive can be carried out sufficiently despite the boys’ young age. Regardless of the underlying reasons, given the age group involved in this study being between 5 and 7 it is arguable that more supervision is required where boys and teeth cleaning in general are concerned. Additional reinforcement of dental health practices both at home and school could provide positive long-term health benefits beyond the realm of oral health.</p>

<title>Implications for health</title>
<p>While the research that underpinned the paper was not designed to specifically target dental hygiene it emerged as an important point of discussion within the context of broader health issues and masculinities. As stated, the boys expressed a degree of autonomy around their teeth cleaning and dental hygiene regimes. While this can be viewed in a positive light in terms of the boys taking control of their dental health, it needs to be reflected upon in the context of their early childhood lives and also the wider milieu of masculinities and how these are socially constructed.</p>
<p>Young males’ health gradually deteriorates in the absence of parental involvement, generally around the beginning the adolescence. Risk-taking behaviour and a general disregard for personal health, and sometimes safety, is argued to be a by-product of hegemonic masculine behaviours displayed among young males. It is the disregard for personal health, which has been socially constructed as a masculinized act, that is constantly culturally endorsed and perpetuated within contemporary Western culture. Conversely, attention to health is often perceived as somewhat feminized and therefore often rejected by young males. Cleaning one’s teeth and fundamental dental hygiene can be rejected further given the perceived aesthetic nature of teeth as a cosmetic rather than functional part of the body.</p>
<p>Attending to the health education needs of boys in early childhood is imperative in developing attitudes and behaviours that can be adopted for adolescence and beyond. However, boys need to recognize that attending to health needs is not feminizing and will be important for later life. The problem is that most boys, and many young people in general, ‘live for now’ and do not adequately comprehend the implications of long-term health-oriented behaviours. Therefore, where dental hygiene and teeth cleaning is concerned, boys need to recognize the practical implications of not brushing and flossing. Given that teeth are often regarded cosmetically, in so far as being seen and discussed in terms of their aesthetics, there is potential to take an alternative perspective and discuss this aspect of the body in very practical terms. Health promoters need to be cognizant of gender when discussing the potential benefits of dental hygiene and teeth cleaning and ask, ‘what will work best for this group of boys with whom we are working’? Gender, together with age race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status and health literacy also need to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Promoting dental health among boys early in their lives has the capacity to create positive health implications beyond dental hygiene. Given that cleaning teeth is one of the first acts of health-oriented independence, utilizing the process of dental health as a mechanism to teach boys about health promoting behaviours in general is possible. By promoting vigilance around cleaning teeth regularly, and appropriately, including other aspects such as flossing and regular dental checks, the significance of self-monitoring health promotion is emphasized. This is something, which is lacking among many males from adolescence. The dental hygiene regime then becomes a template for understanding how self-monitoring health promotion can work. This can be taught at home, in schools and recognized culturally as a method of developing young males’ positive health practices. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493511435427">Willerhausen et al. (2004</xref>: 404) articulated, ‘the significant success in the reduction of caries prevalence with preventive programs in schools could represent an exemplary concept for corresponding health efforts in the area of nutritional guidance and an increase in physical activities’. It is these areas of men’s health that require attention most during adulthood. In finding another means through which they can be facilitated and positively promoted early in a boy’s life, such as through dental hygiene or other traditional health and well-being practices, we offer greater potential for change.</p>
<p>We understand the significance of early dental hygiene practices in both boys and girls. However, it is the opportunity that the independence of cleaning teeth early in a boy’s life that offers immense scope for future health promotion initiatives later in life. Listening to the voices of boys in early childhood about such practices has the capacity to provide important understanding in how we go about improving not only the dental health of boys but also other aspects of young males’ health.</p>
