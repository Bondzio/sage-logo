<p>Most people like to know where they come from. This includes their family origin, as well as the origin of the human species as a whole. In <italic>The Evolution of Childhood</italic>, Melvin Konner writes about human origin through over 750 pages of compiled research on theories, physiology, socialization, and culture regarding the evolution of humans and other animal species. Konner compares the development of humans in the industrialized world to several hunter-gatherer groups of humans across Africa and South East Asia using evolutionary anthropology as his primary approach. Furthermore, Konner compares research on the development of humans to the development of other animal species, including apes, rodents, and precocial birds.</p>
<p>This book covers a wide breadth and depth on these topics. In the first two sections, Konner covers the major paradigms and theories of evolution and physiology. While old ground to experienced researchers in the area, this may prove to be more challenging for newcomers to the field. In this regard, Konner’s introduction of all of the foundational theories is likely to be profoundly appreciated. It allows new readers to grasp some of the basics of human evolution, as well as understand the rest of the book that builds on these basics.</p>
<p>One aspect of the book that we recognized as both a strength and a recurring theme was how Konner covers all aspects of human development, including the physiological, psychological, social, and cultural influences from gestation up until middle childhood and adolescence. Specifically, Konner stresses the significance of the interaction that has been occurring for billions of years between genetics, the nervous system, society, and culture – what he describes as epigenetics – in order to shape childhood. Konner explains that this is a continuous process that only makes sense in light of evolution. As members of a multidisciplinary department that specifically embraces multiple approaches to studying children and youth, we view this book as both an advertisement for, and a testimonial to, the value of multidisciplinary research.</p>
<p>A second recurring theme in <italic>The Evolution of Childhood</italic> was the uniqueness of childhood in humans in comparison to other species. Konner covers both industrialized and hunter-gatherer groups, which vary greatly in their social and cultural practices. However, Konner emphasizes that despite such differences, all humans have several key ways in which the development of childhood is similar, while different in comparison to other animals. Specifically, Konner emphasizes the complexity of human brain development, including the density and length of time required for neuron development. In addition, Konner stresses the significance of human culture and socialization in childhood. For instance, in comparison to other species including apes, human children must learn to navigate far more complex networks of social relationships. Language (a tool unique to human culture) is required for these interactions and relationships. Konner also discusses the contributions of socialization on other unique human qualities such as morality and faith. Thus, Konner argues that despite the diversity within and between distinct subcultures of human groups across the world, an underlying universal culture of the human species exists. Only through an evolutionary lens can the development of changes and adaptations of such human qualities throughout history be understood.</p>
<p>The majority of previous research on socialization emphasizes the role of mother–infant or mother–child relationships (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0907568213481377">Hrdy, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0907568213481377">2009</xref>). Konner includes a discussion of mothers, but also the significance of fathers, extended family, and genetically unrelated family (e.g., step and adoptive parents). Konner explains that child interactions with these family members have the potential to be also, if not equally, as important as interactions with mothers. This emphasizes an important view of research on childhood socialization and enculturation that is often lacking in many contemporary and previous accounts of child development.</p>
<p>Despite all of these strengths, there are some limitations to the book. While we may quibble about some of the data (e.g., child mortality rates; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0907568213481377">Volk and Atkinson, 2013</xref>), the information contained was generally accurate and up-to-date with the caveat that we are certainly not experts in all the topics discussed in this book. In addition, as researchers with backgrounds primarily in psychology, it was quite evident that Konner gives a greater weight to anthropology in comparison to other disciplines. The evolutionary picture of child development may thus be even richer than he describes in his book (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0907568213481377">Ellis et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, <italic>The Evolution of Childhood</italic> is clearly Konner’s magnum opus, and it makes an excellent book for senior students or for academics who are interested in an anthropological perspective on the evolution of childhood. It is the summary of a mountain of research on how humans compare to one another and other animals from an interactionist framework. As multidisciplinary scholars, we enjoyed the opportunity to encounter literature that we would likely not find among psychological sources. We feel it is possible for anyone (even those without an evolutionary background) interested in research on human or child development to understand Konner’s view of childhood through a cross-cultural, biological, historical, and (primarily) evolutionary lens. Given the tremendous scope afforded by those lenses, we therefore recommend this book to anyone who has a serious interest in better understanding childhood.</p>
