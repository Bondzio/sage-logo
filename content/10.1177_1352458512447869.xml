<title>Background:</title>
<p>Associations of several autoimmune disorders with intrauterine and early life exposures have been reported.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1352458512447869">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>We used population-based linked hospital discharge-birth records data to explore maternal, prenatal, and infant characteristics in relation to MS-related hospitalization among Washington State residents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1352458512447869">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>272 cases hospitalized for MS during 1988–2008 and 2720 birth record controls were identified from linked hospital discharge-birth certificate data. Exposure information from their birth records were compared in a population-based case-control study to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) for associations with MS hospitalization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1352458512447869">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Most factors examined were not associated with MS. Having a mother with 3+ prior live births (OR 0.54, 95%CI 0.31–0.95) or having 3+ older siblings (OR 0.49, 95%CI 0.28–0.85) were negatively associated. Maternal prenatal smoking (OR 3.09, 95%CI 1.22–7.84) was positively associated.</p>

<sec id="section5-1352458512447869">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Transplacental exposure to smoke constituents including chemicals affecting myelin may help explain any association with maternal prenatal smoking; however, we were unable to assess childhood or adult smoke exposures which may also account at least partly for this effect. The negative associations observed with greater maternal parity and number of siblings are consistent with some other studies. Reasons for these associations may involve various pathways.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) occurrence is likely associated with multiple genetic, infectious, and environmental factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512447869">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512447869">2</xref></sup> As there is evidence from epidemiologic and animal studies that some autoimmune diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512447869">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512447869">4</xref></sup> and other conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512447869">5</xref></sup> may be associated with <italic>in utero</italic> and early life exposures, these developmental factors are also being explored for MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512447869">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512447869"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512447869"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512447869"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512447869"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512447869">11</xref></sup> However, measurement of maternal pregnancy conditions and early life factors in interview studies is difficult; the subjects (or their mothers) may not know such details and locating and reviewing historical medical records is not often feasible. Although population-based health registries have facilitated MS research in some countries,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512447869">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512447869"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512447869"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512447869"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512447869"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512447869"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512447869">12</xref></sup> epidemiologic studies of MS in many regions are hampered by the lack of population-based registries resulting in reliance on clinic- or practice-based studies or volunteer registries which may result in biased samples. We used population-based linked hospital discharge-birth records data to explore maternal, prenatal, and infant characteristics in relation to MS-related hospitalization among Washington State residents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1352458512447869" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>After Institutional Review Board approval was granted, discharge records for all hospitalizations in non-federal hospitals in Washington State during 1988–2008 were screened to identify potential cases for this case-control study, including all males and females with an International Classification of Diseases (ICD), Ninth Revision diagnosis code for MS (340). These records were linked to Washington birth certificates to identify those born in Washington State in 1968 or later (<italic>N</italic>=272). For comparison, 2720 controls were randomly selected from amongthe remaining birth records, frequency-matched by year of birth. Exposure data available from the birth record included parental characteristics, maternal health, pregnancy course, labor and delivery details, and infant outcomes, as obtained near the time of delivery from labor and delivery, prenatal care, and medical records. Disease information available for cases from the hospital discharge record included their age and calendar year of hospitalization, total number of MS-related hospitalizations during 1988–2008, and the position (first, second, or later) of the MS diagnosis code in the discharge record.</p>
<p>Stratified analysis was initially conducted to examine associations of MS in relation to maternal and infant characteristics that may reflect aspects of the intrauterine environment or neonatal exposures. Subsequently, we used multivariable logistic regression to calculate odds ratio (OR) estimates of relative risks, and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs). Parental factors examined included maternal and paternal age (&lt;20, 20–24, 25–29, 30+ years). Maternal factors also included race, marital status, number of prior births and pregnancies (0, 1, 2, 3+), prior fetal deaths (0, 1+), number of live born now living (0, 1, 2, 3+, as a surrogate for possible early infection exposure from older siblings), delivery method, trimester prenatal care began (first, second, third or no care), and prenatal smoker status (yes/no). Infant characteristics included birth month and weight (&lt;2500, 2500–3999, 4000+ grams), gestational age at delivery (&lt;37, 37–41, &gt;41 weeks), plurality (singleton, twin or higher order), and five minute Apgar score (&lt;7, 7+). Categorizations of (non-dichotomous) variables were based on those used most often in reproductive epidemiologic studies, and which generally provided at least 10 subjects in each group. Not all variables were available for all years of birth records; records with missing data were excluded from relevant analyses.</p>
<p>After adjustment for the matching variable birth year, factors selected a priori based on prior relevant studies for evaluation of their potential effects on the relationships with MS hospitalization included gender; maternal and paternal age; and maternal race, marital status, prenatal smoking, and number of prior live births and pregnancies. Only variables that changed ORs by about 10% or more after inclusion of variables producing larger changes already in the model were adjusted for in the analyses; unless otherwise indicated risk estimates are adjusted for birth year alone. Potential effect modifiers were evaluated by inspection of stratum-specific risk estimates for important differences and the Breslow–Day test for homogeneity. Subanalyses were conducted to determine whether results varied by birth year categories, gender, or age at hospitalization; these were hampered by small numbers; however, no marked differences were observed.</p>

<title>Characteristics of MS cases</title>
<p>The mean age at index hospitalization of cases was 25.9 years (standard error 0.4), and the ICD code for MS was placed first (32%) or second (38%) among diagnosis codes for 70% of cases; 100 (37%) cases had &gt;1 MS-related hospital admission identified (data not shown).</p>

<sec id="section10-1352458512447869">
<title>Parental and subject characteristics in relation to MS hospitalization</title>
<p>A greater proportion of MS cases (64%), than controls (47%) were female (OR 2.02, 95%CI 1.56–2.62), and gestational age at delivery of 42 weeks or greater was associated with a suggested modestly decreased OR of MS (OR 0.72, 95%CI 0.49–1.05) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458512447869">Table 1</xref>). Of the parental characteristics considered, modest differences were noted for young maternal age &lt;20 years (OR 0.69, 95%CI 0.39–1.20, adjusted for birth year, parity, paternal age), older paternal age 30+ years (OR=0.73, 95%CI 0.44–1.22, adjusted for birth year, maternal age, parity), and single marital status (OR=1.39, 95%CI 0.97–2.00). Maternal prenatal smoking was associated with an OR of 3.09 (95%CI 1.22–7.84, adjusted for birth year, maternal age, and parity).</p>

<title>Analyses restricted to cases with primary MS diagnosis or multiple hospitalizations, and their controls</title>
<p>Restriction of analyses to the 87 cases with a primary diagnosis code for MS or to the 100 cases with MS-related hospital readmissions did not alter the direction of most ORs, although some results calculated with the smaller number of subjects no longer reached statistical significance (data not shown). The negative association of MS with gestational length of 42+ weeks became more marked when cases included only those with an MS primary diagnosis code (OR 0.53, 95%CI 0.26–1.08), or only those with multiple MS-related admissions (OR 0.49, 95%CI 0.24–0.98). The OR associated with a fall birth month decreased to 0.60 (95%CI 0.30–1.09) for hospitalization with an MS primary diagnosis, and to 0.75 (95%CI 0.49–1.15) for those with multiple MS admissions. The decreased ORs in relation to having a father 30+ years old were also more notable (OR 0.41, 95%CI 0.16–1.04 for primary MS diagnosis; OR 0.40, 95%CI 0.17–0.94 for those with multiple MS admissions). The OR for having a mother with any prior fetal deaths was also more marked when cases were restricted to those with multiple MS admissions (OR 3.06, 95%CI 1.04–9.00). Increased ORs for prenatal smoking were still observed when analyses were restricted to cases with a primary MS diagnosis code (OR 2.42, 95%CI 0.79–7.40), or to those with multiple MS admissions (OR 2.37, 95%CI 0.87–6.42), although these estimates were based on small numbers and both confidence intervals included one.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We utilized population-based hospital discharge data to identify subjects in combination with birth records to assess maternal and infant characteristics obtained at the time of delivery and, thus, our results are not affected by recall or other biases that may occur in interview studies. Our results demonstrate the expected gender distribution and are not inconsistent with previous studies suggesting a decreased occurrence among individuals born in fall,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512447869">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512447869">11</xref></sup> although our ability to examine this was hampered by small numbers.</p>
<p>Smoking has been reported as a risk factor for MS occurrence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512447869">13</xref></sup> and progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458512447869">14</xref></sup> (summarized in D’hooghe et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458512447869">15</xref></sup>) in several previous studies, and a meta-analysis reported a summary OR of 1.34 (95%CI 1.17–1.54) for pooled analyses of six studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512447869">13</xref></sup> A two-fold increased relative risk of MS onset at &lt;16 years of age has also been associated with self-reported smoking by either parent within the home,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458512447869">16</xref></sup> and a significantly increased odds of MS (OR 1.3) was noted in relation to self-reported passive smoke exposure among never-smokers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458512447869">17</xref></sup> Although our results are generally consistent with these results, our findings are in contrast to those of the only other study we were able to identify in which prenatal smoking was evaluated. No association was observed in a Swedish health registry study comparing prenatal smoking status from birth records of 143 MS cases (mean diagnosis age 17 years) and their controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458512447869">18</xref></sup> Although the Swedish study was smaller than ours and subjects were younger on average (both factors which might at least partly explain the different results), disease ascertainment through the National Swedish MS Register was more complete as it included outpatient as well as inpatient registers within that nation’s health care system.</p>
<p>If the increased risk we observed for MS in relation to maternal prenatal smoking is real, it may result from trans-placental exposure to smoking-related toxins. Many smoke-related constituents cross the placenta, including cyanide,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458512447869">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458512447869">20</xref></sup> which may cause degenerative neurological disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458512447869">19</xref></sup> and demyelination specifically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458512447869">21</xref></sup> However, the observed association with prenatal smoking might also be related to second-hand exposure to maternal smoking during infancy or childhood, as women who smoke prenatally may continue after delivery. We also had no information about subjects’ own smoking habits; if offspring of smoking parents,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458512447869">22</xref></sup> or of women who smoke prenatally are more likely to also smoke as adults,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458512447869">23</xref></sup> it is possible that our results may be at least partly due to the subjects’ smoking behavior as an adult or adolescent. Our results might also be inflated if maternal prenatal smoking increases the likelihood of hospitalization as an adult, given our use of hospital discharge data to identify cases.</p>
<p>Our data suggest a decreased risk of MS if the maternal reproductive history was of three or more prior births, or at least three older siblings as measured by the “number live born, now living”, but not in relation to number of prior pregnancies. A decreased risk in relation to having three or more older siblings was also observed in a Swedish registry study (OR=0.83, 95%CI 0.72–0.96),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512447869">6</xref></sup> which employed a similar data linkage strategy to our own project. (That study also reported an increased risk associated with older paternal age which we did not observe.) Decreased associations of MS in relation to increasing birth order have been described in some,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512447869">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458512447869">24</xref></sup> but not all<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512447869">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512447869">9</xref></sup> recent studies, and were not observed for a large (&gt;10,995 individuals with MS) Canadian cohort.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512447869">10</xref></sup> Possible explanations for a reduction in MS occurrence among higher-order offspring include the “hygiene hypothesis”, which posits that increased exposure to infection at very young age (as from one’s older siblings) may alter the immune response, leading to decreased risk of autoimmune and/or allergic conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458512447869">25</xref></sup> Our observation is consistent with this hypothesis, but the lack of a dose-response relationship and of expected associations with other variables often examined as possible markers of infection exposure (prenatal smoking, Cesarean delivery) weaken support for this, as does our lack of data on complete sibship size. It is also possible that individuals with more siblings may be less likely to be hospitalized (method of case identification in our study) due to a greater level of family support, or that this may be a chance finding. Studies examining pre-diagnosis antibiotic use as a measure of infection exposure have reported both increased<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458512447869">26</xref></sup> and decreased<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458512447869">27</xref></sup> associations with MS, but little is known about the timing of infections in potentially vulnerable windows including gestation, infancy, or early childhood.</p>
<p>One could speculate that our observed decreased ORs for MS in relation to greater maternal parity and number of older siblings result from protection against gene characteristics that increase MS risk due to microchimerism in the form of acquisition of cells or DNA from an older sibling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1352458512447869">28</xref></sup> who lacks these characteristics or even carries genes associated with MS protection; however, the relationship we observed may also be a chance finding.</p>
<p>Our study has some limitations, including the use of hospital discharge codes to identify MS cases. Many affected individuals are not hospitalized. Misclassification of cases among the control group is possible but unlikely given the rarity of MS. However, if it did occur, this would bias our results towards the null. It is possible that our MS cases include those with relatively severe disease, making our results potentially less applicable to those with milder symptoms. It is unclear how well our hospital discharge records identified cases. The ICD code for MS may include clinically established disease, probable MS, or individuals for whom the condition is being ruled out. Among patients with health care encounters identified by ICD code in the United States Veteran’s Health Administration system in 1998–2002, 60% of individuals were classified as “MS/possible MS” after review of their computerized patient records;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1352458512447869">29</xref></sup> however, this included both inpatient and outpatient visits, the latter of which might have low sensitivity for identifying MS, given that diagnostic evaluations of potential MS cases largely occur in the outpatient environment. We were unable to review medical records to validate diagnoses; however, restriction of analyses to cases with a primary MS diagnosis code or to those with MS-related readmissions (both of which might provide more sensitive identification of MS cases) did not change the direction of results, although we were hampered by smaller numbers in these analyses. To the extent that our MS cases include individuals with other conditions, or that MS cases are present among the control group, our results would likely be biased towards the null.</p>
<p>Potential out-migration of controls is also a limitation, as is our reliance on case identification only during years with available hospital discharge data. However, inclusion of affected individuals among the controls for either reason (if some controls were hospitalized for MS in other states or during years prior to 1987) would bias results towards the null. We also lacked information about family history of MS, or any measures of potential confounding factors such as socioeconomic status.</p>
<p>Although our exposures were assessed prior to diagnosis, the quality of some items on birth certificates may be limited. Birth weight, maternal parity, and demographic information has been assessed as reliable in comparison with medical records<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1352458512447869">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458512447869">31</xref></sup> and Medicaid program data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458512447869">32</xref></sup> Cigarette smoking information on birth records is generally underreported;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1352458512447869">33</xref></sup> however, it is unlikely that any reported smokers are true non-smokers and, thus, any biases are likely towards the null. Given the consistency of smoking exposure as a risk factor for MS in most prior studies, and increasing evidence for the intrauterine origin of many diseases, further examination of a possible role for prenatal smoking in MS is warranted, particularly within studies containing further information on environmental tobacco smoke exposure during childhood as well as subjects’ own smoking history. Associations with birth order, number of siblings, and markers of infection during vulnerable periods such as gestation and infancy also should be explored further.</p>
