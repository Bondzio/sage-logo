<p>Fabrics made from natural fibers, such as wool and cotton, are susceptible to attacks from micro-organisms, which may damage the fabrics and harm the human body. Antimicrobial finishing of natural textile products may involve harmful and non-environmentally friendly chemicals. In this study, a natural antibacterial agent, capsaicin, was coated on the surface of wool fabrics by a sol-gel process. The antibacterial properties of coated fabrics were evaluated against test bacteria Escherichia coli according to the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC) method and standard American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) E2149-01. Compared with the control group (sol-gel coated fabric without capsaicin), the capsaicin-coated fabric inhibited bacterial growth markedly after 24 hours incubation at 37°C.

<body>
<p>Fabrics made from natural fibers, such as wool and cotton, are susceptible to attacks from micro-organisms, because some microbes can thrive under conditions provided by these fabrics. Infestation by microbes can cause cross infections by pathogens and development of odor where the fabric is worn next to the skin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517511426608">1</xref></sup> especially for fabrics used in hospitals and hotels, which may damage the fabrics and harm the human body.</p>
<p>With increasing awareness of the importance of a hygienic health lifestyle, antimicrobial finishing of natural textile products has received much attention in recent years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517511426608">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517511426608">10</xref></sup> Several textile finishing techniques for antibacterial purposes have been developed. Forexample, a precursor biocidal agent, dimethylol dimethylhydantoin (DMDMH), was applied to cotton and cotton/polyester fabrics, followed by a chlorine bleaching treatment to impart the fabrics with a durable antimicrobial functionality. Polymeric biguanide was also used as an antimicrobial agent to improve the deodorization function and antimicrobial abilities of cotton fabrics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517511426608">7</xref></sup> Cotton fabrics treated with chito-oligosaccharide (COS) and N-(2-hydroxyl) propyl-3-trimethyl ammonium chito-oligosaccharide chloride (HTACC) also showed an effective antimicrobial function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0040517511426608">6</xref></sup> Besides organic chemicals, inorganic materials, such as nano-sized ZnO, were also used, and the finished fabrics showed good antibacterial performance as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0040517511426608">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, many of the treatments involved harmful and non-environmentally friendly chemicals. For example, the inorganic nanoparticles may gain entry into human systems through inhalation, ingestion or dermal routes, and exert deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517511426608">11</xref></sup> The antibacterial works have been focused on cotton or cotton/synthetic blends. Since more and more next-to-skin knitwear has been made from fine/superfine wool, the antibacterial properties of wool fabrics have also become important.</p>
<p>Capsaicin (N-vanillyl-8-methyl-6-(E)-noneamide), a colorless crystalline compound derived from the genus capsicum, is the active component of chili peppers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0040517511426608">12</xref></sup> The chemical structure of capsaicin is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517511426608">Figure 1</xref>. Capsaicin has been found to deplete substance P – a neurochemical that transmits pain, consequently desensitizes the sensory nerve endings giving a paradoxical antinociceptive effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0040517511426608">13</xref></sup> Thus it is normally used in cream as a paradoxical counterirritant and topical analgesic ingredient to relieve the pain of peripheral neuropathy, herpes and arthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0040517511426608">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517511426608">16</xref></sup> Recently, capsaicin has also been found to possess antibacterial properties.
<fig id="fig1-0040517511426608" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Chemical structure of capsaicin.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0040517511426608-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Capsaicin has been used as an anti-fouling agent for marine boats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0040517511426608">17</xref></sup> The feasibility of using capsaicin as a green biological pesticide in agriculture and green additive in cable and construction materials to prevent damage by animals has been claimed;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0040517511426608">18</xref></sup> however, no evidence is available to prove these claims. No reports on the application of capsaicin in textiles can be found in the scientific literature.</p>
<p>The sol-gel process is to convert chemical compounds to a gel state solid material by crosslinking reactions (hydrolysis, condensation and polymerization) in a suitable solvent medium, and then the solvent is removed to leave a porous structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0040517511426608">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0040517511426608">20</xref></sup> It has been established that hybrid silica from a sol-gel process contains a huge number of ‘nano-sized’ pores. These tiny pores provide ideal hosts for functional compounds. In our previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0040517511426608">21</xref></sup> we demonstrated that silica embedded with photochromic dye can be coated onto wool fabrics to impart the substrates with a very fast photochromic transformation when irradiated under the sun.</p>
<p>In this study, we used silica as a matrix to encapsulate capsaicin to produce an antibacterial coating on wool fabrics by means of a sol-gel technique. We then examined the antibacterial performance of the coated fabrics and how this performance was affected by laundry washes of the fabrics.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0040517511426608"><title>Experimental details</title>
<p>The wool fabric, obtained from AIM Sports Pty. Ltd, Australia, was an undyed, double jersey knitted interlock, with 245 g/m<sup>2</sup> fabric weight and a construction of 12 stitches per cm in the wale direction and 10 stitches per cm in the course direction. The fabric was made from fibers that had been shrink-proof treated by a chlorine-Hercosett® process at the top stage. This type of wool fabric was selected because wool is normally shrink-proof treated for use in next-to-skin knitwear.</p>
<p>The silica sol gel was synthesized by an established method reported elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0040517511426608">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0040517511426608">23</xref></sup> Briefly, octyltriethoxysilane (OTES; Degussa) and 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS; Aldrich) were mixed together, and then tetraacetoxysilane (TAS, as a catalyst) was added to the silane mixture and stirred vigorously for 30 min. Ethanol, facilitating the condensation reaction of silanes, was then mixed with the silane solution. Water was added drop-wise at 1 ml/min to allow the hydrolysis reaction, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for a further 24 hours to make a transparent and homogeneous sol-gel solution. The structures of the silanes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517511426608">Figure 2</xref>. The moles of the reactants used in preparation of silica sol gel are 16, 16, 1, 160 and 100 for OTES, GPTMS, TAS, ethanol and water, respectively. Capsaicin (TIPC, CAS, 99% purity) of different concentrations was finally dissolved in the sol-gel solution. Concentrations of 0.01 and 0.04 mol/l for fabric 1 and fabric 2 were used, respectively, which are equivalent to 1.1% and 3.7% owf concentrations of capsaicin.
<fig id="fig2-0040517511426608" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Chemical structures of selected silane precursors.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0040517511426608-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>To apply the solution, an ethanol-washed wool fabric (size of 20 × 20 cm<sup>2</sup>) was immersed in 30 ml capsaicin contained sol-gel solution for 15 min, and then padded with one dip-and-nip (100% wet pick up) using a Werner Mathis Laboratory Pad Mangle to get a uniform coating on the fabric. The coated fabric sample was air dried for 48 hours. Simultaneously, the sol-gel coated fabric without capsaicin was prepared as control-I. The uncoated original fabric was set as control-II. The dry pick up of sol-gel coatings on fabric is calculated as the percentage of dry fabric mass difference before and after coating.</p>
<p>The coated fabric (with 0.04 mol/l capsaicin) was washed using Hydropal TN450 (1%) once at 45°C and rinsed with cold water, namely 1-wash fabric. The 1-wash samples were dried in air and went through another two wash cycles to prepare the 3-wash samples. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of coated and uncoated original fabrics were measured by a Burker Vertex 70 FTIR Spectroscope in the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode. Four corners and the middle section of full-sized fabric samples were scanned and the average ATR intensities of spectra were used to evaluate the chemical bands of the surface coatings and also to check the uniformity of the coatings.</p>
<p>The antibacterial activities of the capsaicin-coated fabrics were tested against the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (ATCC 11229, USA) using the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC) Parallel Streak Method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0040517511426608">24</xref></sup> (Static test). The Tryptone Soya agar solution (CM0131, Oxoid, pH = 7.2) was sterilized at 120°C in the autoclave for 20 minutes and then poured onto disposable sterilized Petri dishes (90 mm diameter) for solidification. The Escherichia coli stock solution was streaked on one Petri dish, cultured for 24 hours at 37°C, and then a fully grown single colony was selected and cultured for 24 hours in sterilized Tryptone Soya Broth (CM0989, Oxoid); several tubes of culture solution were prepared in this way for the following tests. Then the culture solution was diluted with soya broth at a ratio of 1:9 to a concentration of 6 × 10<sup>7</sup> cfu/ml as the initial test solution. The optical density (OD) of the diluted suspension was used to estimate the bacteria concentration, as the OD value is proportional to the number of bacteria cells in one milliliter solution, viz 1 OD ≈ 8 × 10<sup>8 </sup>bacteria cells/ml. The OD value of 1 ml dilution was measured by a Cary 300 ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer at 550 nm wavelength. One loopful of the diluted inoculums was streaked onto a Petri dish in five parallel lines using a 4 mm inoculating loop, and the fabric samples (large fabrics were cut into small sample pieces of 2.5 × 5 cm<sup>2</sup>) were gently pressed transversely across the five inoculum streaks. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours and the zones of inhibition and interruption of growth along the streaks were examined for incubated Petri dishes.</p>
<p>Glutaraldehyde (GA)/osmium tetroxide (OsO<sub>4</sub>) was used for fixation and stabilization of bacteria for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation. A piece of sample (size 2 × 3 cm<sup>2</sup>) was cut from the tested fabric, and rinsed with 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution (pH 7.4) three times. The sample was then fixed in 5 ml 2.1% GA/PBS (wt/vol) solution for 2 hours. The fixed sample was stained with 2 ml 2% OsO<sub>4</sub> solution for 20 minutes and with 1 ml 1% aqueous solution of tannic acid for another 10 minutes. The sample was then rinsed with 2 ml 20% aqueous ethanol solution three times, and finally freeze dried for 24 hours. The surface morphology of the coated fabric and bacteria was examined by a scanning electron microscope (LEO SEM S440, Germany). The operating voltage of the scanning electron microscope was controlled at 10 kV.</p>
<p>In addition to the above static test, the coated fabric was also subjected to a dynamic test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0040517511426608">25</xref></sup> The antimicrobial activity of a substrate-bound antimicrobial is dependent upon the direct contact of microbes with the active chemical agent. The antimicrobial activity of the treated specimen was determined by shaking the coated samples (180 rpm, 37°C) in a concentrated bacterial suspension for a 4 hour contact time, then for 6 and 18 hour contact times. The test suspension was collected at each time interval. The number of viable organisms in the suspension was determined by measuring the OD using a spectrophotometer and the percentage reduction of bacteria was calculated based on counts difference between control-I and capsaicin-coated fabrics.</p>
<p>Different concentrations of capsaicin (0.0004, 0.002, 0.004, 0.007, 0.01 and 0.04 mol/l) were also prepared just in soya broth (2 ml for each) and then mixed with 0.1 ml bacteria suspension (6 × 10<sup>7</sup> cfu/ml) and cultured under the same conditions as above for 4 and 18 hours. The bacteria growth was then examined by measuring the OD values of each cultured suspension after it was diluted 10 times. Lower OD values indicate fewer bacteria.</p>
<p>For either the static test or dynamic test, duplicates of subsamples were evaluated for each group. The results of OD values were averaged.</p>

<p>To synthesize transparent and homogenous sol-gel solutions for the fabric coating, the amounts of reactants and reaction conditions were carefully chosen according to the recommendations from the previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0040517511426608">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0040517511426608">23</xref></sup> The precursors OTES and GPTMS were used because this silane system can provide fabric with a soft handle after coating. Once coated, a transparent and well-attached silica coating layer was formed on the wool fabric. The amount of silica coating pickup on the fabric is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0040517511426608">Table 1</xref>.

<p>The presence of capsaicin in the silica matrix can be verified by the FTIR spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517511426608">Figure 3</xref>). For the original wool fabric, the spectrum showed two dominant vibration bands around 1655 cm<sup>−1</sup> (C = O stretch) and 1550 cm<sup>−1</sup> (N-H bend), and a weak band at 1470 cm<sup>−1</sup> (C-N stretch), which represent amides I, II and III, respectively. There are strong peaks in the C-H stretching regions at 2930 and 2850 cm<sup>−1</sup>. All these bands indicate that wool fiber is made of the complex polyamide chains that are formed from the carboxylic group and the amino group of different amino acids by crosslinking. The S-O stretching bands near 1040 cm<sup>−1</sup> may result from the oxidation step in the chlorine-Hercosett® treatment for wool fabric. When the fabric was coated with the silica, several very pronounced bands appeared at 1100, 930 and 790 cm<sup>−1</sup>. These correspond to the vibration absorption bands of Si-O-Si groups and Si-OH vibration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0040517511426608">26</xref></sup> resulting from hydrolysis and condensation reactions in sol-gel processes. The O-H and N-H groups in the capsaicin structure are observed clearly near 3600–3100 cm<sup>−1</sup> in the capsaicin-coated fabrics, the component of O-CH<sub>3</sub> is seen at 2931 cm<sup>−1</sup> and the C = O stretch and N-H band in capsaicin piled up with the same bands of wool fabric at 1650–1550 cm<sup>−1</sup>. The broad peak at around 3350 cm<sup>−1</sup> is mainly originated from N-H vibration. For the fabrics that were coated with capsaicin-containing sol-gel solution, this peak was obviously higher than that of both the untreated wool fabric and the fabric coated with only sol-gel solution without containing any capsaicin. The peak at 1655 cm<sup>−1</sup>, the typical characteristic vibration of amide groups, also showed the same trend. This suggested that the coating layer contained <inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0040517511426608-img1.tif"/> moieties, which should be from the capsaicin molecules added. Since these peaks showed no reduction after laundry, capsaicin in the coating layer should have a high washing durability. This high washing durability can be explained by the small pores (less than 2 nm) of the silica, which can effectively prevent the fast release of capsaicin molecules from the coating layer during washing. The same spectra of each group measured on different locations of fabric indicated the uniform coatings by padding.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517511426608">Figure 4</xref> shows an example of the results from the parallel streak method. The fabric coated with capsaicin inhibited bacteria growth under the covered area. In comparison, there was a moderate to heavy growth under the control-I sample (sol-gel coated, without capsaicin). To understand if the antibacterial activity of capsaicin is inhibitory or bactericidal, the morphology of Escherichia coli from different samples was investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0040517511426608">Figure 5</xref>). On the surface of the untreated and the coated wool fibers, it can be seen that Escherichia coli cells with flagella (long, thin structures) are plump and each individual bacterium is columniform or oblong shaped. With the presence of capsaicin, large amounts of collapsed or non-viable bacteria were found on the capsaicin-coated fabric. This suggested that capsaicin inhibited the normal bacteria growth process. Because no inhibition zone was found along the fabric edges, the antibacterial function could be due to the chemical reactions between bacterial cells and components of capsaicin. It has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0040517511426608">27</xref></sup> that when special polycationic components are non-diffusibly embedded within a silica matrix layer, interaction between positively charged biocidal additives and negatively charged microbial cell membranes can cause leakage of protein and other intracellular constituents, which interrupts microbes’ proliferation and colonization. Therefore, immobilization of biocides in such a coating matrix offers a long-term antimicrobial protection for the coated substrate. It might also avoid the transfer of biocide chemicals to the users.

<p>The effects of capsaicin concentration and contacttime on antibacterial activity were examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517511426608">Figure 6</xref>). Within the first 4 hour incubation, there was a slower bacterial growth on the treated fabrics (Fabrics 1 and 2) compared to the control-I (sol-gel coated fabric only) and the control-II (uncoated original fabric). The differences between samples were small. With the culturing time increased to 6 hours, expanded bacteria growth was observed for all the groups. However, after 18 hours, Fabric 2 exhibited the highest reduction in microbe growth, while the original group was nearly saturated with a full growth of bacteria. Increasing the capsaicin concentration in the coating layer resulted in a large reduction in the number of bacteria (39% reduction of Fabric 2 versus 20% of Fabric 1).

<p>With wool fibers, nutrient substance (i.e. wool protein) may promote bacteria growth. However, a reduction in the bacterium number indicated the antibacterial function of capsaicin. A higher concentration of capsaicin in the coating showed better antibacterial efficiency.</p>
<p>The antibacterial activity of capsaicin not encapsulated in silica was evaluated by dynamic tests. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517511426608">Figure 7</xref>, with the presence of capsaicin, increasing the capsaicin concentration in the culture medium resulted in a relatively small reduction in the bacteria number after the first 4 hours of culture. However, a significant reduction of the bacteria number was found after 18 hours of culture. The minimum capsaicin concentration showing antibacterial ability was 0.004 mol/l in this study. These results, along with those for the coated fabrics, suggest that capsaicin is a relatively mild antibacterial agent.

<p>The antibacterial efficiency of capsaicin-coated wool fabric before and after laundry washing was compared (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0040517511426608">Table 2</xref>). For the capsaicin-coated fabrics, the efficiency of antibacterial activity was higher than the other groups. There was a slight decrease in the antibacterial efficiency after a few washes, but the antibacterial ability still remained. Because of the low melt point (60–65°C) of capsaicin, the sample was not heat cured after sol-gel coating. This could result in partial removal of the coating layer when samples were washed. More research work on the durability of the coating under severe washing and abrasion conditions, and further quantitative analysis (e.g. high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI/MS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0040517511426608">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0040517511426608">29</xref></sup>) on the capsaicin content should be carried out in the future.

<sec id="sec3-0040517511426608" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We have demonstrated that capsaicin embedded homogeneously in a silica matrix can form an antibacterial coating on wool fabrics. This silica from a sol-gel process could be an ideal host for the capsaicin molecules for prolonged antibacterial effect. The laundry washes resulted in some reduction in the antibacterial efficiency, but capsaicin was still attached to the fibers after laundering. More studies are warranted to broaden the capsaicin concentration range and improve the coating durability.</p>
