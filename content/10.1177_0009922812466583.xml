        <p>To better understand parental opinions regarding the diagnostic process and use of
          genetic testing to assess risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in the younger
          siblings of affected children in the Unites States, we conducted a survey of parents who
          had at least one child with ASD. A total of 162 surveys were completed anonymously using
          an Internet-based survey tool. The mean reported time to ASD diagnosis and age at
          diagnosis were 35.2 months and 56.6 months, respectively. Seventy-two percent of parents
          felt there was a delay in diagnosis. Most parents indicated they would want to pursue
          genetic testing if a test were available that could identify risk in a younger sibling
          (80%). Earlier evaluation/intervention, closer monitoring, and lessened anxiety were
          reasons cited for testing. Our survey indicates most parents would pursue genetic risk
          assessment testing in children at high risk for ASD.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of highly heritable developmental disorders
        that can cause significant social, communication, and behavioral challenges. The Centers for
        Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates the prevalence of ASD is approximately 1 in
        88 children and that the majority of children with an ASD are not diagnosed until after they
        are 4 years old.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812466583">1</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics has developed surveillance guidelines with the goal of
        identifying children who are at risk of an ASD at an early age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812466583">2</xref></sup> Early identification of children at risk for
        ASD is important since it permits referral for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and
        early intervention for affected children. Several studies have documented that children who
        receive early intervention show significant improvements in IQ scores, cognitive and
        adaptive behavior, language skills, daily living skills, educational placement, and severity
        of ASD diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812466583">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812466583"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812466583"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812466583">6</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Although there is a recognized need for early identification of children at risk for ASD,
        there remains a significant time lag between the age when parents first express concern
        about a child’s development and the age of ASD diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812466583">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812466583"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812466583">9</xref></sup> Sivberg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812466583">7</xref></sup> reported that there was a
        delay of 18 to 60 months between parental suspicion and diagnosis of an ASD, with more
        prolonged delays in higher functioning children with autistic disorder or Asperger disorder.
        More recently, Wiggins et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812466583">10</xref></sup> reported that there was an average delay of 13 months from the first
        documented ASD evaluation by a qualified professional and eventual ASD diagnosis. Since the
        mean age of the first ASD evaluation for the patient series reported in their study was 48
        months, the average age of eventual ASD diagnosis was 61 months for this cohort.</p>
      <p>Genetic factors have been shown to have a significant role in the development of ASD.
        Numerous studies have shown that ASDs have a strong genetic component with most estimating
        heritability from 70% to 90%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812466583">11</xref></sup> A recent study reported that the average recurrence risk for siblings
        of affected children is 18.7%, a 20-fold increase compared to the prevalence of ASD in the
        general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812466583">12</xref></sup>
        The authors also report differential recurrence risks based on gender with a recurrence rate
        of 25.9% for males and 9.6% for females.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812466583">12</xref></sup> Although genetic factors have a prominent
        role in the etiology of autism, there are few genetic tests available for children with
            ASD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812466583">13</xref></sup> The genetic
        tests currently available are limited to diagnostic use only and include chromosome
        microarray, fragile X DNA analysis, and tests for a small number of genetic syndromes
        associated with ASD. These tests serve to identify the underlying genetic etiology in a
        child already diagnosed with an ASD. Recently, a new DNA-based test has become available
        which assesses the risk of ASD in children who have an older sibling diagnosed with ASD
        (ARISk® Test, IntegraGen, Inc, Cambridge, MA). The test detects common single nucleotide
        polymorphisms that have been shown to be associated with ASD. Based on the number of
        variants detected, a child’s reported risk for ASD would be increased, decreased, or
        unchanged when compared with the baseline recurrence risk. Although not diagnostic or
        indicative of a specific etiology, this test is designed to identify children at increased
        risk of ASD, allowing for early referral for a diagnostic evaluation and earlier
        intervention.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this study was to better understand parental experiences with the ASD
        diagnostic process in the United States, to assess anxiety levels regarding the recurrence
        risk of ASD, and to obtain parental opinions regarding the use of a genetic risk assessment
        test to evaluate risk for ASD in a younger child.</p>

        <title>Participants</title>
        <p>We developed a self-administered Internet-based survey using online survey and
          questionnaire software available from SurveyMonkey, Inc, Palo Alto, California (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.surveymonkey.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.surveymonkey.com</ext-link>). Requests for participation in the survey were
          e-mailed to potential participants by representatives from local and regional autism
          advocacy groups following receipt of an e-mail from 3 of the authors requesting assistance
          with recruitment for the survey. Contacts at more than 900 organizations were identified
          using an Internet-based search of local and regional autism advocacy groups in every state
          of the United States. Internet links to the survey were also posted to selected autism
          advocacy blog sites.</p>
        <p>Survey participation was limited to U.S. residents who were a parent or guardian of one
          or more children with ASD. Respondent demographics collected included state of residence,
          age, gender, ethnicity, education level, number of children with ASD, and household
          income. The survey was conducted in English only. All surveys were completed anonymously
          and no information was collected that permitted the identification of any individuals
          completing the survey. A single recruitment request was sent to the potential
          participants, and responses to the survey were collected from February 13, 2012 until
          March 23, 2012.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section4-0009922812466583">
        <title>Survey Design</title>
        <p>Survey questions were designed to elicit objective, yes/no, or multiple choice answers.
          The first portion of the survey focused on parental perceptions regarding the ASD
          diagnostic process related to the respondent’s most recently diagnosed child. This
          included questions regarding the timing of initial suspicion of a difference in
          development, the referral and diagnostic process including the types of specialists
          encountered, and the time periods required for referral to specialists and eventual ASD
          diagnosis. Additional questions explored the reasons for perceived delays in the
          diagnostic process and parental anxiety levels prior to their child receiving an ASD
          diagnosis. The remaining questions of this portion of the survey focused on the perceived
          role of genetics in ASD and parental experiences with genetic testing for their child
          diagnosed with ASD.</p>
        <p>Parents who reported having a younger, undiagnosed child less than 48 months of age were
          eligible to complete the second portion of the survey. This section included questions
          regarding participants’ perceptions of the recurrence risk of ASD for their younger child,
          anxiety levels associated with the perceived recurrence risk, and opinions regarding
          whether they would want to have their younger child receive a genetic test which assessed
          the child’s risk of ASD, but neither confirmed nor ruled out an ASD diagnosis. This was
          followed by a series of questions related to why they would or would not want their child
          to receive a genetic risk assessment test for ASD.</p>
        <p>The survey was reviewed and pilot tested with select parents of children with ASD and
          with specialists who provide clinical care and diagnostic services for children with
          developmental delays and/or ASD. To avoid any potential bias, the survey did not include
          any specific reference to IntegraGen, Inc or the ARISk Autism Risk Assessment Test.</p>

        <p>Overall, there was nearly a 3-year time period (35.2 months) between the initial

          survey participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812466583">Figure 1</xref>).
          This time period was somewhat reduced if the family had two previous children diagnosed
          with an ASD. Parents indicated a perceived delay in diagnosis was primarily due to a “wait
          and see” approach by the child’s pediatrician or a delay in seeing a specialist. Only 28%
          of parents indicated that there was no delay in receiving a diagnosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0009922812466583">Figure 3</xref>). The majority of parents
          (84.3%) indicated that they had a high level of anxiety about their child’s development

        for the children represented in our survey was 4.7 years. This is similar to the average age
        of ASD diagnosis of 4.4 years reported by the CDC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812466583">1</xref></sup> A more recent report from the CDC and the
        National Center for Health Statistics indicates that 40% of children with ASD are 6 years or
        older when they are first identified as having ASD and only 20% of children are identified
        before the age of 2 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812466583">14</xref></sup> Delays in diagnosing a child with ASD have significant consequences since
        infants and toddlers have an increased level of neural plasticity, the ability to develop
        new neurological pathways in the brain, and less severe interfering behaviors compared with
        older children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922812466583">15</xref></sup>
        Therefore, in general, the largest improvements in developmental outcomes are reported when
        intervention services are begun at a younger age.</p>
      <p>Delayed evaluation and diagnosis of a child in whom a parent suspects a difference in
        development or ASD can also lead to increased parental anxiety. Parents of children with ASD
        experience increased anxiety levels and the uncertainty of an autism diagnosis can increase
        parental anxiety and delay the introduction of behavioral therapy and other beneficial
            efforts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812466583">16</xref></sup> Many
        clinicians dismiss parental concerns regarding suspicion of developmental issues or advise a
        “wait and see approach,” which prolongs the diagnostic process. Research by Pisula<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812466583">16</xref></sup> and Avdi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812466583">17</xref></sup> suggests that most parents
        consider themselves as the person who knows their child best and often feel frustrated when
        healthcare professionals control information or try to protect them by not telling them all
        of the information about their child and the risk of ASD.</p>
      <p>Unresolved parental concern for a child suspected of having a developmental delay
        contributes to a parent’s anxiety about the child and their prognosis. A recent study by
        Weiss et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812466583">18</xref></sup>
        demonstrated that a parent’s psychological acceptance of having a child with a developmental
        delay or ASD is an important component for the development of coping mechanisms leading to
        reductions in parental stress. The above coincides with the responses from the parents in
        our present survey as to whether or not they would want a younger at-risk sibling to undergo
        genetic risk assessment testing for ASD even if the test was not diagnostic. Eighty-five
        percent of parents who reported they would want their child tested indicated that their
        anxiety levels would be lessened if their child were tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0009922812466583">Figure 7</xref>). This suggests that concerns clinicians may
        have about the potential for increasing parental stress if a child is identified as having
        an increased risk of ASD may be unwarranted for most families.</p>
      <p>A key limitation of the study was that it relied solely on retrospective self-reporting
        rather than prospective data collection. Parental self-reporting questionnaires, however,
        have been widely used by other researchers to provide parental feedback and to obtain
        demographic data for individuals with ASD and their families.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812466583">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812466583"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812466583">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812466583">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922812466583">19</xref></sup> Of note are several studies based on data
        obtained from the Interactive Autism Network, a national, Internet-based, voluntary autism
        family register (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ianproject.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://ianproject.org/</ext-link>) where parents provide information on their children
        with ASD and biological siblings via standardized questionnaires.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922812466583">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922812466583"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922812466583"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922812466583">23</xref></sup> Similar to our
        survey, participants in the Interactive Autism Network project and other parental surveys
        were limited to parents or legal guardians who were English-speaking.</p>
      <p>The parents responding to our survey were also not representative of the US population with
        an overrepresentation of individuals with higher levels of education and income and an
        increased percentage of Caucasian non-Hispanics. This may partially have been because of the
        fact that participants were recruited through local and regional advocacy groups rather than
        using a randomized approach, which may have introduced ascertainment bias. However, the
        overrepresentation of these groups in our study is similar to other ASD surveys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812466583">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922812466583">19</xref></sup> The higher educational level and
        socioeconomic status of our survey participants also coincide with reports from the
        literature that these demographic groups are disproportionately represented in the ASD
            population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922812466583">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922812466583"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922812466583"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922812466583"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0009922812466583">28</xref></sup> The
        administration of the survey via the Internet only may have also contributed to the above
        since access to a computer and the internet were requirements for participation in the
        study. The underrepresentation of Hispanic and African American survey participants
        coincides with the historical decreased incidence of ASD reported for these 2 ethnic
            groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812466583">1</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Finally, survey participants were not asked to indicate the gender of the affected child
        within their care. Therefore, all mean ages reported are of males and females combined. It
        is unknown what impact gender would have had, if any, on the age at which developmental
        differences might have been detected or an ASD diagnosis might have been made.</p>
      <p>In summary, our study is consistent with previous studies that delayed diagnosis and access
        to specialty care remain problematic for children with ASD. Our results showed a
        considerable amount of time between the initial suspicion of a difference in development and
        the diagnosis of ASD, and that these time lags are primarily related to delays in referrals
        to specialists by pediatricians and the wait times to see a specialist once a referral is
        made. The results of our survey also indicate that the majority of parents would be
        interested in using a genetic test that assessed the risk of ASD in younger siblings of
        affected children and that the results of such a test would help to reduce their anxiety
        levels.</p>
