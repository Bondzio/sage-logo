<abstract>
<p>This article presents an investigation on the performance characteristics of a transonic axial compressor with the application of the circumferential casing grooves. Three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations with the shear stress turbulence model are discretized by finite volume approximations and solved on hexahedral grids for the flow analysis. The numerical results for the pressure ratio and the adiabatic efficiency show good agreement with the experimental data. The numerical stall inception point is identified from the last converged point by the convergence criterion, and the stall margin (SM) is numerically predicted. The performances of an axial compressor with rectangular shape of the circumferential casing grooves are analysed in comparison with the case of smooth casing. Additionally, the SMs and the peak adiabatic efficiencies with various shapes of the circumferential casing grooves are compared and evaluated in order to explore the influence of groove shape. The application of the circumferential casing grooves leads to significant improvement in the operating stability of compressors with slight reduction in the peak efficiency.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0957650911427244"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Operating stability of an axial compressor used as an essential component of jet engine, marine engine, and other gas turbines becomes important as a performance parameter as well as pressure ratio and efficiency, and it is limited at low mass flow by stall and surge phenomena. It is reported by Greitzer [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650911427244">1</xref></bold>] that stall induces large vibratory stresses in the blade of compressors and is often unacceptable for structural reasons, and surge can lead to high blade and casing stress levels. These kinds of flow phenomena in an axial compressor consequently result in compressor instability and reduce the compressor performance. Thus, this impact of flow instability on a whole system of gas turbine should be avoided. Many studies have been carried out to alleviate the stall and surge phenomena and to improve the operating stability of axial compressor through experiments and numerical analysis by many researchers together with the history of compressors [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957650911427244">2</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957650911427244">5</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>Tip-leakage vortex around casing region is generally known as a primary factor of axial compressor instability. Casing treatment of passive method controlling this tip-leakage vortex near casing region is a well-known method for improving operating stability. However, since decrease in efficiency is accompanied in an axial compressor with casing treatment, a trade-off between stall margin (SM) and efficiency should be considered. Various methods to improve the SM of a compressor have been suggested. Beheshti <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650911427244">6</xref></bold>] performed a numerical investigation of abradable coating as a means to seal tip-leakage flow in NASA Rotor 37. Their results proved that the application of abradable coating in a transonic axial compressor could efficiently improve the performance and stability. Unsteady flow simulations in an axial compressor with four different semicircular slots were performed by Hembera <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957650911427244">7</xref></bold>] using a three-dimensional (3D) time-accurate Favre-averaged Navier–Stokes flow solver. The results show the effectiveness of the casing treatment with an upstream stator.</p>
<p>In addition, various types of grooves have been suggested by many researchers to understand the mechanisms of stall and surge, and it has been reported that using grooves increases SM by delaying stall. Huang <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650911427244">8</xref></bold>] reported the effects of the width and depth of the circumferential groove casing treatment on SM by 3D numerical analysis, and suggested that the stall mechanism was substantially influenced by tip clearance. Muller <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957650911427244">9</xref></bold>] studied the effects ofthe number and depth of casing grooves on SM by3D numerical analysis. Houghton and Day [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957650911427244">10</xref></bold>] examined the effect of grooves on rotor outflow blockage, and the near-casing flow field was studied using experimental and computational methods. However, the previous works have been focused on grooves with various depths, widths, and types rather than different shapes of grooves.</p>
<p>In this study, the effects of the circumferential casing grooves on the performance of an axial compressor have been numerically analysed based on 3D Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations. Also, the SMs and the peak adiabatic efficiencies with various shapes of the circumferential casing grooves are compared and evaluated in order to explore the influence of groove shape.</p>

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650911427244">Fig. 1</xref>, flow parameters such as totalpressure and total temperature, in relation to mass flowrate, are measured at the inlet (Station 1)and the outlet (Station 2) located 41.9 mm upstreamof the blade leading edge and 106.7 mm downstream of the trailing edge near the hub, respectively.

<sec id="sec3-0957650911427244"><title>3 DESCRIPTION OF THE CIRCUMFERENTIAL CASING GROOVES</title>
<p>In this study, the five different shapes of the circumferential casing grooves, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650911427244">Fig. 2</xref>, are considered, and their stabilities and performances are compared with each other. Each type of the circumferential casing grooves except case 4 consists of seven grooves. Case 1 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650911427244">Fig. 2(a)</xref> has the rectangular shape of the circumferential casing grooves with depth 4.272 mm evenly spaced from the leading edge to the trailing one, as suggested by Huang <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650911427244">8</xref></bold>]; the width of each groove is 10 per cent tip axial chord with a gap of 5 per cent tip axial chord. Huang <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650911427244">8</xref></bold>] studied the effects of the width, depth, and tip clearance of case 1 on SM by numerical analysis. They showed that the application of the circumferential casing grooves is beneficial to expand the operating range of an axial compressor. Case 1 is the base model of this study, which is used to investigate the effects of the casing grooves on the performance of the axial compressor. The configurations of the other cases are designed on the basis of case 1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650911427244">Figs 2(b)</xref> and (c), cases 2 and 3 are the models skewed forward and backward by 45°, respectively. Thus, the depth of each case is reduced to 3.021 mm due to the changed value of angle. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650911427244">Figure 2(d)</xref> shows that case 4 is designed with the rounded edges of each circumferential casing groove. Also, case 5 has an additional circumferential casing groove both upstream and downstream of the blade in comparison with case 1, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650911427244">Fig. 2(e)</xref>.

<sec id="sec4-0957650911427244"><title>4 NUMERICAL ANALYSIS</title>
<p>For this study, ANSYS-CFX 11.0 [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957650911427244">12</xref></bold>] is employed for a3D steady-state flow analysis of an axial compressorwith the circumferential casing grooves. Three-dimensional RANS equations have been discretized with finite volume method. Blade-Gen, Turbo-Grid, CFX-Pre, CFX-Solver, and CFX-Post are used for Blade profile creation, mesh generation, boundary condition definition, numerical analysis, and post-processing, respectively. In addition, creation of circumferential casing groove and its mesh generation are performed by Design-Modeler and integrated computer-aided engineering and manufacturing-computational fluid dynamics (ICEM-CFD), respectively.</p>
<p>The computational domain investigated in this study consists of one blade-to-blade passage of the axial compressor and the circumferential casing grooves by assuming that the flow between two adjacent blades is periodic about the rotating direction. Astructured grid system is constructed in the computational domain of an axial compressor, which has O-type grids near the blade surfaces and H/J/C/L grids in other regions. The H/J/C/L grid topology allows a separate choice of topology types for the upstream and downstream ends of the passage mesh. Therefore, H/J/C/L grid topology provides thebest mesh quality for the asymmetry airfoil shape. Also, a non-matching H-grid mesh is employed as the topology of the tip clearance mesh. The inlet and outlet blocks are constructed with 60 × 37 × 17 and 60 × 37 × 21 grid points, respectively, while the main passage except for the tip clearance and the O-type grids is constructed with 40 × 37 × 84 grid points. Also, the tip clearance and O-type grids are constructed with 20 × 37 × 84 and 216 720 grid points, respectively. The O-grid with a width factor of 0.5 and 20 elements is assigned. This study uses a total of 480 000 nodes as an optimal number of grids determined by the grid dependency test in the previous work [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957650911427244">13</xref></bold>] to define the main flow passage of the axial compressor. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0957650911427244">Figure 3</xref> shows the effects of computational grids on the performance curves for the efficiency and pressure ratio. As shown in this figure, the values of the adiabatic efficiency and pressure ratio almost do not change with the variation of number of grids from 480 000 to 740 000. The predicted near-stall normalized mass flows for the grid numbers, 270 000, 480 000, and 740 000 are 0.939, 0.921, and 0.920, respectively. Each groove is constructed with 20 × 48 × 25 grid points. The near-wall mesh progression is kept as 1.2 with a distance of 0.002 mm for first node. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650911427244">Figure 4</xref> shows the grid systems for different shapes of grooves.

<p>The shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model is used as a turbulence closure. The SST model uses a <italic>k–ω</italic> model at the near-wall region, and a <italic>k–ε</italic> model in the bulk domain, and a blending function ensures smooth transition between two models. It is reported by Bardina <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957650911427244">14</xref></bold>] that the SST model is more effective to analyse the flow separation by adverse pressure gradient than other two-equation models. The accuracy of the numerical scheme for turbulent flow is highly dependent upon the treatment of the wall shear stress. In this study, the near-wall grid resolution is adjusted to keep <italic>y</italic> + ≤2 for the accurate capturing of wall shear stress, and also for the application of low-Reynolds number version of SST model.</p>
<p>The working fluid is considered as an ideal gas in this study. Total pressure and total temperature at the inlet are set to 101 325 Pa and 288.15 K, respectively. The designed mass flowrate is set at the outlet for steady-state simulation. Adiabatic walls with no slip and hydraulically smooth walls are considered at the solid boundaries. The periodic boundary is set at the blade passage interface, and tip clearance is considered along with the passage. The general grid interface (GGI) method is used for the connection between the passage and the grooves. The GGI method is the class of grid connections where the grids on either side of the two connected surfaces do not match [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957650911427244">12</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>For the numerical analysis, the computations have been performed by an Intel Core I7 CPU 2.67 GHz PC. The computational time is approximately 6–7 h.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0957650911427244"><title>5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Validation of the flow analysis results for the total pressure ratio and the adiabatic efficiency in comparison with the performance test results from AGARD report by Dunham [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650911427244">11</xref></bold>] for the smooth casing without the grooves is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0957650911427244">Fig. 5</xref>, as performed by the previous work [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957650911427244">13</xref></bold>]. The numerical results show some uniform underestimations of the total pressure ratio and the adiabatic efficiency through whole mass flow range, but they have good agreements with the test data in terms of the tendency.
<fig id="fig5-0957650911427244" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Validation of the flow analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957650911427244">13</xref>]</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650911427244-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The technique of the circumferential casing grooves is normally used for the improvement of the stability of an axial compressor. The SM and the peak adiabatic efficiency (<italic>η</italic><sub>peak</sub>) are used as parameters to quantitatively evaluate the stability in this study. These important parameters are defined as follows
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0957650911427244"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650911427244-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-0957650911427244"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650911427244-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>m</italic> and PR indicate the mass flowrate and total pressure ratio, respectively, and the subscripts peak and stall refer to the peak adiabatic efficiency point and the near-stall point, respectively. Also, <italic>γ</italic>, <italic>P<sub>t</sub></italic>, and <italic>T<sub>t</sub></italic> indicate the specific heat ratio, total pressure, and total temperature, respectively.</p>
<p>The numerical stall inception point could be identified from the last converged point by reducing the normalized mass flow by 0.002. The peak adiabatic efficiency point is also found by reducing the normalized mass flow by 0.002 in the high-mass flow region. The convergence criterion is suggested by Chen <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957650911427244">15</xref></bold>] as follows.
<list id="list1-0957650911427244" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The inlet mass flowrate variation is less than 0.001 kg/s for 300 steps.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The difference between inlet and outlet mass flowrate is less than 0.5 per cent.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>At that time, the adiabatic efficiency variation is less than 0.03 per cent per 100 steps.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The same convergence criterion is used to find the numerical stall inception point in this study. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0957650911427244">Fig. 5</xref>, the near-stall point predicted based on this convergence criterion is 0.921, while the near-stall point measured by the experiment is 0.925, which is the mass flow normalized by choking mass flow.</p>
<sec id="sec6-0957650911427244"><title>5.1 Performance enhancement via application of the circumferential casing grooves</title>
<p>At a low mass flowrate, the tip-leakage flow and tip-leakage vortex induce a stagnation zone downstream of the passage shock which is caused by a vortex breakdown. This leads to a critical blockage of the main flow resulting in the instability of the axial compressor. This phenomenon of the tip-leakage vortex breakdown is the general characteristic of the transonic compressors with NASA Rotor 37 [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650911427244">8</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957650911427244">16</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957650911427244">17</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>In this study, case 1 with rectangular groove shape is selected as the base model in order to evaluate the effects of the circumferential casing grooves on performance of the axial compressor compared with the case of smooth casing. Also, the total pressure ratio and the adiabatic efficiency are used as the performance parameters of the compressor. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0957650911427244">Figs 6(a)</xref> and (b), it is predicted that the near-stall points are 0.921 for the smooth casing and 0.882 forcase 1, which are obtained by the aforementionedcriteria. The total pressure ratios of the smooth casing and case 1 at near-stall points are 2.073 and 2.086, respectively. The adiabatic efficiencies of the smooth casing and case 1 at the peak adiabatic efficiency are 85.23 per cent and 85.12 per cent, respectively. In comparison with the smooth casing, the circumferential casing grooves contribute to a significant reduction of the near-stall mass flow, and consequently to the improvement in the SM. Higher total pressure and higher efficiency are also achieved for most of the range between the peak efficiency and stall points, but the peak adiabatic efficiency slightly decreases when the circumferential casing grooves are installed. It is thought that separation resulting in pressure loss near the blade’s suction surface is reduced by the high-momentum flux from the circumferential casing grooves.
<fig id="fig6-0957650911427244" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Performance curves for the smooth casing and case 1: (a) total pressure ratio and (b) adiabatic efficiency</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650911427244-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The vortical structures at the near-stall point of the smooth casing (normalized mass flow, 0.921) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650911427244">Fig. 7</xref>. One of the effects of the circumferential casing groove is to change the angle between the tip-leakage vortex and the blade, resulting in the change of the trajectory of the tip-leakage vortex. The tip-leakage flow driven by the pressure gradient over the blade tip interacts with the inflow of the passage, and it produces the tip-leakage vortex. In the axial compressor without the circumferential casing grooves, the tip-leakage vortex is mainly driven by the tip-leakage flow, and it proceeds along the pressure surface of the blade as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650911427244">Fig. 7(a)</xref>. However, in case 1, the pressure gradient over the blade tip region is decreased compared to the smooth casing design, especially near the leading edge, and is mainly driven by the inflow. This makes the incidence angle smaller, which is resulted in a tip-leakage vortex closer to the passage centre in the axial compressor with the circumferential casing grooves, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650911427244">Fig. 7(b)</xref>.
<fig id="fig7-0957650911427244" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Vortical structure at the near-stall point: (a) smooth casing and (b) case 1</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650911427244-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0957650911427244">Figure 8</xref> shows the pressure distributions on the pressure and suction surfaces of the blade at 98 per cent span. With the circumferential casing grooves, the change in the pressure difference between the pressure and suction surfaces is observed at each groove location. It is thought that a remarkable reduction in pressure difference has occurred near the leading-edge region due to a decrease in blade loading near the leading edge by the reduced incidence angle, while the pressure differences at the locations of the third and fourth grooves are increased.

The circumferential casing grooves also have an effect on the momentum transport across the blade tip. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0957650911427244">Figs 9(a)</xref> and (b), separation occurs on the suction side of the blade in the axial compressor with the smooth casing; it is suppressed in the axial compressor with the circumferential grooves, and the Mach number around the suction surface is eventually recovered. It is thought that the application of the grooves generates the high-momentum flux from the pressure surface to the suction surface. Consequently, the suppressed separation on the suction surface of the blade aids the improvement of the operating stability. The static pressure on the suction surface of the blade is also recovered due to the suppressed separation shown in<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0957650911427244">Fig. 8</xref>.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0957650911427244">Fig. 10</xref>, the application of the circumferential casing grooves has negative effects in this aspect. Higher entropy generation is observed near the casing of the axial compressor with the circumferential casing grooves; this explains the inevitabledecreases in the efficiency of the compressor. However, the entropy generation of the smooth casing near the casing is significantly reduced compared to case 1. This reduction in entropy generation contributes to the recovery of the efficiency.

<p>In this study, the performances with various shapes of the circumferential casing grooves shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650911427244">Fig. 2</xref> are also compared.</p>
<p>The SM and the peak adiabatic efficiency of each type of the circumferential casing grooves are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0957650911427244">Fig. 11</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0957650911427244">Fig. 11</xref>(a), all the types of the circumferential casing grooves, except the skewed backward type (case 3), show a beneficial effect on the SM. The SM of the smooth casing is 11.63 per cent, and it is increased by the application of the circumferential casing grooves except case 3. Case 1 shows the SM of 18.01 per cent, which is increased by 6.38 per cent in comparison with the smooth casing. The SMs of cases 2, 4, and 5 are also increased by 4.38 per cent, 5.14 per cent, and 5.64 per cent, respectively. However, the SM of case 3 is slightly decreased by 0.18 per cent. It is thought that the rectangular type (cases 1 and 5) is the most effective shape in the configurations to extend the operating range and improve the stability, whereas the skewed type (cases 2 and 3) is less beneficial for the stability than the other types of the circumferential casing grooves. Moreover, the application of the additional circumferential casing grooves upstream and downstream of the blade (case 5) and the rounded edge (case 4) is not found to have a remarkable effect on the SM. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0957650911427244">Fig. 11</xref>(b), all the peak adiabatic efficiencies are decreased by the application of the circumferential casing grooves, which also induces a drop in the efficiency. The smooth casing shows the highest peak adiabatic efficiency as 85.23 per cent in this study. Each peak adiabatic efficiency is reduced by 0.11 per cent, 0.23 per cent, 0.65 per cent, 0.18 per cent, and 0.14 per cent for cases 1–5, respectively, in comparison with the smooth casing.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0957650911427244">Figure 12</xref> shows the axial velocity contours at 99 per cent span for the smooth casing and each type of the circumferential casing grooves at the near-stall point of the smooth casing (normalized mass flow, 0.921). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0957650911427244">Fig. 12</xref>(a), the tip-leakage vortex from the leading edge interacts with the passage shock, which induces the large low-speed region downstream of the interaction due to energy loss of the flow across the passage shock. This low-energy region is the vortex stagnation zone changing the main flow and resulting in a separation by increasing the back pressure due to the decrease in velocity of the flow. However, it is observed that the application of the circumferential casing grooves contributes to the alleviation of the vortex stagnation zone. This result shows that the circumferential casing grooves are beneficial for improving the operating range and the stability of the axial compressor. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0957650911427244">Fig. 12</xref>(b), thevortex stagnation zone is improved more than the other cases, which means that case 1 has the best stability among these cases. On the other hand, case 2 is improved less than the other types of the circumferential casing grooves, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0957650911427244">Fig. 12</xref>(c). Similar phenomena are also observed in cases 4 and 5 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0957650911427244">Figs 12</xref>(d) and (e).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0957650911427244">Fig. 13</xref>, the application of the circumferential casing grooves shows mostly lower entropy values in the downstream region of the blade passage in comparison with the smooth casing. Consequently, this reduction in the entropy generation with the circumferential casing grooves contributes to the recovery of the efficiency near the low mass flow region.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0957650911427244">Figure 14</xref> shows the tangential velocity contours in the openings of the circumferential casing grooves for cases 1 and 3, which are the most and least effective shapes for the stability, respectively, at each peak efficiency point. The application of the circumferential casing grooves results in a tip-leakage vortex closer to the passage centre that generates more losses near the tip region. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0957650911427244">Fig. 14</xref>, case 1 shows slightly higher tangential velocity in the openings of the circumferential casing grooves compared to case 3. The higher velocity makes the tip-leakage flow closer to the pressure surface of the blade, and consequently reduces the losses by the tip-leakage vortex near the tip region.

<p>In this study, numerical analysis of the axial compressors based on 3D RANS equations has been performed to find the effects of the circumferential casing grooves on the performance of an axial compressor as well as to compare the performances with various types of the circumferential casing grooves in terms of the SM and the peak adiabatic efficiency. From the results, it is found that the vortex stagnation zone induced by interaction between the tip-leakage vortex and the passage shock is a primary factor for the instability of an axial compressor. Moreover, the application of the circumferential casing grooves is beneficial to reduce the vortex stagnation zone, and the stability of the axial compressor is varied with the groove shape. Higher total pressure and higher efficiency are achieved for most of the range between the peak efficiency and stall points, but the peak adiabatic efficiency slightly decreases when the circumferential casing grooves are installed. The case with the rectangular grooves is shown to be most effective in the aspects of the SM and peak adiabatic efficiency among four cases. On the other hand, the case with the skewed backward type of grooves is shown to be the least effective.</p>
