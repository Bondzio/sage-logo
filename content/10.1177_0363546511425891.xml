<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> There are few long-term studies evaluating functional outcomes and rates of arthrosis after arthroscopic Bankart repair with bioabsorbable tacks.</p>
<p><bold>Purpose:</bold> We evaluated the clinical and radiographic results of arthroscopic Bankart repair using intra-articular bioabsorbable tacks at a minimum of 10 years’ follow-up.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design:</bold> Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Thirty-two consecutive patients were retrospectively identified. Twenty patients (63%) were evaluated at a mean follow-up of 13.5 years (range, 10.75-17.5 years) and average age of 43 years (range, 28-73 years). The surgical shoulder (SS) was compared with a healthy control shoulder (CS) in 15 of 20 patients. Outcome tools included the Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI) and Disabilities of the Shoulder, Arm, and Hand (DASH). Blinded, independent evaluators performed physical examinations and reviewed radiographs.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Thirteen patients (65%) had stable shoulders, 5 of 7 (25%) failed by dislocation, and 2 of 7 (10%) failed by signs of anterior instability on examination. Three patients underwent revision stabilization surgery. Average time to failure was 4.2 years (range, 0.25-14.7 years). Average WOSI and DASH scores were 80% and 7.3, respectively. The CS faired better than SS in WOSI scores (97% vs 83%, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .008), main DASH scores (0.39 vs 6.79, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .024), and the DASH sports module (0.00 vs 10.94, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .043). Patients lost 5.9° of passive forward flexion (<italic>P</italic> = .031) and 4.3° of passive external rotation (<italic>P</italic> = .001). Forty percent returned to their preoperative sports level. Higher grades of arthrosis were seen in the SS (20% absent, 40% mild, 25% moderate, and 15% severe) versus CS (<italic>P</italic> = .002).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> At long-term follow-up, 65% of patients treated with an arthroscopic Bankart repair using bioabsorbable tacks had a well-functioning, stable shoulder. Disability scores were greatest with sports; however, the majority of patients had well-preserved ranges of motion and good functional WOSI scores. Despite this, 40% had evidence of moderate to severe glenohumeral arthrosis.</p>

<p>In 1978, Rowe et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511425891">25</xref></sup> established the open Bankart repair as an effective treatment modality for anterior glenohumeral instability. Since then, many studies have shown open Bankart reconstruction to be a successful stabilization procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511425891">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511425891">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511425891">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511425891">24</xref></sup>; however, open techniques are known to restrict the shoulder in motion, particularly external rotation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511425891">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511425891">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511425891">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511425891">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511425891">27</xref></sup> Rosenberg et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511425891">24</xref></sup> studied long-term open Bankart repair outcomes at a minimum of 10 years’ follow-up. Eighteen of 31 (58%) patients had shoulders with arthrosis, with 13% (4/31) being moderate to severe in nature. Loss of external rotation was associated with degenerative radiographic changes and raised the question of whether degenerative arthrosis was a long-term complication from the loss of external rotation caused by open Bankart repairs.</p>
<p>With the advent of arthroscopy, an explosion of new fixation devices and techniques arose for the management of Bankart repairs, including metallic staples, transglenoid sutures, anchors, and bioabsorbable tacks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511425891">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511425891">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511425891">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511425891">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511425891">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511425891">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511425891">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511425891">22</xref></sup> Arthroscopic techniques with anchors and tacks have become increasingly more popular because they offer better postoperative range of motion and have decreased surgical morbidity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511425891">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511425891">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511425891">27</xref></sup> The main drawback to these techniques is the reported higher failure rates when recurrent instability is compared with the open technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511425891">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511425891">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511425891">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511425891">27</xref></sup> Yet, some short- to medium-term follow-up studies have shown failure rates statistically similar to those after open fixation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511425891">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511425891">27</xref></sup> At 6.5 years’ follow-up, Elmlund et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511425891">8</xref></sup> reported a failure rate of 14% with arthroscopic bioabsorbable tacks, but 51% of shoulders had moderate to severe arthrosis. With longer follow-up averaging 11.7 years, Owens et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511425891">23</xref></sup> reported 33% of patients failed their arthroscopic Bankart repair with tack fixation, with no radiographic or physical examination data obtained.

<p>Recently, the Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511425891">20</xref></sup> and Disabilities of the Shoulder, Arm, and Hand (DASH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511425891">14</xref></sup> functional outcome instruments have been developed and validated as more responsive measures of functional shoulder outcomes, with WOSI developed to specifically address functional outcomes with regard to shoulder stability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511425891">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511425891">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511425891">19</xref></sup> To date, no studies exist with greater than 10-year clinical and radiographic follow-up of arthroscopic Bankart repairs using bioabsorbable tack fixation. The objective of this study was to use these outcome measures, as well as clinical examination and radiographic studies, to assess long-term results of arthroscopic Bankart repair using intra-articular bioabsorbable tacks at a minimum of 10 years’ follow-up.</p>
<sec id="section1-0363546511425891" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Thirty-two patients who underwent an intra-articular arthroscopic Bankart repair using bioabsorbable tacks (Suretac, Smith &amp; Nephew, Andover, Massachusetts) between the years of 1992 and 1999 were included in the study. All patients had signs of anterior instability on examination preoperatively and had failed nonoperative therapy. One orthopaedic surgeon (J.M.) with a special interest in shoulder surgery performed all arthroscopic Bankart repairs. Patients with posterior or multidirectional instability, an irreparable rotator cuff tear or one that required repair, biceps tendon or acromioclavicular joint injury requiring surgical intervention, a posterior labral tear requiring repair, prior shoulder surgery, or bony glenoid defects &gt;25% of the inferior glenoid were excluded from the study. None of these patients had an engaging Hill-Sachs lesion. The follow-up period was a minimum of 10 years. All patients gave informed consent, and an institutional review board approved the study.</p>
<sec id="section2-0363546511425891">
<title>Surgical Procedure</title>
<p>All patients underwent an examination under anesthesia of both shoulders to confirm anterior instability, and the surgery was performed with the patient in the modified beach-chair position. A standard posterior portal was created, and a complete diagnostic arthroscopic examination was performed, which confirmed a Bankart lesion in all patients. Arthroscopic intra-articular Bankart repair was done using the technique described by Warner and Warren<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511425891">28</xref></sup> and Speer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511425891">26</xref></sup> The capsulolabral complex was mobilized, and the anterior glenoid rim and neck were abraded using a rasp and an aggressive shaver. With use of one or more anterior portals, the avulsed tissue was then reapproximated. According to the size of the Bankart lesion, between two and four 8-mm cannulated bioabsorbable tacks from the Suretac system (Smith &amp; Nephew) were placed to secure the avulsed tissue at the chondral margin of the glenoid and restore labral height, re-creating the bumper effect of the labrum.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546511425891">
<title>Postoperative Management</title>
<p>Patients were kept in a sling or shoulder immobilizer for 4 to 6 weeks. For the first 4 weeks, they were allowed to perform pendulum exercises with their shoulder and active range of motion exercises with their elbow and wrist. At 4 weeks postoperatively, patients were allowed to initiate passive exercises of their shoulder including forward elevation, abduction to 90°, and passive external rotation to 0°. They were also allowed to perform isometric deltoid and periscapular exercises. At 6 weeks, patients were allowed to progress their shoulder activity to full active range of motion. By 12 weeks, resistance training was initiated. Patients were restricted from returning to contact sports until 4 months postoperatively or 6 months if the sport involved overhead activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546511425891">
<title>Assessment at Final Follow-up</title>
<p>Three questionnaires were obtained at their study visit to assess functional outcomes: WOSI,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511425891">20</xref></sup> DASH,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511425891">14</xref></sup> and a 23-point shoulder assessment survey. Both the index and contralateral shoulders were evaluated by WOSI and DASH scores. All WOSI scores were expressed as a percentage of 100% of all possible points, with 100% representing the best possible score. Total WOSI scores were broken down into 4 domains (physical symptoms, sports/recreation/work, lifestyle, and emotions) and expressed as a percentage of 100% of all possible points in each category, as described by Kirkley et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511425891">20</xref></sup> A subjective account of recurrent instability by history was reported as a dislocation if the instability event required a manual reduction or a subluxation if the instability event did not require manipulation, and at least one episode of instability resulted in dead arm syndrome.</p>
<p>One independent observer (D.P.) performed 18 of 20 physical examinations. Because of geographical limitations, 2 other independent observers each examined one study participant. All 20 patients received a full physical examination of both shoulders. At the time of the study visit, patients wore a colored shirt to hide surgical scars and atrophy, so the examiner was blinded to the side of the index shoulder. Active and passive ranges of motion were measured using a goniometer to the nearest degree. Isometric strength was graded on a standard 5-point scale. Rotator cuff function, impingement, and a full neurovascular examination followed. Stability was assessed with the anterior apprehension test, load and shift, and sulcus sign. A positive apprehension sign was considered if the patient demonstrated pain, guarding, or apprehension that the shoulder would dislocate or felt unstable. If positive, the relocation test followed to confirm relief of the pain or discomfort caused by anterior instability. The load and shift was graded according to the criteria of Altchek et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511425891">1</xref></sup> (a scale of 1+ indicates excessive translation to the glenoid rim, 2+ as subluxation of the humeral head with spontaneous reduction, and 3+ as frank dislocation without spontaneous reduction). Toward the end of the examination, the patients removed their shirts, and a physical inspection of each shoulder completed the examination.</p>
<p>Radiographs of the index and contralateral shoulders (serving as a within-group control) were obtained for all 20 patients, including a standard axillary view and a true anteroposterior view in external rotation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511425891">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511425891">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511425891">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511425891">24</xref></sup> One blinded independent radiologist with specialty training in musculoskeletal radiology reviewed all radiographs. Both shoulders were graded for degenerative changes, as classified by Rosenberg et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511425891">24</xref></sup> as normal (no joint space narrowing, osteophytes, or sclerosis), mild (slight joint space irregularity, &lt;1-mm joint space narrowing, slight sclerosis), moderate (narrowing &lt;2 mm, mild-moderate osteophytes, moderate sclerosis), or severe (severe joint space narrowing, abundant osteophytes, severe sclerosis, and cyst formation). Drill holes were evaluated using the same follow-up radiographs. Drill holes placed at the time of tack implantation were 2.4 mm in diameter, and so based on prior studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511425891">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511425891">17</xref></sup> drill holes were graded as invisible, hardly visible, clearly visible but &lt;3 mm in diameter, or clearly visible and &gt;3 mm in diameter. Evidence of a Hill-Sachs lesion was also documented. Preoperative radiographs were not available for comparison.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546511425891">
<title>Control Group</title>
<p>The surgical shoulder (SS) and contralateral control shoulder (CS) were evaluated in all patients. Patients were excluded from the healthy CS group if they had prior shoulder surgery, a history of shoulder dislocations, or an abnormal physical examination finding. Five patients’ contralateral shoulder were excluded from the comparison healthy CS group for the following reasons: 1 patient had a rotator cuff repair, 1 patient had a stabilization procedure for glenohumeral instability, 2 patients reported a history of multiple glenohumeral dislocations, and 1 patient reported subluxations with evidence of glenohumeral instability on examination. Fifteen healthy CS were available for comparison.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546511425891">
<title>Failure</title>
<p>A failed repair was defined as a postoperative dislocation, revision stabilization surgery, or a positive apprehension and relocation sign on examination with or without a history of subluxation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0363546511425891">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Comparisons between the injured and uninjured contralateral shoulders were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Categorical data were evaluated with χ<sup>2</sup> or Fisher exact tests as appropriate for observed cell size. A <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05 was considered significant.</p>

Twenty of the 32 patients (63%) returned for follow-up at a mean of 162 months (range, 129-210 months) after the index procedure. Of the 12 patients lost to follow-up, 1 had died of a brain tumor, and 11 were either unable to be reached or unable to be evaluated because of geographical circumstances. Fourteen patients described a history of recurrent anterior glenohumeral instability before surgery, including at least one dislocation, whereas 1 patient reported only subluxations, and 5 reported no obvious history of dislocations or subluxations.</p>

<p>At the index procedure, in addition to a labral detachment at the anterior/inferior quadrant, at least 18 of 20 shoulders had a Bankart lesion extending into the anterosuperior quadrant (2 missing). Normal sublabral foramina were not repaired. Fifteen patients received 2 tacks, 4 received 3 tacks, and 1 received 4 tacks. Two patients received radiofrequency capsulorrhaphy when the surgeon determined that there was capsular laxity in addition to the Bankart lesion. Five patients had glenoid chondromalacia. No patients had a recorded episode of adhesive capsulitis, postoperative synovitis, or any other clinical complications from the bioabsorbable tack.</p>
<p>At the time of follow-up, 13 patients (65%) had stable shoulders. Of the 7 failed repairs, 5 had experienced a redislocation. The 2 other failures had signs of instability on examination, with one of them reporting a history of subluxation. Three patients underwent revision stabilization surgery. Six of 7 failures had obvious trauma as the cause of the failure, with the average time to failure being 4.2 years (range, 0.25-14.7 years). All patients reporting a history of subluxations without dislocations either demonstrated signs of instability on examination or underwent revision stabilization surgery. Of the 2 patients who had a radiofrequency capsulorrhaphy, 1 had a successful repair, and 1 failed with recurrent postoperative dislocations.</p>
<p>At final follow-up, 5 shoulders had a positive apprehension and relocation sign. Of those 5 shoulders, only 2 had an appreciable 1+ load and shift, whereas 2 patients had a 1+ load and shift without history of dislocation, subluxation, or a positive apprehension and relocation sign. No patients had a 2+ or greater load and shift sign. Range of motion values are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546511425891">Table 2</xref>. When comparing the SS to the healthy CS, patients lost an average of 5.9° of passive forward flexion (<italic>P</italic> = .031) and 4.3° (range, −3° to +10° lost) of passive external rotation at 0° of abduction (<italic>P</italic> = .001). When comparing range of motion between successful repairs (n = 13) and their healthy control shoulder (n = 11 [2 of the 13 successful repair patients had abnormalities of the CS]), only passive external rotation at 0° of abduction remained significant (loss of 4.3°; <italic>P</italic> = .010). There were no significant differences in range of motion between successful and failed repairs. Mild weakness in external rotation at 90° of abduction was demonstrated in 35% (7/20) of patients.</p>

<p>The average total WOSI and DASH scores at final follow-up for all 20 patients were 80% and 7.3, respectively.

Similar statistically significant differences were found in all WOSI domains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546511425891">Table 3</xref>). Failed repairs had lower total WOSI scores (55%) than stable repairs (92%) (<italic>P</italic> = .005).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To date, only a handful of studies exist in the literature evaluating long-term outcomes of arthroscopic Bankart repairs using bioabsorbable tacks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511425891">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511425891">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511425891">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511425891">23</xref></sup> Fewer studies examined functional outcome data using both questionnaires and independent physical examiners,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511425891">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511425891">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511425891">22</xref></sup> and none included radiographic outcomes at a minimum of 10 years’ follow-up. Twenty of 32 study patients were available for evaluation, yielding a 63% follow-up at an average of 13.5 years (range, 10.75-17.5 years) postoperatively.</p>
<p>Similar to other studies, a failed repair was defined as a dislocation after surgery, revision stabilization surgery, or a positive apprehension and relocation sign with or without symptoms of subluxation at the time of follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511425891">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511425891">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511425891">22</xref></sup> At the time of follow-up, 7 of 20 (35%) patients had failed repairs. Five failed by dislocation, one by subluxation, and one by signs of instability on examination. Three patients underwent revision stabilization surgery, of whom 2 had failed by postoperative dislocation and 1 by frequent subluxations. Six of the 7 failures failed by a traumatic mechanism.</p>
<p>The duration of our follow-up may in part speak to this high failure rate. At a median follow-up of 6.7 years, Elmlund et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511425891">8</xref></sup> demonstrated a failure rate of 14%, with similar studies demonstrating failure rates between 11%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511425891">22</xref></sup> and 18%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511425891">7</xref></sup> at a mean follow-up of approximately 8 years (range, 4-11 years). Our average time to failure was 4.2 years, yet one of our failures occurred just a couple weeks before his 14.7-year follow-up study visit. Recently, Owens at al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511425891">23</xref></sup> reported on arthroscopic Bankart repair outcomes with bioabsorbable tacks at a mean follow-up of 11.7 years (range, 9-14 years), and 33% had experienced a dislocation or reported symptoms of subluxation postoperatively. No physical examination or radiographic data were collected for this study.</p>
<p>Our study visit included a physical examination for all patients performed by a blinded, independent examiner. When comparing the SS to 15 healthy CS, patients lost an average of 5.9° of passive forward flexion (<italic>P</italic> = .031) and 4.3° of passive external rotation at 0° of abduction (<italic>P</italic> = .001). A similar loss of passive external rotation was also noted in our successful repairs (<italic>P</italic> = .010). Otherwise, there were no significant differences between SS and CS in range of motion. Seven of 20 patients (35%) had mild weakness of external rotation at 90° of abduction. Only 3 of these patients had a failed repair. Elmlund et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511425891">7</xref></sup> demonstrated a statistically significant loss of 10° of external rotation at 90° of abduction and a mean loss of 0.5-kg strength in abduction when compared with the contralateral shoulder. Other long-term follow-up studies of arthroscopic bioabsorbable tacks have compared injured and noninjured shoulders postoperatively and reported similar losses of motion in external rotation and forward flexion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511425891">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511425891">22</xref></sup> Alternatively, open Bankart repairs have been associated with 12° to 18° of lost external rotation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511425891">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511425891">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>We evaluated functional outcomes at the study visit using WOSI and DASH questionnaires. The WOSI questionnaire is a validated quality of life measurement tool for patients with shoulder instability, and it measures physical and emotional symptoms as it relates to the patient’s shoulder as well as the functional status of the shoulder with regard to work, recreation, sports, and general lifestyle. Some consider it “more responsive than other tools for shoulder instability” when compared with Rowe, DASH, Constant, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder scoring tools.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511425891">19</xref></sup> Our study depicts mean WOSI scores in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546511425891">Table 3</xref>. Total WOSI scores averaged 80% in all 20 patients. Interestingly, when evaluating all 15 patients with a healthy control shoulder (CS), the SS WOSI scores were statistically lower than the CS by only 14% to 17% (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) in all domains except in the lifestyle domain, which only showed a 7% difference (<italic>P</italic> = .037). In comparison, our successful repairs, as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546511425891">Table 3</xref>, had WOSI scores 3% to 7% lower than their healthy control shoulder; however, only the sports and performance WOSI domain was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .035). In a similar group of surgical patients treated with arthroscopic tacks, Owens et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511425891">23</xref></sup> reported average total WOSI scores to be 82.3% at an average of 11.7 years’ follow-up.</p>
<p>The DASH questionnaire is a valid and reliable tool for disorders of the upper extremity and can be used as a one-time outcome measure or to determine change over time, as seen in postoperative patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511425891">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511425891">12</xref></sup> We observed a significant difference in disability between SS and CS in the main score (6.78 and 0.39, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .024) but not in the work module. We also observed a larger difference in disability in the sports/performing arts module (10.94 and 0.00, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .0043). Despite this, 40% of patients at an average of 13.5 years after surgery were still participating in their preoperative level of sporting activity, and 30% were still participating with limitations. In our successful repairs, DASH scores were not statistically different from their healthy control shoulders (<italic>P</italic> = .069).</p>
<p>Using the classification described by Rosenberg et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511425891">24</xref></sup> radiographic evidence of arthrosis in our study patients was absent in 20%, mild in 40%, and moderate to severe in 40% at an average of 13.5 years’ follow-up. Rates of arthrosis were higher in our SS than our CS group. In a similar study of arthroscopic intra-articular tack fixation with shorter average follow-up of 6.7 years, Elmlund et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511425891">8</xref></sup> found moderate to severe arthrosis in 51%. In comparison, Hovelius et al’s natural history study with 10-year outcomes showed moderate to severe arthrosis in 8% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511425891">13</xref></sup> Chondral damage from prominent tacks as a cause for this substantially higher rate of arthrosis is possible, but interestingly, an arthroscopic stabilization study that used extra-articular tacks still found moderate arthrosis in 67% of patients at a median follow-up of 8.9 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511425891">16</xref></sup> Open Bankart repairs at 15-year follow-up have shown rates of moderate to severe arthrosis of 13%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511425891">24</xref></sup> and a recent arthroscopic suture anchor study demonstrated 10% moderate and no severe arthrosis at almost 11-year follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511425891">4</xref></sup> Although none of these studies used a control shoulder for comparison, suture anchors, similar to open repairs, may have improved arthrosis outcomes compared with tack fixation because of a more anatomic restoration of the capsulolabral complex. Other causes of arthrosis in our study may include undocumented synovitis, even though none of our patients had documented synovitis or adhesive capsulitis. It is unlikely that overtensioning of the anterior capsule occurred because there was minimal loss of motion at final follow-up.</p>
<p>Kartus et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511425891">16</xref></sup> reported only 9% of shoulders to have visible drill holes in their arthroscopic Bankart repairs with extra-articular tacks at 8.9 years’ follow-up, whereas we reported 45% with our intra-articular tacks. The clinical consequence of this is unknown but may not be significant, as we documented no clinical complications from our 20 study patients.</p>
<p>In our small group of 7 repair failures, as expected, we did find that functional outcomes were lower than stable repairs (WOSI, 55% vs 92%, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .005). Although the study was not powered to further evaluate this subgroup, we did not find higher rates of arthrosis or significant differences in range of motion when compared with successful repairs. In fact, 2 of the 7 patients with failures (29%) were still participating in sporting activity without having undergone revision stabilization surgery.</p>
<p>Our study has many strengths. We had a blinded, independent examiner and radiologist interpreting the clinical and radiographic outcomes, and we compared these outcomes with those of healthy contralateral shoulders to serve as a control. We used the WOSI questionnaire, which specifically addresses shoulder instability as the primary focus of its functional outcome, and our follow-up is the longest of any study evaluating arthroscopic Bankart repairs using bioabsorbable tacks. Yet, this was a retrospective study with inherent limitations. First, we were only able to examine 63% of our 32 patients at a minimum of 10 years’ follow-up. One of 32 patients was deceased, and 11 were unable to be reached. Naturally, if all 32 study patients were available for follow-up, our study results may have been different, depending on the status of the 12 patients lost to follow-up. Also, we found that all preoperative radiographs were no longer available because of storing policies and had unfortunately been destroyed. We also did not have preoperative functional outcome questionnaires available for comparison. Furthermore, we did not use a dynamometer to more objectively quantify weakness on examination. Lastly, the small sample size precluded us from making conclusions involving outcome predictions.</p>
<p>In light of our failure rate and the advantages provided by the suture anchor, we no longer use bioabsorbable tacks for our arthroscopic fixation of Bankart repairs. And yet, suture anchors at long-term follow-up also have their issues. At greater than 10-year follow-up, 23% of arthroscopic Bankart repairs fixed with suture anchors failed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511425891">4</xref></sup> compared with a 5% to 9% failure rate of open Bankart repairs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511425891">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511425891">15</xref></sup> A meta-analysis from 2007 also demonstrated open Bankart repairs to have a significantly lower incidence of recurrent instability when compared with all arthroscopic repairs (8% vs 18%, respectively).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511425891">21</xref></sup> Open approaches were associated with higher rates of returning to a previous level of work or sport. Rowe scores, however, were higher in the arthroscopic groups. Although this meta-analysis was inherently biased by older arthroscopic fixation techniques, the higher rate of recurrent instability from arthroscopic fixation has been suspected, and often, failed arthroscopic repairs are treated with open Bankart repairs. Like other studies with bioabsorbable tacks,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511425891">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511425891">16</xref></sup> the greater incidence of moderate to severe arthrosis at long-term follow-up in comparison to open repairs is somewhat surprising. This finding warrants further investigation, particularly considering arthroscopic fixation allows for greater maintenance of external rotation when compared with open repairs. Although premature, there may be more promising results with suture anchors, considering a recent long-term report of only 10% moderate and no shoulders with severe arthrosis at a minimum of 10 years’ follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511425891">4</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>At a minimum of 10 years after arthroscopic Bankart repair using intra-articular bioabsorbable tacks for anterior shoulder instability, 65% of patients had excellent function with a stable shoulder. Disability scores were greatest in sporting activities and performing arts; however, the majority of patients had well-preserved ranges of motion and good functional WOSI scores when compared with their healthy contralateral shoulder. Despite this, 40% of repaired shoulders had evidence of moderate to severe arthrosis.</p>
