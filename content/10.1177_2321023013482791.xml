<p>Political science research includes within its scope various methodological approaches and a broad array of specific methods and techniques<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2321023013482791">1</xref></sup> for the collection and analysis of empirical data. The purpose of this section on <italic>Notes on Methods</italic> in the <italic>Studies in Indian Politics</italic> is to provide a space for the discussion of new methods of data collection and analysis from around the world, as well as their applicability for students of Indian politics. In addition to newer methods, this section also encourages short review pieces discussing existing methodological approaches and distinctions between them, strengths and weaknesses of various methods, discussions on the variety of techniques for the collection and analysis of data, and the usefulness of these to the study of politics in India. Though issues of methodology are crucial, the stress in this section of the Journal is on the <italic>application</italic> of these methods.</p>
<p>While empirical political science research has a long history in the country, there has been an insufficient discussion on the applicability and suitability of various techniques for the analysis of existing data sources, or for the collection of primary data. With the increasing availability and use of statistical programming packages (SPSS, STATA etc.) including free open-source resources (PSPP, R etc.), secondary data use has increased considerably in the past few decades, though with still fairly limited use in the Indian context.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2321023013482791">2</xref></sup> Often there is a trepidation regarding certain methods, in particular when there is an unwritten hierarchy with quantitative, particularly ‘survey research methods’, often placed at the bottom of the pyramid (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2321023013482791">Yadav, 2008</xref> for a discussion). This leads to attacks on the conclusions arising from such research without a nuanced critique of the method or more rigorous arguments in favour of possible alternatives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-2321023013482791">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hence, a focus on ‘methodological pluralism’ is crucial for this journal, as is the ‘multi-method’ approach for understanding political phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2321023013482791">Palshikar, 2010</xref>). We thus welcome notes that engage with the critiques of ‘quantitative survey methods’ along with debates on the generalizability of ‘qualitative’ work, alternative methods such as discourse analysis and archival research, discussions on issues of validity and reliability of various techniques and deliberations on differing methods that can be used collaboratively (through a mixed-method approach) to arrive at conclusions regarding the phenomenon being investigated.</p>
<p>We also welcome brief notes on more specific techniques—for instance, on innovative uses of survey and sampling techniques, including experimental questionnaire designs and survey implementation. However, surveys, as we know, are simply one possible method available for the collection of information and data (generally for larger-N studies). There are various other methods used by political scientists. We welcome discussions on a whole gamut of methods from ‘qualitative’ to ‘quantitative’, and in between. For instance, discussions could include notes on the use of aggregate data; comparison of insights that can be gleaned from micro-economic and election survey data; the interface between geography, spatial issues and politics; comparative analysis at both the national and the sub-national level to list a few areas. In addition, notes on ‘non-quantitative’ methods such as focus groups and in-depth interviews are also welcome.</p>
<p>One example of the use of innovative techniques in surveys is the use of ‘anchored vignettes’ in questionnaire design. King, Murray, Salomon, and Tandon (2004) provide a critical discussion on vignettes as well as the problems in measurement of ‘complicated concepts’ in surveys and the variation in interpretation of questions by respondents, and possible solutions to these problems. Another example of using mixed-approaches or innovations involves the creation of a sampling frame when a ready frame is unavailable. For instance, in an ongoing project of which I am a part (on social mobility and educational inequalities in two cities in India), due to the unavailability of an adequate sampling frame a mixed sampling strategy was used. First, multistage stratified random sampling was used to select a number of Assembly Constituencies (AC) from the list of Parliamentary Constituencies, followed by the selection of Polling Stations (PS) within each of the selected ACs. Next, using a sampling constant and a random number table, a given number of households were selected from each PS. Finally, a quota sample (with pre-defined quotas for age and gender) with a random number table was used for the selection of respondents within each chosen household. This enabled the creation of a frame when existing frames such as electoral lists are of limited use,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-2321023013482791">4</xref></sup> and it enabled ‘randomization’ through the entire sampling phase of the study.</p>
<p>Beyond surveys, experiments are an example of an alternative method of data collection. Originally used in the behavioural sciences, experiments (beyond those in survey questionnaire design) have in the past few decades been applied in political science and economics research around the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-2321023013482791">5</xref></sup> An example of these experimental techniques in India comes from recent studies by economists on caste discrimination in the labour market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2321023013482791">Banerjee et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2321023013482791">Thorat &amp; Attewell, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to a discussion on methods, we also encourage conversations on training with a focus on building up existing teaching resources and capacity in political science departments across the country.</p>
<sec id="section1-2321023013482791">
<title>Curriculum: Research Methods</title>
<p>Courses on <italic>research methodology</italic> are becoming increasingly compulsory in both political science and other social sciences departments across universities in India. However, a cursory look at some of the syllabi highlights the secondary position provided to the applied use of these methods (here I imply the breadth of techniques, which could include surveys and more, for data collection and analysis).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-2321023013482791">6</xref></sup> This may at some level indicate the lack of adequate teaching sources, materials and qualified instructors to undertake such a task. In this situation, we need a more nuanced discussion on pedagogical techniques that would allow for the inclusion of alternative frameworks in the teaching of political science in particular, and social sciences in general.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-2321023013482791">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>This section in the <italic>Studies in Indian Politics</italic> hopes to engage with this issue by providing a space for discussions on cutting-edge methods and techniques and their application in a variety of scenarios. Further, it will also be a place for discussions on existing sources of teaching and training materials available to political scientists in India, and alternative materials that could be utilized.</p>
<p>One example of a training course in quantitative techniques comes from the Lokniti Summer School on Quantitative Methods in Political Science Research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-2321023013482791">8</xref></sup> This Summer School has had as its mandate the emphasis on the <italic>application</italic> of research methods and techniques for political science. For this purpose students at each summer school (there have been five schools so far) are given access to one National Election Study dataset from the CSDS archive. The students use this dataset and the statistical techniques learnt during the course to answer novel research questions. An issue of the international journal <italic>Asian Survey</italic> last year included some of the articles that arose from past Lokniti summer schools.</p>
<p>We need more discussions on such programs being run across the country, as well as debates on ways in which those of us in social science disciplines can approach the teaching of methods and techniques.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-2321023013482791">
<title>Under-utilization of Existing Databases</title>
<p>Along with discussions on new ways to collect empirical data, there is the pressing need to initiate the mining of relevant existing secondary data sources. In light of this, we welcome notes on the utilization and usefulness of various databases for students of political science in India.</p>
<p>There are numerous secondary databases, both national and state-level, available to students of political science. Some such as the Census and the Election Commission of India provide aggregate data, while others such as the National Sample Survey, National Family and Health Survey and the National Election Study provide raw household or individual-level data. In this note I would like to highlight <italic>one</italic> possible archive available for students of politics in India. This in no way implies that there are no alternative secondary data sources available.</p>
<p>Lokniti–CSDS has pioneered the collection of survey data related to elections in particular, and politics in general—a practice that began in the 1960s and continues to the present. The core of this database comprises the National Election Study series (NES, 1967–2009, with a gap in the 1980s<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-2321023013482791">9</xref></sup>) and State Election series. Further, data has also been collected on a thematic basis (for example: the periodic ‘State of the Nation Surveys’ and the Surveys on the youth including ‘Youth in Indian Politics’ and ‘Youth Attitudes in India’). There have also been internationally comparative studies, such as the ‘State of Democracy in South Asia Surveys’. In addition to survey data, the CSDS Data Unit houses aggregate data from a variety of sources.</p>
<p>While this data archive is now enviable in size and can compare with similar databases from across the world, it has been seriously under-utilized by Indian scholars. There have indeed been studies from members of the national Lokniti Network, but there has been limited use of this data by other scholars. Further, studies using these databases have dealt primarily (though indeed not exclusively) with issues of political and electoral participation and related concerns (the special issue of the <italic>Economic and Political Weekly</italic> from 2009 is an example). There is however, adequate scope for these datasets to be used for other political science and sociological research as well. One example of the use of this NES data in recent times comes from the field that I am most familiar with —that of social mobility research. Recent work by Kumar, Heath and Heath (2002a and 2002b), Vaid and Heath (2010), provide some examples of the use of large secondary databases for macro-level studies of mobility.</p>
<p>In addition to the election and opinion survey archive, there is an ongoing novel attempt to mine the data on delimitation that has been painstakingly compiled by Lokniti researchers. This delimitation data along with other secondary data sources on politics (aggregate and survey data) can be a veritable goldmine for political science researchers.</p>
<p>These datasets are open to the national and international research community of academics and researchers. However, for the large scale use of these databases their access needs to be standardized and made more user-friendly—a self-reflexive process that is underway among the members of the Lokniti network.</p>
<p>In sum, this journal hopes to provide an open space for discussion on the issues mentioned in this note. We particularly encourage short articles that cite examples of situations in which existing or new methods have been applied, both in India and abroad. We look forward to this collective engagement.</p>
