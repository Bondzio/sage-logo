<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although research on negative attitudes towards psychiatric patients has increased recently, both in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764011408652">Angermeyer &amp; Dietrich, 2006</xref>) and among mental health professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764011408652">Bell et al., 2010</xref>), few data are available about trainees in healthcare professions who commonly care for these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764011408652">Ng, Pearson, Chen, &amp; Law, 2010</xref>). Medical residency is a key training period when individuals fall somewhere between being a lay person and being a professional. An increased understanding of the attitudes of medical residents towards psychiatric patients during this formative period allows for the proposal of tailored interventions should these prove necessary. Surprisingly, very few studies have investigated the attitudes of medical residents towards psychiatric patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764011408652">Chin &amp; Balon, 2006</xref>) and to our knowledge, none has examined the specific impact of a psychiatric label. The aim of the present study is therefore to investigate the impact of a psychiatric label on medical residents’ attitudes towards a person, as well as their willingness to treat this person.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0020764011408652" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This cross-sectional study was conducted following principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764011408652">World Medical Association, 2008</xref>), among current medical residents of all specialties at Toulouse University Hospital (France) in June and July 2010. Participants were contacted by email through the residents’ mailing list and invited to fill in an anonymous online questionnaire assessing demographic information and attitudes towards an individual described in a vignette. The medical residents were randomly assigned to one of two hypothetical vignettes describing the same apparently ‘healthy’ individual, differing only in the presence of a psychiatric label given to one of them. The medical residents did not receive any educational credit for participation in the study, nor financial compensation.</p>
<p>The email invitations to participate in the study (<italic>N</italic> = 680), resulted in 322 completed responses, a response rate of 47.4%. The mean age of the participants was 27.7 years (SD = 1.9), 64.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 208) were female, and the mean time spent as a resident was 2.4 years (SD = 1.3). Of the total, 97 (30%) were unmarried, 54 (17%) were dating someone but living apart, and 171 (53%) were living with a partner. Using sociodemographic data of current residents provided by Toulouse University Hospital, we confirmed that respondents to the survey did not differ from non-respondents on gender, age and time spent as a resident.</p>
<p>The vignette was as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>Mr A is a young man who can express his feelings and thoughts in the presence of close friends and family, although he sometimes gets anxious when talking in front of strangers. He gets along all right with his family most of the time. Generally he also gets along with other people. Compared to those of his age, his life can be considered to be organized. He is generally an optimistic and happy person. In summary, he establishes a good balance between his social life and study.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The residents were assigned to this case description alone, or the identical description but with the addition of the sentence at the end of the case description: ‘This young man was diagnosed with a psychiatric condition during his last consultation in the emergency room.’ This vignette has been previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764011408652">Ogunsemi, Odusan, &amp; Olatawura, 2008</xref>). The specification of the emergency room setting was added to make it more relevant to residents working in Toulouse University Hospital. Each case description was followed by a modified version of the Social Distance Scale (SDS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764011408652">Bogardus, 1925</xref>), including 10 questions to be rated on a five-point Likert-type scale, ranging from ‘definitely agree’ to ‘definitely disagree’. The different versions of the SDS display good psychometric properties and have been extensively used in research on stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764011408652">Angermeyer &amp; Matschinger, 2005</xref>). In addition to these 10 questions measuring desire for social distance, we added two questions assessing willingness to treat the person.</p>
<p>In line with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764011408652">Ogunsemi et al., 2008</xref>), we dichotomized scores on each item of the SDS. A rating of 4 and 5 indicated a great desire for social distance and an unwillingness to treat. We then calculated odds ratios adjusted for age, gender and length of residency for reporting a great desire for social distance (items 1–10) and an unwillingness to treat (items 11–12). The analyses were then repeated to compare total scores for each question between the two groups. All data analyses were performed using the statistical software package SPSS v17.0.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Being informed that an individual had been given an unspecified psychiatric diagnosis in an emergency room predicted residents reporting a greater desire for social distance from him, even after statistical adjustment for age, gender and duration of residency. These findings were confirmed using student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests to compare total scores for each question. Odds ratios (95% CI) for a great desire for social distance and unwillingness to treat are reported <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020764011408652">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To date, this is the first study to investigate the effect of an unspecified psychiatric label on the attitudes of medical residents towards potential patients. According to our findings, this label when added to an individual’s description was significantly associated with residents reporting a greater desire for social distance after controlling for background variables. These findings are in line with those of others, both in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764011408652">Arkar &amp; Eker, 1994</xref>) and in Nigerian medical students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764011408652">Ogunsemi et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the present study explores the impact of a psychiatric label on professional attitudes and suggests that such a label might reduce a medical resident’s willingness to examine a patient unaccompanied. Such a negative attitude towards the presence of a psychiatric disorder also has the potential to confound the resident’s ability to make a correct diagnosis by either doubting the veracity of the patient’s reporting of symptoms, or assigning causation to psychological issues rather than physical ones.</p>
<p>Since both vignettes described the same apparently ‘healthy’ individual, it is reasonable to suppose that the labelling alone was responsible for the negative attitudes. These findings emphasize that psychiatric illness is associated with apprehension and avoidance among medical residents, even in the absence of symptoms. Addressing these concerns more directly within medical training programmes may help decrease stigmatization and increase the residents’ confidence, competence and quality of care.</p>
<sec id="section10-0020764011408652">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Our study was, however, limited by the use of an unspecified psychiatric label, and while it cannot be ruled out that the use of a more detailed psychiatric diagnosis might have changed our results, our findings do emphasize that the psychiatric label in itself is sufficient to create stigma, regardless of diagnosis. Also, the presentation in the emergency room may have altered the residents’ responses, as this may indicate a more serious psychiatric disorder.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0020764011408652" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Future similar research across a number of university hospitals with more precise and detailed measures seems necessary in order to gain a more complete understanding of stigma towards psychiatric patients and how this affects the care by medical residents. Our results support the need to implement programs that fight stigma in the curriculum of medical residents.</p>
