<p>Ernest Gellner was a major 20th-century intellectual. He made a significant impact in a range of distinct research areas including analytical philosophy, social anthropology, sociology of Islam, the study of psychoanalysis, theories of nationalism, state socialist systems, kinship studies, historical sociology, political ideologies, and the philosophy of history. He was also a vibrant public intellectual, always eager to debate the burning social and political issues of the day and happy to take on the intellectual adversaries from the right, left and centre of the political spectrum. His first book (<italic>Words and Things</italic>, 1959) was an unprecedented attack on the Wittgenstein-influenced Oxford school of linguistic philosophy, and as such it established him quickly as a maverick who had no difficulty in expressing views that went so clearly against the grain. He was an excellent speaker and somebody who could think on his feet. He was also a witty essayist who, when writing for newspapers and high-circulation periodicals, was able to articulate his complex theories and ideas in a popularly digestible form with funny and striking metaphors that were impossible to forget. He had a distinct charismatic appeal, was sought after as an analyst, speaker and debater, and his 20 or so books always attracted a lot of attention.</p>
<p>Yet less than two decades after his death Gellner’s influence seems to be largely confined to nationalism studies, where his 1983 book <italic>Nations and Nationalism</italic> achieved the level of fame only comparable to Anderson’s <italic>Imagined Communities</italic>. While there is no doubt that Gellner’s account, with its stress on the historical novelty, structural contingency and legitimizing potency of nationalist doctrine in the modern era, is still in many respects unrivalled and the most original theory of the rise and expansion of nationalism, his theoretical opus is certainly much bigger and has so much more to offer. Moreover, his theory of nationalism cannot be fully comprehended without proper engagement with his broader philosophy and sociology.</p>
<p>John A. Hall’s excellent book shows the inherent richness, complexity and internal coherence of Gellner’s life-work, which is also deeply embedded in his biography which mirrors the dramatic social changes that have shaped the 20th century in Central Europe. Hall beautifully charts the interlinked dynamics between Gellner’s biography and the major political, social and economic forces – including world wars, revolutions, genocides, the collapse of empires, industrialization, economic prosperity, and urbanization – all of which had a profound impact on both Gellner’s life and his social philosophy.</p>
<p>In brief, Gellner was born in 1925 in Paris but grew up in interwar Prague, in a German and Czech speaking Jewish family, where he also attended an English Grammar school. The Nazi occupation and partition of Czechoslovakia forced his family to emigrate to England where Gellner won an Oxford scholarship. As the war ended Gellner attempted to return to Prague but was quickly disillusioned by the Soviet influence and permanently settled in England. After Oxford he briefly worked as a lecturer in Edinburgh and then spent 35 years at the London School of Economics as professor of philosophy ‘with special reference to sociology’. During this period he undertook several fieldworks in Morocco, studying Berber kinship organization, which was the backbone of his PhD thesis and a later book, <italic>Saints of the Atlas</italic> (1969). In 1984 Gellner was appointed chair in social anthropology at Cambridge. Upon his retirement in 1993 he moved back to Prague where he established the Centre for the Study of Nationalism at the new Central European University. He died in Prague in 1995.</p>
<p>Gellner was first and foremost a theorist of modernity. Consistent with the classics of social thought, Gellner was perplexed by the same questions that preoccupied Durkheim, Marx, Simmel or Weber: how and why the modern world came into being and what makes modern life so distinct from the rest of human history. He also shared much of their Enlightenment-infused rationalism, describing himself on one occasion as ‘a rationalist fundamentalist’, and he too shared the view that historical transformation presumes a gradual move from traditional to modern societies. In his memorable phrase this was a ‘big ditch theory’: a transition from<italic> Agraria</italic> – a universe characterized by rigid hierarchies, violence, stagnation, and the dominance of ‘coercion-and-salvation-monopolising rulers’ over the destitute and superstitious peasantry – towards <italic>Industria</italic> – a highly dynamic, complex, socially and geographically mobile world sustained by science and incessant economic growth. Nevertheless, despite his insistence to the contrary, Gellner’s sociology was substantially less rationalist than that of Marx, Weber or Simmel. Although his philosophical writings, such as <italic>The Devil in Modern Philosophy</italic> (1974), <italic>Legitimation of Belief</italic> (1975), <italic>Spectacles and Predicaments</italic> (1980), <italic>Relativism and the Social Sciences</italic> (1985) and <italic>Reason and Culture</italic> (1992), were written in the service of an uncompromising defence of empiricism and rationalism, while also providing a fierce critique of relativism, idealism, subjectivism and vitalism, this severity completely disappears in Gellner’s sociology. Instead what comes across in his more sociological and anthropological studies, such as <italic>Thought and Change</italic> (1964), <italic>Muslim Society</italic> (1981<italic>), Psychoanalytical Movement</italic> (1985), <italic>Culture, Identity and Politics</italic> (1987), <italic>State and Society in Soviet Thought </italic>(1988), <italic>Conditions of Liberty</italic> (1994), <italic>Anthropology and Politics</italic> (1995) and <italic>Language and Solitude</italic> (1998), is great subtlety in understanding profoundly different social and moral universes. Hence, unlike the classics, who were still the untroubled heirs of Enlightenment and who, with the partial exception of Weber, largely saw the transition from the <italic>Gemeinschaft</italic> into <italic>Gesellschaft</italic> as inevitable, irreversible and beneficial to humanity, Gellner’s account is more nuanced and ironic. Not only does he emphasize the utter historical contingency of modernity (as something that happened accidentally ‘in one small part of Europe and on one occasion only’), and its rescindable potential, but he also insisted on the intrinsic fragility and paradoxical character of modern life.</p>
<p>Whereas most classics shared the general Enlightenment idea that the attainment of knowledge will ultimately lead to human happiness and a degree of social harmony, for Gellner truth, individual happiness and social accord are nearly always inversely proportional. In other words, whereas Marx and Durkheim saw alienation and anomie respectively as the modern processes that lead away from one’s true self, Gellner argued that it is truth that alienates, not illusions. As he put it strikingly in <italic>Plough, Sword and Book</italic> (1988: 272): ‘social cohesion cannot be based on truth. Truth butters no parsnips and legitimises no social arrangements’. As pure knowledge is factual, dry, and coldly rational it cannot in itself bind human beings nor provide comfort. The truth does not set you free; explanations are inevitably cold, blunt and heartless. Telling a simple truth to a small child that there is no Santa Claus will make her more knowledgeable but it is bound to hurt her feelings.</p>
<p>In contrast, social bonds require complex ‘falsehoods’: culture, ideology, religion, or myth. It is these ‘falsehoods’ that provide meaning and communal warmth. The sincere believers who attend a religious ceremony, tribesmen who take part in the rain dance or co-nationals who experience the shiver in their spines when the national anthem is played forge an intensive sense of belonging not by way of truth but through shared ‘falsehoods’. Once one realizes that dancing does not bring rain, that there is no god or that nationalist rituals are recent inventions, one attains knowledge at the expense of communal solidarity. The cold, rational truth brings enlightenment but the price is very high: solitude, emotional deprivation and the lack of meaning. Hence for Gellner (1974: 55) martyrs do not die for truth: ‘Beliefs must be difficult to be satisfying. … Martyrs have in general defended in the face of death beliefs which they would have found somewhat harder to defend in the face of logic’. The consequence of this situation is the realization that genuine, deep, cultural differences are ultimately irreconcilable: multicultural Canada can allow Sikh policemen to wear their traditional turbans (<italic>dastar</italic>) but burning widows (<italic>sati</italic>) is out of the question. Hence, despite his stanch rationalist philosophy, Gellner’s sociology has a strong trace of Nietzscheism. Nevertheless, this is a sociological, not an ontological, Nietzscheism: an attempt to understand, explain and historically situate a cultural difference. In this sense Hall is perfectly right in his characterization of Gellner as a sociologically more grounded analyst than Habermas, Rawls or Taylor, who call for the recognition and reconciliation of difference through dialogue without working out the full social implications of deep, genuine diversity. Although Gellner was often attacked for his Eurocentrism he had a profound respect and empathy for the <italic>weltanschauungen</italic> which were so alien to his own. Moreover, he wanted to understand such worldviews on their own terms.</p>
<p>In this sense Gellner was a great participant observer and real life sociologist who utilized the same conceptual and analytical apparatus to analyse all collective agents that he encountered. He was able to draw interesting parallels between various groups and found great similarities between the Oxford dons (‘Narodniks of Northern Oxford’) and the Moroccan Berber tribesmen or the American psycho-analysts and the members of medieval guilds. During the year he spent in the US in the early 1950s Gellner (1974: 37) was fascinated with nearly identical lifestyles of the leading American philosophers: ‘The cars, wives, divorces, and psychiatrists of the Utah personalist do not differ from those of a New Hampshire Heideggerian or a North Dakota neo-Kantian, or even a Louisiana Austinian. The ideological differentiation, in formal philosophy, seems to mean nothing in the souls or life-styles of the philosophers’.</p>
<p>Hall successfully ties important biographical moments in Gellner’s life to the masterful and succinct presentation of his main ideas and research interests. Although Hall is deeply sympathetic to Gellner’s work and clearly admires him as a person, the book is far from being a hagiographic text, even in a minimal sense of the word. Instead Hall provides a critical analysis of the entire opus with a spotlight on Gellner’s theory of nationalism, sociology of Islam and his historical sociology.</p>
<p>Despite significant refinements and improvements, from its early, path-breaking, formulation as a chapter in <italic>Thought and Change</italic> (1965) to the most recent articulations in <italic>Encounters with Nationalism</italic> (1994) and the posthumous <italic>Nationalism</italic> (1997), Hall finds Gellner’s account of nationalism potent but still too economistic, too functionalist and lacking in the greater appreciation of politics and especially the wider geo-political context in which nation-states operate. Similarly Gellner’s sociology of the Islamic world is praised, particularly his original and persuasive synthesis of theories of Ibn Khaldun’s and David Hume and his attempt to interpret the rise and potency of Islam in modernity through the Weberian lenses as a form of ‘generic Protestantism’ resistant to secularism, but Hall is doubtful that this model can explain the transformations that have taken place in the Middle East over the last several decades.</p>
<p>Hall is more well-disposed towards Gellner’s historical sociology as they both (together with Michael Mann) share an approach which singles out pre-industrial Western Europe as the only world region where unique social, economic, political and cultural conditions allowed for the unprecedented breakthrough to modernity. However, while Gellner emphasizes the importance of church-state stalemate and the ‘expanding bribery fund’ (i.e. the ability to pacify the rulers by allowing them to become wealthy in return for power sharing), Hall identifies multipolar power struggles, often characterized by incessant warfare, and a shared normative universe as the decisive factors in the rise of Europe over the rest of the world. This difference with Gellner is clearly spelled out in Hall’s splendid <italic>Powers and Liberties</italic> (1986).</p>
<p>As someone who knew him really well and whose detailed knowledge and inner understanding of his work comes across throughout the book, Hall is particularly good at spotting the inherent contradictions in Gellner. For example, his theory of nationalism insists on the link between industrialization and cultural homogeneity, as the new nation-states utilized standardized vernaculars and large-scale educational systems to mould their, initially rural, population into nationally conscious citizenry. Yet Gellner as a person had great difficulty in accepting the consequences of his analysis: he could not come to terms with post-1989 Prague, which by then was largely a mono-ethnic city. As Hall demonstrates, Gellner missed the multi-cultural city of his youth and was generally sympathetic and even nostalgic towards the pre-national world of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Similarly, notwithstanding his reputation as an anti-communist and his open dislike of Western neo-Marxism, Gellner was extremely fond of the Soviet Marxist anthropology and was genuinely saddened by the collapse of the USSR, an event that perfectly fits his theory of nationalism. Likewise the collapse of Yugoslavia came as a complete shock to him and I remember how a few weeks before his death he expressed to me his bewilderment with the fact that many of the Yugoslav Praxis School Marxist philosophers, people he knew such as M. Marković, S. Stojanović and Lj. Tadić, became the hard-line Serbian nationalists. Nevertheless, this particular transformation of intelligentsia does not contradict his theoretical diagnosis either.</p>
<p>Hall’s meticulously researched biography also chronicles Gellner’s fierce debates and extensive polemic correspondence with Karl Popper, Edward Said, Noam Chomsky, Clifford Geertz and several leading psychoanalysts, among others, where one can see Gellner as an energetic and stubborn debater. Some of these discussions have later found more extensive expression in his books, such as <italic>The Psychoanalytic Movement: The Cunning of Unreason</italic> (1985), a forceful and comprehensive critical analysis of psychoanalysts as secular priests, and <italic>Postmodernism, Reason and Religion</italic> (1992), a ruthless attack on postmodernism and relativist anthropology, with Geertz bearing the brunt of Gellner’s ire.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Gellner was a rare breed of intellectual who was able to successfully link complex philosophical ideas and an encyclopaedic knowledge of history, geography, politics and literature with the changing realities of everyday life and produce instant and insightful observations. He was also able to rework and expand these insights into coherent and persuasive theories. However, there are some odd omissions in Gellner’s approach that need to be highlighted.</p>
<p>Firstly, despite living through the most violent period in European history, being forced to emigrate to avoid gas chambers, and even having to briefly fight in the Second World War, Gellner had very little to say about the role of organized violence in modernity. His economistic historical sociology makes room for warfare and violence in the agrarian world, but once <italic>Industria</italic> emerges violence is seen as superfluous. As Hall documents, this view went so far that in one lecture at the LSE he described the Holocaust as ‘an unnecessary mistake of industrial society’. This problematic understanding stems from Gellner’s conception of industrial society as a universal, singular, and almost borderless order rather than what it really is, a universe of multiple asymmetric polities firmly separated by contested boundaries. In other words, the gradual pacification of internal orders in modernity was often a direct by-product of the externalization of violent conflict. Hence, rather than being less violent than the organizationally puny <italic>Agrarias</italic>, modern industrial orders are well oiled military machines capable of wielding a monopoly of organized violence over their sovereign territories and organizing the mass mobilization of an entire population, the outcome of which is often mass destruction on a scale that no pre-modern polity could ever achieve. Organized violence cannot be seen as a needless sideshow on the stage of modernity – in most instances, it is its very core.</p>
<p>Secondly, although Gellner is a great theorist of ideologies, being able to simultaneously understand, empathize and explain the origins, make-up and workings of such diverse value systems as Khomeinism, British conservatism, Leninism, political Islam or nationalism, his overly optimistic view of the industrial era prevented a proper engagement with the role of ideology in late modernity. His rather credulous view of science and technology coupled with the sanguine perception of continuous industrial growth has made Gellner less receptive towards acknowledging the enduring intensity and prevalence of ideological power in the present-day world. Although his belief that science and technological advancement would eventually undermine ideocratic regimes might be plausible in the case of state socialism, this seems certainly less so in relation to other ideologies, not least Islamism and nationalism. What is particularly striking is Gellner’s view, which in some respects contradicts his own theory, that the strength and intensity of nationalism is bound to decline in modernity. Nevertheless if, as Gelner argues (1983), nationalism is reinforced by expanding educational systems, standardized high cultures, increasing literacy rates, and the centralization of administrative power, then as these processes keep intensifying there is no palpable rationale for nationalism to wane.</p>
<p>Finally, Gellner’s approach, heavily focused as it is on the benefits of economic growth underpinned by the uninterrupted development of science and technology, is largely ignorant of the environmental costs of such growth. In this view he is much closer to the 19th century than to late-20th-century social thought. While, as Hall shows, he was no friend of a ruthless, ecologically blind, laissez faire economy, he was essentially a social philosopher of industrialism who did not dwell on the (often disastrous) consequences of everlasting industrial expansion.</p>
<p>However, regardless of these omissions and shortcomings, Gellner remains a towering, yet mostly overlooked, figure of 20th-century social thought. The fact that he was an intellectual loner who never belonged to a distinct school of thought, did not follow academic fashions, was not politically correct, opposed all orthodoxies and regularly went against the dominant views of his day did not make him a very popular figure, and this has not changed after his death. Moreover, he disdained academic snobbery, intellectual cults of personality so widespread in modern academia and preferred, if the truth obliged it, to defend the status quo when it was much more fashionable, easier, and often profitable to be seen as a fierce critic of a particular social order.</p>
<p>John Hall’s marvellous book clearly shows why Gellner needs to be rediscovered and brought to the mainstream of contemporary social thought. His elegant, thoughtful and highly accessible biography is the best possible invitation to revisit Gellner’s thought.</p>
