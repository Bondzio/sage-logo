<p>To take a photograph is to participate in another person’s (or thing’s) mortality, vulnerability, mutability. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470357213483228">Sontag, 1979</xref>: 15)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Sontag’s influential words on photography as death, echoing Barthes’ similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470357213483228">2000</xref>) formulation of the photograph as always a ‘has been’, insightfully hints at the radical contingency and finality inherent in photography’s capture of random life moments. Yet, it reflects a rather negative theory of images, which is deeply suspicious of the potentially educative possibilities of images to nurture dispositions of action towards human vulnerability – a suspicion that, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470357213483228">Linfield (2010)</xref> argues, is endemic in a long tradition of photographic criticism from Roland Barthes to Frederick Jameson. Far from sharing this suspicion, this special issue wishes to emphasise the power of images to re-animate the ethical and political tensions captured in their fleeting snapshots and to make claims to reflection and emotion that always, however, depend on the historical contexts in which images emerge. Given the omnipresence and gravitas of spectacles of suffering in our culture, this issue both challenges and takes Sontag’s argument at face value by focusing on the <italic>actual</italic> imagery of human vulnerability and mortality in two of its most prominent public manifestations: humanitarian imagery of distant suffering and the photojournalism of conflict.</p>
<p>By drawing on a wide range of photographic, filmic and digital representations, the contributions in the issue, in their various ways, seek to throw into relief the complex relationships between those who witness the suffering of others and those who suffer. From the poor and sick to street protesters and from war victims to soldiers-in-battle, the figures of suffering in this issue are, however, unevenly distributed in the global economy of images of vulnerability and violence, reflecting the historical divide of viewing relations between Western societies of relative affluence and safety and developing societies of poverty and danger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357213483228">Chouliaraki, 2006</xref>). The ethics of images, then, refers firstly, to the social relations of power and the forms of moral–political action that the visual representations of such vulnerability call on us to perform and, secondly, to the truth claims and modes of identification with those who suffer – what, that is, these visuals tell us about ourselves as moral actors and how they invite us to engage with them.</p>
<p>Two assumptions inform the focus of this issue on the ethics of images. The first is that images do not simply have a representational power in depicting an external reality but that they possess a <italic>performative</italic> power upon this reality, simultaneously constituting it in meaning. It follows that, rather than interpretation being concerned with the witness’s ‘spontaneous’ faculty of empathy, it emerges instead at the interface between the witness and the object of his or her gaze precisely through those texts that produce meaning about vulnerability and violence. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357213483228">Butler (2009</xref>: 67) writes in one of the chapters in her book, <italic>Frames of War</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>Interpretation takes place by virtue of structuring constraints of genre and form on the communicability of affect – and so sometimes takes place against one’s will or, indeed, in spite of oneself. Thus, it is not just that the photographer and/or the viewer actively and deliberately interpret, but that the photograph itself becomes a structuring scene of interpretation – and one that may unsettle both maker and viewer in its turn.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The second key assumption of this special issue, it follows, is that our moral and political response to images of vulnerability and violence is not only a question of personal convictions or intimate emotions, but primarily a product of the <italic>collective imaginations of the world</italic>, of self and other, that such imagery disseminates and legitimises in our (Western) societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357213483228">Chouliaraki, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470357213483228">Orgad, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470357213483228">Zelizer, 2010</xref>). The ethics of images is, in this sense, a crucial aspect of the public cultures of the West as the primary mechanism of moral education through which the West becomes the witness of other people’s suffering. This is because the realities that images represent work not only to depict the world as it is but also to evoke emotions and visions about how the world might or should be. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470357213483228">Zelizer’s (2010</xref>: 23) ‘as if’ or ‘subjunctive’ nature of images, thereby also mundanely reproduces specific dispositions towards engaging with this world: ‘if the power of news images derives in part from the “as if” of what they show, then images can be used to simplify, soften, and render contingent the untenable features of the geopolitical realities that they depict.’</p>
<p>Understanding, then, how our public cultures imagine the world beyond our own zones of safety and prosperity and how they make claims about common humanity or justice requires, therefore, a sharp focus on the historical and critical analysis of the aesthetics of images – of the multiple practices of visual representation through which the resources of semiotic and technological systems come to produce meaning about vulnerability and violence. It also requires an equally sharp focus on people’s own accounts about these images – how they produce them, as institutional agents, or respond to them, as citizens/consumers of our visual culture. This issue draws attention to these different analytical foci by including a variety of methodological approaches on the aesthetics of humanitarian imagery and war photojournalism, encompassing historical analysis (Wilkinson, Chouliaraki), sociological/genre and semiotic analyses (Wells, Andén-Papadopoulos), audience research (Orgad) and cultural analysis (Blaagaard).</p>
<p>The aim of the issue is to provide a multi-perspectival account of the ethical role of images in the West, both in its historical dimensions, such as the early modern emergence of humanitarian imagery (Wilkinson), the transformations of the ethics of war as reflected in 20th-century photojournalism (Chouliaraki) or the role of 19th-century melodrama in contemporary appeals of distant suffering (Wells) <italic>and</italic> in its more contemporary challenges associated with the rise of new media and the subsequent digitisation and personalisation of images of violence (Andén-Papadopoulos), the production of new claims to authenticity and post-human forms of spectatorship (Blaagaard) or the marketization of humanitarian communication (Orgad). Even though these perspectives by no means exhaust the full range of theoretical and analytical possibilities in the study of the ethics of images, they do offer systematic and interconnected insights into the shifting relationships between visual representation and its technologies as well as into the increasingly blurred boundaries between media producers and media users – and hence between those who witness human suffering and those who witnessed suffering. In so doing, all articles in this issue seek to problematise the truth claims and power relations that arise out of the technological witnessing of the camera and to scrutinise the moral proposals for action that such acts of witnessing make possible for Western publics. The visual essay in this issue (‘Montage as tool of political visual realignment’), consisting of the compelling images by artist Fatimah Tuggar, further contributes to this critical problematisation as the images eloquently illustrate the moral tensions involved in the staging of vulnerable others for the purposes of their visual consumption by the West and thereby gesture towards the economic and political power relations between the West and the ‘rest’.</p>
<p>Whilst the specific contributions of each section are presented in some detail, the aspiration underpinning this special issue as a whole is, let us recall, to move beyond mainstream theoretical critiques that lament the corrosive impact of images on public life, such as those of Sontag and Barthes, and to acknowledge instead the historical, technological and semiotic specificity of images and thus the changing contexts of power within which these images may turn into objects of our reflection, emotion and action. Taking its point of departure partly in the major divide between zones of prosperity and poverty and partly in the distinct but equivalent, and often intersecting, divide between safety and danger, this special issue is organised, as mentioned earlier, around two major themes: ‘Humanitarianism and images of vulnerability’, which addresses the divide of prosperity and poverty; and ‘Journalism and images of violence’, which addresses the divide of safety and danger. Here is a brief presentation of each section.</p>
<sec id="section1-1470357213483228">
<title>Humanitarianism and Images of Vulnerability</title>
<p>This theme explores visual representation in the humanitarian field as a practice of witnessing that both recognizes the pain of others as a cause of solidarity and subjects them to an a-political and, often, colonial politics of pity. The section’s three papers address historical (Wilkinson), sociological (Wells) and media-related (Orgad) aspects of this ambivalence inherent in the act of photographic witnessing.</p>
<p>Iain Wilkinson’s article, ‘The provocation of the humanitarian social imaginary’ traces the emergence of the humanitarian imagination of late modernity through a historical account of the images of human suffering and the early modern debates that these provoked about the ethics of the human condition. Through critical readings of the shifting discourses on our ‘common humanity’ that proliferated in these debates, Wilkinson reflects on the implications of such discourses not only for the practice of humanitarianism today but also for the production of sociological knowledge about human suffering. Karen Wells’s article, ‘The melodrama of being a child’, scrutinises the genre of melodrama as a major communicative device of NGO appeals. The genre, she argues, works by evoking an immediate emotional and ethical response through which the theatrical function of the NGO appeal is played out. Rather than denouncing it as inauthentic, however, Wells defends the melodramatic mode against accusations of simplification by asserting that melodrama allows for a ‘visceral emotional response with another individual’s suffering’ and thus enables the articulation of passionate politics and, potentially, social change to occur. Finally, Shani Orgad, in ‘Visualizers of solidarity’, uses interviews with NGOs to offer insights into the organizational politics and institutional paradigms that produce the visual representations of humanitarian campaigns. Identifying organizational tensions within and between NGOs, Orgad demonstrates how organizational politics operates on the basis of dominant frames around images and their messages. These frames are not only divided into negative and positive imagery but also articulate a productive tension that operates as a springboard of the imagination. The tension makes it possible to imagine different ways of engaging with suffering others.</p>

<title>Journalism and Images of Violence</title>
<p>The three articles in this section explore a series of moral tensions around truth, authenticity, emotion and humanity, which come about from the rise of new technologies in the mediation of images of violence, in a variety of contexts – from iconic war photojournalism to online amateur videos.</p>
<p>Developing the idea of the war imaginary, Lilie Chouliaraki reflects on the normative ethics of war photojournalism in the past century in her article ‘The humanity of war: Iconic photojournalism of the battlefield, 1914–2012’. She argues that the war imaginary has perpetually struggled with the impossible tensions of representing humanity in the midst of brutal suffering and that this struggle is reflected in the various moral claims that photojournalism has made in time: from the early sublimation of warfare as heroic soldiering to its contemporary psychological profile as humanitarian activism. In the context of the rise of new media and a hyper-emotionalised public sphere, the war imaginary may today be becoming more humanitarian, Chouliaraki argues, but it is no less humane for that. In her article entitled ‘The un/reality of crowdsourced video: Towards a new global imagination in national television news?’, Kari Andén-Papadopoulos offers a productive classification of the use of crowd-sourced news footage based on the example of the footage of the captured Gaddafi in terms of four aesthetic features – hypermobility, opacity, non-narrativity and ‘raw’ audio – and makes a persuasive case for the emergence of a citizen-driven ethics of authenticity that re-articulates subjectivity, affectivity and partisanship in new ways. In conclusion, she reflects on the tensions arising between, on the one hand, the immediate emotional and ethical response that crowd-sourced films evoke and, on the other, the suspicion that their unauthorised modes of production and fragmentary nature of dissemination provoke to audiences. Finally, in ‘Post-human viewing: A discussion of the ethics of mobile phone imagery’, Bolette Blaagaard argues for a rethinking of the ethical and epistemological relationship between the object of the image and the spectator. In the light of new media imageries, she argues, the boundaries between the roles of producer of images, the spectator and the object of images blur and force us to think towards a theory of post-human viewing or spectatorship. Applying classic texts of photography theory to mobile phone generated news footage of the death of Neda Agha-Soltan in 2009, Blaagaard asserts that what Barthes called ‘traumatic images’ still applies to our relationship with mobile phone footage today, in ways that may not just undermine traditional processes of interpretation, as many would argue, but also, in fact, allow for a confirmation of long-standing conceptions of reality and authenticity.</p>
<p>As a whole, the issue hopes to introduce a variety of dynamic approaches to the study of images, which, whilst abandoning the unnecessary scepticism of earlier positions, seek to maintain a critical spirit towards the powerful effects of photography and to illustrate the variety of practices, contexts and histories within which visual representation emerges and acquires its multiple meanings in our intensely mediated public culture.</p>
