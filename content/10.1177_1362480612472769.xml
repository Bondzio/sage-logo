<p>Increasingly encountered in various institutions, biometric technologies promise safety and security and claim to be ushering in a new era of certain identification and verification. Biometrics, ‘the science of using biological information for the purpose of identification or verification’ (p. 21), includes digital fingerprinting, iris scanning, voice recognition and facial recognition. But do biometrics function as claimed? At what public cost are they deployed? Whom do they disadvantage, especially when they fail? If ‘[h]uman bodies are not biometrifiable’ (p. 2), the failure of biometrics would seem to demand consideration, and this is what this excellent book does. Using an approach influenced by Michel Foucault and Donna Haraway, Magnet explores the failure of biometrics and its consequences through case studies. Magnet argues biometric failure is ‘endemic’ to its functioning (p. 6) and that this failure is intimately linked to systemic inequalities. Thus, she notes how these technologies often cannot adequately check visually impaired persons’ irises or recognize people with voice disorders, which can have devastating effects on people’s lives (p. 5). A central concept deployed throughout is ‘corporeal fetishism’, the notion that biometrics transform bodies into ‘things-in-themselves’ (p. 4) that become uncoupled from any cultural understandings of race, class, gender, sexuality and ability. These ‘things’ become commodities that primarily benefit the industry that creates them, and also the neoliberal advocates who arrange their purchase with public funds as politically expedient, but hopelessly inefficient, solutions to social problems.</p>
<p>Magnet documents the various ways these technologies fail. Sometimes they are fooled by moving one’s head back and forth to avoid facial recognition, by placing water on a scanner, by offering an iris image for scanning rather than an iris or by using a severed, dead body part to fit an appropriate device (p. 27). Other technologies have unacceptably high error rates or fail in other ways. But, crucially, Magnet argues these technologies do not merely fail; they fail in particular directions, at public expense, and to the detriment of particular groups of people. Their design tends to be based on the able-bodied, middle-class, middle-aged male; those outside privileged categories end up being systematically misidentified or unverified, with detrimental consequences, such as being restricted from timely access to essential services or preferred spaces (p. 45). Thus, working class people with fingerprints worn down from manual work or people who cannot be discretely classified as man or woman thus become system failures (p. 48). More generally it is demonstrated how biological assumptions about identity and the idea that bodies are fixed, rather than ever-mutating, are built into these technologies. This tends to reproduce unequal treatment or discrimination despite claims by advocates of the opposite effect, that replacing human discretion with ‘neutral’ technologies will prevent practices such as racial profiling.</p>
<p>The bulk of the book comprises three case studies, mostly in a US context, of biometric deployments in the prison system, in the welfare system and on the Canada/US border. Magnet identifies something of a migration of these technologies across these domains. For each realm she suggests the technologies succeed even when they fail (pp. 67, 89) in that despite their ineffectiveness and detrimental effects, they generate massive profits for a growing biometrics industry and help further neoliberal political agendas (p. 89). Thus, one chapter explores the historical development of biometric technologies and their use in relation to the expansion of the ‘prison industrial complex’ in the US. The author elaborates how biometrics intensified criminalization of disadvantaged groups based on class and race, all while generating hefty biometric industry profits: vulnerable captive bodies were ‘spun into gold’ (p. 67). Biometrics’ introduction into welfare systems began in earnest in the 1990s and, like the prison system, welfare became a profitable market. But Magnet casts serious doubt on claims of increased efficiencies due to prevention of fraud and shows these technologies’ integration into welfare systems coincided with increasing criminalization of the poor. After 9/11, biometrics entered border practices in earnest, including the previously less fortified US-Canada border, which is taken up in the third case study. Biometrics became a neoliberal response to shifting US government perceptions of Canada as a white settler society friend, to Canada as a ‘terrorist haven’ (p. 99), due to its lax immigration and refugee policies (p. 100). The border suddenly had to be fortified and this came with potentially detrimental effects on some groups and a staggering cost: ‘billions of dollars’ (p. 120). These three studies are followed by a chapter that explores representations of biometric technologies. Here the author shows how film, television and other formats depict these technologies as flawless. Such representations, Magnet argues, help grease the wheels of biometric industry marketing, ultimately permitting wider adoption of these technologies.</p>
<p>Criminologists will find the chapters on biometric technologies in an expanding US prison system and within welfare systems to identify fraudsters of immediate relevance. But, to reiterate, this book is much less a study of biometric technologies in prisons and welfare systems, as it is a study of their <italic>failure</italic>. And it is Magnet’s interrogation of failure that makes this book so compelling. She elaborates this ‘impoverished language’, showing how failures are consistently dismissed as exceptional glitches rather than recognized as deeply embedded in a world rife with systemic inequalities and discrimination. This is suggestive for future research on technologies in criminal justice systems and realms of criminalization and, I would argue, also for the sociology of governance more broadly, where failure has been a long standing focus in principle (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1362480612472769">Lippert and Stenson, 2010</xref>). There are intriguing implications for the surveillance studies literature too. Rather than focusing on privacy or social sorting exclusively, by attending to failure this study adds a new analytical dimension when unearthing relationships between surveillance technologies, inequality, and democracy, and in this way moves that literature forward. Her provocative questioning of taken-for-granted assumptions, for example, about the increased efficiency and cost effectiveness of moving from analog to digital surveillance technologies is an important contribution. To be sure, in places in the chapters on border practices and representation in particular, I would have welcomed more empirical attention to actual effects, although this is often difficult to achieve due to limited access and may still be coming in the author’s future studies. Overall, Magnet’s critique of biometric discourse and technologies is penetrating, relentless and often devastating. This is an enlightening, exquisitely critical book that should be required reading as much for neoliberal policy-makers considering quick-fix technological solutions to systemic social and crime control problems as for students and scholars of criminology.</p>
