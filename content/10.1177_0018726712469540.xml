<p>This study addresses discrimination that individuals who wear religious attire encounter during the hiring process. We build from the relational demography literature and contemporary research on discrimination in the workplace to propose possible discriminatory effects against Hijabis (Muslim women who wear the headscarf). Specifically, we conduct a field experiment in which confederates portraying Hijabis or not applied for jobs at stores and restaurants. Evidence for formal discrimination (job call backs, permission to complete application), interpersonal discrimination (perceived negativity, perceived interest), and low expectations to receive job offers in the workplace was found for Hijabi confederates. Furthermore, Hijabis were less likely to receive call backs when there was low employee diversity compared to when there was high employee diversity. Implications of these findings with regards to Hijabis and organizations are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Certain individuals in various religious groups don religious attire. Religious attire refers to clothing and/or symbols that members of various religious groups wear either to reveal their religious identity (i.e. Star of David) and/or to fulfill perceived religious obligations (i.e. Sikh turban, Muslim headscarf). Because religious attire might be considered by some individuals as mandated by one’s faith, it is not uncommon for religious attire accommodations to be requested in the workplace. In a major study of US organizations containing 10,000 or more employees conducted by the Society of Human Resource Management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0018726712469540">SHRM, 2001</xref>), 50 percent of organizations received requests for religious attire accommodations when an employee’s religious practices conflicted with the dress code. Although Title VII of the US Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires employers to reasonably accommodate such religious practices of employees or prospective employees, these requests are not always met. In a sample of US employees who reported requesting accommodations regarding their religious attire, only 33 percent reported being offered such accommodations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0018726712469540">SHRM, 2001</xref>). This disparity between employee requests and employer accommodations signals concerns regarding potential discrimination against those who don religious attire.</p>
<p>In addition, the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712469540">EEOC, 2011</xref>) reveals that religious-based discrimination claims in the USA have nearly doubled over the last decade and have risen four times more rapidly than any other protected category under the US Civil Rights Act of 1964. This is especially disconcerting for individuals who wear religious attire given that their visibility might make them even more susceptible to discrimination in the workplace (i.e. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726712469540">Goffman, 1963</xref> for review). Because of their visibility, these individuals might be treated differentially during the recruitment and selection processes, be subjected to biases in performance appraisals, receive lower pay, experience negative treatment from others, and lack opportunities for advancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0018726712469540">Stone et al., 1992</xref>). Such discrimination can also be costly to organizations, not just in terms of the low organizational commitment, poor job performance, and high turnover rates on the part of the stigmatized individuals but also the legal repercussions and negative publicity that organizations might face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726712469540">Avery et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726712469540">James and Wooten, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Even though the evidence of discrimination in the form of numbers of complaints and lawsuits suggests that religious discrimination is on the rise in the USA, very few experimental studies exist to systematically examine what leads to such discrimination in the workplace (for exceptions see studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726712469540">Ghumman and Jackson, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726712469540">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0018726712469540">King and Ahmad, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0018726712469540">Unkelbach et al., 2010</xref>). Accordingly, management researchers should consider this to be a topic of concern and seek to explore how discrimination against individuals who wear religious attire may manifest itself in actual hiring settings.</p>
<p>The overarching purpose of this study is to utilize a field methodology to investigate the extent to which individuals wearing religious attire encounter discrimination during the hiring process and the effects on their expectations regarding employment, while controlling for other potential contributing factors (e.g. attractiveness, dress, ethnicity, or qualifications). In addition to extending the relatively small body of employment research on religious discrimination, this study also contributes to a growing focus on broader definitions of discrimination in the workplace. Because legal and social norms in the USA today prevent people from showing outright differential treatment of stigmatized individuals, traditional forms of discrimination may be less common than other forms of discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726712469540">Brief and Hayes, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726712469540">Cortina, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726712469540">Dipboye and Halverson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018726712469540">Dovidio and Gaertner, 1998</xref>). However, relatively little research exists that documents these subtle forms of discrimination, especially in the context of religion. Accordingly, this study goes beyond measuring overt forms of discrimination (formal discrimination) against individuals who wear religious attire to assess more contemporary subtle and not necessarily illegal forms of discrimination (interpersonal discrimination) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712469540">Hebl et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>A secondary purpose of this study is to examine an understudied group, Muslims, at a point in time at which viewpoints towards them are especially salient in the US culture. In light of the negative stereotypes and perceptions of Islam after 11 September 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726712469540">Asani, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0018726712469540">Shaheen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0018726712469540">Srivastava, 1987</xref>), it has become increasingly important to develop an empirically-based understanding of discrimination against Muslims. More specifically, this research focuses on Muslim women who wear the headscarf (Hijabis) as the headscarf can be used to clearly identify Muslims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726712469540">Ahmed, 1992</xref>). While previous research on Hijabis involves self reports of their attitudes and experiences in workplace settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726712469540">Ghumman and Jackson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0018726712469540">Syed and Pio, 2010</xref>) and has examined Hijabi’s workplace experiences in experimental lab settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726712469540">Ghumman and Jackson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0018726712469540">Unkelbach et al., 2010</xref>), true field experiments on this topic are lacking. Consequently, it is possible that previous research on this topic may have over- or underestimated true rates of discrimination against Hijabis in workplace contexts. Accordingly, this study goes beyond self-report data on attitudes towards Muslims and explores behavioral evidence of employment discrimination against Hijabis.</p>
<p>With these two primary research objectives, we contribute to the limited literature on religious discrimination by examining direct evidence of discrimination of religious-attire via a field experiment. Whereas the majority of previous studies on this topic has primarily been limited to EEOC complaints and self-reports on attitudes, relatively few experimental studies exist. As such, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0018726712469540">Landy (2008)</xref> called for ecologically valid research designs such as field experiments to ascertain more clearly the levels of stereotyping and discrimination in actual work settings. We answer this call and fill this gap in the literature by conducting an initial field experiment and more accurately measuring the true extent to which discrimination occurs. In doing so, our study also adds value to previous studies on religious discrimination by examining the various manifestations of discrimination today, rather than just limiting the study of discrimination to traditional, overt forms of discrimination. Such particular attention to the nature of the discrimination is both conceptually and empirically important in understanding discrimination in the contemporary workplace because it informs future research that different aspects of discrimination should not be ignored by management scholars. Lastly, but not to be overlooked, we examine an understudied group in the discrimination literature, Hijabis. Given the rise of tension resulting from the increasing presence of Muslims in the western landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726712469540">Cainkar, 2002</xref>), it is important for research to attempt to gain a deeper understanding of contemporary social issues concerning discrimination in the workplace and to provide new insights regarding the experiences of this particular minority group as they navigate the American work context.</p>
<p>Below, we review the extant literature on religious discrimination in the workplace and explain why Hijabis have come to be a stigmatized group in the USA today. After our review, we draw from relational demography theory and previous research on formal and interpersonal discrimination to propose how this particular form of religious attire will lead to both formal and interpersonal discrimination and low expectations in the hiring context.</p>

<title>Religious discrimination overview</title>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726712469540">Gallup poll (2006)</xref> reveals that 80 percent of Americans say that religion is a part of their lives and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0018726712469540">SHRM (2008)</xref> reports that 64 percent of human resource professionals recognize religious/spiritual diversity among their employees. Due to the rapid increase in the non-Christian population in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726712469540">American Religious Identification Survey, 2008</xref>), there has also been a growth in the number of employees wishing to express their non-Christian religions in the western workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712469540">Estreicher and Gray, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726712469540">Huang and Kleiner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0018726712469540">Morgan, 2004</xref>) and requesting religious accommodations that may directly interfere with everyday workplace practices (i.e. grooming/dress code modifications), highlighting the need for management researchers to further explore this topic.</p>
<p>Despite the growing need, there is a relatively small body of employment research on religious discrimination. Specifically, a recent database search using the keywords ‘religious discrimination’ and ‘work’ generated only 80 peer-reviewed articles in Authority in Business Research Databases and Psychinfo, suggesting that researchers have mostly ignored this topic. Moreover, an overwhelming majority of this literature focuses on the legal strategies needed to handle religious discrimination complaints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726712469540">Cromwell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726712469540">Ettorre, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0018726712469540">Kelly, 2008</xref>) rather than explore the psychological and underlying currents for religious discrimination in the workplace.</p>
<p>There is an even smaller body of literature that addresses Muslims as a minority in workplaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726712469540">Alkhazraji, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726712469540">Ball and Haque, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726712469540">Ghumman and Jackson, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726712469540">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0018726712469540">King and Ahmad, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0018726712469540">Syed and Pio, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0018726712469540">Unkelbach et al., 2010</xref>). This is unfortunate given that the 9/11 incidences and the subsequent rise of Islamophobia in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712469540">Allen and Nielson, 2002</xref>) make this particular religious group even more vulnerable to workplace discrimination. This is evidenced by the fact that Muslims account for almost a quarter of religious-based claims filed with the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712469540">EEOC (2011)</xref>, a higher rate compared to any other religious group. Below, we discuss research specifically focused on Hijabis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0018726712469540">
<title>Stigmatization of Hijabis</title>
<p>The word <italic>hijab</italic> derives from the Arabic word <italic>hajaba</italic>, which means to cover. Consequently the word hijab can refer to wearing modest clothes in general that are in line with conservative Islamic beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712469540">Brenner, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0018726712469540">Read and Bartowski, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0018726712469540">Winter, 2006</xref>). In the Western context however, the <italic>hijab</italic> has come to more exclusively refer to the Muslim headscarf itself. There is considerable debate among religious scholars and theologians regarding the requirement of the hijab for Muslim women. Some Muslims consider the hjiab as not necessarily being essential to Islamic teachings but rather a cultural phenomenon, while others consider the hijab as a symbol of oppression that delineates gender distinctions and disadvantages Muslim women in the western context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0018726712469540">Read and Bartowski, 2000</xref>). In contrast, some Muslims consider the headscarf (hijab) as an integral part of the modest dress code for women prescribed by the Qur’an. Outside of religious reasons, an increasing number of Muslim women have also chosen to wear the hijab to publicly affirm their American Islamic identity in what they perceive to be an anti-Islamic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726712469540">Haddad, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0018726712469540">Read and Bartowski, 2000</xref>) or to reject the Western view of beauty and to gain more respect by resisting sexual objectification of oneself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726712469540">Droogsma, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In a survey conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0018726712469540">Pew Research Center (2007)</xref>, it was estimated that about 51 percent of the female Muslim population in the USA wear the hijab all or some of the time. Although no current statistics are available regarding how many women wear the headscarf worldwide, the rate is even as high as 90 percent in certain countries such as Egypt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0018726712469540"><italic>New York Times</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, several laws have been enacted or are being debated that ban the headscarf in the public arena in various European countries such as France, Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, and even predominately Islamic countries such as in Turkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726712469540">BBC News, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0018726712469540"><italic>New York Times</italic>, 2010</xref>). Given the current international arena and accounts of workplace discrimination against Hijabis in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0018726712469540">Pluralism Project, 2004</xref>), it has become increasingly important to empirically study this group in the USA.</p>
<p>Hijabis are likely to be stigmatized due to their affiliation with Muslims, a group that is often associated with negative stereotypes, attitudes, and perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726712469540">Cesari, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0018726712469540">Poynting and Mason, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0018726712469540">Sheridan, 2006</xref>). Even though Muslim females are stereotypically seen as docile, submissive, sexually chaste, religiously conservative, exotic, and oppressed, while Muslim males are stereotypically seen as being aggressive, belligerent, and hostile, it should be noted that Muslim women are not free from the common Muslim stereotypes, as Muslims in general are portrayed as evil, barbaric, backwards, terrorists, religious fundamentalists, and uncivilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726712469540">Asani, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712469540">Cole and Ahmadi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726712469540">Haddad, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0018726712469540">Shaheen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0018726712469540">Srivastava, 1987</xref>). Muslim women who wear the hijab are considered unattractive and less intelligent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0018726712469540">Mahmud and Swami, 2010</xref>), and Hijabis were subjected to more aggressive behavior in a shooter bias paradigm than non-Hijabi targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0018726712469540">Unkelbach et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0018726712469540">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, the hijab is a visible symbol of Islam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726712469540">Ahmed, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0018726712469540">Unkelbach et al., 2010</xref>). Research shows that individuals whose stigma is visible experience more discrimination than individuals with concealable stigmas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726712469540">Goffman, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712469540">Jones et al., 1984</xref>). In the religious context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0018726712469540">Moore (1986)</xref> suggested that groups with the most visibly different religious practices generally encounter the greatest discrimination among religious groups. In fact, being visually identifiable as a Muslim has been found to be the most powerful antecedent to negative behaviors against Muslims, with the hijab being identified as a primary visual identifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712469540">Allen and Nielson, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, given that there are many Muslim women who choose not to wear the hijab and do not classify it as an obligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0018726712469540">Read and Bartowski, 2000</xref>), Hijabis may come to be perceived as having a controllable stigma for actively choosing to partake in this activity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726712469540">Goffman (1963)</xref> notes that individuals who have such controllable stigmas are more likely to be subjected to stigmatization because they are perceived as being responsible for their own condition. As such, Hijabis should be expected to experience discrimination to a greater extent because not only is the headscarf visible, but also perhaps due to its perceived controllability.</p>
<sec id="section4-0018726712469540">
<title>Research on the stigmatization of Hijabis</title>
<p>Research that concerns Hijabis in the workplace is primarily limited to self-reports of experiences. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726712469540">Ghumman and Jackson (2010)</xref> found that Hijabis had relatively lower expectations for their job prospects than American Muslim women who did not wear the headscarf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0018726712469540">Syed and Pio (2010)</xref> conducted a qualitative study of the experiences of immigrant Muslim women in the Australian workplace and found that the headscarf was primarily described as a barrier for Muslim women in gaining employment. Additional qualitative research on the perceptions of Muslim women in America available from responses to open-ended questions from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726712469540">Ghumman (2006)</xref> also echoes a similar concern in that the headscarf is seen as a disadvantage when applying for work, with employers reactions to the hijab ranging from shock, awkwardness, harassment, to outright refusal to employ a woman wearing the headscarf.</p>
<p>Lab experiments on Hijabis in the hiring context are also limited and have yielded mixed results. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0018726712469540">Unkelbach et al. (2010)</xref> conducted a lab experiment of hypothetical Hijabi/non-Hijabi job applicants with a German sample and found that there was a selection bias in the acceptance rate of women who wore the Muslim headscarf, with Hijabis being rejected more quickly and accepted more slowly than women who did not wear the hijab. However, an experiment conducted in the USA comparing the perceived employability of hypothetical job applicants with different religious identifiers (Christian cross, Star of David, yarmulke, turban, headscarf) found that women who wore the hijab were rated the most employable compared to job applicants with other forms of religious identifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726712469540">Ghumman and Jackson, 2008</xref>). Thus, results from such experiments on the employability of Hijabis in the workplace are inconclusive, calling for the need for research to systematically examine the experiences of Hijabis in <italic>actual</italic> work settings.</p>
<p>Although the majority of research would suggest that Hijabis will be subjected to discrimination in the workplace, controlled field experiments on discrimination against Hijabi applicants are needed as self-reports of discrimination and lab experiments may over- or underestimate true rates of discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0018726712469540">Landy, 2008</xref>). Also, without using experimental research designs that control for confounding factors such as ethnicity, qualifications, or attractiveness, we cannot rule out that factors other than the hijab itself are the reasons for lowered hiring rates and other negative personnel outcomes. To account for such limitations, we conduct a field experiment to investigate this topic.</p>

<title>Relational demography</title>
<p>The relational demography perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0018726712469540">Tsui and O’Reilly, 1989</xref>) provides a useful framework for understanding why discrimination against Hijabis might exist in the workplace. The basic premise of the relational demography perspective is that demographic similarity to one’s workgroup results in positive work outcomes. Specifically, individuals are attracted to those who are similar to them and thus, tend to form stronger bonds with those that share similar demographic profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726712469540">Ibarra, 1995</xref>). In contrast, dissimilar others are often excluded from social networks, receive less support from their workgroup, and experience higher levels of conflict with their coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726712469540">Jehn et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0018726712469540">Pelled et al., 1999</xref>). Research on relational demography has shown considerable support that dissimilarity between individuals and their workgroup leads to less supportive work environments, repulsion, lowered interpersonal attraction and liking, and perceived discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726712469540">Avery et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0018726712469540">Rosenbaum, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0018726712469540">Tsui and Gutek, 1999</xref>). Moreover, and of interest to this study, in hiring settings, some studies have shown that recruiter-applicant demographic similarities are positively related to selection decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726712469540">Goldberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726712469540">Heilman et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0018726712469540">Rand and Wexley, 1975</xref>). Specifically, applicants who share similar demographics to their interviewers receive more favorable interview assessments and subsequent job offers than those who are demographically dissimilar (however, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0018726712469540">Sacco et al., 2003</xref> for an indication of more complex relationships).</p>
<p>Relational demography is relevant to why Muslims may be subjected to discrimination in the American workplace. Although the USA census does not track religious affiliation, estimates of the American Muslim population vary from two to seven million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726712469540">America.gov, 2008</xref>), and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726712469540">American Religious Identification Survey (2008)</xref> described the Muslim population in America as accounting for about 0.6 percent of the American population. Furthermore, according to Pew Research (2007), approximately 57 percent of the Muslim sample is employed full time or part time. As such, even though Muslims represent a relatively small proportion of the American working population, they account for almost a quarter of the religious discrimination claims filed with the USA Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712469540">EEOC, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Formal and interpersonal discrimination against Hijabis</title>
<p>Although relational demography theory predicts discrimination against certain groups and the extent to which it may occur depending on their demographic representation at work, it does not directly distinguish between the different forms of discrimination that are manifested in the workplace. Thus, to understand the different manifestations by which Hijabis experience discrimination within the hiring process, we use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712469540">Hebl et al.’s (2002)</xref> conceptualization of discrimination as two distinct forms: 1) formal discrimination; and 2) interpersonal discrimination. Formal discrimination, also known as overt discrimination, is marked by explicit negative behaviors towards a member of a stigmatized group, such as outright refusal to employ stigmatized individuals. In contrast, interpersonal discrimination is described as the subtle expression of discrimination through interpersonal nonverbal and sometimes verbal behavior. Below, these two forms of discrimination and the extent to which Hijabis might experience each of these in the hiring context are discussed in greater detail.</p>
<sec id="section7-0018726712469540">
<title>Formal discrimination</title>
<p>While subtle forms of discrimination are more prevalent because of laws and norms against discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726712469540">Brief and Hayes, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018726712469540">Dovidio and Gaertner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712469540">Hebl et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726712469540">2007</xref>), blatant forms of discrimination can still manifest in the modern workplace when both personal and group or organizational biases exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726712469540">Cortina, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726712469540">Dipboye and Halverson, 2004</xref>). That is, when individuals themselves hold conscious, explicit biases towards a particular stigmatized group (i.e. Muslims) and their groups or organizations also permit or even pressure these individuals to engage in discriminatory behaviors towards members of the biased group, formal discrimination can occur.</p>
<p>From a personal bias perspective, there is reason to believe that many Americans hold not just implicit biases but may also hold outright explicit prejudices towards Muslims, Hijabis’ super-ordinate group. Arab-looking<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0018726712469540">1</xref></sup> men have been wrongfully accused of being terrorists, mosques have been vandalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726712469540">CNN News, 2001a</xref>), and there have been attacks against women who wear the headscarf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726712469540">CNN News, 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0018726712469540">USA Today, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, individuals openly reported having higher feelings of prejudice towards Arab-Americans than any other ethnic group, including African-Americans, Asian-Americans, and Hispanic-Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726712469540">Bushman and Bonacci, 2004</xref>). In a nationwide poll conducted by Cornell University (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0018726712469540">Nisbet and Shanahan, 2004</xref>), 44 percent of Americans believed that some form of restrictions should be placed on the civil liberties of Muslim Americans. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0018726712469540">Sheridan (2006)</xref> found evidence of overt discrimination (e.g. hateful behavior) against Muslims on the grounds of their religion, in which 17.8 percent of the Muslim participants reported experiencing violent or life-threatening situations, and 36.1 percent indicated experiencing hostile behavior directed against them.</p>
<p>From a group or organizational bias perspective, although the US Civil Rights Act of 1964 clearly forbids religious discrimination and requires employers to reasonably accommodate certain minority groups, formal discrimination against Muslims is also apparent in work settings. For example, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726712469540">EEOC (2003)</xref> notes there has been a 153 percent increase in workplace discrimination claims by Muslims since the 9/11 attacks, while the frequency of discrimination claims from other groups has remained stable. Hijabis, like other Muslims, have also reported experiencing formal discrimination at work; for example, a policewoman in Pennsylvania was barred from wearing the headscarf on the job and a Hijabi applicant was denied a uniformed airline job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0018726712469540">Pluralism Project, 2004</xref>). In fact, one of the major sources of motivated abuse against Muslims identified is one’s visible membership as a Muslim, such as the hijab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712469540">Allen and Nielson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0018726712469540">Weller et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the considerable amount of research that suggests that many Americans hold explicit personal biases against Muslims, and the legal statistics from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712469540">EEOC (2011)</xref> that reveal workplace discrimination against Muslims in America, it is important to systematically measure the extent of formal discrimination that Hijabis will experience via a field experiment in the American workplace. Accordingly, we hypothesize:</p>
<list id="list1-0018726712469540" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Hijabis will experience more formal discrimination than non-Hijabis in job application contexts.</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0018726712469540">
<title>Interpersonal discrimination</title>
<p>Because US law forbids religious discrimination and requires employers to reasonably accommodate certain minority groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0018726712469540">US Civil Rights Act of 1964</xref>), more covert forms of discriminatory behavior have also emerged. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712469540">Hebl et al. (2002)</xref> theorized that in the context of someone applying for a job, certain behavioral norms are well established (e.g. avoid derogatory or stereotypic statements) while others remain ambiguous. For example, individuals are not mandated by law to make a certain amount of eye contact, to nod and make affirmative gestures, or to stand only a certain distance away from the job applicant. Because such behavioral norms contain leeway, employers may engage in interpersonal discrimination by being less cordial, more disinterested, and curt in their conversations with stigmatized individuals than they would with non-stigmatized individuals.</p>
<p>As noted before, research does suggest that subtle forms of discrimination (interpersonal discrimination) are more likely to be manifested than overt forms of discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726712469540">Brief and Hayes, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726712469540">Cortina, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726712469540">Dipboye and Halverson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018726712469540">Dovidio and Gaertner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712469540">Hebl et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726712469540">2007</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712469540">Hebl et al. (2002)</xref> reported that managers spent less time interacting and said fewer and more negative words when the confederates portrayed homosexual job applicants than when they portrayed heterosexual job applicants. Additionally, qualitative studies in the past have also alluded to Hijabis’s experiences of subtle discrimination in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726712469540">Ghumman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0018726712469540">Syed and Pio, 2010</xref>). To extend these findings, we examine whether women wearing the hijab also experience interpersonal discrimination in a field experiment. Specifically, we hypothesize:</p>
<list id="list2-0018726712469540" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Hijabis will experience more interpersonal discrimination than non-Hijabis in job application contexts.</p></list-item></list>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section9-0018726712469540">
<title>Expectations to receive job offers</title>
<p>In addition to examining the extent to which Hijabis will experience discrimination in the workplace, it is also important to examine their expectations regarding discrimination in hiring settings. The relational demography literature suggests that individuals who are not highly represented within their organization will perceive themselves as not being valued within the organization and have lower perceptions of fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726712469540">Ely, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726712469540">Kirchmeyer, 1996</xref>). Moreover, in the hiring process, low relational demography can be perceived as a reflection of employer’s engaging in hiring discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726712469540">Carrington and Troske, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0018726712469540">Reskin et al., 1999</xref>). Of direct concern to this study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726712469540">Ghumman and Jackson (2010)</xref> found that among a sample of Muslim women who were presented with hypothetical job ads, Muslim women who wore the hijab had lower expectations of receiving job offers than Muslim women who did not wear the hijab. To extend these findings to the actual hiring context, we examine whether women wearing the hijab also hold low expectations in personnel decisions in a field experiment:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section11-0018726712469540">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Data were collected from a field experiment conducted post 9/11 in the USA. Participating employees included 49 male and 63 female employees from a total of 72 retail stores and 40 restaurants in, or in the vicinity of, two shopping malls located in the Midwest. The retail stores and the restaurants and stores chosen for the study were matched across conditions to be of similar typical clientele such that they were not too upscale or expensive and primarily geared towards a low to mid-income level clientele.</p>
<p>For the role of the confederate participants, 14 female undergraduate students of working age (ages 19–22) from a Midwestern university volunteered to act as job applicants. To make sure that the results would generalize to a wide variety of Muslim women, women from several different ethnic backgrounds were chosen (6 South Asian women, 1 Middle Eastern woman, 2 Black women, and 5 Caucasian women). All confederates reported currently working or having had prior work experiences, primarily in the service/retail sectors similar to the jobs they applied for in this field experiment. Each confederate engaged in eight interactions each as job applicants by applying for jobs at eight different stores or restaurants, yielding a total of 112 trials. An additional 14 female undergraduate students (ages 18–21; 1 multi-racial woman, 2 Asian women, 11 Caucasian women) served as interaction observers for the confederate trials. Each observer was paired with one of the confederate applicants and acted as the observer for all of the confederate applicant’s eight trials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0018726712469540">
<title>Manipulation</title>
<p>For half of the trials, the confederate wore a hijab (plain black headscarf), while no hijab was worn in the other half (control condition). All applicants wore the hijab in a similar fashion in which the hijab covered the hair, ears, neck and chest. In a pilot study conducted to ensure that the hijab led to perceiving the wearer as Muslim, 70 participants were randomly shown a picture of one of two different women (South Asian and White) wearing a headscarf and asked to identify which religious affiliation the women were associated with. Participants identified the two women wearing the headscarf as Muslim, at 96.8 percent and 94.8 percent, respectively, supporting the use of the headscarf manipulation. To standardize all the interactions, in both the Hijabi and non-Hijabi conditions, all applicants dressed similarly in long-sleeve collared shirts with black slacks and a black purse. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018726712469540">Figure 1</xref> for sample pictures of the job applicants in the two conditions.</p>

<sec id="section13-0018726712469540">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Following the design of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712469540">Hebl et al. (2002)</xref>, this study utilizes similar training and data collection procedures. Both the confederates and the observers received extensive training, focused on acting professional throughout the study, acting as much to a scripted standardized manner of a job applicant (confederate role) or being a customer (observer role), and respecting the anonymity of stores/restaurants and employees. Confederates learned verbal scripts, how to enter/leave stores and restaurants, and participated in mock trials with the experimenter. Observers were trained as to how to enter stores/restaurants and to act discreetly as customers while observing the confederate, and also participated in mock trials with the experimenter. Training was deemed effective once the lead experimenter of this study was able to confirm that both confederates and observers were following the standardized script accurately while still maintaining consistency and professionalism throughout the mock trials. Additionally, confederates learned how to wear the hijab and were required to wear it in a public place for three hours to ensure that they felt comfortable with the hijab before participating in actual trials.</p>
<p>After training had been completed, the confederate/observer pairs were assigned to eight different stores or restaurants in or in the vicinity of two malls. The experimenter set a designated place to meet in the mall area so as to provide a home base station for the confederate-observer teams to begin and end each of their interactions. The confederate-observer pairs each participated in eight trials. The stores/restaurants visited were chosen randomly to be in a Hijabi or non-Hijabi condition. Depending on the nature of the service provided for the trial (i.e. retail store or restaurant), the experimenter told the confederate which specific occupation to apply for and what religious attire condition they would be in.</p>
<p>Upon the assignment of stores or restaurants to the confederate-observer team, the observers entered the store/restaurant two minutes prior to the confederate and either busied themselves with merchandise, looked through menus, or waited in the waiting area (restaurants) so as to appear unacquainted with the confederate. The observers were trained to decline help if offered by employees. The confederate job applicants entered the stores or restaurants and directly approached a store employee. Upon entering the stores, confederate applicants asked to speak to the manager, or the person in charge and asked three standard questions: 1) ‘Do you have a job position open for a______ (sales representative/waitress)?’, 2) ‘Could I fill out a job application?’, and 3) ‘What sort of things would I be doing if I worked here?’ Meanwhile, the observers used a stopwatch to time the length of the interaction between the confederate applicant and the employee from the time that the confederates started speaking with the employee to the end of the whole interaction. After each interaction, the confederate applicants returned to the home base station to fill out measures about their interaction. After the confederates left, the observers waited approximately two minutes before leaving, so as to appear unacquainted with the confederate. The observers also returned to the home base station to complete measures. During each of the interactions and until all of the trials were complete, the confederates and observers were required to not talk to each other, so as to not bias their responses.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section15-0018726712469540">
<title>Formal discrimination</title>
<p>Following the precedent established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712469540">Hebl et al. (2002)</xref>, this study utilized three objective measures of formal discrimination on a yes/no scale depending on whether the confederate applicants 1) were told a job was available, 2) were given permission to complete a job application, and 3) received a call back. For the call back measure, during a six-week period the confederates reported back to the investigator of any stores/restaurants that called them back for interviews or with job offers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0018726712469540">
<title>Interpersonal discrimination</title>
<p>Following the precedent established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712469540">Hebl et al. (2002)</xref>, interpersonal discrimination was measured by: 1) interaction length, 2) perceived negativity of the employer, and 3) perceived employer interest. To measure whether interactions were shorter for Hijabi compared to non-Hijabi applicants, observers recorded the full length of the interactions in seconds through the use of a stop watch. The items for the perceived negativity and perceived interest subscales were derived from similar field studies measuring interpersonal discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712469540">Hebl et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726712469540">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0018726712469540">King et al., 2006</xref>). Perceived negativity measured the extent to which the employee was helpful, hostile, standoffish, nervous, motivated to end the conversation prematurely, focused on their attire, and avoided eye contact. Perceived employer interest measures the extent to which the employer would be interested in them as a job candidate and perceived them as qualified job applicants. Items were on a 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much) scale and were completed by both the confederates and observers. The perceived negativity and perceived interest scales had Cronbach’s alphas of 0.82 and 0.87, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0018726712469540">
<title>Expectations to receive job offers</title>
<p>Using the two-item scale by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726712469540">Ghumman and Jackson (2010)</xref>, confederates were asked their beliefs on the likelihood of a job offer. This scale asked respondents ‘Do you think you would receive a job offer?’ and ‘Do you think you would be hired for this job?’ The scale ranged from 1 (very unlikely) to 5 (very likely), with lower scores indicating lower expectations of receiving a job offer. The scale had a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.99.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0018726712469540">
<title>Applicant consistency</title>
<p>To ensure that the applicants were not acting differently in the two different conditions, observers also completed four items on a 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much) scale regarding how relaxed, nervous, attentive, and friendly the confederate was for each trial. The scale had a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.78.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0018726712469540">
<title>Situational and organizational characteristics</title>
<p>In addition to the measures above, the investigator noted the trial number of interaction, date of interaction, and the mall in which the interaction took place (location). The confederate and observers also recorded how crowded the store was on a 1 (not crowded at all) to 5 (very crowded) scale, the diversity of employees and customers on a 1 (not diverse at all) to 5 (very diverse) scale, and the diversity of the manager (coded 0 if the manager was a white male, 1 if the manager was a minority male or a white female, and 2 if the manager was a minority female). Location of mall and the diversity of the managers, employees and customers all showed significant correlations with one or more dependent variables of interest and therefore were used as controls. Additionally, to account for applicant fatigue, trial number was also controlled. Following the precedent set by prior research using similar paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726712469540">Barron et al., 2011</xref>), the remaining situational characteristics were also used as control variables in the analysis because these characteristics may lead to differences in employer interactions with the Hijabis. For example, brevity might be more likely in a crowded store or during certain times of the day, when the employer must attend to other customers or other duties that might preclude them from having longer exchanges with applicants than normal.</p>

<p>The correlations, means, standard deviations, and internal consistency reliabilities for all of the variables are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018726712469540">Table 1</xref>. Wearing the hijab was negatively correlated with permission to complete a job application, perceived interest, expectations to receive job offers and positively correlated with perceived negativity. Job availability was positively correlated with permission to complete job application, job call back, interaction length, and expectations to receive a job offer. Perceived negativity was negatively correlated with interaction length, perceived interest, expectations to receive job offers, and with several measures of formal discrimination (job availability and permission to complete job application). Perceived interest was positively correlated with all the measures of formal discrimination (job availability, permission to complete application, job call back) and expectations to receive a job offer.</p>

<title>Initial analyses</title>
<p>To ensure that the confederates’ behavior was standardized across the Hijabi and non-Hijabi conditions, a <italic>t</italic>-test was conducted to see if there were any significant differences in behavioral consistency. There was no significant difference in applicant consistency, <italic>t</italic>(109) = 0.76, NS, between the Hijabi (<italic>M</italic> = 3.93, SD = 0.63) and non-Hijabi conditions (<italic>M</italic> = 4.03, SD = 0.63), suggesting that applicants did not act differently across the two conditions.</p>
<p>To assess agreement between confederates and observers on their ratings of interpersonal discrimination and the control variables, <italic>r<sub>wg</sub></italic> values were calculated using equations provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726712469540">James et al. (1984)</xref>. There was strong interrater agreement between confederate and observers on perceived negativity (<italic>r<sub>wg</sub></italic> = 0.97), perceived interest (<italic>r<sub>wg</sub></italic> = 0.82), diversity of manager (<italic>r<sub>wg</sub></italic> = 0.97), diversity of employees (<italic>r<sub>wg</sub></italic> = 0.70), diversity of customers (<italic>r<sub>wg</sub></italic> = 0.64), and how crowded the location was (<italic>r<sub>wg</sub></italic> = 0.80). As the statistical index of agreement for all these scales met the <italic>r<sub>wg</sub></italic> ≥ 0.60 rule of thumb required to justify aggregation of ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726712469540">Glick, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018726712469540">James, 1982</xref>), the confederate and observer ratings for all these measures were averaged within trial.</p>
<p>To assess agreement between confederates and observers on their ratings on dichotomous measures, Kappa values were calculated for job availability (κ = 0.65) and permission to complete job application (κ = 0.98). Both measures had good agreement based on rule of thumb that Kappa values between 0.60 and 0.79 are good and Kappa values at or above 0.80 are outstanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0018726712469540">Landis and Koch, 1977</xref>). However, the responses on these two formal discrimination measures were not averaged and only the confederate’s responses were used in the analysis so as to preserve the dichotomous nature of these variables and because observers were sometimes unable to record this information when they were beyond hearing distance.</p>

<title>Hierarchical linear modeling analyses</title>
<p>The hypotheses in this study exist entirely at the interaction level but the data is hierarchical in nature in that all the interaction trials are nested within individuals, such that each confederate applicant underwent eight trials each. As a result of this nesting, the observations are non-independent and because analysis of variance (ANOVA) and hierarchical regression both violate these assumptions, their usage may yield biased estimates. In contrast, hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0018726712469540">Raudenbush and Bryk, 2002</xref>) yields more conservative estimates because it specifically controls for such non-independence between observations by estimating both the between-individual and between-observation effects of religious attire on formal discrimination, interpersonal discriminations, and expectation to receive job offers. Thus, we utilized HLM to test our hypotheses.</p>
<p>At Level 1, the HLM models included interaction (observation) level data. At Level 2, data were examined at the person level controlling for non-independence of observations within individuals. A total of seven HLM analyses were conducted, six for each of the three separate measures of the two forms of discrimination (formal and interpersonal) and one for expectations to receive job offers. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0018726712469540">Table 3</xref> shows the results from the HLM analyses.</p>

<p>Hypothesis 1 predicted that Hijabis would experience more formal discrimination compared to non-Hijabis. Consistent with this hypothesis, Hijabis were significantly less likely to receive call backs than non-Hijabis (<italic>B</italic> = −1.95, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04) and significantly less likely to be given permission to complete job applications (<italic>B</italic> = −1.22, <italic>p</italic> = 0.044). However, the difference in job availability between Hijabis than non-Hijabis was not significant (<italic>B</italic> = −0.60, <italic>p</italic> = 0.239). Hypothesis 1 was partially supported.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 2 predicted that Hijabis would experience more interpersonal discrimination compared to non-Hijabis. This hypothesis was also primarily supported, as Hijabis experienced significantly more perceived negativity (<italic>B</italic> = 0.19, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) and significantly less perceived interest (<italic>B</italic> = −0.37, <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) than non-Hijabis. However, the difference in interaction length between Hijabis and non-Hijabis was not significant (<italic>B</italic> = −32.08, <italic>p</italic> = 0.681). Hypothesis 2 was partially supported.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 3 predicted that Hijabis will have lower expectations of getting a job offer compared to non-Hijabis. Consistent with this hypothesis, Hijabis had significantly lower expectations to receive a job offer than non-Hijabis (<italic>B</italic> = −0.54, <italic>p</italic> = 0.005), supporting Hypotheses 3. This finding also parallels findings regarding actual call backs.</p>

<sec id="section25-0018726712469540">
<title>Exploratory analyses</title>
<p>We also conducted exploratory tests to examine if certain organizational context factors related to discrimination. For example, interaction times were longer (<italic>B</italic> = 114.20, <italic>p</italic> = 0.027) and permission to complete an application was more likely to be given in stores with a greater diversity of employees (<italic>B</italic> = 0.83, <italic>p</italic> = 0.047). In addition, confederates were more likely to be told that a job was available when there was greater diversity of customers (<italic>B</italic> = 1.16, <italic>p</italic> = 0.006). Surprisingly, call backs were more likely to occur (<italic>B</italic> = −1.19, <italic>p</italic> = 0.034), interaction times were longer (<italic>B</italic> = −97.26, <italic>p</italic> = 0.037), and confederates had higher expectations to receive a job offer when managers were less diverse (<italic>B</italic> = −0.26, <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).</p>
<p>Because we found significant relationships between several of our control diversity variables and discrimination, we assessed whether the diversity of manager, employees and customers served as moderators of the relationship between hijab and discrimination. We found only one significant interaction, between wearing the hijab and diversity of employees on job call back (<italic>B</italic> = 4.55, <italic>p</italic> = 0.039) such that Hijabis were more likely to get call backs when they were applying to organizations with high employee diversity than when they were applying to organizations with low employee diversity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In a field experiment, we find that Hijabis experience both interpersonal discrimination in the form of greater perceived negativity and less perceived interest and formal discrimination in the form of being less likely to be given permission to complete applications and to receive call backs as compared to non-Hijabi job applicants. Additionally, we extend previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726712469540">Ghumman and Jackson, 2010</xref>) by revealing that confederate Hijabis have lower expectations of receiving job offers than non-Hijabis in actual hiring contexts. Finally, our exploratory findings reveal that the diversity of employees moderated the relationship between Hijabis and call backs such that Hijabis were more likely to receive call backs when applying to organizations with high employee diversity than when they were applying to organizations with low employee diversity.</p>
<sec id="section27-0018726712469540">
<title>Theoretical implications</title>
<p>This study contributes to existing literature on discrimination in several ways. First, evidence of discrimination in the form of numbers of complaints and lawsuits suggests that religious discrimination is on the rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726712469540">EEOC, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712469540">2011</xref>), but very few experimental studies exist to systematically examine what leads to discrimination. Moreover, previous research primarily focuses on self-reports on attitudes of Hijabis and prejudiced behaviors, which may have over- or underestimated true rates in workplace contexts. Our study serves to investigate more rigorously discriminatory behavior in actual hiring contexts through the use of a field experiment. In doing so, we also address <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0018726712469540">Landy’s (2008)</xref> concern that much of the research on stereotyping and discrimination in personnel decision making lacks ecologically valid research designs. Such findings of discrimination against Hijabis in a controlled within-subject experiment are an important addition to the literature as they show that discrimination against this group occurs when other factors (ethnicity, attractiveness, qualifications) are held constant.</p>
<p>Second, while previous studies using similar methodologies with different stigmatized groups only find evidence for interpersonal discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712469540">Hebl et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726712469540">2007</xref>), we find evidence of both interpersonal and formal discrimination in our experiment, suggesting the importance of not assuming generalizability across stigmatized groups. Formal discrimination is still very relevant and should not be overlooked by management researchers, despite the changes to the modern workplace.</p>
<p>Third, women who wear the hijab are an understudied group, with prior studies limited to self reported attitudes of discrimination or expectations of discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726712469540">Ghumman and Jackson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0018726712469540">Syed and Pio, 2010</xref>) and experimental lab settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726712469540">Ghumman and Jackson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0018726712469540">Unkelbach et al., 2010</xref>). By focusing on actual personnel decisions through the use of a field experiment, we help research to develop an empirically-based understanding of discrimination against the Muslim headscarf in the workplace today.</p>
<p>Finally, our exploratory analysis addresses how the diversity of an organization can function as a moderator between religious attire and discrimination. While diversity of employees played a moderating role suggesting that organizational context factors related to workplace diversity may negatively influence workplace discrimination, it is important to note that other diversity-related variables (diversity of customers and diversity of manager) examined in this study did not yield any significant interactions with religious attire on any of the dependent variables. The significant finding either may be due to type II error or because the relationship between diversity and discrimination is quite complex and warrants future research.</p>

<title>Practical implications</title>
<p>The findings of this study are of practical value to recruitment agencies, organizations, and Hijabis. The findings suggest that some organizations may have disproportionate hiring rates for certain stigmatized groups, and such cases of adverse impact increase the organization’s vulnerability to lawsuits. Such discriminatory practices can have negative consequences for stigmatized individuals as well. Specifically, discrimination has been shown to negatively affect personal well-being, to lower self-esteem, and to increase stress, anxiety, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726712469540">Deitch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018726712469540">Jackson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0018726712469540">Kessler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0018726712469540">Sanchez and Brock, 1996</xref>). Moreover, individuals who have been discriminated against are likely to have low organizational commitment, poor job performance and high turnover rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726712469540">Avery et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726712469540">James and Wooten, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Even in the absence of formal discrimination, interpersonal discrimination may be present in hiring settings and needs to be acknowledged. Training of individuals who have contact with job applicants does address potential discriminatory behavior by emphasizing the need to treat applicants consistently, but such training seldom addresses the forms of interpersonal discrimination studied here. Moreover, it is important to note that although interpersonal discrimination is subtle, it is not free of negative consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0018726712469540">Stone et al., 1992</xref>). For example, stigmatized individuals who experience interpersonal discrimination subsequently perform worse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0018726712469540">Word et al., 1974</xref>).</p>
<p>Both these subtle and overt negative behaviors by those who interact with job seekers can also serve as cues for what the applicants might expect should they be hired, and thus might affect their level of trust in such organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0018726712469540">Purdie-Vaughns et al., 2008</xref>). Specifically, the low expectations of Hijabis to receive job offers should be viewed with concern as previous research suggests that minorities who expect to be stigmatized against avoid such situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0018726712469540">Mendoza-Denton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0018726712469540">Pinel, 1999</xref>), which may reduce the application pool or even influence their job acceptance behavior. However, it is important to note that our finding for low expectations of Hijabis should be taken with caution as the hijab in this study was an ascribed identity, rather than a true identity.</p>
<p>Finally, in addition to the significant finding in our exploratory analyses regarding the moderating influence of diversity of employees on the relationship between religious attire and job call back, it is interesting to note the significant zero-order correlations (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018726712469540">Table 1</xref>) between both the interpersonal and formal discrimination variables and indicators of workforce diversity (customer diversity and employee diversity). These relationships suggest that more diverse organizations may be ones where discrimination is less of an issue and, consequently, organizations should strive to foster climates that promote diversity. Specifically, having formal policies in place that directly target diversity may serve to reduce discrimination in hiring settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726712469540">Highhouse et al., 1999</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section29-0018726712469540">
<title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>There are a number of strengths to this research. The use of a field experiment design enabled us to investigate more rigorously discriminatory behavior in actual hiring contexts while holding other potential factors constant (i.e. attractiveness, qualifications). Another study strength is that, by using HLM, we take into account non-independence of observations that are nested within individuals, using a more sophisticated and conservative technique than that which has been used in previous research examining formal and interpersonal discrimination in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712469540">Hebl et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726712469540">2007</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the American Religious Identity Survey (2008), American Muslims belong to a variety of different racial and ethnic groups, including Whites, Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics. Because confederates selected in this study were from various ethnic backgrounds, they were more representative of the actual population of interest and the findings are more likely to generalize to a wider variety of Muslim women who wear the headscarf, not just those of one ethnic background.</p>
<p>It is also important to acknowledge the limitations of this research. Even though confederates and observers were not directly told the purpose of the research, because wearing the headscarf was obvious to both confederates and observers, the confederates and observers may have guessed the rationale for the study. However, we measured confederate applicants’ consistency of behavior across the two conditions, and no significant differences were found, suggesting that confederates did not act differently as a result of the manipulation. Additionally, formal discrimination was more objectively assessed on a yes/no scale (e.g. applicants were told a job was available, completed a job application, received a call back) as was interaction length (i.e. measured via stopwatch) and these measures were found to correlate with the confederate and observer reports of negativity and interest (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018726712469540">Table 1</xref>), providing support for the validity of those measures. Furthermore, to reduce confederate bias, both the confederates and observers were restricted from talking to each other during the interaction so as to not influence each other’s results. However, their interrater agreements on the interpersonal measures of discrimination were high.</p>
<p>Another limitation of this study was that that not all of our measures for formal discrimination and interpersonal discrimination revealed significant differences between Hijabis and non-Hijabis. Specifically, we were unable to detect differences in interaction length although previous studies have (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712469540">Hebl et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726712469540">2007</xref>), which may be reflective of the manner in which time had been measured in this study. Previous research involved audiotaping interactions and later measuring the exact amount of time the interaction took and how many words were spoken, but legal restrictions on third party audio taping as well as ethical concerns prevented recording the interaction in our research (Michigan Compiled Laws 750.539d). Observers’ use of a stopwatch is a slightly more imprecise measure of interaction length as it does not account for interruptions and the length of the application, which varied by stores and restaurants. Additionally, our failure to detect differences in time effects might also have been due to the brevity of the confederate interactions, which on average lasted approximately 6.5 minutes. We also did not find significant differences between Hijabi and non-Hijabi confederate job applicants regarding job availability. It is plausible that the high unemployment rates at the time during which this study took place likely led to a restriction in this variable. However, despite the lack of job availability and hence low overall call back rates, Hijabis were still significantly less likely to receive a call back than non-Hijabis.</p>
<p>A final limitation of our research is that because we did not directly ask the employers their reasons behind their actions so as to not bias their behaviors, there is a potential that the discrimination may not have been targeted against the Muslim identity directly, but the employers may have had alternative motives for engaging in the differential treatment of the Hijabi applicants. For example, it is possible that employers are reacting as a result of perceived religious extremity associated with the hijab, the multiple stigmatized identities that Hijabis may have, a perceived lack of fit of the hijab with the organizational dress code, perceived discomfort of other employees and clients having to interact with a Hijabi, or a combination of all these factors. We consider each of these potential alternatives below in detail.</p>
<p>The identity management literature suggests that minorities who are highly identified with their stigmatized identity, as Hijabis are through their visible religious attire, are judged more negatively than their less identified counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726712469540">Branscombe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018726712469540">Kaiser and Pratt-Hyatt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0018726712469540">Sellers and Shelton, 2003</xref>). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726712469540">Derous et al. (2009)</xref> found that recruiters had more negative attitudes towards highly identified Arab applicants than less ethnically identified Arab applicants in a simulated hiring context. Thus, it is possible that the employers in our study were acting towards their biases on what they perceived to be religious extremity, and not necessarily a bias against the Muslim religion.</p>
<p>Also, it is important to understand that Muslim women have many other identities interwoven together (i.e. religious attire, gender, ethnicity, religion), and that these multiple forces often interact together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0018726712469540">Syed and Pio, 2010</xref>). In fact, it may be that collectively these stigmatized identities make Hijabis even more susceptible to discrimination. For example, a considerable amount of research has shown that being from a minority ethnic group can result in discrimination (i.e. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726712469540">Deitch et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, the intersectionality between hijab and ethnicity seems like a valid point to examine in this research. However, with the exception of perceived negativity, <italic>t</italic>(54) = 3.52 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, we did not find any significant effects for race on any of the dependent variables (<italic>p</italic>s &gt; .09) between Hijabis from minority ethnic groups (i.e. Black, South Asian, and Arab) and White Hijabi confederates. Surprisingly, White Hijabi confederates were actually more likely to perceive negativity from employer than minority Hijabi confederates. While our study does not show ethnicity to be a primary driver of discrimination, it is important to not discredit the idea that having multiple stigmatized identities can lead to even more discriminatory treatment and future research is needed on this topic to investigate these interactive effects of multiple stigmatized identities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it can also be argued that it is neither the Muslim identity nor the hijab, but violation of the organizational dress code that is an employer’s concern. However, simply refusing to hire a Hijabi on the basis of one’s Hijab without making a good effort to reasonably accommodate is illegal unless the employer can prove that there is undue hardship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0018726712469540">US Civil Rights Act of 1964</xref>). Also, refusing to hire a Hijabi because of concerns of oneself or others feeling ‘uncomfortable’ with the headscarf or their Muslim identity is considered legally inexcusable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726712469540">EEOC, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726712469540">Cortina (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726712469540">Dipboye and Halverson (2004)</xref> noted that whenever conditions exist that allow for differential treatment of groups to be attributed to explanations other than the stigma itself, covert discrimination tends to occur. This suggests that even alternate explanations of discriminatory behavior (e.g. organizational dress, lack of fit issues, discomfort) may also be classified as subtle discrimination.</p>
<p>In summary, because discrimination may not have been focused completely towards the Muslim identity of the Hijabis per se, it is important to state our findings modestly. Certainly, uncovering the underlying mechanisms, beliefs, and values inherent regarding why employers may show bias against Hijabi job applicants is but one potential avenue for future research, many of which we address below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-0018726712469540">
<title>Future research</title>
<p>Future research concerning the advancement of this study’s findings should examine the generalizability of these findings to other stigmatized groups. In particular, it would be interesting to see if individuals who wear religious attire from other religions (cross necklaces, yarmulkes, Hindu tilaks, etc.) are also discriminated against to the same degree as Hijabis. As noted earlier, employers may react negatively to any strong religious identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726712469540">Branscombe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0018726712469540">Sellers and Shelton, 2003</xref>). It would also be interesting to see if other religious groups who don religious attire perceived to be Islamic (i.e. Sikh men who wear the turban) are subjected to the same forms of discrimination as Hijabis, due to their resemblance to Muslims, even though this association is incorrect.</p>
<p>Future research should also examine similar and additional moderators of the relationship between religious attire and discrimination, such as looking at perceived attractiveness of job applicants and job type (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726712469540">Heilman and Sauwatari, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0018726712469540">Stewart and Perlow, 2001</xref>). Although we intentionally chose a black hijab because this color and this style of head covering is more commonly worn in the West than are other forms of religious headscarves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0018726712469540">Tarlo, 2007</xref>), given that the hijab can be worn in a variety of colors and styles, it is possible that certain color or style combinations of the hijab may be perceived as less extreme and even considered a fashion statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726712469540">BBC News, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, examining this topic in a broader comparative context and taking into account other cultures may enhance our understanding. Perhaps in certain cultures being a non-Hijabi would be subjected to discrimination, such as in a majority Islamic cultural context. While the hijab may not be quite accepted in western culture, the lack of religious attire may also not be accepted in conservative Muslim cultures.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Going beyond self-report data on negative attitudes and discrimination towards Muslims, this research builds from the relational demography perspective and contemporary theories on discrimination to demonstrate direct evidence for both formal and interpersonal discrimination and low expectations of receiving job offers among Hijabis. Furthermore, our exploratory analysis reveals that the diversity of employees moderates the relationship between wearing the hijab and receiving job call backs such that Hijabis are more likely to receive call backs when there is greater diversity among the employees of an organization. These findings highlight the need for researchers to not just continue to examine different forms of discrimination in work settings, but also to examine the low expectations that stigmatized individuals may hold and to recognize how certain contextual organizational factors (i.e. diversity of employees) can influence these relationships. Finally, these findings also make salient the importance of considering underrepresented stigmatized groups in research.</p>

<p>Arabs represent an ethnic group and may not necessarily be Muslims. Although we acknowledge this distinction, Arabs have become targets of Muslim backlash because of their misconceived affiliation with Muslims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726712469540">Cainkar, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0018726712469540">Poynting and Mason, 2007</xref>). Because these two groups are often portrayed as overlapping categories in the media, we believe that Arab discrimination is of relevance to this research.</p>
