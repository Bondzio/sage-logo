<abstract>
<p>Transfer students are a distinct population. Their characteristics lead to a qualitatively different student experience. Drawing on interviews with a cross-sectional sample of transfer students at George Mason University (GMU), this study focused on the ways transfer students perceived their social and academic engagement, on the ways they engaged academically and socially at GMU, and on the ways in which their perceptions of engagement and their actual patterns of engagement affected their sense of belonging at GMU. Most notably, transfer students viewed social engagement in the context of family and community rather than college life. The findings have implications for how campuses support transfer students and question assumptions about some engagement theories.</p>

<p>Transfer students are a significant population in many large 4-year public institutions. As the cost of a college education continues to rise, more students are beginning their college education at a local community college before transferring to a baccalaureate granting institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091552113496141">American Association of Community Colleges, 2009</xref>). Some students begin their studies at a 4-year institution and transfer to another 4-year school. Yet others have a “swirling” pattern of enrollment, attending multiple institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091552113496141">McCormick, 2003</xref>). McCormick found that among those students who transferred from a 2-year to a 4-year college, a little less than half (44%) attended two or more higher education institutions prior to transferring. These transfer students, unlike their 4-year native counterparts, are a distinct population who are often older, who are more likely to work full-time, who come from lower socioeconomic households, and who often have significant family responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0091552113496141">Office of Institutional Assessment, 2010</xref>). These characteristics lead to a qualitatively different student experience that theoretical models and conceptualizations of student success and experience need to consider. This study focuses on the ways transfer students perceive social and academic engagement as well as on the ways they engage socially and academically, once at the 4-year public institution.</p>
<p>A robust body of research supports the idea that student engagement is a critical part of student success. The empirical support for this belief is strong in traditional populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091552113496141">Astin, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091552113496141">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091552113496141">Kuh, Kinzie, Schuh, &amp; Whitt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091552113496141">Pascarella &amp; Terenzini, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091552113496141">2005</xref>). Student engagement focuses not on what students bring to college (i.e., motivation and academic preparation) but on what students do in college and how student behaviors, opportunities, and environments mediate college retention and graduation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091552113496141">Kuh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0091552113496141">Saenz et al., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091552113496141">Astin’s (1984)</xref> theory of student involvement emphasizes how student development is facilitated by participation in academically purposeful activities. On a wide range of outcome measures, more involvement leads to better outcomes including persistence, learning, and personal growth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0091552113496141">Tinto (1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0091552113496141">1993</xref>) theorized that retention can be understood in terms of a student’s integration into the social and academic environment of an institution. The more connected a student is to the social and academic fabric of a campus, the more likely he or she is to persist in college. The importance of integration and involvement in academics and life outside the classroom is shared by these perspectives.</p>
<p>Research conducted after the introduction of Astin’s and Tinto’s models has prompted revised understanding of integration and engagement. Studies focused on special populations have provided a more nuanced perspective of engagement that allows for other constructs, such as sense of belonging, to be used as proxies for engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091552113496141">Hurtado &amp; Carter, 1997</xref>). Hurtado and Carter learned that, for Latino students, perceived sense of belonging supported students’ transition to college. Studies have shown that for some populations of students, engagement does not mean giving up one’s identity and assimilating to the dominant culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091552113496141">Hurtado &amp; Carter, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0091552113496141">Tierney, 1992</xref>). Instead, participation and involvement are group-specific, selective experiences that contribute to one’s sense of being a part of a larger community.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091552113496141">Kuh et al. (2005)</xref> offered a measure of student engagement that emphasizes academic participation. Student engagement includes academic challenge, student–faculty interaction, and active and collaborative learning. Social engagement with peers is embedded in the collaborative learning construct, but the context for this connection is academic.</p>
<p>The research on student engagement is vast with strong empirical support for the reliability of each component. Perhaps most prominent is the work of Kuh and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091552113496141">2005</xref>) on the National Study of Student Engagement (NSSE) and the sister survey, the Community College Survey of Student Engagement (CCSSE), designed specifically for community college students. Yet these instruments capture the student experience as either existing in the community college or the 4-year institution and do not take into account the impact that the transfer experience may have on student engagement at the new institution. There are also a growing number of questions related to the reliability and applicability of the NSSE and CCSSE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091552113496141">Angell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0091552113496141">Jaschik, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0091552113496141">Schneider, 2009</xref>). However, the scope and widespread reliance on NSSE and CCSSE as measures of student engagement prompt close attention to their findings.</p>
<p>This study examines the experiences of transfer students at one institution of higher education, George Mason University (GMU). Historically, GMU has enrolled large numbers of transfer students each year, above 3,000, due in part to the proximity of a community college with one of the highest annual enrollments in the nation. We focus in this study on those students who transferred from community colleges, those who transferred from other 4-year institutions, and those who previously enrolled in a combination of 2- and 4-year colleges. We agree with the research that has identified nonlinear or “swirling” patterns to transfer, and we sought to focus on the transfer experience once students are at the 4-year institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091552113496141">McCormick, 2003</xref>). Recent NSSE findings note that GMU’s transfer students report low levels of participation in many student engagement measures, such as participation in cocurricular activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0091552113496141">Office of Institutional Assessment, 2010</xref>). These data illustrate a need to understand the transfer student experience on this campus with a focus on student engagement. This study strives to understand transfer student social and academic engagement. Specifically, the questions guiding this study are</p>

</list>
<p>A focus on transfer students is important given the current economic recession that has increased unemployment, led to increased enrollment at community colleges, and drawn attention to community colleges as a site for workforce development and economic renewal. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091552113496141">American Association of Community Colleges (2009)</xref>, enrollments at community colleges increased by 11.4% in the fall of 2009. Recent federal policy shifts have increased the number of individuals who have access to higher education, particularly at community colleges. President Obama’s American Graduation Initiative promotes community colleges as the pathway for workforce development and economic recovery for the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091552113496141">Obama, 2009</xref>). In addition, the revised GI Bill provides financial benefits to veterans and their families who are flocking to community colleges. Although we do not focus exclusively on community college student transfers, the increased attention, federal support, and access to community colleges will eventually lead to more students seeking to transfer to universities, including students who transfer from a variety of institutions before receiving a bachelor’s degree.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>To guide our understanding of the transfer experience, this study embraces the framework of student engagement developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091552113496141">Kuh et al. (2005)</xref> and the literature on transfer student engagement. For Kuh et al., engagement is indicated by the investment students make in their college experience in terms of academic challenge, student–faculty interaction, and active and collaborative learning. <italic>Academic challenge</italic> is the “amount of time and effort students devote to (1) studying and other academic work, (2) preparing for class, (3) reading assigned and other books, and (4) writing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091552113496141">Kuh et al., 2005</xref>, p. 45). This characterization of academic challenge includes challenges through the entire academic experience, from orientation to graduation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091552113496141">Kuh et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>Student–faculty interaction</italic> includes connections inside and outside the classroom such as discussions about career plans, work on research projects, and conversations about course readings. Increased interaction with faculty members has been consistently found to positively affect student retention and persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091552113496141">Braxton, Milem, &amp; Sullivan, 2000</xref>). The third component of student engagement includes <italic>active and collaborative learning</italic> that involves both the individual student’s application of learned material in varied situations as well as his or her interaction with peers to solve problems and carry out tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091552113496141">Kuh et al., 2005</xref>). This type of learning involves classroom response or discussion along with group work and has a positive relationship with student persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091552113496141">Braxton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091552113496141">Terenzini, Springer, Pascarella, &amp; Nora, 1995</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-0091552113496141">
<title>Community College Student Engagement</title>
<p>Much of the literature on student engagement at community colleges relies on the model developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091552113496141">Kuh et al. (2005)</xref>. For example, the comprehensive work of the Center for Community College Student Engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091552113496141">CCCSE, 2010</xref>) asserts that engagement is an important predictor of persistence. The Community College Survey of Student Engagement, which the CCCSE administers, refers to engagement as participation in activities that are considered educationally meaningful and includes items that specifically measure student perceptions of the “time and energy” spent on these activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091552113496141">McClenney, 2007</xref>). CCCSE benchmarks—active and collaborative learning, student effort, academic challenge, student–faculty interaction, and support for learners—have exhibited a positive relationship with persistence. Another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091552113496141">Borglum &amp; Kubala, 2000</xref>) supports the relationship between academic and social engagement within the community college population. Borglum and Kubala found that community college students who felt academically integrated also felt socially integrated. The authors speculated that because community college students aspire to transfer, they may have little desire to participate in extracurricular, or more socially oriented, activities. Their study showed that community college students remained on campus only to attend classes and were more goal driven.</p>
<p>Other results from CCCSE studies focusing on specific student groups have noted that high-risk students are more likely to be engaged than students in comparison groups. At-risk or high-risk students need to “put forth more effort in attempting to compensate for a pervasive combination of academic and institutional barriers to education success” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091552113496141">Greene, Marti, &amp; McClenney, 2008</xref>, p. 529); for example, they need to travel a greater distance to receive the same results as their low-risk peers. In addition, full-time and part-time students exhibit differing levels of engagement. Part-time students are significantly less likely to interact with instructors, make class presentations, or work with other students in or outside of class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091552113496141">Greene et al., 2008</xref>). Age also factors into the engagement of community college students. First-year students who are above the age of 25 engage in more purposeful activities than younger students, and the correlation between engagement and the quality of relationships is consequently higher for these older students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091552113496141">Gibson &amp; Slate, 2010</xref>). Differences in student engagement exist for community college students of color. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091552113496141">Swigart and Murrell (2001)</xref> found that African American community college students get greater gains from effort in class assignments and discussion and from using campuses services, such as the library. Students of color reported higher levels of student engagement overall in another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091552113496141">CCCSE, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Transfer Student Engagement</title>
<p>What does engagement look like for transfer students enrolled in a 4-year university? The literature on student engagement for this population is thin. Most of the literature focuses on the factors that lead students to transfer, not their experiences once attending the 4-year institution. One study that focused on the success of transfer students at a 4-year university found that they may not make as many social connections because they are often much older than their peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0091552113496141">Townsend &amp; Wilson, 2006</xref>). Community college students are accustomed to seeing the classroom as a site for social and academic engagement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091552113496141">Ishitani and McKitrick (2010)</xref> compared community college transfer students on one 4-year campus with students who began their college experience at that institution and learned that the former were less engaged in the 4-year college. When the students transferred (e.g., as sophomores or juniors) also affected the nature of their involvement (students who transferred later were less engaged), enrolling part-time was found to be negatively connected to engagement. Although transfer students’ scores on measures of social engagement may be lower by traditional definitions of engagement, these students may still feel a high level of engagement. However, several studies support conventional wisdom about engagement; the more students are involved, both academically and socially, the more successful they are in their transfer transition and the better the overall student experience will be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091552113496141">Flaga, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091552113496141">Laanan, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, the research on student engagement in higher education is vast with many empirical studies that support the basic premise of academic and social engagement promoted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091552113496141">Kuh et al. (2005)</xref> as well as by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091552113496141">Center for Community College Student Engagement (2010)</xref>. Community college students generally have less focus on social engagement and rely more on the classroom as the site for engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091552113496141">Borglum &amp; Kubala, 2000</xref>). They are also more “at-risk” for persistence due to their demographic characteristics and their work and family responsibilities. Studies of transfer students in the 4-year university are few but also indicate that students who transfer from community colleges tend to perceive of engagement as being related primarily to academic support. Interestingly, <italic>sense of belonging</italic> as a construct is not addressed directly in these national surveys, but may be relevant to the students’ lived experiences. Following the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0091552113496141">Townsend and Wilson (2006)</xref>, we sought to examine the definition and behaviors of academic and social engagement from the student perspective.</p>

<title>Research Design</title>
<p>To examine and understand student engagement among transfer students at a 4-year university, we conducted a single institution study to learn more about transfer student experiences. Data primarily included 31 interviews.</p>
<sec id="section5-0091552113496141">
<title>Description of Site</title>
<p>GMU is a large 4-year, primarily residential research university that was founded in 1972. The current enrollment totals more than 30,000 students with a small, but growing graduate population. The institution prides itself on being innovative, collaborative, and highly diverse in terms of ethnicity, religion, and country of origin. GMU is located in northern Virginia within the District of Columbia metropolitan area. The transfer student population at GMU is large with more than 3,000 transfer students each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0091552113496141">Office of Institutional Research and Reporting, 2012</xref>). Many of the transfer students originate from Northern Virginia Community College, one of the largest community colleges in the country.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0091552113496141">
<title>Identification and Recruitment of Participants</title>
<p>A cross-sectional sampling design was used to select transfer students from across the university. This approach allowed us to understand students’ experiences during their initial year of transfer as well as during subsequent years, thereby providing a more accurate picture of each transition phase as students adjust to the university. We requested e-mail addresses of transfer students who had matriculated to the university in the past 3 years. We received a random sample of 250 e-mail addresses for each of the four groups in the cross-sectional design: second semester at the university; second year at the university; third year at the university; and fourth year at the university. All of these randomly selected students (<italic>N</italic> = 1,000) were invited to participate. To increase the number of study participants, we also sent a recruitment e-mail message to the 270 members of the Tau Sigma National Honor Society for transfer students. Our intention was to target a specific group of transfer students who were likely engaged on the campus and who were academically successful.</p>
<p>We interviewed the 31 students who volunteered from the initial e-mail recruitment and from the e-mail recruitment of the Honor Society members. Of these 31 students, 3 were in their second semester at GMU, 22 were in their second year, and 6 had been at GMU for 3 or more years; 4 were members of the Honor Society. Each participant completed a brief demographic questionnaire prior to one-on-one, semistructured interviews to assure that the students were diverse in terms of racial backgrounds, gender, part-time versus full-time employment, and residential versus commuter status. We also used the demographic survey to ensure that we interviewed students from each of the four groups in the cross-sectional design. This goal necessitated a weekly updating of a spreadsheet of all demographic information and an analysis of the total number of interviews in each group (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0091552113496141">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>One-on-one semistructured interviews provided the primary data for this study. Each participant was interviewed once for approximately 45 min. The interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. The interview questions and prompts focus on three key themes: (a) educational experiences prior to and at the 4-year university, including academic preparation; (b) transition from the previous institution to the 4-year university; and (c) perceptions of academic and social engagement. Questions included the following: Describe your educational experience prior to transferring to GMU (e.g., What was your previous school? Was it academically challenging?). Did your previous institution prepare you for the transfer experience? In what ways? Describe your transition to GMU. How do you spend your time outside of class? Do you have relationships with faculty such that you could comfortably ask someone for a letter of recommendation? Do you fit in at GMU—why or why not?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0091552113496141">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Consistent with methodological norms of qualitative inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0091552113496141">Mertens, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0091552113496141">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990</xref>), the systematic coding of texts (i.e., interview transcripts) served as the primary means of data analysis. All three researchers engaged in open and axial coding of the texts to identify themes. We focused on how the students defined social and academic engagement as opposed to using the definitions in the literature. Analysis included examinations for patterns related to race, gender, age, sexuality, and social class. Additionally, analysis focused on the ways that the transfer students engaged themselves socially and academically in the 4-year campus, experienced academic preparation and challenge, and, in general, navigated the transition to a new university context. Included in our analysis was attention to potential differences between students who enrolled in 2- and 4-year institutions prior to transferring to GMU and between those who were members of the Tau Sigma National Honor Society and those who were not. We did not find differences across these groups and, therefore, do not make distinctions in the presentation of our findings.</p>

<sec id="section9-0091552113496141">
<title>Trustworthiness</title>
<p>We took several approaches to ensure trustworthiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0091552113496141">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 2000</xref>). First, we engaged as a research team to discuss our insights and analysis. Each team member read and coded transcripts, discussed interpretations of codes, and then recoded the transcripts based on revised, mutually understood and agreed-upon interpretations of the codes. Second, we sought disconfirming cases for the trends that were emerging. If a pattern was identified, we speculated about the subset of our participant pool for which this pattern would perhaps not hold true and examined the pattern with this exception in mind. By seeking negative cases, we enhanced the credibility of the findings. Third, having multiple researchers provided an internal audit system for the analysis. When we shared our respective analyses, other team members asked questions to clarify process and interpretation, thereby enhancing dependability and confirmability.</p>

<sec id="section10-0091552113496141">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Several limitations to the research design affect the study conclusions. First, this study is situated in a single institution and is not intended to be generalized to transfer students at other institutions of higher education. However, there are lessons to be learned from this study, which are highlighted in the discussion section of this article. Second, the student perspectives in this study do not represent all students. Although we strived to achieve a diverse group of participants, not all students could be included. Finally, there are variables of interest that we did not collect; for example, we did not determine whether students were enrolled in their academic program full-time or part-time. This variable may have intersected with the findings to offer an alternative explanation of the results.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section11-0091552113496141">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine how the transfer students at one institution defined and participated in academic and social engagement as well as how their definitions of engagement and their participation affected their sense of belonging and perceived level of engagement. The findings are organized to respond to each research question.</p>
<sec id="section12-0091552113496141">
<title>Definition of and Participation in Social Engagement</title>
<p>The transfer students viewed social engagement as interacting with others broadly both inside and outside the university. Overwhelmingly, students viewed engagement as important to their experiences and viewed support structures outside of the university as contributing to their success in college. Those structures consisted of family, mentors, colleagues, church, and other community-based groups, not peers, faculty members, and student affairs professionals who are traditionally conceptualized as sources of social engagement in the literature. Russell, a 27-year-old junior stated
<disp-quote>
<p>But my wife and my family are very supportive and even my in-laws are very supportive. . . . [S]ometimes I have to sacrifice things in order to study or to go to a program or whatever and they understand that, they get that, so they’re very supportive of that . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And, Julia, a 27-year-old junior valued the support from her spouse:
<disp-quote>
<p>My husband . . . is constant encouragement and nurturing and telling me how smart he thinks I am and wants to know everything I’m learning. He even questions things to get conversation going, so he’s been an amazing partner in this whole thing. Even when I doubt myself, he’s always there; really supportive, healing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Family members and friends within organizations, such as church groups, played a significant support role by building students’ self-efficacy in academic work and reducing barriers, such as time for study. These individuals provided encouraging words, read drafts of papers, or provided child care that allowed the transfer students to continue their studies. This kind of support was particularly important because many of the transfer students were older and had family obligations outside of their college experiences. When those obligations became support structures, as opposed to barriers, students felt able to succeed in their academic work.</p>
<p>Another source of student engagement discussed by the study participants derived from activities in the community, such as church functions. Similar to family, these activities served as sources of support and created a sense of community. While they did not technically take place in an academic context, they were identified by transfer students as examples of social engagement. More importantly, their interactions with individuals outside of the college were connected to their academic experiences and kept them engaged in intellectual life. Ted, age 35, commented
<disp-quote>
<p>Yes, I do a lot of volunteer work for human rights campaign and . . . it’s a church I’m kind of affiliated with. I’m not particularly religious any more but they provide a lot of opportunity to do good things . . . There’s a church in Arlington that I kind of hang out with whenever they do something—soup kitchen, food drive, I help out then. And I’m on the [homeowner’s association] community board . . . We got approval for a new park and stuff like that. So I stay busy with that stuff . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The transfer students saw social, community-based events as social engagement and framed these experiences as learning opportunities. The transfer students were often limited in their ability to attend events on campus due to work schedules and other obligations. For 30-year-old Bob, work and personal responsibilities prompted a narrower focus on the academic sphere: “I don’t really participate in any of the organized stuff outside of the classroom.” Alyssa, age 23, concurred:
<disp-quote>
<p>I mean I haven’t really looked for any [clubs] and the ones I’m interested in, I notice it’s either during a class or when I’m at work, so it’s the downfall of taking so many classes and working so much. But you do what you have to do.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite tight schedules, the transfer students were interested in and valued social engagement and learning. Julia, a 27-year-old junior, described the tension:
<disp-quote>
<p>If I was talking to a younger person just starting school, developing friendships on your own and going to events, ’cause I wish I didn’t work. There are so many cool events here. I’m just like, dang it. But there are a lot of really cool things around here beyond George Mason to get learning because we live in such a great environment in the DC area. I mean you can just take a metro ride and see the things you’re learning about in class. And the museums or go to the lectures from visiting professors. So I say making the world your learning environment and not just making George Mason your university.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus engagement was valued, but participation may not have been on campus. Personal relationships and the richness of the region offered a range of involvement opportunities for students. The students made the intellectual connection between their learning in the college environment and the opportunities provided by church events, museums, and other forms of social connections that can be made outside the structure of the college but within the intellectual work of academic life.</p>
<p>A few transfer students in the study defined social engagement in ways that were consistent with more formal and traditional notions of student participation. Erik, age 21, found connections via traditional outlets: “Last semester I rushed fraternity and I felt like that really opened the door to being social and having an outlet other than just coming to campus, taking classes, and going home which is what I did last fall.” Four study participants were members of the transfer student honor society. For these students there was some formal involvement in a student group. This participation helped them make a social connection and feel a sense of engagement; however, these students were an exception in the sample, and they were often younger. The majority of the students in our study lived at home (with parents or a spouse) and maintained a full- or part-time job to support their studies. Paul, age 22, explained a common concern, “I’ve just been busy with work, so there’s no other—I can’t really find any other clubs to join.”</p>
<p>Even students who engaged socially with traditional forms of campus-based groups rarely embraced it as essential to their transition or success. They did not see participation in formal GMU-related groups as the only form of engagement. Erik, the 21-year-old fraternity member noted this capacious idea of involvement: “It doesn’t have to be a Greek organization, obviously, but something that is a group of people that you like hanging out with and just finding that right outlet.” Additionally, Peter, a 30-year-old junior, noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>I mean, I’m here and I have kids and when I’m done with my classes, I go home, in between classes I go home and I’m reading a book. And so the social aspect of college life is really not what I’m here for.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Social engagement inside the college was viewed broadly. A few transfer students enjoyed the traditional forms of engagement—residence halls and Greek life—and saw those activities as part of their social network. An impromptu meeting with peers or a conversation in class was also considered a part of social engagement for these students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0091552113496141">
<title>Definition of and Participation in Academic Engagement</title>
<p>The transfer students in this study expressed a respect for academic engagement. They viewed academic engagement as a strict focus on academic activities that include meaningful connections with faculty members as well as academic challenge and learning. Meaningful relationships with faculty members included interactions within the context of a course, as explained by Peter, age 30: “I feel like I’ve been able to relate to the professors and engage with them in a meaningful way in order to get more out of their classes.” Yet, other meaningful relationships with faculty members extended beyond the classroom (especially for older students). The experience of Ted, age 35, is illustrative:
<disp-quote>
<p>But yeah, after the class is over, I’ve met with a bunch of professors outside of class just to hang out. Some of them have met my wife. I’ve developed a bond with [several faculty] when we went to Liberia over the summer [to study]. So that was a month of intense emotional stuff, so they are very close. So yeah, but most professors I’ve had are very friendly and there’s no reason not to have a relationship with them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nonetheless, the transfer students in this study did not overwhelmingly interact with faculty members outside of class. They often noted attending office hours and asking questions via e-mail. These interactions were not considered academic engagement; rather, the students viewed these behaviors as part of course taking. However, students felt a heightened sense of engagement when faculty members created opportunities for more meaningful interactions. Examples include Ted’s trip, extensive comments on writing, or instances in which faculty members went beyond student expectations, paying special attention to their progress or regularly assisting with learning the material outside of class. In addition to connections with faculty members, transfer students conceptualized academic engagement as related to challenge and learning. Study participants were academically engaged when they found their academic work intellectually challenging. The importance of academic challenge was expressed by Julia, a 27-year-old junior:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t feel like I’m wasting my time and doodling through class and jumping through the hoops to get the grade and move forward. I feel like I’m actually getting a brain workout. I love this campus. I love how it looks and how it feels, the campus environment.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Dustin, a 23-year-old junior, and John, a 21-year-old senior, gave specific examples of this challenge. Dustin was surprised by but appreciative of the feedback faculty members provided on his writing:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve historically done really well with papers but I got like my—it wasn’t my first paper back but one of my first papers I was kind of shocked to see that my arguments weren’t as strong as I’d been led to believe from the instructors at [my community college] who I guess didn’t expect as much or something . . . I’ve kind of stepped things up a notch.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This form of challenge was related to his overall academic engagement. John, too, encountered a demanding faculty member and considered that encounter beneficial to his learning and engagement:
<disp-quote>
<p>He [the professor] told everyone in the very beginning, “you’re going to need a very thick skin to get through this class, and we’re going to write short essays, but I’m going to read through every one of them and critique them completely. I’m not just going to skim them and give you slight insights. You’re going to get the full blown everything. Everything will happen to your essay that’s possible.” . . . I did have to adapt and grow a very thick skin to get through this class and try and adapt. And that particular experience really did make a serious difference in how I approach essays, approach research, approach my projects in general, even reading that that class really did shake me at the foundation. And it was absolutely for the better.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Significant and constantly high levels of academic challenge led to increased engagement and identification with the campus community. These activities included a course with high expectations for written work, significant and intellectual readings, and faculty members who stated clearly that their expectations are high. Ted, 35, described the significance of faculty expectations as leading to engagement:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t mind being challenged. But he came into that class first day and guns a-blazing. He was ready to go. He was telling us and told us in an email before the class that it was going to be hard. And I’m fine with that. I worked well. Lots of reading.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This student went on to explain that another section of the course was offered and had an open slot. That section was viewed as easier; it involved less reading and lower expectations. The student stayed with the challenging section and reflected, “I probably learned more, and it was a great experience.” The transfer students sought out academically challenging experiences to learn more and to feel intellectually (and academically) engaged.</p>
<p>Academic engagement was also defined in contrast to social engagement. Part of the definition given by students is linked to a devaluing of social activities. The transfer students were concerned that social activities would be a distraction from academic work. Many of the participants viewed academic engagement as their primary function and viewed social activities as meaningful only if they contributed to the central purpose of college: classes. From living on campus to participation in social groups, the transfer students considered their options for engagement within their desire for a strict focus on their academic work. Janice, a 21-year-old transfer student from Virginia Tech stated, “I would not really want to live on campus because of the distractions.” Janice went on to say,
<disp-quote>
<p>I came into Mason [GMU] knowing I wanted to focus on my grades. That was my number one priority. I didn’t want to get distracted. So, I feel I could be more social to fit in more, but then again I don’t really want to because I know it will distract me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Bryan, age 27, noted, “I am here to go to school and get a degree. That’s it.” Again, academic and social engagement were not seen always as mutually exclusive. Transfer students generally had a strict focus on their academic work and looked for academic challenge. Social activities inside the college, for the majority of the study participants, were viewed as a possible distraction unless framed within their academic work. As noted above, most transfer students found social engagement outside of the college within familial relationships or community-based groups; however, academic engagement was closely linked to campus, including faculty interactions and academic challenge in the classroom.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0091552113496141">
<title>Sense of Belonging</title>
<p>When asked if they felt as if they fit into the university community, student responses ranged from feeling completely included in the campus community to not feeling included. A majority of the students responded in ways that were consistent with Dustin, 23, who noted that “I’m comfortable here. I don’t feel out of place or anything.” But a few echoed 22-year-old Gregg’s comments:<disp-quote>
<p>Yeah, I guess. I mean I do not have any issues with it. I do not have any animosity here or anything. I do not feel left out. I mean I think the teachers are all welcoming, they are all there.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The responses often related to student age. Older students tended to view their age as a reason for not fitting in as a student on campus. An older, female student, Ann, 47, explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s easier for me to come here and fit in. I look like an instructor. I do. They don’t even come and ask me to participate in fundraisers; they think I’m an instructor. So in that sense, it’s a way for me to hide. And so I do fit; I just don’t fit in maybe as a student until I sit in the classroom and I’m the only old chick in the room.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, this was not always the case with older students and should not be overstated. Several older students did not see age as a significant issue that derailed their sense of belonging. One older student, Ted, 35, noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>There’s always one or at least one student who is approaching my age or even older. And that, well, I’m not saying that helps because it’s not a guarantee that they are the people I’ll sit next to the [next] time or [be] talking to. Yeah, it’s never been remotely an issue.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Seeing other older students engaging with diverse student groups inside and outside the classroom tempered the uneasiness that many older students felt and assisted in an overall sense of belonging.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the transfer students did not feel a strong distinction between themselves and the native student population. Thirty-year-old Bob’s comment represents the sentiment of those in the study: “I think I consider myself more a Mason [GMU] student now.” Julia, 27, compared her experiences across institutions and geographic regions: “I do feel comfortable here, this is the type of place, like you said, more than any place I’ve ever been whether it be Eastern Washington or Montana or Southern California or Spokane, I feel most comfortable here.” Although age mediated the sense of belonging for some students, their status as transfer students did not impede belonging. Students generally saw the campus as diverse in terms of age, race, ethnicity, religious affiliation, and other identity groups. The diversity led to a feeling of inclusiveness. As Stephanie, 23, explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>Yeah, I do. I feel like everybody fits into Mason [GMU]. There is like every kind of person here, and that’s what my high school was like, like I love it. Like I just feel like everybody fits in, there’s not like one type.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Jennifer, 22, expressed a similar sentiment, “Yeah, I think I do [fit in] even though I guess I am not the most talkative or the most outgoing type of individual. I think there is a place for everybody here.” Finally, diversity was also expressed in terms of residential status. Most of the transfer students did not live on campus. The history of the institution as a commuter school, and the large number of commuter students on the campus, contributed to the diversity and helped the transfer students belong. Russell, 27, explained, “I would say in my opinion Mason [GMU] is like that because it’s a big commuter school, there are a lot of people that commute here and there are a lot of people who live here too”</p>
<p>The sense of belonging among the students was also fostered by the overall campus climate as a diverse institution and by the convergence of academic purpose, focus, and rigor. The students’ focus on academic engagement led to definitions and conceptualizations of belonging that were linked to academic activities. Ruth, 26, explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>I think it’s a little more challenging here…. I’ve learned a little more in my classes so far here. But I think it’s a really good start and the main thing is that it can show that you really can do this. They are very supportive and stuff like that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The challenge of the class was appreciated and viewed as reasonable given the support from faculty members and peers. The transfer students were also zeroing in on a major and taking more upper-division courses. This sense of purpose and focus contributed to their success and sense of belonging. For example, Peter, 30, reported,
<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve done a lot better [in terms of grades], and part of that has to do with [the fact that] I’m taking more courses, which I think are more aligned to my real capabilities and interests. For me that makes a huge difference. If I’m studying something I don’t particularly like . . . I have a real hard time focusing. It just doesn’t retain as well. And I’ve matured a lot since then. I was 18. I’m 30 now. I’ve changed.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, Mary, a 23-year-old senior, noted that
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . through group work and through class activities I’m able to apply what I know and kind of expand on that. So I’d say in a way it’s more challenging, but it really helps me prepare for when I’m going to go out to do what I want to do in my job.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Meaningful, intellectually challenging work was appreciated and contributed to students’ good feelings about being at George Mason.</p>
<p>For many students in the study, engaging in social activities and events was not included in the list of activities that promoted their sense of belonging. Often, the transfer students connected their sense of belonging to their beliefs about academic engagement. Peter, 30, observed,
<disp-quote>
<p>If that question [fitting in] has to do with gelling with the student body, I don’t partially. But okay. I get along well enough with the people I engage with . . . The social aspect of college life is really not what I’m here for.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The transfer students in this study privileged academic activities as central to their collegiate life and, by doing so, developed a sense of belonging connected to academic activities. Although age and campus climate partially mediated a sense of belonging, the students’ language and discourse concerning inclusivity related directly to academic activities.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section15-0091552113496141">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Early literature on college student success conceptualized academic and social engagement as separate constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091552113496141">Astin, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0091552113496141">Tinto, 1975</xref>). Students who engaged in academic and social activities were more likely to persist and receive a bachelor’s degree. The construct of sense of belonging expanded the way social and academic integration is conceived, especially for minority students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091552113496141">Hurtado &amp; Carter, 1997</xref>). More recent literature, such as the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091552113496141">Kuh et al. (2005)</xref>, privileges the academic sphere, relating all social activities to those that occur in an academic context. The constructs explored in more recent scholarship include academic challenge, student–faculty interaction, and active and collaborative learning. Activities included in these constructs are studying for classes, engaging in experiential learning, and working with faculty members inside and outside the class. The literature on transfer students notes the primacy of academic work, given the demographic characteristics of transfer students; they are often older, hold full- or part-time jobs, and have significant family obligations.</p>
<p>The findings from this study support the centrality of academic engagement among a transfer student population. Generally, students viewed engagement in college within the context of their academic work. The students who had significant experiences outside of the college as full-time workers, some with significant family responsibilities, had developed support networks broadly. Although we did not find differences across age groups, our findings do support the research within the adult education literature on the primacy of the classroom as a source of collegiate engagement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091552113496141">Donaldson and Graham (1999)</xref> note that in their model of college outcomes for adults, “the classroom is seen as the fulcrum of the collegiate experience . . ., mediating the psychosocial and value orientations, the life-world environment, the adult cognition, and the outcomes components involved in the collegiate experience” (p. 31). Most students in our study found their work academically challenging and, therefore, engaging. Several students noted that this discovery was not unexpected. By the time most students transferred to the university, they were working on more advanced courses that were often in their major or in some other area of interest. Most students had completed general education courses and were able to focus on upper division courses in topical areas of great interest. This more demanding academic work was accompanied by greater motivation and focus.</p>
<p>Transfer students in this study viewed social engagement primarily within the context of family and community, not as activities related to college life. In agreement with the adult education literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091552113496141">Kember, 1999</xref>), outside college support structures had a positive impact on student success. The students also privileged academic activities and made a strong connection between those activities and sense of belonging. They felt a sense of belonging when engaged in academic activities and did not conceptualize their academic and social engagement as separate spheres. These findings are similar to the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0091552113496141">Townsend and Wilson (2006)</xref> who found that community college students may not make as many social connections because they are older and accustomed to seeing the classroom as a site for both social and academic engagement. Our findings depart slightly from other literature on transfer students that emphasizes the importance of academic and social engagement for student success. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091552113496141">Flaga (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091552113496141">Laanan (2006)</xref> both argue that students have a more successful transition if they are more engaged socially and academically. The students in our study were all successful and conceptualized their engagement outside of the college sphere.</p>
<p>Our findings also contribute to the literature on transfer students. Much of the literature focuses on the factors that will lead community college students to transfer or on the factors that contribute to the academic success of students once they enroll at a 4-year institution. We included students who transferred from a variety of institutions—both community colleges and 4-year colleges—and focused very specifically on how they defined and perceived academic and social engagement. Our findings illustrate that transfer students are similar to community college students in terms of their perceptions about student engagement. Similar to the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091552113496141">Borglum and Kubala (2000)</xref>, this study found that transfer students who felt academically integrated also felt socially integrated, had little desire to participate in extracurricular activities, remained on campus only to attend classes, and were goal-driven. Our findings depart from their work in that social and academic engagement did not converge in the same manner. Students associated social engagement with off-campus activities and viewed on-campus social activities as a distraction.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>Factors that influence transfer student success and retention may be linked more to academic engagement, especially academic challenge, than to social engagement as traditionally defined in the literature. Joining clubs and organizations on campus was not a priority for most of the transfer students in this study and, for most, this disinterest in participating on campus did not deter from their overall engagement or sense of belonging. Thus the NSSE results that show transfer students are only modestly involved in campus activities is both accurate and irrelevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0091552113496141">Office of Institutional Assessment, 2010</xref>). University life staff and campus leaders who are focused on retention may need to conceive of student engagement more holistically to include resources and organizations beyond the campus. The seamlessness with which off-campus participation and support contributed to on-campus success is a key insight from this research. Transfer students value educationally meaningful assignments, interesting class discussion, and connections with peers and faculty members. Attention to strong teaching and active learning pedagogies may be a stronger investment for transfer student success than campus activities.</p>
<p>Most of the transfer students in this study felt well prepared for the academic demands of the university. This congruence between both the academic skills and the understanding of what is expected in college may contribute to student success. Most participants in this study did not experience a brief decline in their grade point averages immediately after transfer (referred to by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091552113496141">Hill [1965]</xref> as “transfer shock”), in part because they were prepared and motivated to focus on their academic goals. The orientation message at the university cautions students about the likelihood that they will experience transfer shock. An additional message might be warranted: Transfer students who are motivated, focused, and engaged in their academic work may have stronger grades at the university than at their previous schools, especially if they have the support of family and community groups outside of campus.</p>
<p>The student voices in this study reflect a sample of the transfer student population at one institution. The diversity of the transfer student population at this institution suggests the need for more research comparing different transfer student subgroups as well as the need for multi-institutional studies that will allow us to determine if the findings of this study can be generalized to transfer students at other universities. Comparing transfer students to those who start their education at the institution (so called “native” students) would provide insights about which campus experiences are distinctive to transfer students. A comparison between transfer students enrolled part-time versus full-time is another area for further investigation.</p>

<sec id="section17-0091552113496141">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The number of individuals seeking to transfer to 4-year universities will continue to grow. This study provides a greater understanding of student engagement for transfer students. Students who begin their higher education experiences in a community college setting or at another 4-year institution define and engage in the traditional definition of academic engagement and view their social lives as separate from their education endeavors, but this separation does not compromise their success. The findings from this study have implications for how colleges and universities view their NSSE results, how they apply academic and social engagement standards, and how they support transfer students. The study findings question assumptions in the research about the parsimony of engagement theories; for example, are social and academic engagement separate concepts for all students?</p>
