<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The impact of alcohol on cognitive functioning among older adults is an area of growing concern because cognitive decline is associated with certain dementias that restrict individuals from independent functioning, thereby imposing caregiving burdens on families and society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898264312459346">Anstey, Mack, &amp; Cherbuin, 2009</xref>). The findings of past research related to alcohol consumption and cognition are equivocal. Some studies show that moderate drinking is beneficial for cognitive functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898264312459346">Fan, O’Donnell, Singh, Pungan, &amp; Perlmuter, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898264312459346">Lang, Wallace, Huppert, &amp; Melzer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898264312459346">McGuire, Ajani, &amp; Ford, 2007</xref>), while other studies indicate that heavy drinking is harmful to cognitive functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264312459346">Bond et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898264312459346">Galanis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898264312459346">Mukamal et al., 2003</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898264312459346">Anstey et al. (2009)</xref>, the relationship between alcohol consumption and cognition is described by a J-shaped or inverted U-shaped curve, which emphasizes the beneficial effects of low-to-moderate alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>Most studies on drinking and cognition have not considered unique domains of cognition, such as fluid intelligence and crystallized intelligence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898264312459346">Britton, Singh-Manoux, &amp; Marmot (2004)</xref> investigated the relationship between alcohol consumption and cognitive functioning using five different cognitive tasks (memory, inductive reasoning, Mill Hill vocabulary, phonemic fluency, and semantic fluency). They found that alcohol had no significant impact on the memory task, which measures fluid intelligence, while alcohol had a significant impact on the Mill Hill vocabulary task, which measures crystallized intelligence. As crystallized intelligence is associated with cumulative knowledge, which is influenced by environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264312459346">Perlmutter, 1988</xref>), it is expected that alcohol consumption has a greater impact on crystallized intelligence than on fluid intelligence. In this study, fluid intelligence and crystallized intelligence are analyzed individually. Looking at these two cognitive domains separately should make it possible to describe the effect of drinking on cognition in more detail.</p>
<p>For the most part, gender differences in the impact of drinking on cognition have not been examined directly, because most studies used samples comprised solely of men or women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898264312459346">Espeland et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898264312459346">Fan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898264312459346">Galanis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898264312459346">Perreira &amp; Sloan, 2002</xref>). One study suggested that long-term alcohol consumption has a greater impact on cognition among women than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898264312459346">Dougherty, Bjork, &amp; Bennett, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898264312459346">Bond et al. (2004)</xref> also found that the sample means of many risk factors of heavy drinking (age, education, income, BMI, and depression) are different among women and men. The present study was designed to investigate the relationship between alcohol consumption and cognition among older men and women using a nationally representative sample while controlling for age, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, income, smoking status, exercise, self-rated health, depression, Activities of Daily Living (ADL) limitations, chronic illnesses, vision, hearing, and body mass index (BMI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898264312459346">Appenzeller, Bertolo, &amp; Costallat, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898264312459346">Dawe &amp; Moore-Orr, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898264312459346">Espeland et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898264312459346">Lang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898264312459346">Lin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898264312459346">McGuire et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898264312459346">Perreira &amp; Sloan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898264312459346">Zelinski, Crimmins, Reynolds, &amp; Seeman, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, previous studies investigating the relationship between alcohol and cognition have commonly used the subject’s current level of drinking as the measurement of alcohol consumption. Relying on the current level of drinking alone, however, overlooks the effect of chronic excessive drinking or alcohol dependence on cognition. Long-term heavy drinking is reported to lower the hippocampus volume, which plays an important role in memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898264312459346">Beresford et al., 2006</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898264312459346">Perreira and Sloan (2002)</xref> showed that men aged 50 and over with a problem-drinking history have a higher onset of cognitive impairment than those without a problem-drinking history. Thus, this study also examines cognition in both men and women, using a measure of excessive drinking based on chronic drinking status and problem-drinking history.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0898264312459346">
<title>Study Sample</title>
<p>Data for this study came from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally representative survey conducted by the University of Michigan and funded by the National Institute on Aging. The HRS includes respondents who were born between 1931 and 1941, and their spouses of any age. In this study, the 2004 core data file was used to measure cognitive functioning. Also, the RAND data file, an accessible cleaned longitudinal version of HRS, was used to measure chronic drinking status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898264312459346">St. Clair, 2009</xref>). To measure problem-drinking history, CAGE variables from the 1992, 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2004 data were used because the CAGE questions are asked only once, when respondents are first interviewed. Detailed information about the CAGE measure will be provided in the section on measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898264312459346">Ewing, 1984</xref>). HRS data with imputed values for missing data were also used in the measure of household income.</p>
<p>The sample was limited to self-respondents who completed the cognition questions. Individuals with proxy respondents were not included in this study because the variables used to measure cognition for individuals with proxy respondents consisted of only three questions, which is insufficient for assessing the cognitive functioning of subjects. Also, the current study did not include respondents under age 65, because the full set of cognition questions was addressed only to people aged 65 and older in HRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898264312459346">Ofstedal, Fisher, &amp; Herzog, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the drinking status variables were measured using both chronic drinking status and problem-drinking history, people who had missing data on both variables were excluded. Also, individuals who were not classified as chronic heavy drinkers but had missing data on problem-drinking history variables were excluded, as were individuals not classified as problem drinkers who had missing data on variables used to determine chronic drinking status. Individuals with missing data on some drinking variables were retained in the sample if the available data were sufficient to identify them as either a problem drinker or a chronic heavy drinker. After listwise deletion of cases with missing values, a pool of 6,238 subjects remained eligible for empirical analysis. The sample was subdivided into female and male groups, which consisted of 3,888 and 2,350 subjects, respectively.</p>
<p>Due to a large fraction of cases with missing data, we compared subjects in the analytic sample with subjects excluded from the analytic sample. Compared to women who were excluded, women in the final sample were more depressed (excluded mean: 1.54 vs. sample mean: 1.73) and had fewer functional difficulties (excluded mean: 0.71 vs. sample mean: 0.45). Compared to men who were excluded, men in the final sample were a little older (excluded mean: 73.7 vs. sample mean: 74.9), more depressed (excluded mean: 0.96 vs. sample mean: 1.28), and had fewer functional difficulties (excluded mean: 0.52 vs. sample mean: 0.35).</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section5-0898264312459346">
<title>Cognition</title>
<p>The measure of cognitive function was derived from a self-reported cognition survey that had a maximum score of 35 points. The survey items included seven tests: immediate free recall (10 points), delayed free recall (10 points), serial 7s (5 points), backward counts (2 points), naming the day and date (month/day/year) (4 points), naming two objects (2 points), and naming the president and vice president (2 points; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898264312459346">Herzog &amp; Wallace, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Immediate free recall and delayed free recall tests assess the respondent’s short-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898264312459346">Ofstedal et al., 2005</xref>). The interviewer reads a list of 10 nouns and the respondent is asked to recall as many words as possible from the list in any order (immediate free recall). After about 5 min spent answering other questions, the respondent is asked to recall the words from the immediate free recall task (delayed free recall). The serial 7s test assesses the respondent’s working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898264312459346">Ofstedal et al., 2005</xref>). The respondent is asked to subtract 7 from 100, then subtract 7 from the result, and so on for five trials. The respondent gets credit for each trial if the difference is 7.</p>
<p>The Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) test assesses the respondent’s knowledge and consists of backward counts, naming the day and date, naming two objects, and naming the president and vice president (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264312459346">Brandt, Spencet, &amp; Folstein, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898264312459346">Ofstedal et al., 2005</xref>). In this test, the respondent is asked to count backwards from 20 for 10 continuous numbers. Two points are given if the respondent answers correctly on the first trial and one point if the respondent answers correctly on the second trial. Next, the respondent is asked to identify the month, day, year, and day of week. The respondent is then asked to name two objects that answer the questions “What do you usually use to cut paper?” and “What do you call the kind of prickly plant that grows in the desert?” Finally, the respondent is asked to name the current president and vice president of the United States.</p>
<p>Given the cognitive data recorded in the HRS, it is possible to measure fluid intelligence and crystallized intelligence individually using different items. The fluid intelligence score can be measured by items identifying “processing” abilities, which include immediate free recall, delayed free recall, and serial 7s measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898264312459346">McArdle, Hamagami, Meredith, &amp; Bradway, 2000</xref>). The crystallized intelligence score can be measured by items identifying acquired and generalized knowledge, which include the TICS measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898264312459346">McArdle et al., 2000</xref>). As the crystallized intelligence score was highly skewed (mean 9.23 out of 10), it was divided into two levels. Only respondents who scored a perfect 10 were categorized as having a high crystallized intelligence score. In this study, the fluid intelligence score and the dichotomous measure of the high crystallized intelligence score serve as dependent variables for the analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0898264312459346">
<title>Drinking status</title>
<p>In this study, drinking status was categorized into three groups (nondrinker, non–excessive drinker, excessive drinker) using data on chronic drinking status from 1998 to 2004 and problem-drinking history. “Nondrinker” was coded as 1 if respondents answered no to “Do you ever drink alcohol?” in 2004. “Excessive drinker” was coded as 1 if the respondents were chronic heavy drinkers or had a problem-drinking history. “Non–excessive drinker” was coded as 1 if the respondents were non–chronic heavy drinkers without a problem-drinking history.</p>
<p>“Chronic heavy drinkers” were defined as subjects who were heavy drinkers in any three of the four biennial waves between 1998 and 2004. “Heavy drinkers” in any particular wave were defined as drinking on one or more days a week and having three or more drinks per occasion for males, and two or more drinks per occasion for females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898264312459346">Satre, Gordon, &amp; Weisner, 2007</xref>). The threshold for heavy drinking was different for males and females because of gender differences in alcohol absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264312459346">Wechsler, Dowdall, Davenport, &amp; Rimm, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Problem-drinking history was measured by using the CAGE instrument from the 1992, 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2004 waves, because CAGE questions are only asked once of respondents. The CAGE questionnaire consists of four questions: Have you ever felt you should cut down on your drinking? Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking? Have you ever felt bad or guilty about your drinking? Have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or to get rid of a hangover? “Yes” was coded as 1, and “No” was coded as 0. If the total score of the CAGE instrument is 2 or more, the respondent was considered to have a problem-drinking history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898264312459346">Ewing, 1984</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0898264312459346">
<title>Covariates</title>
<p>In this study, age (number of years), race (others = 0, non-Hispanic White = 1), marital status (others = 0, married = 1), education (less than high school education, high school graduate, some college, college graduate or more), and income (four quartiles of the household income distribution for all HRS respondents in 2004) are included as preexisting sociodemographic factors.</p>
<p>Health behaviors such as smoking status and exercise level were also included as covariates. Smoking status was measured by using categorical dummy variables (never smoker, former smoker, current smoker). “Never smoker” was coded as 1 if respondents answered no to “Have you ever smoked cigarettes?” “Former smoker” was coded as 1 if respondents answered yes to the question about past smoking, but no to “Do you smoke cigarettes now?” “Current smoker” was coded as 1 if respondents answered yes to both the past smoking and current smoking questions. Exercise level was measured by using a dummy variable, which was coded as 1 for regular exercise. If the respondents engaged in a vigorous activity—such as running or jogging, swimming, cycling, aerobics or gym workout, tennis, or digging with a spade or shovel—three or more times per week, it was regarded as regular exercise.</p>
<p>Perceived health variables such as self-rated health, depression, and functional difficulty were also included as covariates. Self-rated health was measured by using categorical dummy variables (excellent health, good health, poor health). If the respondents rated their health as very good or excellent, “excellent health” was coded as 1. If the respondents rated their health as good, “good health” was coded as 1. If the respondents rated their health as fair or poor, “poor health” was coded as 1. Depression was measured by using eight items on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898264312459346">Andresen, Malmgren, Carter, &amp; Patrick, 1994</xref>). The respondents were asked whether they had depressive symptoms during the past week. “Yes” was coded as 1 and “No” was coded as 0. Two items (felt happy, enjoyed life) were coded reversely. Functional difficulty was measured with six items of ADL limitations. Respondents were asked if they had any difficulty with dressing, walking, bathing, eating, getting in or out of bed, or toileting. Each item was coded as 1 if respondents reported difficulty. If the respondents answered either “can’t do” or “don’t do,” it was also coded as 1.</p>
<p>Objective health variables such as chronic illnesses, vision, hearing, and BMI were included as covariates as well. Chronic illnesses (high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, lung disease, heart condition, stroke, and arthritis) were measured by using dummy variables. If a doctor had ever told the respondent that he/she had the condition, the variable was coded as 1. Poor eyesight was measured by using a dummy variable. If the respondents self-reported poor vision in general or a near or distant eyesight problem, it was coded as 1. Poor hearing was measured by using a dummy variable. If the respondents had worn a hearing aid, it was coded as 1. BMI was computed from self-reports of height and weight and specified through categorical dummy variables (underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese) defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). If the BMI was less than 18.5, it was regarded as underweight. If the BMI was 18.5 to 24.9, it was regarded as normal weight. If the BMI was 25.0 to 29.9, it was regarded as overweight. If the BMI was over 30, it was regarded as obese.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>In this study, analyses were conducted separately for females and males. For the descriptive analyses, means (<italic>M</italic>) and standard deviation (<italic>SD</italic>) were used to assess the sample characteristics. <italic>t</italic>-Tests and <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> tests were conducted to evaluate the gender differences in descriptive statistics. For the regression analyses, the model was separated based on dependent variables (fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence). Multivariate regression was used to study the association between alcohol consumption and fluid intelligence while controlling for other covariates. Since high crystallized intelligence was a dichotomous variable, logistic regression was used to investigate the association between alcohol consumption and crystallized intelligence while controlling for other covariates. Statistical gender differences in the relationship between drinking status and cognition were also evaluated. All statistical analyses were based on weighted data and conducted using STATA version 11.</p>

The mean fluid intelligence score was 12.2 out of 25 (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.36) for the female group and 11.8 out of 25 (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.05) for the male group. About half of the respondents had a high crystallized intelligence score (56.5% for the female group and 56.6% for the male group). About 7.8% of women and 13.7% of men were classified as excessive drinkers, while 78.0% of women and 69.1% of men were nondrinkers. As for sociodemographic characteristics, the mean age of the population was about 75.5 years for the female group and 74.9 years for the male group. For both female and male groups, most of the subjects were non-Hispanic White (76.1%, 77.5%), and at least high school graduates (70.3%, 68.8%). About 44.4% of women and 73.4% of men were married. Ranked according to household income, about 39.6% of women and 19.9% of men fell into the lowest quartile.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0898264312459346">Table 2</xref> contains the results of the multivariate regression model that describes fluid intelligence. The overall model fit was good, with an adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of 0.314 for the female group and 0.328 for the male group. The empirical result showed that controlling for other factors, female nondrinkers had a fluid intelligence score 0.613 points lower (about 5.04% lower) than otherwise similar female non–excessive drinkers. There was no significant difference in fluid intelligence score between male nondrinkers and male non–excessive drinkers. For both female and male groups, there was no significant difference in fluid intelligence score between excessive drinkers and non–excessive drinkers. In terms of gender differences, the effect of drinking status on fluid intelligence was not statistically significant.</p>

The overall model fit was good with pseudo <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values of 0.138 and 0.124 for female and male groups, respectively. Similar to the result found for fluid intelligence, the odds of having a high crystallized intelligence score were about 31.7% lower for female nondrinkers than female non–excessive drinkers, while there was no significant difference in the odds of having a high crystallized intelligence score between male nondrinkers and male non–excessive drinkers. Also, the odds of having a high crystallized intelligence score were about 32.1% lower for female excessive drinkers than female non–excessive drinkers, but no significant difference was found between excessive drinkers and non–excessive drinkers among males. As in the case of fluid intelligence, the effect of drinking status on crystallized intelligence was not significantly different by gender.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study was designed to examine the relationship between excessive drinking and cognitive functioning among older adults. Corresponding to previous studies, age, race, education, and income were significantly associated with cognitive functioning for both women and men. However, the key independent variable, excessive drinking, was associated with lower crystallized intelligence compared to non–excessive drinking among women, but not among men. Also, nondrinking was negatively associated with both fluid intelligence and crystallized intelligence compared to non–excessive drinking among women, but not men. Although previous studies did not examine fluid intelligence and crystallized intelligence separately, these results are similar to findings that among women, moderate drinking is protective against cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898264312459346">Nolen-Hoeksema, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898264312459346">McGuire et al., 2007</xref>). However, although we controlled for many confounders, it should also be noted that there remains a potential for residual confounding that is associated with crystallized intelligence, especially among women.</p>
<p>The results of this study more specifically suggest that excessive drinking impairs the crystallized intelligence of women but not men. By definition, crystallized intelligence is a construct in which psychological factors are combined with biological factors to describe cognitive function. Previous studies argue that women who drink excessively are prone to depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898264312459346">Fillmore et al., 1997</xref>) and may have lower self-esteem than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264312459346">Beckman, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898264312459346">Marsh &amp; Miller, 1985</xref>). Therefore, those women who consume excessive alcohol may be engaged with more negative psychological factors than men, which may lead to the deterioration of crystallized intelligence cognition.</p>
<p>The results also suggest that nondrinking is associated with low cognition among women. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898264312459346">McGuire et al. (2007)</xref>, women who do not drink are less likely to have healthy behaviors than women who drink moderately. Compared to moderate drinkers, nondrinkers are less likely to engage in regular exercise, have higher BMIs, consume more fat and fewer vegetables, and are less likely to monitor their health. In addition, nondrinkers are more likely to be poor, disabled, and less likely to be active both physically and socially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898264312459346">McGuire et al., 2007</xref>). Since the lifestyle and health characteristics of nondrinking women are related to low cognition, it is not surprising that nondrinking is negatively associated with cognitive functioning among women.</p>
<p>Although the effect of alcohol consumption on cognition was not found to be significantly different by gender, it is notable that alcohol consumption was significantly associated with cognition only among women. Previous studies suggest two explanations for this difference. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898264312459346">Nolen-Hoeksema (2004)</xref>, women achieve higher blood alcohol levels than men for a given dose of alcohol because women have a higher percentage of body fat and a lower percentage of body water weight than men. In addition, due to gender differences in the interaction between alcohol metabolism and hormonal status, the relationship between alcohol consumption and cognition may be different between men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898264312459346">Dufouil, Ducimetiere, &amp; Alperovitch, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the several interactions between alcohol consumption and cognition explained above, excessive drinking is problematic for crystallized intelligence especially among women because women who drink excessively are vulnerable to many risk factors related to crystallized intelligence, such as depression, low self-esteem, obesity, smoking, and low cerebral blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264312459346">Beckman, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898264312459346">Dufouil et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898264312459346">Fillmore et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898264312459346">Kalmijn, van Boxtel, Verschuren, Jolles, &amp; Launer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898264312459346">Marsh &amp; Miller, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898264312459346">McGuire et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898264312459346">Nolen-Hoeksema, 2004</xref>). Although women who consume excessive alcohol are not exposed to all of the risk factors listed above, we should be aware that women are more susceptible to the adverse effects of excessive alcohol than men.</p>
<p>There are some limitations in this study that should be noted. First, when measuring cognitive functioning, proxy reports were excluded. As proxies are used when respondents refuse or are unable to answer the questions, many respondents who were more severely cognitively impaired may have been excluded. Data from proxy respondents might have made it possible to explain the relationship between drinking and cognition more effectively. Second, the drinking variable was self-reported. Individuals tend to underreport alcohol use. This may have made it difficult to accurately differentiate non–excessive drinkers from excessive drinkers. Third, the number of problem drinkers was so small that it was hard to define excessive drinking more strictly. Due to the limitation of sample size, problem drinkers, regardless of whether they were chronic heavy drinkers, were defined as excessive drinkers. If problem drinkers who were chronic heavy drinkers and problem drinkers who were not chronic heavy drinkers were analyzed separately, the results may have shown a closer association between excessive drinking and lowered cognitive ability. Fourth, the definition of excessive drinking is relatively simple and does not capture the degree of excessiveness. In this study, the number of drinking days per week was only considered to determine whether respondents drink or not. Although the frequency of drinking can be based on both the number of days of drinking per week and the number of drinks per occasion, we defined excessive drinking based on guidelines from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898264312459346">United States Department of Agriculture and United States Department of Health and Human Services (2005)</xref>, which only consider the number of drinks per occasion. Moreover, we did not take into account the timing of excessive drinking. From the CAGE instrument alone, we could not determine when respondents had experienced problem drinking. Again, we did not differentiate between current abstainers and chronic drinkers because we assumed that excessive drinking might have a long-term effect even if respondents had stopped drinking recently. Finally, the current study is cross-sectional. Therefore, it cannot be established that excessive drinking is causally related to cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>In future studies, it will be important to examine the relationship between drinking and cognitive performance longitudinally in order to specify the causal relationship. Also, it would be interesting to investigate why nondrinking is more detrimental to cognitive functioning than excessive drinking, and why drinking has a greater impact on women than men. Although some studies have examined the association between excessive drinking and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898264312459346">Harwood et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898264312459346">Rosen et al., 1993</xref>), most of those studies are based on clinical settings with small sample sizes. Therefore, it would be interesting to test whether excessive drinking has a significant effect on the onset of Alzheimer’s disease, using a nationally representative data set.</p>
<p>To conclude, these findings suggest that there may be a curvilinear association between drinking patterns and cognition in later life, such that among some older women, a moderate level of alcohol consumption may be associated with better cognitive functioning. Therefore, from a policy perspective, moderate drinking may be suggested for maintaining cognitive health. However, caution should be exercised when encouraging moderate drinking because chronic moderate drinking is also related to the risk of cerebrovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898264312459346">Marmot &amp; Brunner, 1991</xref>). In any case, clinicians and service providers should consider gender differences when developing strategies for the prevention and treatment of alcohol-related cognitive decline among older adults. Finally, it is important to note that the benefits of drinking can vary from individual to individual according to health status and genetic factors.</p>
