<abstract>
<p>This article offers some reflections on the author’s working style, which is highly resource oriented. A selection of resources is presented on an axis of time that can extend into the past to birth or even beyond to ancestors as well as into the future all the way to death or beyond depending on the client’s belief about what happens after death. In addition to the resources of the past and the future, the author emphasizes the value of the archaic basic survival reflexes in the present, such as the impulses to fight, flight, or immobilization. The hope is that this article will contribute to a rich discussion about various working styles.</p>

<body>
<p>On Wikipedia there are more than 50 terms related to counseling, from career and family counseling to a range of lesser known counseling types, including biblical counseling, genetic counseling, and ecological counseling. Generally, counseling may be either purpose oriented (e.g., finding an optimal investment strategy) or personality oriented (e.g., reorientation during a transitional phase in life). In certain cases, a person may be required to seek counseling (e.g., if there is a court order). More typically, however, individuals seek counseling based on their own perception of need. Whether voluntary or mandated, counseling is undertaken for the purpose of improving an individual’s current professional or personal situation. Transactional analysts in counseling will define a contract together with the client, setting the intensity, goals, and duration of counseling as well as the rubric for verifying the outcome.</p>
<sec id="section1-0362153713486101">
<title>Counseling Models</title>
<p>We find the earliest models of counseling in antiquity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0362153713486101">Aristotle’s (2001)</xref> <italic>Nicomachean Ethics, </italic>for example, was intended as a guide to a good life. He taught that living a happy life draws on <italic>bios theoretikos </italic>and <italic>bios praktikos</italic>. Bios theoretikos includes the life of the mind, the use of reason to obtain knowledge about fundamental truths, and the attainment of wisdom (pp. 251-253). Bios praktikos, the practical life, refers to the perfect use of reason in relation to action in the world, that is, to the use of intelligence and skill in combination with ethical values (p. 529). The aim of Aristotle’s guide resembles the life goal that Eric <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0362153713486101">Berne (1964</xref>) described when he wrote about autonomy, “which is manifested by the release or recovery of three capacities: awareness, spontaneity and intimacy” (p. 158).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0362153713486101">
<title>Defining Counseling</title>
<p>As already mentioned, professional counselors formulate their goals individually with the client. At the same time, they are guided by definitions from national or international professional associations that define the framework for counseling. As an example, I cite the definition of counseling formulated by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0362153713486101">European Association for Transactional Analysis (EATA) (2008)</xref>:
<disp-quote>
<p>TA Counselling is a professional activity within a contractual relationship. The counselling process enables clients or client systems to develop awareness, options and skills for problem management and personal development in daily life through the enhancement of their strengths, resources and functioning. Its aim is to increase autonomy in relation to their social, professional and cultural environment. (Section 5, p. 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>According to this definition, counselors are encouraged to help their clients develop their awareness and abilities and to use and enhance their own resources and capacities to this end. I regard this as the counselor’s major task, which I like to think of as engaging in an exciting treasure hunt.</p>
<p>In his basic philosophy of transactional analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0362153713486101">Berne (1961</xref>) posited that “every individual is capable of thinking” (p. 33). From the EATA definition of counseling just cited, I infer that the philosophy of transactional analysis counseling begins with the assumption that beyond a capacity to think, every individual also has a treasure chest of additional resources.</p>
<p>The EATA (2008, Section 5, pp. 3-6) counseling core competencies articulate the knowledge, attitude, and skills expected from a certified transactional analyst in that field in order to be able to work with high professional standards. These include:

<title>Focusing on Resources</title>
<p>During their training, counselors develop all of the competencies just mentioned. Certified Transactional Analysis (CTA) counselors show their mastery of the field in their written and oral exams. Although I consider all of the competencies listed to be important assets of counselors, I think focusing on resources (#8) is essential. This, for me, represents a kind of treasure hunt, which I experience as life enhancing for my clients and for myself.</p>
<p>By focusing on resources, the counselor
<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item>
<p>Is able to utilize and build on the client’s strengths, as the agent for change.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Identifies existing resources in the client and client’s system and integrates them into the counseling process.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Has working knowledge of other local resources in the community which could be of support to the client or to which the client could be referred, including medical, psychiatric, psychotherapeutic, and other services. (EATA, 2008, Section 5, p. 5)</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
<p>I find it particularly interesting to consider the client’s entire life with the aim of identifying and developing his or her resources. The time frame for this can extend into the past all the way to birth or even beyond to the person’s ancestors as well as into the future all the way to death or beyond depending on the client’s perspective and his or her idea of what happens after death.</p>
<p>In the following section, I point out a few resources, which I classify along a time axis as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0362153713486101">Figure 1</xref>. I also give an example of my work with each resource.</p>

<title>Resources of the Present</title>
<p>I start with the resources of the present because they are on hand and available. The hunt just consists of acknowledging and using them. Every professional counselor has his or her own techniques and focuses on the resources she or he considers of particular value. In the following paragraphs, I will focus my attention on a few that I consider especially important.</p>
<sec id="section6-0362153713486101">
<title>The Body as the First Treasure on Hand</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0362153713486101">Stephen Porges (2009/2010)</xref>, professor of psychiatry and biomedicine, described the close correlation between visceral sensations and prosocial parts of the autonomous nervous system (p. 15). He wrote that visceral afferences—that is, the brain’s reception of signals from the body—influence our reactions to the environment. We have all experienced what we might call <italic>gut feelings, </italic>when we know that something does not feel right before we know what could be wrong. Exploring clients’ gut feelings is thus a tool to enhance their contact between themselves and the counselor and to build up trust in their own sensations.</p>
<p>The psychoneuroimmunologist Joachim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0362153713486101">Bauer (2002</xref>) wrote, “Connections between our bodily experience and objects in the external world are especially significant from a psychosomatic perspective. This merger of signals from the inner sphere of the body and the external world takes place in the cingulate gyrus of the limbic system, the locus of ‘the senses of self and self-worth’ ” (p. 76). I often notice that clients start to regard themselves with esteem if they spend time exploring their gut feelings.</p>
<p>Independently of various scientific statements, I experience counseling to be especially effective when I integrate body reactions, so I work in a multilayered cognitive, emotional, and sensory manner (see case examples 4, 5, and 6).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0362153713486101">
<title>Safety: A Powerful Resource</title>
<p>Clients typically turn to counselors when they experience a challenge or need or they are referred by organizations that offer support for people in difficult life circumstances. Counselors can, therefore, assume that their clients are not in a relaxed state. In fact, people who come to counselors are likely to feel stressed, which they may experience to varying degrees. In the face of an environment that is perceived as unsafe, the body responds with multiple physical reactions. The autonomic nervous system switches from phylogenetically newer affective systems, which enable socially oriented strategies, toward archaic fight, flight, and immobility mechanisms (Porges, 2009/2010, p. 78). The prefrontal cortex, with its ability to conduct complex thinking processes, is impaired in its function. Once counselors pay attention to these physical, involuntary, and thus not consciously influenced processes, it becomes obvious that they must first and foremost provide clients with a situation in which they are able to experience the greatest degree of safety that is currently possible.</p>
<p>Transactional analysis provides useful tools for promoting a sense of safety, thereby reducing stress levels. In my work, I emphasize the basic attitude of “I’m OK, You’re OK” and provide structure that helps the client know what to expect. Every transactional analyst in counseling uses transactional analysis as a basic resource in his or her treasure hunt.</p>
<p>If counselors have internalized their professional abilities, they will have free access to the social components of the autonomic nervous system. The muscles of the face and throat will be agile, which means that the client can orient himself or herself to the counselor’s expression and the modulation of his or her voice (Porges, 2009/2010, p. 86). In transactional analysis, we refer to this phenomenon as the psychological level of transactions, which is perceived and valued independently from social communication.</p>
<p>Safety is also provided by the counseling setting itself, which typically offers a time schedule set in advance and the same room each time, ideally without interruption or disturbing ambient noise. In addition, trained counselors use techniques that help the client establish a sense of relationship and, at the same time, modulate how intense the relationship will be. For example, explicitly or implicitly allowing the client to make eye contact or to avoid it can provide him or her with room to experiment and may be a parameter for the counselor in assessing the client’s readiness to relate and/or the state of activation of the person’s flight reflex (see flight impulse in a following section). I tell my clients that sometimes it feels comfortable to have the possibility of roaming with their eyes when they choose the position of their chair, thus offering the liberty of eye movement as a potential treasure.</p>
<sec id="section8-0362153713486101">
<title>Case example 1</title>
<p>Mr. A. was sent to counseling by his physician, who was also his friend. The physician told me that his friend suffered from severe phobias. He would not go to a psychotherapist but was ready to see a counselor if he could guarantee that the counselor would not wear a white blouse and would allow him to hold his bunch of keys in his hands. I reluctantly agreed to see him for a first interview. Mr. A.’s first transaction was to ask me where the toilet was. With this question, he cared for his need to orient himself. Mentioning that it would be a success if he could stay in the room for an hour, he gave himself permission to flee whenever he felt like it. With all these prerequisites, he established for himself the greatest degree of safety that was currently possible. Stroking his safety measures, I provided for my own safety by asking him what would be the worst situation that might arise in our time together. He told me that he would either have to throw up or leave the room. I was sure I could handle both of those possibilities, and we agreed that we would both be OK. In fact, Mr. A. mentioned at the end of the session that his protective measures and my agreement had allowed him to feel safe enough to engage in this first interview and to master it.</p>

<sec id="section9-0362153713486101">
<title>Use of the Adult Ego State: A Special Treasure in Counseling</title>
<p>Once the counselor has succeeded in establishing a climate of the greatest possible safety and reassurance, the counseling is already well on its way to success. At this point, clients should have access to their capacity to think and their own body perceptions and feelings. This is described in transactional analysis as access to the Adult ego state (Berne, 1966/<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0362153713486101">1994</xref>, p. 220) and is the most powerful resource in the counseling process.</p>
<sec id="section10-0362153713486101">
<title>Case example 2</title>
<p>I asked Mrs B. in her first session, “What do you need to know about me?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0362153713486101">Cornell, 1986</xref>, p. 5). Rather than answering my question, she said, “I want you to know about my situation.” With this she started in a frenzy to tell me about her difficulties and her inability to handle them. Her redefinition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0362153713486101">Schiff, Schiff, &amp; Schiff, 1975</xref>, pp. 291-292) of my question led me to hypothesize that her Adult ego state did not have the executive power at that point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0362153713486101">Berne, 1961</xref>, pp. 20-25). Therefore, I did not confront her but expressed empathy for her situation and stroked her for being able to manage it for quite a long time. Instead of accepting the stroke, she continued redefining by telling me that she was not able to manage but just did it “in some way.” I invited Mrs. B. to look at herself from the perspective of a best friend. Moving from her own awareness to the perspective of a friend allowed her to see her merits in a realistic way and to activate her Adult ego state. I invited her then to notice her body reactions while keeping in mind her merits. To focus on one’s body reactions in the here and now enhances access to the Adult ego state. As soon as her Adult ego state had the executive power, Mrs. B. discovered two resources: her merits and the possibility of using awareness of her body to feel relaxation.</p>
<p>This example shows how the counselor can help clients to trust themselves and the practitioner to consider realistically whatever predicaments clients are facing. They may still perceive themselves as lacking the resources for mastering these situation because they are accustomed to defining themselves in terms of their frustrations, unmet needs, and/or developmental deficits. They thus continue to perceive the world and themselves from an attitude of “I’m Not OK, You’re OK” or from the defensive position of “I’m OK, You’re Not OK.”</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0362153713486101">
<title>Flight Impulses</title>
<p>At the beginning of counseling, clients often feel tense and insecure because they do not know what to expect. They may express their insecurity directly or appear reticent. If the counselor validates their insecurity and their fear or reticence as natural defense mechanisms and encourages them to take these signals seriously, they will see that the flight reflex, which is the source of their current behavior, is natural and valuable. Clients thereby learn that the flight reflex does not reflect cowardice but rather an archaic and meaningful survival impulse, a way to perceive and independently determine whether and to what degree they should flee or withdraw to master a given situation.</p>
<sec id="section12-0362153713486101">
<title>Case example 3</title>
<p>Mr. A., the first client mentioned earlier, expressed his flight impulse when he said that it would be a success if he could stay in the room for an hour. As soon as he was seated, I asked him to describe how he noticed his impulse to flee and how he would rate its intensity on a scale from 1 to 10. He described it as fidgetiness in his legs, especially in his feet, and said he would put it nearly at a 10. I asked him to imagine walking and to let his feet follow the impulse as if he where walking. In the meantime, I explained the natural function of the desire to flee as a life-saving impulse in a dangerous situation. After a few moments, he realized that the fidgetiness lessened to a manageable level of 4. He learned that walking or even imagining walking or running is a precious tool he could use to calm himself.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0362153713486101">
<title>Fight Impulses</title>
<p>Clients may appear aggressive toward the counselor in certain situations or express aggression toward other persons or situations. Like the impulse to flee, aggression or the fight response arises from an impulse in the brain stem that originally served the interests of safety and survival. If counselors validate for clients the communicated or perceived aggression in this sense, such individuals may be able to harness this energy to serve the interests of safety and their own needs without endangering self or others. Clients then become aware of aggression as a resource.</p>
<sec id="section14-0362153713486101">
<title>Case example 4</title>
<p>Mrs C., a single mother with two adolescent children, told me that instead of insisting firmly on what she wanted her children to do, she let herself get caught up in fits of losing her temper that were ineffective and left her feeling angry at herself. Asked to localize the anger in her body, she felt the compression of her jaw. Allowing this compression to get stronger and giving it a sound, she connected with the menacing gesture of a predator, which felt powerful. Understanding the archaic and life-ensuring force of this gesture, Mrs. C. gave herself the assignment to experience the power of this gesture every day. She integrated this resource into her behavior with her children and noticed with amazement their new reactions.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0362153713486101">
<title>Significance of the Freeze Reflex</title>
<p>Traumatized individuals experience the activation of nonmyelinized, vagal portions of the autonomic nervous system in situations that either appear or actually are dangerous (Porges, 2009/2010, p. 86). One of the effects of activating these neurons is total or partial immobility. Clients describe dissociative states and an inability to perceive their bodies. In acute stress situations, immobility not only protects the person from perceiving physical pain but also from cardiovascular overload (p. 277). If clients recognize this protective mechanism as a resource that once served a useful purpose, then they can learn to better and more realistically assess current dangers. In this way, they can both protect themselves from danger while also perceiving it.</p>
<sec id="section16-0362153713486101">
<title>Case example 5</title>
<p>Mrs. C., just described, mentioned that sometimes, especially with authority figures such as her boss, she felt immobilized instead of being able to be assertive (e.g., requesting a salary increase). When asked to localize this perception of immobilization in her body, she was unable to do so. Instead, she noticed that she had no sensation. Asked how she experienced this “having no sensation,” she called it “numbness.” Having explored the various degrees of numbness in her body, she was able to differentiate a hint of anger underneath the numbness. Realizing that she was actually safe and understanding the former protective function of freezing, Mrs. C. was able to role play the situation with her boss while being aware of her mobility and ability to protect herself. She was then also able to ask for a salary increase.</p>

<title>The Relationship Between Counselor and Client: A Life-Saving Treasure</title>
<p>Counselors are trained to use awareness of their own bodily sensations as a tool to recognize transference phenomena. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0362153713486101">Hargaden and Sills (2002</xref>) wrote, “For us, the transferential relationship is indistinguishable from any other relationship. It is part of how we cocreate the relationship between others and ourselves” (p. 46). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0362153713486101">Bauer (2007</xref>) wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>From a neurobiological perspective, we are inherently social creatures inclined toward resonance and cooperation. It seems that the core element of all motivation is to find or to provide interpersonal recognition, validation, or caring. Motivational systems switch off when there is no chance for social caring, and they switch on when the opposite is true, when acknowledgement or love is in play. (p. 34)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The basic attitude of “I’m OK, You’re OK” maintained by transactional analysis counselors offers optimal conditions for making strokes perceptible and acceptable to clients so that they can go on to develop an attitude of validation toward themselves and others and thereby be motivated to and capable of taking further developmental steps.</p>
<sec id="section18-0362153713486101">
<title>Case example 6</title>
<p>Mrs. D. had gone through a phase of deep depression. During many sessions she seemed so stuck that sometimes I doubted my ability as a counselor to handle the situation. She was in treatment with a psychiatrist, and she saw her physician from time to time. She said that she saw them just to get her medicine but that she did not see them as human beings. She opposed every proposition I made that she see specialized professionals, so I mainly kept structuring her days. Many times she was convinced that there would be no end to the tunnel. I had the strong gut feeling that she would be able to master this phase, and many times I told her so. After coming out of her depression, she told me that her main resource during that dark time had been my belief that she would be able to manage and finally overcome the depression. The consistency of our working relationship provided the foundation from which she was gradually able to move out of her depression.</p>

<sec id="section19-0362153713486101">
<title>Emotions: A Well-Known Treasure</title>
<p>There are many books and articles in the transactional analysis literature about emotions, including their value and function. Transactional analysts are thus well trained in working with emotions and view them as a treasure that they seek. In fact, Berne (1966/1994) said that “emotions always generate an impulse for a constructive action as far as the person allows the activation of the Adult ego state” (p. 309). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0362153713486101">Cornell and Hine’s (1999)</xref> article “Cognitive and Social Functions of Emotions: A Model for Transactional Analysis Counselor Training” offers a theoretical model and technical illustrations for working with emotional processes in the context of a counseling contract.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0362153713486101">
<title>Resources of the Past</title>
<p>By accessing resources from the past, clients can change their perspectives on the world, themselves, and others and their identity in a self-affirming direction. Counselors are often reluctant to work on the client’s past because this could lead the person to regress spontaneously, regressive work being the purview of psychotherapy. However, such reluctance may lead counselors to miss the opportunity to discover resources from different life stages and put them to good use.</p>
<sec id="section21-0362153713486101">
<title>Experiences of Former Success: An Easy Treasure Hunt</title>
<p>Every counselor is familiar with asking clients about similar situations or challenges that they were able to master. This question typically leads clients to recognize rapidly how they overcame the problem at that time and how they might apply the same resources to their current situation. The risk is that by moving rapidly to a solution in the present, clients do not adequately reflect on the solution from the past. As a result, the individual’s motivational system may not become fully mobilized. Finding a solution too quickly can lead clients to catalog current solution options in a purely cognitive way, thus missing the opportunity to harness emotional motivation. Exploring a former challenging situation in depth, including its emotional components, enables clients to acknowledge the value of solutions that were created under difficult circumstances. Both deserve acknowledgment: that the person endured the situation and that he or she was creative and active in finding solutions.</p>

<title>Case Example 7</title>
<p>Mr. E., a successful businessman and politician, felt stressed when he had to sign something in public. His arm would stiffen and he would manage to sign only with difficulty. We first looked for experiences of failure, being blamed, or other causes. Nothing seemed to catch his attention or to matter. When I asked him to think about a time when he successfully wrote in public, he remembered that at a public school day, he was asked to write a poem on the blackboard. I asked him to be aware of his emotions and his body sensations as he imagined himself standing in front of the blackboard. With joy he noticed the ease he felt in his shoulder and arm, and when in his imagination he signed the poem with his name under the name of the poet, he laughed and said, “That’s the way I want it to be.” To my surprise, the next time he came he talked about his new feeling of ease and growing pleasure about signing his name in public.</p>

<title>Resources of Script: The Treasure Lies in the Story</title>
<p>In her introductory speech to the roundtable at the transactional analysis conference in Prague in 2010, Maria Teresa Tosi talked about the narrative vision of script:
<disp-quote>
<p>Basically, the narrative vision suggests that the person needs a story to define her own identity. Life is constructed and reconstructed through the stories we tell about ourselves and our relationships. Stories help people integrate and make sense of their experiences. When people tell stories they are always doing so with a listener—internal or external, in actuality or fantasy—who influences the development of that story. (Tosi as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0362153713486101">Erskine et al., 2011</xref>, pp. 256-257)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The counselor’s role is to be that listener. He or she can influence the story by helping the client to assume a new perspective, thus developing the story further in a way that focuses on resources rather than on limits. Drivers, for example, can be viewed as limiting or by focusing on the qualities that have been developed with them. People with a “Be perfect” driver often develop an extreme sense of quality, which is useful in situations in which quality is essential. Seeing the quality of his or her behavior, rather than focusing on not being able to achieve perfection, allows the client a more generous attitude toward himself or herself.</p>
<sec id="section24-0362153713486101">
<title>Case example 8</title>
<p>Mrs. F., a young women, felt so distressed each time a colleague or her boss gave her a new instruction that she was barely able to listen and register what she should do. She told me about her anxiety regarding not being able to perform well enough. When I told her about drivers, she said, “That is exactly what I experience. I have to be perfect to be part of the team.” With that she revealed an essential part of her story. When she could recognize that she had very high standards and that once she had mastered a new assignment she delivered high-quality work, she started to feel proud of her sense of quality. She realized that she was appreciated as a team member and gave herself permission to belong, even if she had yet to learn how to do parts of her job. She developed her new story and hence was able to listen when others gave her new instructions.</p>

<sec id="section25-0362153713486101">
<title>Validation of Survival Strategies: Uncovering the Treasure</title>
<p>Counseling primarily involves clients recalling difficult experiences from childhood and adolescence and allowing the experience of current feelings that arise from those earlier experiences, such as grief or rage. The current feelings are the basis for validating the capacities of the child they used to be. A child who received little affection from her family, for example, will either have been wise enough to find affection from neighbors or friends or to have learned to survive without affection or to have created her own world. These are achievements worthy of acknowledgment. By validating these enormous accomplishments, the client can develop more self-respect. “The physical perception of this new respectful attitude triggers the person’s motivational systems and leads to the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, endogenous opioids, and oxytocin. All three create a sense of well-being and put the organism into a physical and psychological state of concentration and readiness for action” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0362153713486101">Bauer, 2007</xref>, pp. 28-31). Therefore, we can assume that all validation of survival strategies or survived injustices serves to support individuals in their capacity to create new strategies, practice new behavior, and thereby experience further validation.</p>
<sec id="section26-0362153713486101">
<title>Case example 9</title>
<p>Mr. G., who was 80 years old, wanted to prepare to die in peace. He explicitly chose counseling rather than therapy because “I don’t want to go through my life, I just want to find peace.” He agreed to look at his life from above, from a “pilot’s perspective” (he used to have a small airplane, which was a wonderful resource for his goal). He saw a boy who was placed as a foster child to work on a farm. He saw him feeling lonely but realized that the boy had a wonderful friend, the farmer’s dog, in whom he could confide all his sorrows. He also saw the milkman’s wife, who was always friendly to him when he had to bring the milk in early in the morning. He saw his teacher, who pretended not to see when he fell asleep at school because he was exhausted, and he saw the boy’s wonderful ability to build his own fantastic world. Seeing all this from his pilot’s perspective, he began to feel great love and appreciation for himself as a child. His bitterness seemed to melt away. When I asked him to notice his body reactions, he said that he felt warm and less tense than before. In a few sessions, Mr. G. not only achieved peace in preparation for dying but also a new quality of life.</p>

<title>Ancestors: Looking Out for Forgotten Treasures</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0362153713486101">Berne (1972</xref>) described his idea of the <italic>family parade </italic>(p. 329) and gave an example in which five generations were linked by the same injunction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0362153713486101">English (1969</xref>) described the transgenerational <italic>episcript</italic> in which the <italic>hot potato </italic>is passed on from generation to generation. Berne and English both referred to the limiting aspects of transgenerational dynamics, but I am convinced that ancestors have much more to pass on than restrictions. We just have to change perspective and look for the treasures they have to offer instead of focusing only on the limitations. Grandparents or other relatives may have played an important role in clients’ lives, either by providing them with attention or as role models if they had mastered their own fate. Even family stories passed down to clients can contain resources. The awareness of belonging to a group of people who met the challenges of life with courage, perseverance, creativity, and/or love of life serves to acknowledge the client’s origins and thus can activate his or her motivational system.</p>

<title>Case example 10</title>
<p>Mrs. H. came to counseling because she felt tired and listless. Her son had just left home, and her daughter would leave soon. She had thought a good deal about herself, her history, and her family, and she said, “Women in our family seem to live restricted lives. They just work and care for the children.” I asked her what she knew about her mother and her grandmother. She said, “Mother was mostly busy with her job. Grandmother was very tough, she seemed not to have any emotion. She had to leave her farm and care for her children on her own because her husband died early. Great-grandmother had to manage her large family and her farm alone, her husband being away in the war.” We put a chair up for each of these female ancestors. Looking at them lined up, Mrs. H. was impressed to realize how strong these women had been and what they had achieved. She said, “Wow, this seems to me like an amazingly powerful row of women.” When she acknowledged being their descendent, she started to feel proud and her posture straightened. She said, “I seem to be connected in some way with these women, as if I could connect with their power.” After this experience, she could look forward in a positive way as she developed ideas about her future and even engaged in new training for her work.</p>

<title>Resources of the Future</title>
<p>Visions of the future are sources of motivation and strength. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0362153713486101">Hüther (2006</xref>), the more a sensory arousal pattern spreads to other areas of the brain, overcoming the normally generated arousal pattern for that area, the more powerful its effect is. This is especially the case when arousal spreads to the more ancient, deeper-situated portions of the brain, which are responsible for regulating bodily functions. If an image is associated with emotional experiences, then activation patterns occur in the associative areas of the brain and are linked to the subcortical limbic areas of the brain that are closely tied to the regulation of bodily functions (p. 87).</p>
<p>In practice, Hüther’s theory means that in processing a vision for the future, the greater the attention the counselor pays to the perception of associated physical and emotional responses, the greater the likelihood that the steps required for realization of the vision will be put into motion and can help to change clients’ perceptions of themselves. Instead of being stuck in lethargy or passivity, they can perceive themselves as being able to envisage a goal and to take the necessary steps to achieve it. As this process is validated, more dopamine is released, which further helps to establish and put into action the concrete steps needed to actualize the vision.</p>
<sec id="section30-0362153713486101">
<title>Vision of a New Identity: Creating a New Treasure</title>
<p>Most people remember their childhood dreams of becoming a pilot, a researcher, a doctor, and so on. For some, this vision of a future identity was motivation enough to go through all the necessary steps to realize their dream. Sometimes clients present a possible resource in saying, “I am envious of…” or “I would like to be like…” or “Others do…with ease.” These statements express a longing for being like someone else or having a certain characteristic. Visualizing such traits can put into motion a process of allowing the client to live the dream or adopt the characteristic of the envied person.</p>
<sec id="section31-0362153713486101">
<title>Case example 11</title>
<p>It is with particular respect that I remember Mrs. I., an 85-year-old woman who felt physically and emotionally tired. She perceived herself as always waiting: waiting for time to pass, waiting for her house cleaner to come, waiting for meal service, and especially waiting to die. As an example of how she passed her days, she mentioned watching the wedding of Britain’s Prince William and Kate Middleton on television. Mrs. I. was amazed to see Queen Elizabeth, who is about her own age, walking along the red carpet gracefully accepting everyone’s honors. She then talked about her own life, in which the “honors” she had received were scarce. At one point she said, “I wish I could have had just a shade of royalty in my life.” I invited her to imagine what would be different if she started to live a little royally from then on. She considered this question for a while and then began to design her life with a royal outlook. Creating this vision of a new way to live, she started to explore her bodily reactions, emotions, and even a new posture. She spent enough time to give her body, nervous system, and brain a chance to adjust so that she finally reached a new inner perception that included the image of the queen in herself. Mrs. I. decided to stop waiting any longer and to begin immediately living her own royalty. Putting on her hat, she said, “My hat no longer serves to conceal my sparse hair but serves as the symbol of my new royalty.” She left the room with the same walking sticks that she had used before, but they had changed from tools to help support her weight to tools for walking with an upright posture and attitude.</p>

<title>Vision of the Problem Already Solved: The Treasure Lies in the Vision</title>
<p>The artistry of a goal-oriented counselor lies in arousing clients’ fantasies so that they can see the possibilities of change and then take the first step toward that change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0362153713486101">Bamberger, 2010</xref>, p. 25). De Shazer created a tool for this purpose that he called the “wonder question” (De Shazer as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0362153713486101">Bamberger, 2010</xref>, p. 11). He asks the client, “Imagine that one morning you wake up not knowing that a wonder has happened and all your problems are gone. You don’t know yet that this wonder has happened during your sleep. How would you realize during your day that the wonder has happened? What would be different, what would you do in another way? What would you do you usually don’t do?”</p>
<p>By thinking about how the situation would appear once the challenge has been mastered or the problem has been solved, the brain is stimulated to a neuronal stabilization of the conscious or unconscious information. To be consciously evoked, the internal image of the situation and the course of action, including the expected outcome, must already be present in the brain in the form of specific neuronal activation patterns. Therefore, we can only think about something and imagine it if we have already experienced it or anchored it as an internal image in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0362153713486101">Hüther, 2006</xref>, p. 87). Thus, creating a vision of the problem being already solved means establishing access to resources about which the individual is only partially aware.</p>

<title>Case example 12</title>
<p>Mr. J., a 40-year-old Internet technology specialist, was torn between the pleasure he found in his work and his wish to look for a new job with another boss. Asking him what would be different if the problem were solved, he said, “I would enjoy my job and not torment myself after work asking myself how I should have reacted differently in relation to my boss.” When I asked him what he would do instead of tormenting himself, he was at a loss for some time. Then he said, “I would probably dare to tell my boss what I want and what I don’t want instead of just performing.” Asking him to notice and describe how his body reacted and how he felt with that vision, he realized the change in his physical position and a mixture of feelings of joy and anger. He differentiated the joy of being able to stand up for himself and the anger he felt toward his boss. He recognized the anger as power that he could use in a constructive way. Through role playing he was able to fine tune the anger so that he was just clear and assertive. When he returned for his next session, he described with amazement his boss’s reaction, which Mr. J. had perceived as respectful.</p>

<title>Live Horizon: The Treasure of Acquired Wisdom</title>
<p>Another valuable resource related to the future is to have clients imagine celebrating their birthday in “old age” (or in a few years) and telling guests at the party their life story. The story includes both their present situation and the developmental steps they took to be able to celebrate their birthday in such a happy way. This way of visualizing one’s future life path retrospectively fosters the possibility of seeing today’s stress-laden situation from the perspective of a successfully lived life. It thereby permits the prefrontal cortex to think clearly and to arouse the limbic brain with the corresponding emotions. The more this image can be linked to bodily perceptions and emotions, the greater the likelihood that the system of neural connections created in such a way will enable new thoughts, feelings, and behavior.</p>
<sec id="section35-0362153713486101">
<title>Case example 13</title>
<p>For one of my clients, old age was not 80 but 35. Mr. K. lacked energy to study for his bachelor’s degree. He told me that he did not see why he had to learn so many details when he would not need them for his professional career. I asked him what he would like to achieve in his life and he said, “You know, life is difficult and uncertain, and I don’t have any idea how it will be and what will be.” However, he was willing to imagine what things could be like at the time of his 35th birthday. He knew for sure that he would celebrate his birthday with friends, his wife, his three children, and a dog. He knew that he would have a sports car for himself and another car for the family. He imagined living in a house. Each morning he would go for a walk with the dog and then start a busy day as an executive at a major business. Noticing his body reactions and his emotions with this vision of a possible future, he realized that he felt elated. The more time he spent exploring his sensations, the more his emerging vitality spread in his body. With his growing hunger for life, he felt motivated to overcome the difficulties in earning his degree as a first step toward his vision of a future life. This vision even helped him to achieve his degree with excellent scores.</p>

<title>Beyond Death: Could There Be a Treasure to Find?</title>
<p>It is not only religious people who have personal beliefs or assumptions about what comes after death. Some people believe in reincarnation, some in nonexistence, some in a life in heaven or hell, and so on. One’s belief system can be a source of hope, anxiety, or fear about life or death. Where I live in Switzerland, many adults remember that priests or nuns told them that sinners must suffer into eternity and that there is a God who sees everything, even one’s thoughts. It seems to me that these threats from religious authorities invited children to see themselves in an “I’m Not OK, You’re OK” position and made them feel constantly anxious about doing something wrong. Although as adults these individuals may have developed their own opinions about religion, they tend to feel the <italic>emotional rubberband </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0362153713486101">Kupfer &amp; Haimowitz, 1971</xref>) or pull toward those archaic feelings, especially when under stress.</p>
<sec id="section37-0362153713486101">
<title>Case example 14</title>
<p>Mrs. L, an attractive woman in her late forties, became upset whenever she thought about her 50th birthday. She felt panicked whenever she looked in the mirror and saw a new wrinkle. She interpreted wrinkles as signs of imminent death, and her fast-approaching 50th birthday meant to her that life was coming to an end. Exploring the source of her panic, she remembered the panic she felt in church after taking communion. She knew that it was impossible for her to remain in the pure state she had accessed through communion because she would inevitably have unrighteous thoughts again. When I asked about her beliefs, she explained, “I am not sure if this God is a good God or a God of vengeance. They always gave us this double message of the good Father who loves us so much that He gave his Son for us sinners, on the one hand, and the God of vengeance who punishes us for our sins, on the other. I have not come to a stable personal opinion about this yet.” I invited her to think about her own children and what she did when they did something wrong. After a time, she said, “I never stop loving them even if they have to bear the consequences of their actions.” When I asked her what consequences she would have to bear for what she had done in her life, she answered, “Oh, I would probably have to stand up for quite a few errors, but I guess it would be in a way like it has been for my children. Sometimes it was quite arduous for them. My daughter once told me that the punishments felt OK because in some way they cleaned up the wrong. Maybe I could start seeing my relationship to God in a more adult way. I am able to stand up for my faults and I think I could look him in the eye, although I guess that ‘looking him in the eye’ is a rather human, childlike phrase.” Mrs. L. started to change her image of the hereafter, and while she adjusted her way of communicating with God, she started to plan her 50th birthday celebration and bought herself a face treatment for advanced beauty.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0362153713486101">Hargaden and Sills (2002</xref>) view “therapy as a journey of discovery, which can therefore go beyond the limits of the initial therapeutic contract” (p. 32). I also view counseling as a journey of discovery that may lead to undiscovered or unexpected richness. In keeping with Hargaden and Sills’s perspective, we could define the counselor’s task as to serve as a guide for this resource-discovering journey or a tutor for the treasure hunt.</p>
<p>A client of mine once described her counseling experience as follows: “You consider what I tell you about the challenges of my daily life, and you help me see the quality in my thinking, feeling, and behavior. Interestingly, this approach allows me to feel much better, to be more generous with myself, and to try out new ways of behaving.”</p>
<p>I am inspired time and again by the power of my clients’ resources, which enables them to enhance the quality of their lives. To witness this process keeps alive my motivation and my love for the treasure hunt. I know that most of my colleagues share my love for the counseling profession and enjoy seeing themselves as representatives of a profession that needs engagement, merits respect, and offers variety and satisfaction.</p>
