<abstract>
<p>This article explores ways of evaluating the performance of the press in an electoral public sphere and compares the output of newspapers in England and in Scotland during the 2001 and 2005 general election campaigns. It combines content analysis with critical discussion of examples of coverage and complements these with evidence from interviews with Scottish political editors. It argues that, even though Scottish newspapers gave less coverage to the two elections than titles sold in England, both sets of newspapers performed better in their role as providers of information and opinion to inform the electorate, than in that of presenting an inclusive, discursive and diverse electoral debate or encouraging forms of active citizenry.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In modern large democratic societies, where direct, collective, face-to-face participation in political debate is no longer possible, the role of the media in facilitating deliberative democracy, namely opinion formation and decision-making among citizens through discussion and argumentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884911398335">Elster, 1998</xref>), is recognized but also widely debated.</p>
<p>This article explores existing proposals on how the performance of the press in democratic debate may be evaluated and compares the coverage of the 2001 and 2005 Westminster elections in daily morning newspapers produced in Scotland and in England. The findings of this analysis are supplemented with the insights of Scottish political editors who covered the two elections. The paper contributes to the debate regarding the role of the press within a separate Scottish public sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884911398335">Crawford, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884911398335">Higgins, 2006</xref>) and to a wider discussion about the potential of commercial media to support democratic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884911398335">Bennett et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911398335">Feree et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884911398335">Gamson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884911398335">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464884911398335">Peters et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>The media and the public sphere</title>
<p>An influential theory in projects which attempt to evaluate journalistic practice against normative requirements of deliberative democracy is the Habermasian concept of the public sphere. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884911398335">Habermas (1989)</xref>, the public sphere is an arena of public debate where citizens form opinions about issues of common concern and influence political decisions by participating in a process of public deliberation and rational argumentation. The academic debate around Habermas’s theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884911398335">Dahlgren, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884911398335">Fraser, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464884911398335">Habermas, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884911398335">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464884911398335">Verstraeten, 1996</xref>) has helped to develop a useful model to conceptualize opinion formation in a contemporary democracy. In this model the public sphere is seen as a field of struggle between groups who claim recognition of their perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884911398335">Habermas, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite his early pessimism regarding the effects that mediated communication has had on public deliberation, in his later writings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884911398335">Habermas (1996)</xref> recognizes the potential role of the media in enabling public debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464884911398335">Habermas, 1992</xref>). Although he remains sceptical about the contribution of commercial media to rational deliberation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884911398335">Habermas, 1996</xref>: 377), he recognizes that mediated communication is vital in bringing together the ‘abstract public sphere of isolated readers, listeners, and viewers scattered across large geographic areas’ and in making it more inclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884911398335">1996</xref>: 374).</p>
<p>A question of particular relevance for this article is how exactly the media can or should contribute to democratic inclusion and decision-making. A number of attempts have been made to set up evaluative criteria for the contribution of the media to democracy. These suggestions derive from different approaches to deliberative democracy and are outlined in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p>Habermas himself proposed that the media should presuppose and encourage an inquisitive, critical public, be independent from political interests, allow access to actors who present convincing arguments, and promote debate on issues which were put in the agenda by the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884911398335">1996</xref>: 378–379). In Habermas’s approach, the media should primarily promote rational, argumentative deliberation between different perspectives.</p>
<p>Liberal approaches to democracy, on the other hand, see the media’s role as providing information that will help citizens make informed choices during election time; encouraging people to vote; representing the views of the governed to the government and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911398335">Feree et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884911398335">Hackett, 2005</xref>). In this approach, ordinary members of the public are not expected to participate directly in governance other than by voting at elections. By contrast, in democratic theories which require popular inclusion, the media are expected to include and privilege the perspectives of ordinary members of the public, especially of those who have little access to power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884911398335">Curran, 2000</xref>). More importantly, in this latter approach the media are required to promote citizen engagement with politics by presenting ordinary citizens as agents actively involved in solving problems; giving prominence to actors from civil society; integrating their discourse in media accounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884911398335">Gamson, 2001</xref>); and presenting citizens as contributing to political debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884911398335">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet such normative perspectives appear idealistic to many. Blumler and Gurevitch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464884911398335">1995</xref>: 96), for instance, suggest that media output is the product of established professional practices and industry demands whose primary concern is not the promotion of democratic purposes. Others argue that the media not only do not promote democratic participation, but are actually the reason why people are turning away from politics. The tabloidization and commercialization of news, the proliferation of entertainment over ‘serious’ news, the cynicism of journalists and the populist coverage of politics, the journalistic focus on corruption, spin and scandal are seen as responsible for creating poorly informed voters with no interest in politics and a distrust of the political system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884911398335">Barnett, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884911398335">Franklin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884911398335">Lloyd, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1464884911398335">Sparks, 1991</xref>). Such concerns echo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884911398335">Habermas’s (1989)</xref> initial pessimistic view of mediated communication.</p>

<title>Problematizing the role of the media in the public sphere</title>
<p>A number of studies have sought to test the normative requirements of democratic theorists by applying them to evaluate real examples of media output. Studies such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884911398335">Bennett et al.’s (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911398335">Feree et al.’s (2002)</xref> count the number of times different actors are given access in press debates on globalization and abortion respectively. They also count instances of dialogue between sources of different social position. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911398335">Feree et al. (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464884911398335">Peters et al. (2008)</xref> additionally test Habermas’s criteria for rational, deliberative argumentation in mediated coverage of public affairs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884911398335">Lewis et al. (2005)</xref> focus specifically on the mediated construction of ordinary citizen voices.</p>
<p>The results of these studies are generally disheartening regarding the potential of the media to promote democratic inclusion and dialogue: news and opinion coverage is largely dominated by elites, does not empower citizen participation in public affairs<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1464884911398335">1</xref></sup> by offering examples of active citizenry (with few exceptions), fails to promote dialogue between different social strata or to offer adequate rational argumentation and juxtapose viewpoints in opinion pieces.</p>
<p>With specific reference to the Scottish press and using similar criteria of access and representation of different voices in the media, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884911398335">Crawford (2009)</xref> looked at opinion pages in <italic>The Scotsman</italic> and <italic>The Herald</italic>, the two newspapers that claim a ‘national’ status in Scotland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884911398335">Meech and Kilborn, 1992</xref>) and found that they offer limited access to opinion authors other than professional journalists (although <italic>The Scotsman</italic> had more non-journalist authors than <italic>The Herald</italic>), no access to non-elite authors and inadequate discussion of Scottish public policy.</p>
<p>The empirical studies discussed above measure the inclusiveness of mediated debate, and the degree of discursive argumentation in political coverage. A different approach, again with reference to the Scottish context, is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884911398335">Higgins’s (2006)</xref> analysis of press coverage of the first election to the Scottish parliament in 1999. He focuses instead on whether and how newspapers make information and opinion available in order to assist their readership in making an informed choice at the election. He finds that Scottish newspapers have a distinctive contribution, offering their readers more coverage of the election than English titles, especially as the election day approaches, more opinion coverage in particular to provide evaluation and arguments, and more election material published in the prominent front part of the paper.</p>
<p>Newspapers’ performance in the public sphere may hence be evaluated based on how much input they offer to inform political deliberation and informed choice; on whether they offer access to and present a dialogue between a variety of perspectives; and on whether they empower members of the public as participants in public affairs through examples of active citizenry. These are the criteria used in the following analysis of the coverage of the two general elections.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1464884911398335" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This article compares the performance of newspapers produced in England and in Scotland during the 2001 and 2005 general elections. Since devolution came about, the Scottish Parliament has powers over devolved issues in Scotland, such as healthcare, education, transport and law and order; while issues such as foreign policy, defence, taxation and broadcasting remain reserved to Westminster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884911398335">Schlesinger, 1998</xref>). In England, on the other hand, all these powers remain the responsibility of Westminster. The Scottish electorate participates in general elections for the Westminster government; however, because of the devolution settlement, not all policy issues in a general election campaign are relevant in Scotland.</p>
<p>This article examines whether newspapers in the two nations offer their respective readerships equal input for their electoral deliberations, and whether they mediate an inclusive and deliberative debate between a diversity of perspectives. The papers examined are <italic>The Scotsman, The Herald, The Daily Record, The Press and Journal</italic> (Aberdeen), <italic>The Courier</italic> (Dundee), <italic>The Scottish Sun, The Scottish Daily Mail</italic> (Scottish sample) and <italic>The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian, The Sun, The Daily Mail</italic> and <italic>The Daily Mirror</italic> (referred to as the English/UK sample in this article). The articles were retrieved from the Lexis-Nexis database and were read carefully during the analysis process. Parts of the material were cross-checked against hard copies of the newspapers to ensure the reliability of the sample gathered electronically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884911398335">Deacon, 2007</xref>), while the articles from <italic>The Courier</italic> were retrieved from hard-copy archives only, as they were not available on the database.</p>
<p>Although a comparison is made between coverage of the elections in both England and Scotland, there is a particular focus on Scottish newspapers and the extent to which their performance in the electoral debate is distinctive, as might be expected within a separate Scottish public sphere. For this reason, comments from a limited number of interviews with Scottish political editors who covered both campaigns are cited to further illuminate relevant points in the analysis of the data.</p>
<p>The newspapers in the sample represent different political convictions and positions in the market. Elite, middle market and tabloid titles are included, as well as newspapers which position themselves as ‘national’ titles, in Scotland (for instance <italic>The Scotsman</italic> and <italic>The Herald</italic>) and in the UK (for instance <italic>The Daily Telegraph</italic> and <italic>The Guardian</italic>). Of course the extent to which any newspaper may be truly national in its content is questionable, as these newspapers tend to reflect the news of their respective areas more comprehensively than that of their respective nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884911398335">MacInnes et al., 2007</xref>). The sample also includes titles with different editions for different parts of the UK (<italic>The Sun</italic> and <italic>The Daily Mail</italic>) and titles produced in non-central belt areas of Scotland such as Dundee and Aberdeen. They are all among the highest selling newspapers in England and in Scotland at the time of the two elections.</p>
<p>The reason why <italic>The Courier</italic> and <italic>The Press and Journal</italic>, two ‘regional’ (although as argued previously the dividing line between ‘national’ and ‘regional’ press is debatable) Scottish titles were included in the sample relates to the distribution of the readership of the Scottish press. The Audit Bureau of Circulations<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1464884911398335">2</xref></sup> classifies <italic>The Scotsman</italic> and <italic>The Herald</italic> under national newspapers, while <italic>The Aberdeen Press and Journal</italic> and <italic>The Dundee Courier</italic> are classified among regional titles. However, none of these four daily morning papers is bought evenly throughout Scotland and their readership is very much based in their respective cities. Moreover, their circulation numbers are comparable and in some cases the regional titles outsell considerably the ‘national’ Scottish press. Therefore the national aspirations of the latter are not always accompanied by equivalent sales or geographical distribution of readership.</p>
<p>Based on the evaluation criteria for newspaper performance in the public sphere identified at the end of the previous section, the entire coverage of the 2001 and 2005 campaigns (all articles referring to the election published between 9 May and 7 June 2001, and between 7 April and 5 May 2005 respectively) in these newspapers was initially subjected to a content analysis which examines whether the overall quantitative patterns of the coverage can be seen as ‘making a contribution to informed political action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884911398335">Higgins, 2006</xref>: 25). The second part of the analysis then focuses on aspects of access, dialogue and empowerment of different voices. It looks at four one-day samples, two for each election year, which comprise the coverage of the same four themes across all the Scottish and English/UK papers: taxation on 22 May 2001, the Iraq war on 29 April 2005, and health on 1 June 2001 and on 15 April 2005. Through a content analysis which counts how often different sources are quoted, this part of the analysis explores whether newspapers are equally inclusive of different social actors when reporting on the same topics. Excerpts from the articles are additionally examined to discuss the way sources are constructed as well as whether there is evidence of dialogue between different perspectives.</p>

<sec id="section5-1464884911398335">
<title>Helping readers make an informed choice</title>
<p>As I discussed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884911398335">Dekavalla, 2009</xref>) in both election periods the seven Scottish titles gave less coverage to the elections than the five English/UK titles. In 2001 the five English/UK papers had 50.9 per cent of the total election coverage across both samples, and in 2005 they had 57.7 per cent of the coverage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1464884911398335">3</xref></sup> These numbers do not mean that the coverage of the Scottish and English/UK papers was equal in 2001 and changed in 2005: given that the study included more Scottish than English/UK titles, I also calculated the average number of words per newspaper in the English/UK and the Scottish sample and found a consistent gap between the amount of coverage in the two parts of the UK in both election years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1464884911398335">Table 1</xref>). This leads to the conclusion that in both elections Scottish newspapers offered their readers less input on the basis of which to deliberate and make an informed decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884911398335">Hackett, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884911398335">Higgins, 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>The Scottish political editors interviewed for this research suggested that the significance of general elections has diminished in Scotland since the establishment of the Scottish parliament. They recognized, however, that the question of which party is in charge at Westminster still has great influence on the direction Scotland takes and on its relationship with the rest of the UK. Yet the 2001 and 2005 elections in particular had little interest because the result was predictable and there was little possibility that the UK government would change. Their perception of the significance of these two elections therefore is consistent with the amount of coverage their papers provided.</p>
<p>While the amount of English/UK newspaper coverage is at similar levels in both elections, there seems to be a drop in the Scottish coverage which is due to a drop in the coverage of <italic>The Scotsman</italic> and <italic>The Herald</italic>. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1464884911398335">Figure 1</xref>, the rest of the Scottish press dedicated similar amounts of space to both elections, while <italic>The Scottish Daily Mail</italic> and <italic>The Courier</italic> even slightly increased their output.</p>

<p>A decline of interest in the 2005 election is not unique to <italic>The Scotsman</italic> and <italic>The Herald</italic> and was found in other media as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884911398335">Deacon et al., 2006</xref>); however, it does not appear in any of the other papers examined here. Only one of the Scottish political editors from these two titles was interviewed for this project and he explained that his title decided to focus less on the 2005 election, first because it was not particularly ‘groundbreaking’ and little change was expected in the results; and second because his paper had to balance between covering both the Westminster electoral debate and the political developments at the Scottish parliament. In this process the coverage of the Scottish parliament took priority:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We covered what was going on here and the election at the same time. […] I think it was a recognition that in Scottish terms, in terms of domestic policy, what was more important in that sense was the Scottish elections. And perhaps it was that by 2005 the feeling had shifted away from Westminster enough for it not to be quite as all-important as it had been before.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It is worth noting here that, although only <italic>The Scotsman</italic> and <italic>The Herald</italic> among the Scottish titles dropped their coverage significantly between the two years, all the Scottish titles have consistently lower coverage of the general election in both years than comparable titles in the English/UK sample. This means that <italic>The Scotsman</italic> and <italic>The Herald</italic> have less coverage than the two UK elite titles, <italic>The Guardian</italic> and <italic>The Daily Telegraph; The Scottish Daily Mail</italic> has less coverage than <italic>The Daily Mail; The Daily Record</italic> has less coverage than both the English popular titles, <italic>The Sun</italic> and <italic>The Mirror</italic>. The only exception in this pattern is the Scottish edition of <italic>The Sun</italic>, which has more coverage than its English edition in both years.</p>
<p>Despite the difference in the overall amount of coverage, the Scottish and English/UK samples appear quite similar with regard to the other criteria set by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884911398335">Higgins (2006)</xref>, namely the balance between news and opinion coverage, the distribution of coverage during the campaign, and the positioning of coverage in the front part of the paper.</p>
<p>In both samples, the majority of the coverage consisted of news articles. Although news is not necessarily opinion free, it is used here as a separate category to ‘opinion’ coverage, which refers to openly evaluative content, clearly marked as such by its position in separate opinion columns within the newspapers. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464884911398335">Table 2</xref> shows the distribution of informative (news) and evaluative (signed opinion items, editorials, readers’ letters) articles in each sample.</p>

<p>Despite the differences in the balance between different types of evaluative coverage,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1464884911398335">4</xref></sup> there is a striking similarity in the overall proportion of informative versus evaluative content in the two sets of newspapers in both years. This means that papers on the two sides of the Scottish border offered their readers a similar mix of information about the election and opinion or advice which could help them in their electoral decision.</p>
<p>The other two criteria, the distribution of coverage during the campaign, and the positioning of coverage in the front part of the paper, reveal equally little distinction between the two groups of newspapers. Although in 2001 both English/UK and Scottish newspapers provide more news coverage as the election day approaches, in 2005 no such pattern is observed in either sample. Although pagination of election coverage was not examined across the whole length of the paper, as was done in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884911398335">Higgins’ (2006)</xref> research, the amount of material appearing on the first pages is generally similar in the two sets of newspapers and only in 2005 do English/UK papers provide more front-page coverage of the election than Scottish ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884911398335">Dekavalla, 2009</xref>). This finding might reflect the declining significance accorded to the 2005 election by some titles, which was discussed earlier.</p>
<p>If the role of the media in the public sphere is to provide information and evaluation that will help citizens make informed choices during election time, this section has argued that both English/UK and Scottish newspapers did that in 2001 and 2005, although to different degrees. The major difference between them is the more limited attention to these elections by the Scottish titles, which consistently provide less coverage than their counterparts in England. This appears to be supported by the political editors interviewed: on the one hand they argue that general elections remain relevant in a devolved Scotland (thus they still receive coverage), but on the other hand the establishment of the Scottish parliament shifted the focus toward Holyrood and the Scottish elections in a period where there was little suspense in relation to the outcome of the general elections.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1464884911398335">
<title>Presenting an inclusive, deliberative debate</title>
<p>Having looked at how much input newspapers offer to their readers for deliberation and decision-making, I now turn to compare them on the degree of inclusiveness and dialogue among different perspectives in the coverage which, as explained earlier, is considered by theorists as an indication of the media’s contribution to deliberative democratic processes. I focus particularly on four smaller samples of coverage and examine which sources are offered access to voice their perspectives, either by being quoted in an article (in direct or indirect speech) or by authoring opinion pieces. The quantitative evidence is supported by excerpts which illustrate the representation of different sources as well as the extent to which dialogue is constructed between them.</p>
<p>The four one-day samples were selected among the coverage of the most mentioned reserved and devolved issue of each election (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884911398335">Dekavalla, 2009</xref>). Looking at the coverage of the events of the same day across different newspapers allows for more comparable material to be evaluated. The four dates included in the sample were chosen to accommodate both topics covered by all newspapers (for example, taxation and health debates at Westminster and the Iraq war) and topics only covered in the Scottish press (the possibility of fiscal autonomy for Scotland and Scottish hospital waiting lists).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1464884911398335">
<title>‘UK’ topics: Access given to political voices in the debate</title>
<p>In fact this distinction between topics covered on both sides of the border and topics only covered in Scotland appears significant in relation to the sources given access to the mediated debate. Topics covered in both groups of newspapers (hereafter referred to as ‘UK’ topics) include the Iraq war, taxation and a debate on healthcare at Westminster level, which, despite the devolved nature of the issue, is covered in both Scottish and English/UK titles. Topics covered only in Scotland (hereafter referred to as ‘Scottish’ topics) include fiscal autonomy and waiting lists at Scottish hospitals.</p>
<p>As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1464884911398335">Table 3</xref>, the coverage of ‘UK’ issues in both Scottish and English/UK newspapers is dominated by UK political parties and their representatives. The balance in the access given to these parties is also consistent in the two newspaper groups: Labour sources consistently receive more attention than the Conservatives, except in the coverage of the taxation debate at Westminster on the day of my sample, where Conservative sources have a greater share in the debate.</p>

<p>A relative absence in the coverage of ‘UK’ issues is the perspective of Scottish sources. At least on the days sampled here, sources which have any particular relevance to Scotland rarely appear in the coverage. A few instances were found in the coverage of the Iraq war, for example:</p>
<sec id="section8-1464884911398335">
<title>Excerpt 1</title>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In a ferocious attack, the father of the House of Commons in the previous parliament [Tam Dalyell], who is standing down at this election after serving as MP for Linlithgow, said Mr. Blair should step down as Prime Minister in the ‘first week in May’ because of his conduct over Iraq. (<italic>The Courier</italic>, 29 April 2005, news, p.1)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1464884911398335">
<title>Excerpt 2</title>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Former Foreign Secretary Robin Cook has warned Tony Blair that he won’t let him off the hook over the legal advice he got on the war in Iraq. (Sinclair, <italic>The Daily Record</italic>, 29 April 2005, news, p. 8)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Tam Dalyell and Robin Cook are Scottish MPs but, because they have previously held elite status at Westminster, they are constructed in excerpts 1 and 2 as Westminster veterans, through referential expressions such as ‘the father of the House of Commons in the previous parliament’ and ‘Former Foreign Secretary’. Therefore they do not appear exclusively because of their Scottish identity. They both appear only in certain newspaper titles on the day examined: Tam Dalyell is quoted only in the coverage of <italic>The Courier</italic> and <italic>The Press and Journal</italic>, while Robin Cook appears in <italic>The Courier, The Press and Journal</italic> and <italic>The Daily Record</italic> because on the day before he had made statements during a visit to Aberdeen and Dundee. His visit therefore gives him particular relevance in these areas.</p>
<p>Both politicians appear as the main sources in the respective articles and are offered the primary position in the discussion. Despite this prominence, Tam Dalyell and Robin Cook make comments about the performance of a UK politician, without talking from a particularly Scottish perspective. Although they give the coverage of the Iraq war regional relevance (Linlithgow is mentioned in relation to Dalyell and Cook’s visit to Aberdeen is mentioned later the article from which excerpt 2 was taken), the debate is not about them or about Scotland, but about Tony Blair.</p>
<p>Less well-known Scottish Westminster candidates on the other hand are even more rare in the coverage of ‘UK’ issues. The only occasion where a Scottish local Westminster candidate is quoted in these samples is one feature article in <italic>The Daily Record</italic> about the implications of Iraq for the campaign in East Dunbartonshire. This absence appears odd because reserved issues such as foreign policy (the Iraq war) and taxation are areas within MPs’ influence and should play an important role in their election. Their absence appears consistent with the perceived importance of Scottish Westminster MPs among the Scottish political editors interviewed. Two of the interviewees argued that MPs in Scotland are less relevant in a post-devolution context because the issues they control are not daily ‘bread and butter’ issues. Of course, being based in Holyrood, the political editors interviewed would be expected to perceive the Scottish Parliament and its members as more important. Scottish Westminster candidates though are absent from all the coverage of ‘UK’ issues in these sampling dates, even in papers which have correspondents in both parliaments.</p>
<p>So far two features of the coverage of the ‘UK’ topics have been identified: the similarity in the balance of sources quoted in English/UK and Scottish titles, and the absence of a distinctive Scottish perspective. A third feature which differentiates the coverage of these topics to that of ‘Scottish’ ones discussed below, is the occasionally prominent position of non-political sources.</p>

<title>‘UK’ topics: Access given to non-political party voices in the debate</title>
<p>Although it might be expected within the context of a general election that politicians would be the primary definers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464884911398335">Hall et al., 1978</xref>) in the coverage, there are instances where other groups are allowed to voice their perspectives. All the quotations of ordinary citizens in the Iraq coverage in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1464884911398335">Table 3</xref> come from the two editions of <italic>The Daily Mail</italic>. The newspaper gives access in its coverage to the private sphere of the lifeworld (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884911398335">Habermas, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884911398335">1996</xref>). This is achieved by giving voice to the personal narratives of those directly affected by the war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884911398335">Fraser, 1992</xref>). For example:</p>
<sec id="section11-1464884911398335">
<title>Excerpt 3</title>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>HE MUST QUIT SAY ANGRY FAMILIES</p>
<p>[…] Samantha Roberts, whose tank commander husband Sergeant Steven Roberts was killed by friendly fire, said: ‘For those of us who lost our loved ones and for tens of thousands who died in Iraq this all comes too late.</p>
<p>‘If the war was illegal, Blair could have saved a lot of lives by refusing to go along with it. The whole thing is a mess. Those responsible should just step down.’</p>
<p>‘Alastair Campbell should be hanged, drawn and quartered for all his spinning.’ Peter Brierley, whose 28-year-old son, Lance Corporal Shaun Brierley, died in a crash in Kuwait, said: ‘It seems Tony Blair misled the whole country. He should resign.’ (Hickley and Greenhill, <italic>The Daily Mail</italic>, English edition, 29 April 2005, feature, p.7)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The two citizen sources in Excerpt 3 appear quite emotional and aggressive toward politicians. Peter Brierley, for instance, uses hyperbole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1464884911398335">Swartz, 1976</xref>) to express his anger (‘Campbell should be hanged, drawn and quartered’). However, citizens here do not simply talk of their experience as relatives of soldiers who died in the war. The modality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884911398335">Richardson, 2007</xref>: 116) of their statements (‘should step down’, ‘should resign’) suggests solutions to the political problem in question. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884911398335">Lewis et al. (2005)</xref> argue that instances where members of the public make suggestions on how political problems should be addressed are rare in media coverage, yet the Iraq coverage of the two editions of <italic>The Daily Mail</italic> features several such instances on my sampling day. The families of dead soldiers in <italic>The Daily Mail</italic> are constructed as the primary definers of the issue: this is also clear in the inclusion of their views in the headline of the article, which frames what follows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884911398335">Conboy, 2007</xref>: 57).</p>
<p>
<italic>The Daily Mail</italic> is a Conservative newspaper and all its coverage of Iraq on that day is critical of Labour’s performance. Citizens hence are voicing the suggestions that journalists themselves would perhaps be reluctant to express so forcefully in a news article. As Lewis et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884911398335">2005</xref>: 85) put it, ‘using the “ordinary person” with whom the audience can identify is a way of mobilizing moral outrage, without compromising the objectivity of the reporter’. Moreover, the deployment of ordinary citizens here adds spontaneous emotion and authenticity to the statement, as well as a human interest aspect to the story. At the same time though, their presence makes the coverage more inclusive and potentially empowers citizens as participants in democratic debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911398335">Feree et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884911398335">Gamson, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>More perspectives of members of the public appear in the coverage of the health debate at Westminster level in 2001. This time patients express their dissatisfaction with the Westminster government’s health policies. This may be seen as an instance whereby personal experiences of service systems ‘assimilated privately’ gain access to public debate, because ‘the communication channels of the public sphere are linked to private spheres’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884911398335">Habermas, 1996</xref>: 313). In other words, as in the Iraq coverage above, members of the public are again included because they have personal experience of the political issue discussed:</p>

<sec id="section12-1464884911398335">
<title>Excerpt 4</title>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Stephen Howard, whose five-year-old daughter Kirsty is dying from a rare heart disorder, met Mr Blair and his wife Cherie nearly four months ago in Downing Street. […] ‘I was impressed by Mr Blair when we met him,’ said Mr Howard, a fork lift truck driver. ‘But none of us could understand a word of the letter that we eventually received from him. We were hoping to get something positive from him, but all we got was a load of facts and figures. It was complete gobbledegook. Now we just live day by day. I get up in the morning to check that Kirsty is still breathing.’ (Baker, <italic>The Daily Telegraph</italic>, 1 June 2001, feature, p. 9)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Stephen Howard in Excerpt 4 represents the voice of ordinary citizens. He is included in the debate because of his experience as the father of an ill child who has requested the support of the political establishment. However, he is constructed here as powerless and dependent on the powerful politician. He is introduced as ‘a fork lift truck driver’, hence emphasizing his generic status as an ordinary working-class man (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884911398335">Van Leeuwen, 1996</xref>: 47). Many of his statements present a contrast between his status, as a powerless ordinary man (‘I was impressed by Mr. Blair’, ‘we were hoping to get something positive from him’, ‘we just live day by day’), and that of the powerful politician who talks an incomprehensible language (‘none of us could understand a word’, ‘it was complete gobbledegook’). Mr Howard’s role is to narrate his personal experience, without making any links to its political implications or possible solutions. He criticizes politicians but does not promote political solutions; he only provides ‘emotional content’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884911398335">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>: 88–9).</p>
<p>It may be concluded from the above discussion that ordinary members of the public occasionally make the coverage of ‘UK’ issues more diverse, although they are not always constructed as powerful. As is argued in what follows though, the debates constructed as ‘Scottish’ have two distinguishing features: the absence of Westminster sources and the marginal position of citizens’ voices. Both features contrast with what has been discussed about the coverage of ‘UK’ issues.</p>

<p>As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1464884911398335">Table 4</xref>, the ‘Scottish’ debates are dominated by Scottish political parties and their representatives. The two-party debate between Labour and the Conservatives observed in the coverage of ‘UK’ topics here includes more parties. Especially in the discussion of fiscal autonomy, Scottish Labour, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and SNP sources have an almost equal amount of contribution.</p>

<p>The presence of the SNP in these debates is also noteworthy. SNP sources appear in all three topics and, particularly in the Scottish waiting lists debate in 2005, they claim the second share of the voice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1464884911398335">Table 4</xref>). Deacon et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884911398335">2006</xref>: 253) also discuss the presence of the SNP in the election coverage but argue that UK-wide parties remain dominant. Although this is also true in the samples of coverage examined here, SNP sources have more presence in the ‘Scottish’ topics than in the ‘UK’ ones while, as discussed later, they are constructed as the main opposition to Labour on these issues.</p>
<p>My interviews with political editors seem to suggest that the SNP was particularly active in trying to manage the general election agenda. According to one interviewee, the party promoted issues which were less important for other parties because ‘it’s within its interest to give a lot of emphasis on all policies, because they want to be seen as a party that could govern an independent Scotland’. Although the issues examined here do not appear to have been explicitly ‘pushed’ onto the agenda by the SNP, this comment suggests a particularly intense communication effort by the party, which may have resulted in more access for its representatives. Another reason may have been the decline in the popularity of the Conservatives in Scotland, which according to McNair led Scottish papers to ‘[lose] interest in the Conservatives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884911398335">2008</xref>: 238).</p>
<p>In contrast to the coverage of the ‘UK’ topics, Westminster politicians (with the exception of the Scottish Secretary, who appears regularly in this coverage due to particular relevance in Scotland) appear very rarely in ‘Scottish’ issues. Only in the Scottish waiting lists coverage in 2005 does UK Labour appear as a source. However, these quotations do not make a direct contribution to the topic discussed:</p>

</p>
<p>As Exemplified in Excerpt 5, the Scottish coverage on that day mentions nine times (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1464884911398335">Table 4</xref>) that the English manifesto/Labour in England/Tony Blair promises reduced waiting lists. However, these statements are taken from the English Labour manifesto and are used by the papers to make comparisons with Scotland. Nobody from the English Labour party is presented as making statements directly in relation to Scottish waiting lists.</p>

<title>‘Scottish’ topics: Access given to non-political party voices in the debate</title>
<p>Another absence from the mediated debate on these topics is that of ordinary citizen voices. The main voices represented are those of Scottish politicians and the Scottish Secretary. Only in the case of fiscal autonomy does another group participate in the debate, namely a group of economists and academics. However, these academics are not quoted in their role as ordinary members of the public. They have elite status because they speak in their capacity as experts on fiscal matters.</p>

<title>Excerpt 6</title>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>ECONOMISTS’ LETTER PROMPTS SNP VALIDATION OVER FUNDING</p>
<p>Scotland’s constitutional future yesterday moved to the fore of the election campaign, when economists and politicians clashed over whether the country should have more fiscal powers.</p>
<p>A group of 12 economists and academics called for Scotland to have control of all tax and revenue raising, arguing this was necessary for ‘accountability and responsibility’. (<italic>The Press and Journal</italic>, 22 May 2001, news, p. 1)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In Excerpt 6, the economists’ intervention is the agent which causes the response of political actors (it is the subject of transitive verb ‘prompts’) in the headline, while in the lead sentence the economists are constructed as equal participants in the debate, being subjects, along with politicians, of the intransitive verb ‘clashed’. Their statement in the second paragraph is presented as categorical: ‘called for’, as opposed to alternatives ‘suggested’ or ‘proposed’, has overtones of assertiveness. Their appearance in thematic position in the headline, and the fact that political actors are the ones who respond to the economists’ statements later in the article, further reinforces their role as primary definers. The economists are offered access and prominence in the coverage because they have expert knowledge, which gives them elite status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884911398335">Boyce, 2006</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section17-1464884911398335">
<title>Mediated access to the debate: Overall comparison between the two samples</title>
<p>I have argued so far that, in terms of the access offered to different sources, Scottish and English/UK titles are quite similar when they cover the same topics. Issues which are presented as relevant to the UK in both sets of newspapers are debated primarily between Westminster Labour and Conservatives, with few other interventions. Members of the public are occasionally offered the opportunity to discuss their perspectives, but their role in general terms is to illustrate problems through their experiences. These limited citizen perspectives are absent from the ‘Scottish’ debates, which take place almost exclusively between the four main Scottish parties, without any participation of Westminster politicians. Occasionally experts are involved in the discussion, but their role as experts is what offers them access in the coverage.</p>
<p>Despite these differences, the coverage of ‘Scottish’ and ‘UK’ issues across all the papers studied is similar in that opinion articles are consistently written by journalists in the days of my sample. Occasional articles by politicians are also found, but other non-professional writers have no access to opinion pages. Of the 43 opinion articles examined in the four days, 37 were written by professional journalists and six by politicians. Even though journalists support a diversity of viewpoints, limited access is offered to other social actors to voice their perspectives in their own discourse.</p>
<p>The discussion so far shows that neither Scottish, nor English/UK newspapers fulfil the criteria set by participatory democratic theory, which requires the media to offer access to a diversity of sources, from both within and beyond the major political parties. Quite a lot of the coverage studied simply presents the views of the major parties to the electorate, as a representative model of democracy would require (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911398335">Feree et al., 2002</xref>). The coverage of ‘Scottish’ topics in the Scottish press is even closer to that model, because few other sources have any access at all to the debate.</p>

<title>Dialogue between different voices in the electoral debate</title>
<p>Turning now to the degree of dialogue between different sources, again it appears that any exchanges reported are between high-profile politicians from the main parties.</p>

<p>Ms Sturgeon said: ‘Can the first minister tell us why his target is 36 weeks – double what it is in England?’</p>
<p>Mr McConnell told MSPs: ‘The target that Ms Sturgeon refers to is for 2008. Our targets here in Scotland are for 2007.’ (Quinn and Pauling, <italic>The Press and Journal</italic>, 15 May 2005, news, p. 15)</p>

</p>
<p>Excerpts 7 and 8 are from the coverage of Iraq and Scottish waiting lists respectively and demonstrate instances where politicians of different parties respond to each other. However, these exchanges do not amount to an in-depth deliberation of the issues in question: political sources from the two main parties merely accuse their opponents and respond to accusations, reproducing a sense of politics as a match between government and opposition. The juxtaposition of perspectives fulfils the news value of conflict rather than attempting to present a range of views on the issues discussed.</p>
<p>Excerpt 8 in particular is one of several occasions where the SNP appears to hold the main opposition role to Scottish Labour in the coverage of ‘Scottish’ health. As mentioned earlier, SNP sources are quoted as often and in some cases more often than the Conservatives in the coverage of ‘Scottish’ issues. This might create the impression that the SNP agenda of independence is prominent in the coverage of these issues. Yet there is no such evidence in my samples. What the SNP seems to contribute, as illustrated in Excerpt 8, is a discursive challenge to Scottish Labour, similar to that of the Conservatives in Excerpt 7. The SNP therefore simply replaces the Conservatives as the main opposition party in some of the ‘Scottish’ issues.</p>
<p>These examples demonstrate that there are opportunities for some level of exchange in the coverage of both English/UK and Scottish newspapers of different issues, and this takes place primarily between senior members of the main UK and/or Scottish parties.</p>
<p>Other participants in verbal exchanges with politicians are experts, as illustrated in Excerpt 6 earlier. As argued in relation to that excerpt from the fiscal autonomy coverage, academics are constructed as the primary definers of the article and politicians respond to their statements. However, the exchange does not include ordinary members of the public (as explained, the economists have elite status deriving from their expertise), who do not participate in any dialogue on the issues studied.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This article has compared the performance of newspapers within the public sphere of general elections after Scottish devolution based on criteria derived from normative accounts of the role of the media in the public sphere and previous research.</p>
<p>One of the basic requirements for the media is to provide the electorate with adequate information on political developments to allow them to make informed choices at elections. This requirement is emphasized more in liberal models of democracy which place particular weight on the role of citizens as voters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911398335">Feree et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884911398335">Hackett, 2005</xref>). In this respect, Scottish newspapers provided less input to their readership for further deliberation and decision-making compared to English/UK titles. Based on this finding it could be said that their performance in the electoral public sphere was not as strong as that of English/UK newspapers. Apart from this though, Scottish papers provided a similar mix of informative and evaluative material to their English counterparts and gave similar prominence to their election coverage.</p>
<p>Other normative requirements of deliberative democratic theory for the media have to do with including a diversity of political viewpoints, presenting a dialogue between different perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884911398335">Habermas, 1996</xref>) and encouraging participation in public affairs through examples of engaged citizenry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884911398335">Bennett et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884911398335">Gamson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884911398335">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>). The evidence presented here shows that neither English/UK nor Scottish titles fully fit the normative requirements of either Habermas’s impartial, dialogic, deliberative model, or participatory theorists’ demands for citizen inclusion and empowerment. Verbal exchanges in both newspaper samples take place primarily among senior members of two or three major parties, while opinion articles are written almost exclusively by journalists. It thus appears that both newspaper samples tend to satisfy the requirements of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911398335">Feree et al. (2002)</xref> describe as the ‘representative’ approach to democracy, whereby the role of the media is to communicate the views of the political elite to the electorate. A similar focus on political elite sources was also found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884911398335">Cushion et al. (2006)</xref> in their study of the coverage of the 2005 election in Yorkshire local newspapers.</p>
<p>Despite this general trend, the coverage of ‘UK’ topics, especially in the English/UK titles and their Scottish editions, offers some examples where members of the public take the role of primary definers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464884911398335">Hall et al., 1978</xref>). Although these examples may not always fulfil participatory requirements of popular inclusion and empowerment, their absence from the discussion of ‘Scottish’ topics perhaps indicates a more participatory approach in the coverage of ‘UK’ topics.</p>
<p>The evidence examined in this study offers support to previous research which has found that the media do not fully perform the role set for them by democratic theorists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884911398335">Bennett et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884911398335">Crawford, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911398335">Feree et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884911398335">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464884911398335">Peters et al., 2008</xref>), in relation to aspects of inclusiveness and dialogue. It appears that in these two elections the newspapers studied responded better to their role as providers of information about the election and the main parties’ positions. By contrast to their coverage of Scottish elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884911398335">Higgins, 2006</xref>), Scottish newspapers’ performance in the two general elections lags behind that of English/UK titles, as Scottish papers offered their readers less input for deliberation and decision-making. This can be due to the reduced significance of these elections for the Scottish press as reported by some of the Scottish political editors interviewed.</p>
<p>Another conclusion is that issues which are constructed as Scottish and those constructed as UK-wide have different protagonists. This means that the political debate on the two types of issues is exclusive to sources in the respective nations and is presented as not being of concern to sources in the other nation. There is an isolation of the mediated debate around ‘Scottish’ issues, which seems related to a deficit in the coverage of Scottish affairs in the rest of the UK after devolution, also noted by other researchers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464884911398335">Rosie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884911398335">Schlesinger, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The discussion presented in this article combines different approaches to the evaluation of newspaper performance in the public sphere and applies them to the specific context of the Scottish and English Westminster election coverage in the first years after devolution. By focusing on media output itself, it complements research on how readerships respond to news media input (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884911398335">Couldry et al., 2010</xref>) and contributes to a debate on how the print press makes information and viewpoints available for discussion and deliberation in a modern democracy.</p>

<p>Many of these studies focus on print and broadcast news. Other types of media coverage such as access broadcasting programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1464884911398335">McNair et al., 2003</xref>), or political debate on the internet provide different conditions for dialogue in the public sphere.</p>

<p>The coverage was estimated in number of words to eliminate differences in typeface and length of articles between newspapers. The difference in the amount of coverage between English/UK and Scottish titles was found to be statistically significant in both elections.</p>

<p>It appears on <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464884911398335">Table 2</xref> that Scottish newspapers have a higher proportion of letters than English/UK ones. However, this may have been skewed by omissions in the database used to retrieve the coverage: through cross-checking some of the material against hard copies, I found that although LexisNexis was overall reliable and omissions were generally not systematic, it was less reliable in recording readers’ letters about the elections. As I only cross-checked part of the data, more evidence is required to reach a conclusion about the prominence of letters in each sample.</p>
