<abstract>
<p>In this study, a recently developed electron-beam polishing process was adopted to improve the surface quality of grooved SM45C mold steel plates. A large electron beam with a maximum diameter of 60 mm was used to instantly melt and evaporate the metal surface in a few microseconds to observe its effect on surface hardness, surface roughness, water repellency, and microstructure variation. The effects of the groove depth and width on the plate were also experimentally observed. The surface polished by the electron beam became smoother, but as the groove depth increased, the effect of the large-electron-beam polishing decreased. Although the surface hardness dropped by approximately 20% on the re-solidified layer, the contact angle increased after the electron-beam irradiation. The microstructure variation on the polished surface was also examined.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Surface finishing comprises a broad range of industrial processes that alter a surface to achieve a certain property. It is often the final process that determines the quality of products after traditional and non-traditional machining. Polishing techniques for metals depend on the type of metal being polished and the desired outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954405411431026">1</xref></sup> However, for complex products, conventional polishing methods have usually been based on manual operation, which is time consuming and costly. Thus, there is the need to improve the efficiency of conventional polishing processes. Recently, large-electron-beam polishing (LEBP) has been proposed as a new polishing method for complex metal surfaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954405411431026">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954405411431026">7</xref></sup> In this process, the surface created by other processes, such as electrical-discharge machining and milling, is smoothed by a large-scale electron beam.</p>
<p>SM45C mold steel, which is the subject of this paper, falls into the class of medium-carbon steels. It has been used extensively in the automotive, machinery, and electronics industries. Recently, the geometry of components used in these industries has become more complex, so the cost and duration of the polishing process has gradually increased. These components are good candidates for LEBP, but the interaction of the large electron beam with common steels, including the SM45C, has not been reported in the literature.</p>
<p>In this study, LEBP was used on grooved SM45C mold steel plates. The changes in surface roughness, water repellency, and surface hardness were experimentally observed to evaluate the performance of the LEBP process for medium-carbon steels. The effects of the groove depth and width on the SM45C mold steel plate for LEBP were also experimentally observed. The microstructure of the re-solidified layer of the grooved SM45C mold steel plate was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the resulting contact angle after LEBP was analyzed.</p>

<p>The grooved SM45C mold steel plate samples were prepared using a mechanical milling process, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954405411431026">Figure 1(a)</xref>. Slots 5 mm and 10 mm deep were machined at 2100 r/min. The top surfaces were milled at 750 r/min. The original roughness was around 2 µm. Then, electron-beam irradiation was carried out using either 32 or 112 pulses, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954405411431026">Figure 1(b)</xref>.</p>

Therefore, a desired surface roughness can be achieved by adjusting the number of electron-beam pulses.</p>

<p>Because the electrons move in a spiral motion owing to the applied Lorentz forces, the effect of electron-beam polishing differs depending on the shape of the grooves. Two different slots were fabricated on the SM45C mold steel plates. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954405411431026">Figure 4</xref> shows the variation in the surface roughness after the electron-beam irradiation on grooves that were 5 mm and 10 mm deep. The improvement in the surface roughness of the 5 mm groove was much greater than that for the 10 mm groove. As deeper grooves distort the electron trajectories, the polishing effect decreases.</p>

<p>The irradiated surface was investigated to evaluate the change in the microstructure of the SM45C mold steel plate. As the pulse duration was only a few microseconds during the LEBP, material removal due to melting and evaporation only occurred near the surface. We evaluated the surface hardness, metallographic change, and surface wettability to quantify the effect of the electron-beam irradiation.</p>

<p>A metallographic analysis was also performed to evaluate the surface microstructure before and after the electron-beam irradiation.

<p>Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spectra of the sample surfaces were quite similar regardless of the location on the samples, except for the surface of the re-solidified layers. On the surface of the re-solidified layers, oxidation and carbon concentration occurred, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954405411431026">Figure 7</xref>, because the material-matrix formation adjacent to the surface varied owing to the melting and evaporation.</p>

<p>The contact angle of a water droplet on the surface was also tested to evaluate the variation in wettability due to the electron-beam irradiation. A water drop 2 mm in diameter was placed on the SM45C mold steel plate surface before and after the electron-beam irradiation. The shape of the water drop was measured after 30 s. The contact angle was calculated from its radius and height. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954405411431026">Figure 8</xref> shows the variation in the contact angle with respect to the number of electron-beam pulses. The contact angle of irradiated surfaces was higher than that of the initial surface regardless of the number of pulses. However, the contact angle after 32 pulses was higher than that after 112 pulses. This may be due to the variation in the microscale surface profile caused by the electron-beam irradiation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>LEBP was performed on grooved SM45C mold steel plates to observe its effect on the surface hardness, surface roughness, water repellency, and microstructure variation in medium-carbon steel. The effects of the groove depth and width were also experimentally observed. LEBP proved to be an interesting alternative to polishing a complex mold. The roughness of the irradiated surface of the grooved SM45C mold steel plate was improved by 50.1%. However, as the groove depth increased, the effect of the LEBP decreased. Although the surface hardness dropped by approximately 20% on the re-solidified layer, the contact angle increased after the electron-beam irradiation. The microstructure of the re-solidified layer of the grooved SM45C mold steel plate was examined using SEM.</p>
