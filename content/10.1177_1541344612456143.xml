<p>It is often assumed anyone teaching in a Christian church has the skills and knowledge to teach. However, that is not necessarily the case. Some Christian educators employ the same skills that were used on them as learners. Hence, this could mean using ineffective teaching methods. In addition, some Christian educators are placed in a religious classroom with no knowledge of adult learning theories. Therefore, they lack knowledge of adult learning principles and techniques that can enhance the learning experience. <italic>Teaching to Transform</italic> addresses these issues. The authors, both who teach at a theological seminary, provide a useful tool for both the novice and experienced Christian educator. <italic>Teaching to Transform</italic> is about change and action—a transformation. The authors purport that teaching a Bible study class can and should result in a transformational experience for learners.</p>
<p>Divided into three parts, the authors begin their discussion with background information on the Bible. As might be expected in a book about Bible teaching, the first section guides the reader through basic concepts that any Christian educator could utilize. In Chapter Three, several familiar terms (i.e., parables, gospel) are provided and thoroughly discussed. In their discussion on “Preparing to Study” the readers will find a list of useful Bible study resources.</p>
<p>Part II of the book focuses on two primary theories of learning. The authors use them as a basis to better understand adult learners. This section is an excellent review for those familiar with andragogy and self-directed learning as well transformational learning. Those being introduced to the concepts for the first time will appreciate the attention given to all three topics. The discussions are thorough in that the authors provide several examples and details and include an honest assessment of each. Different models and approaches to learning are presented. The authors introduce a topic that has garnered recent attention in adult education circles—neuroscience. The authors point out that “the physiological information about learning discovered in the neuroscience transformative theory is perhaps the most helpful” (p. 145).</p>
<p>The final section focuses on the star method of “transformactional” teaching. The authors state transformactional “is derived from a combination of educational (i.e., transformation) and biblical principles” (Melick &amp; Melick, 2010, p. 4). Fourteen principles are outlined and connected to adult learning theories and Bible references. In addition, like the five points on a star, the authors present five parts of the transformactional teaching model. Neophyte Christian educators may be tempted to jump right into this section, because it is replete with handy instructional techniques, useful information about adult learners, and exercises for both educators and learners. In each chapter of this section, the authors explicitly outline the transformactional principles associated with the “connecting” point.</p>
<p>Throughout the book, the authors weave adult education principles, theories, practices, and biblical scriptures. The authors explicate the role and importance of adult education principles in Bible study classes. To move adult learners beyond simply attending a class and leaving the same way they entered, Melick and Melick (2010) challenge religious educators to engage in learning that transforms.</p>
<p>While the focus of the book is on Christian education and adult Bible teaching, adult educators from any context may find the book significant. For example, the discussion on learning theories cuts across any learning context. The numerous examples dotted throughout the book can be applied in a variety of learning situations. The last few chapters of the book provide several exercises, primarily rating activities. However, some readers may have more questions after completing them, because the authors do not provide a detailed discussion on the exercises. For example, should it be assumed if educators do not score all fives on an exercise, whereby a five is “being terrific,” that they are not excellent educators? Melick and Melick (201) list over 40 instructional methods but do not provide readers with caveats regarding their use.</p>
<p>Adult educators espousing transformative learning will appreciate the authors’ contribution to the discussion. As with other adult educators, Christian educators attempt to bring about change (transformation) in learners. They can encourage disorienting dilemmas and perspective transformations. At the end of a Bible study course, adults should be different than when they began. This is the goal of transformational learning and <italic>Teaching to Transform</italic>.</p>
<p>Whether a seasoned adult educator or a novice, <italic>Teaching to Transform</italic> can be affirming for the former and an excellent teaching tool for the latter. Novices could step into a classroom with confidence, as they would be equipped to understand adult learning and adult learners. Researchers may find this book useful as it presents many opportunities for future research.</p>
