<abstract>
<p>The aim of this work was to find a quick, flexible and localised method for determining railhead adhesion. The proposed method is a pendulum rig, which has a rubber pad at the base of a swinging arm. The arm is released and as the rubber pad slides across the contact surface, energy is lost. This loss can be translated into a friction coefficient. Tests have been performed under dry and contaminated conditions, including water, oil and leaf layers both in the laboratory on extracted rail and in the field on live rail. Friction modifiers were also tested. The results of these tests are compared with data obtained using a hand-pushed tribometer. The performed study shows that the pendulum is a viable way to test adhesion levels in the field.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954409712455147" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The wheel–rail interface is an open system and as such can be subject to varying levels and types of contamination. Levels of friction on the railhead can thus fluctuate widely, sometimes to dangerously low levels leading to signals being passed at danger and platform overruns. These are often very dangerous situations over which the driver has little control; travel distances of 3 km between applying the emergency brakes and the vehicle coming to a complete stop have been reported. Such situations are known to be caused by leaf fall; however, there are also other reasons such as wet rail syndrome, morning dew, etc. In order to mitigate these effects, the exact causes of low adhesion must be investigated further as well as solutions to overcome the problem being created. The conditions leading to low adhesion can be highly transitory so a quick method for taking measurements is required. This means that improved, more flexible, easily implemented, measurement techniques are required. A technique has been trialed, via a series of laboratory and field tests, which involved using a pendulum friction test-rig for railhead friction measurement. Results were compared with data from twin-disc testing and from a Salient Systems tribometer and displayed a good agreement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409712455147">1</xref></sup> The pendulum takes its measurements over a shorter distance (12.7 cm) compared with the tribometer (3 m). This makes the pendulum suitable for the investigation of low-adhesion problems as the causes can sometimes be highly localised. This paper outlines further work with both the pendulum rig and the Salient Systems tribometer. Methods and results from using the pendulum (with a new rail attachment method) in the field and the laboratory are presented, but now under different conditions to those trialed in the previous work, some of which have been shown to cause low adhesion levels.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0954409712455147"><title>Test apparatus</title>
<p>The pendulum rig works on the same energy loss principle as used in the Charpy impact test. The rig’s mode of operation is as follows.
<list id="list1-0954409712455147" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The pendulum swing arm is released from its starting position (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409712455147">Figure 1</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It then swings through a radius of arc equal to length ‘b–d’.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>As it approaches 90° of swing, rubber pad ‘d’ comes into contact with the test specimen (floor, road or in this case rail).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The slider is pivoted about point ‘g’ and mounted on a constant-force spring which runs up the swing arm ‘c’, this ensures that there is a constant normal force between the pad and specimen throughout the contact.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Friction between the rubber pad and specimen results in an energy loss which is then measured on scale ‘a’ as the arm swings on its upstroke.</p></list-item>
</list>

</fig></p>
<p>A formula for converting the energy loss, as read from the scale on the rig, into friction coefficient has been specified by the pendulum manufacturer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409712455147">2</xref></sup> This was derived for a contact length, between the rubber pad and test surface, of 127 mm (5 inches)

where <italic>µ</italic> is friction coefficient and <italic>SRV</italic> is the energy loss reading (slip resistance value).</p>
<p>Various types of slider can be used with the rig, and two types were compared in the initial pendulum testing carried out in Lewis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409712455147">1</xref></sup> It was found that Four-s yielded friction coefficients similar to those seen in other laboratory tests and field tests with the hand-pushed tribometer and therefore was chosen for these tests. Although the actual wheel/rail contact is steel-on-steel it may at first seem surprising that rubber-on-steel gave a similar friction coefficient. However, taking into account the unique, high contact pressure, the environment of the wheel–rail contact and the differences in surface roughness between it and the rubber slider it may just be a mere coincidence. It was noted from testing in Lewis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409712455147">1</xref></sup> that the pendulum gave slightly higher friction for dry, water and oil conditions when tested in the laboratory when compared with friction levels generated during twin-disc testing under similar conditions. What was also interesting is that for these three conditions there was almost a fixed difference between the twin-disc and pendulum results. The same was also seen for field tests in this work, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409712455147">Figure 4</xref>, with slightly higher friction seen with the pendulum for C1, C2 and D1 dry conditions. Thus, the pendulum could be tuned to match data from twin-disc testing.

</fig></p>
<p>In order to attach the pendulum rig to the rail in the laboratory and field, a platform was designed to create a portable and stable base for measurement (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409712455147">Figure 2</xref>). It is a three-point platform with two points on the track and a rear point that can be placed either on the sleeper or on the ground. The rear point has a screw adjustment so the height can be set according to the height of the track. The horizontal position of the pendulum can be set by using the height adjustable feet and the strike length (distance that the pad is in contact with the rail) is adjusted by the top screw. The pad was conditioned using P400 abrasive paper to remove any contaminants.

</fig></p>
<p>In order to evaluate the results from the pendulum rig, a widely used Salient Systems hand-pushed tribometer, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954409712455147">Figure 3</xref>, was used as a comparison. The design and operating principles have been presented previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954409712455147">3</xref></sup> The tribometer is a hand-pushed device used to measure friction on the railhead or gauge. It interfaces with the rail via a small steel wheel. Load is applied to the rail through the wheel via a user-adjustable clamping screw. The wheel is connected to a magnetic clutch and as the user commences the measurement, by pushing the device along the rail, the wheel rolls along the rail freely, i.e. the clutch is disengaged. Slowly and gradually the clutch is engaged subjecting the wheel to a gradually increasing braking force. As the tangential force on the wheel approaches the limit of friction, the wheel begins to slip. At this point the tribometer’s on-board computer can calculate the friction using the maximum torque at which the wheel slipped and the normal force on the wheel. The device needs a working length of 3 m for enough braking torque to build up on the wheel between each measurement. The accuracy of the pendulum is ± 0.03 µ and the tribometer has an accuracy of ± 0.02 µ.

<sec id="sec4-0954409712455147"><title>Field tests</title>
<p>Field tests were performed at Ringvägen, Stockholm (Location A); Djursholmsösby, Stockholm (Location B); Granstandabacken, Storvik, Sandviken (Locations C, D, E, F) under different conditions. The amount of contamination was as had naturally occurred and therefore, its quantity relative to the bulk rail material could not be determined during the test. At test location B some modification of the railhead was performed with the deliberate introduction of oil or leaves. Note that the leaf layer was not transformed to a blackish leaf layer during the time period for these tests. Temperature and humidity were measured during the tests and each measurement was repeated six times. The Salient tribometer and the pendulum rig were both used during the measurements. The details of the field test conditions are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954409712455147">Table 1</xref>. Synthetic ester oil was used as a rail lubricant in test 6 and has the following viscosity profile; 68 cSt at 40 °C, 12 cSt at 100 °C. This oil is used by Stockholm Local Traffic to lubricate the wheel flange–rail gauge contact in narrow curves in commuter and underground traffic and has been used in previous laboratory testing by Sundh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954409712455147">4</xref></sup>

<p>In the laboratory tests, two pieces of rail section were used. One was cut from Brommaplan, Stockholm in October 2008 (rail A) during a period of poor adhesion with a blackish surface layer visible on the rail surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954409712455147">5</xref></sup> The other was cut from Brommaplan, Stockholm in March 2009 (rail B) during a period of good adhesion and had a clean railhead appearance. Either water or oil was applied on the rails as uniformly as possible. After that, the pendulum foot was allowed to swing and energy loss values were recorded from the scale.

<p>All the field test results from measurements using the pendulum rig and Salient tribometer are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409712455147">Figure 4</xref>. The results of the laboratory tests using the pendulum are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409712455147">Figure 5</xref>. The error bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409712455147">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409712455147">5</xref> indicate the standard deviation of the six pendulum measurements which was obtained by taking the data obtained in each test and then averaging it to give the value shown in the figures. As can be seen, the pendulum rig and tribometer yield similar results across a range of conditions. The dry laboratory tests compare reasonably well with those obtained in the field. The results obtained for the wet and oil tests are slightly lower in the laboratory. However, it has been shown that most field situations can be replicated well enough in the laboratory to use the pendulum as a means to evaluate methods for mitigating low-adhesion problems in laboratory-based tests. Obviously the hand-pushed tribometer’s requirement for a 3 m test length makes it less practical for such tests.

</fig></p>
<p>The difference between B3-dry and the other dry measurements made at locations C, D, E and F can be explained by the fact the friction can vary from location to location depending on atmospheric conditions and surface topography of the rail. A rail which is located in heavy braking areas will probably show a different surface topography. Levels of railhead oxidation and debris coverage is also likely to differ from site to site. This also explains the difference between the field oil reading shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409712455147">Figure 4</xref> of approximately 0.2 (B4-rail oil) and the laboratory measurement for oil shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409712455147">Figure 5</xref> of approximately 0.1. In the snow conditions the error between the pendulum and tribometer was 0.04 and 0.03 for locations A1 and A2 respectively. Under the dry conditions the differences were 0.02, 0.02, 0.03 and 0.1 for C1, C2, D1 and D2, respectively. The large shift in error seen at location D2 cannot be explained. Another lab/field comparison was performed in Lewis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409712455147">1</xref></sup> using track which had been treated with friction modifier. The differences between pendulum and tribometer measurements in that study averaged 0.06.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0954409712455147" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The work presented here and the previous work presented in Lewis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409712455147">1</xref></sup> have shown that the pendulum, with minimal adaptations can be used for localised measurement of friction on the railhead of tangent track. The pendulum is able to accommodate moderate rail cant as the slider pad is located on a pivot allowing the pad to tilt on an axis parallel to the direction of measurement. In its current design configuration the pendulum is not able to take measurements on steep gradients. The average error between the pendulum and tribometer results in the field taken from data in this article and from Lewis at al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409712455147">1</xref></sup> is 0.05 µ. This compares with the accuracy of the pendulum and tribometer of 0.03 µ and 0.02 µ, respectively. The comparability between laboratory and field results means that the test method is suitable for use in the laboratory for evaluating solutions to low-adhesion problems.</p>
