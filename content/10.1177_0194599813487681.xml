<p>Cochlear nerve deficiency (CND) is increasingly diagnosed in children with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). We sought to determine the prevalence of CND, its imaging characteristics, and correlations with audiologic phenotype in children with unilateral SNHL.</p>

<sec id="section4-0194599813487681">
<title>Subjects/Methods</title>
<p>In 128 consecutive children with unilateral SNHL who underwent high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, the diameters, area, and signal intensity of the cochlear nerve (CN) were measured and normalized to the ipsilateral facial nerve. Presence of CND was determined by comparison to normative data. Relationships among hearing loss severity, progression, and nerve size were investigated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0194599813487681">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Cochlear nerve deficiency was present in 26% of children with unilateral SNHL. Its prevalence was higher (48%) in severe to profound SNHL, especially when in infants (100%). Width of the bony cochlear nerve canal (BCNC) correlated strongly with relative CN diameter, density, and area (<italic>R</italic> = 0.5); furthermore, a narrow BCNC (&lt;1.7 mm) strongly predicted CND. Severity of hearing loss modestly correlated with nerve size, although significant variability was observed. Progression never occurred unless there were other inner ear malformations, whereas in the non-CND group, it occurred in 22%. Ophthalmologic abnormalities were very common (67%) in CND children, particularly oculomotor disturbances.</p>

<sec id="section6-0194599813487681">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Cochlear nerve deficiency is a common cause of unilateral SNHL, particularly in congenital unilateral deafness. Width of the BCNC effectively predicts CND, a finding useful when only computed tomography imaging is available. In an ear with CND, hearing can be expected to remain stable over time. Diagnosis should prompt evaluation by an ophthalmologist.</p>

<body>
<p>Cochlear nerve deficiency (CND), or an abnormally small or absent cochlear nerve (CN), is an increasingly recognized cause of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813487681">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813487681"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813487681">3</xref></sup> As diagnosis has improved with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CND is found to be much more common than once thought. In fact, in a recent pediatric MRI study, CND was found in 18% of ears with SNHL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813487681">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>High-resolution T2-weighted MRIs effectively resolve cranial nerves by distinguishing them from surrounding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813487681"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). As such, the CN can usually be distinguished from the vestibular and facial nerves within the internal auditory canal (IAC) and then directly measured. Computed tomography (CT) cannot resolve cranial nerves but can resolve the bony canals transmitting them, the IAC and the bony cochlear nerve canal (BCNC). Several authors have found an increased prevalence of narrow BCNC in children with SNHL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813487681">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813487681">6</xref></sup> but did not relate it to nerve size, so its predictive value for CND remains unclear.</p>

</fig>
<p>Due to its recent recognition, less is known about CND than other conditions causing SNHL. Its prevalence specifically in unilateral vs bilateral SNHL is unknown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813487681">4</xref></sup> Although CND is sometimes accompanied by other inner ear anomalies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813487681">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813487681">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813487681">8</xref></sup> the relationships among these anomalies overall remain poorly understood. Most studies have included only children with severe to profound hearing loss,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813487681">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813487681">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813487681">9</xref></sup> so very limited data exist for milder cases of CN hypoplasia. Importantly, no longitudinal audiologic data exist, so it is unknown whether hearing levels progress over time, as they do in other inner ear malformations. Finally, there are few data on audiologic and clinical features specific to unilaterally affected children.</p>
<p>We have observed clinically that CND is very common in unilateral SNHL. We undertook this study not only to better understand unilateral CND but also to take advantage of its high prevalence to gain insights applicable to the less common bilateral CND patient. Many of the latter children are cochlear implant candidates, and their management is complex and controversial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813487681">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813487681"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813487681">12</xref></sup> Therefore, we studied a large cohort of children with unilateral SNHL to determine the prevalence of CND and evaluate its imaging and audiologic features, including stability of hearing over time. Finally, we sought to determine the frequency of coexisting genetic and ophthalmologic abnormalities.</p>
<sec id="section7-0194599813487681" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Medical and audiologic records were retrospectively reviewed on all children with unilateral SNHL who underwent high-resolution MRI between 2004 and 2009. The Committee for Protection of Human Subjects approved this study.</p>
<sec id="section8-0194599813487681">
<title>Study Definitions</title>
<p>An adequate MRI scan was a T2-based series, with resolution sufficient to resolve individual nerves in the IAC, measure structures as small as 0.2 mm, and assess for other cochleovestibular malformations. Parasagittal reconstructions perpendicular to the IAC were also required. Cochlear nerve deficiency was defined if a subject had no visualized CN, despite adequate MRI quality as defined above, or met at least 2 of the 3 criteria for CND determined by our recent normative data study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599813487681"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). Progression of hearing loss was defined as a change of +15 dB or more in pure-tone average (PTA) over at least 1 year. Enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) was defined as per Cincinnati criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599813487681">13</xref></sup></p>

<title>Imaging Evaluation</title>
<p>All analyses were done blinded to all clinical data, to the side of hearing loss, and to the original radiologist’s findings. The protocol was a 3-dimensional, volumetric T2 turbo spin echo sequence on a 3 Tesla system, with details reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813487681">14</xref></sup> Bilateral axial magnetic resonance images were first systematically reviewed for abnormalities of the cochlea and labyrinth, including incomplete cochlear partitioning, anomalies of the semicircular canals or vestibule, and EVA.</p>
<p>Nerve measurements were performed on parasagittal reconstructions perpendicular to the IAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813487681"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>), on the most lateral image in which nerves were clearly distinct. Here, the major and minor (ellipse) diameters of the CN and facial nerve (FN) were measured and each nerve’s cross-sectional area calculated using the formula for an ellipse. Nerve “density,” reflecting relative lightness/darkness on MRI, was determined from signal intensity (grayscale) in the central 0.3 mm<sup>2</sup> of each nerve’s cross section, normalized to 2 reference standards from the same ear: brightest (CSF) and darkest (otic capsule bone). Nerve density was thus a relative value between 0 (CSF) and 1 (bone) (C. Clemmens and J. Germiller, unpublished data). Finally, each measurement was divided by that of the ipsilateral FN and expressed as ratios (eg, “relative CN diameter” is [CN diameter/FN diameter]). The IAC’s width (horizontal plane), height, and cross-sectional area were measured on the parasagittal section at its midpoint. Finally, the width of the BCNC was measured on axial images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813487681"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>To help overcome variability, each structure was measured by 5 independent raters (CSC, JG, AC, SJC, JAB), then averaged. Each rater was individually trained by the senior author (JAG) and a board-certified pediatric neuroradiologist (L.T.B.). All were made using Aquarius iNtuition, v4.4.7 (TeraRecon, Foster City, California).</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Continuous variables were summarized using mean, median, and range values and compared by Spearman’s rank correlation.

<title>Subject Characteristics</title>
<p>From 142 children with unilateral SNHL who underwent high-resolution MRI, 128 had images of sufficient quality to evaluate their CNs. Median age at diagnosis was 5.6 years (range, 3 weeks to 16 years). Median audiologic follow-up was 3.1 years (range, 0-13 years); most (87) had more than 1 year of follow-up. Most patients (123) had behavioral audiograms available; the remainder had only auditory brainstem response data. All had normal hearing in the contralateral ear at diagnosis.</p>

<title>Prevalence of CND in Unilateral SNHL</title>
<p>Cochlear nerve deficiency was found in 33 of 128 (26%) children with unilateral SNHL. It was the most common abnormality (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599813487681"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>) and occurred ipsilateral to the hearing loss in all cases. By comparison, EVAs were found in 32 children (25%), with 3 being bilateral. Prevalence of CND was much higher (48%) in the subgroup of 50 children with severe or profound hearing loss at diagnosis. Within this severe subgroup, CND was also progressively more common the younger at diagnosis, occurring in 15 of 20 preschool children and in all 10 infants (age &lt;12 months) with severe to profound loss (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599813487681"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Imaging Findings</title>
<p>Of the 33 children with CND, the CN was absent in 19 and hypoplastic in the remaining 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813487681"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>; Appendix 1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://otojournal.org">otojournal.org</ext-link>). When CND was present, it was usually the only inner ear anomaly (27 of 33; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599813487681"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>; Appendix 1). However, 6 had a second anomaly, most commonly semicircular canal dysplasias (3 children). Two children had EVA accompanied by mild CN hypoplasia; the remaining 30 with EVA all had normal CNs.</p>
<p>The sizes of the BCNC and the IAC were assessed for their ability to predict CND (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599813487681"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>). The BCNC width strongly correlated with all measures of CN size: relative diameter (<italic>R</italic> = 0.53), relative density (<italic>R</italic> = 0.47), and relative area (<italic>R</italic> = 0.51) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599813487681"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). Sensitivity and specificity analysis confirmed that BCNC width was a useful predictor of CND. Using our criterion that BCNC is abnormal if less than 1.7 mm, BCNC width correctly identified CND with 84% sensitivity and 98% specificity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0194599813487681"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>). Of the 5 false negatives (CND but normal BCNC), all had nerves present (hypoplasia). By contrast, IAC width had poor sensitivity (44%), although it was highly specific for CND (98%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0194599813487681"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Audiologic Characteristics</title>
<p>In children with CND, a range of hearing loss was observed, with PTAs ranging from 32 dB to anacusis; overall mean PTA was 86.2 dB. Children with hypoplastic CNs had a mean (SD) PTA of 70.8 (26.9) dB (range, 32-113 dB), and children with apparently absent nerves had a mean (SD) PTA of 97.6 (25.8) dB (range, 37 dB to no response). In the absent nerve group, most (17 of 19) had severe to profound hearing loss; 4 of these patients had measurable thresholds in the severe range (70-90 dB) and the rest were profound. The remaining 2 patients with apparently absent CNs had milder degrees of hearing loss (mild sloping to profound, with PTAs 37 and 48 dB). Both had abnormally narrow IACs (&lt;3.4 mm). Of the 26 CND children with otoacoustic emission (OAE) data, 23 (88%) had absent OAEs.</p>
<p>Relationships between hearing loss severity and nerve size were investigated using regression analysis. In the CND group, hearing severity (PTA) was modestly correlated with nerve size measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599813487681"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). Specifically, PTA worsened as nerves became smaller in diameter (<italic>R</italic> = −0.62; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599813487681"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>), nerve density (<italic>R</italic> = −0.62; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599813487681"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>), or nerve area (<italic>R</italic> = −0.58).

By contrast, in the remaining 95 children without CND (normal nerves), no relationship was found between hearing level and any CN size parameter (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .8, not shown).</p>

In the group with normal CNs, ipsilateral progression occurred in 14 of 62 (22%). By contrast, in the CND group, progression was observed in only 2 children (8%). Notably, both had other inner ear malformations, one an ipsilateral EVA and the other absent posterior semicircular canals. In children with CND, the presence of a second malformation greatly increased risk for progression compared with those without (odds ratio [OR], 16.2; <italic>P</italic> = .04). If other malformations such as these are excluded, the remaining children (with isolated CND) were much less likely to show progression than all non-CND children (0 of 21 vs 14 of 62; OR, 8.3; <italic>P</italic> = .022). Finally, no child with CND developed hearing loss in the contralateral ear, but it developed in 2 non-CND children. These differences, however, were not significant (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .50, Fisher exact test).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cochlear nerve deficiency has only been recognized in the past decade as a significant etiology of SNHL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813487681">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813487681"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813487681">3</xref></sup> It can occur in isolation or can accompany other inner ear anomalies and syndromes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813487681">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813487681">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813487681">8</xref></sup> Although its pathophysiology remains unknown, its onset is almost certainly in prenatal development, as supported by observations of CND in congenital deafness, including the present study.</p>
<sec id="section18-0194599813487681">
<title>Prevalence of CND</title>
<p>Prior to MRI, CND was thought to be rare,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599813487681">15</xref></sup> but our study and others clearly show otherwise. In our series, CND was very common in children with unilateral SNHL, present in more than one-fourth of cases. Notably, it was even more common the younger the child and the more severe the hearing loss. Indeed, it was found in all 10 infants with severe to profound unilateral hearing loss, suggesting CND may be an extremely common cause of unilateral congenital deafness. This finding will be of great importance for the growing interest in cochlear implantation for unilateral deafness, which is starting to be performed in Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813487681">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599813487681">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>This high prevalence is consistent with several other recent series. McClay et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813487681">4</xref></sup> studied 170 children undergoing MRI for SNHL and found CND in 18% of ears. Unfortunately, prevalence was not reported separately for unilateral children. They also found CND more common as severity of SNHL worsened, consistent with our data. Similarly, in a small study (21 children with SNHL), Miyasaka and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599813487681">18</xref></sup> reported 19% prevalence of CND in SNHL ears. Only 11 children had unilateral SNHL, but CND was found in more than half.</p>
<sec id="section19-0194599813487681">
<title>Diagnosis</title>
<p>High-resolution MRI is becoming increasingly used for evaluating SNHL because it effectively resolves both the inner ear structures and the cochleovestibular nerves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599813487681">19</xref></sup> Highest resolution is obtained by use of high magnetic field scanners (3T) with fast spin echo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813487681">4</xref></sup> and newer turbo spin echo protocols, such as those used in the present study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813487681"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Planar reconstructions are easily created perpendicular to the IAC, which allows visualization of the seventh and eighth nerves in cross section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813487681"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>An absent CN is suspected when no nerve is seen in the IAC entering the cochlear aperture. This is relatively straightforward in a high-quality MRI and a normal-sized IAC. However, diagnosis is more challenging when the IAC is narrow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813487681">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813487681">8</xref></sup> With nerves surrounded by less CSF, it becomes more difficult to discern a small CN from the surrounding bony walls. This likely explains the apparently “absent” CNs reported in several recent cases with only mild or moderate hearing loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599813487681">20</xref></sup> Indeed, 2 ears in our series with apparently absent CNs had significant residual hearing, and both had abnormally narrow IACs. Of course, a poor-quality MRI can also result in a CN appearing “absent.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599813487681">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The CN can be present but small (hypoplasia), as was found in 14 of our 33 children with unilateral CND. Until recently, diagnostic criteria for a small CN have been unclear, due to lack of normative data for CN size. As a result, a working definition emerged that the CN should be considered hypoplastic if it is smaller than the facial nerve by visual inspection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813487681">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813487681">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599813487681">21</xref></sup> Recently, some normative MRI data for CN diameter were published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599813487681">22</xref></sup> but unfortunately were not normalized to the ipsilateral facial nerve. We recently established normative data for CN dimensions, relative to the facial nerve (FN), in 135 normal-hearing ears in children (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599813487681"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>), and these were used to define CND in the current study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0194599813487681">
<title>Correlates on CT</title>
<p>Although CT cannot visualize nerves, it can resolve their bony canals, prompting interest in whether canal size can indirectly suggest nerve size. The BCNC has been reported to be narrower on average in ears with SNHL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813487681">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599813487681">21</xref></sup> and with known CN aplasia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813487681">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813487681">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599813487681">18</xref></sup> Indeed, in a recent series by Wilkins and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813487681">6</xref></sup> narrower BCNCs were found more often with increasing severity of SNHL. Unfortunately, that study did not include MRI data, so the relationship of the narrow BCNC to actual CN size was not determined. In the present series, we found that BCNC was strongly correlated to all measures of CN size, and it was a good predictor of CND, both highly sensitive (84%) and extremely specific (98%). This is an important finding because in some clinical situations, BCNC may be the only insight into nerve status, such as when nerves cannot be resolved clearly or when only CT was done. Consistent with other reports, we found IAC width to be unreliable as an indicator of CND.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813487681">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813487681">7</xref></sup> Importantly, the present study evaluated only MRI images. Both BCNC and IAC can be measured on either CT or MRI, and we expect they will be closely correlated. However, to our knowledge, this direct comparison has not yet been performed but should be a focus of future studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0194599813487681">
<title>Audiologic phenotype</title>
<p>In CND, hearing loss severity appears to be related to nerve size but not exclusively. We and others report severe to profound loss in most ears with absent nerves and less severe losses with small nerves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813487681">4</xref></sup> We went further and quantified this relationship, and we found that severity (PTA) correlates significantly with nerve diameter, area, and density (<italic>R</italic> &gt; 0.58). Nevertheless, we found significant variability that cannot be explained entirely by nerve size. Six of our subjects with apparently absent nerves had measurable thresholds less than profound. Others have reported similar instances.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813487681">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599813487681">20</xref></sup> Such findings indicate MRI likely has a lower limit of detection for very small nerves (ie, that nonvisualization of the CN does not necessarily equate to complete absence in all cases). Such considerations become extremely important for children with apparently absent CNs bilaterally, who may be candidates for cochlear implantation. Indeed, there are several recent reports of significant responses to cochlear implantation in ears with apparent CN aplasia, indicating that some very hypoplastic nerves may escape detection on MRI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813487681">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813487681"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813487681">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599813487681">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0194599813487681">24</xref></sup> Our data and data from others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813487681">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0194599813487681">25</xref></sup> suggest that in such situations, BCNC width, either on CT or MRI, may be helpful in determining CN status preoperatively.</p>
<p>In CND ears that have hearing, progression appears to be rare. We found that risk of progression was far lower in children with unilateral CND than in those without CND. The only exceptions were those with additional ipsilateral inner ear malformations, themselves a known risk factor for progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0194599813487681">26</xref></sup> Furthermore, we never observed hearing loss develop later in the normal ear of unilateral CND children. However, a much larger series would be needed to confirm this trend statistically. To our knowledge, these findings represent the first longitudinal hearing data reported for CN hypoplasia.</p>
<p>Our audiologic and demographic data support the concept that CND represents a primary defect from early nerve development, rather than a secondary atrophy caused by the hearing loss, or some form of progressive nerve degeneration. First, CND was seldom associated with progressive loss. Second, if CND were due to atrophy, then it would be most common in older children with severe loss, whereas we found highest prevalence in the youngest infants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0194599813487681">
<title>Comorbidities</title>
<p>Most children with unilateral CND were nonsyndromic, and family history was also usually negative. Little is known about the genetic determinants of CND. It has been reported in both CHARGE and VACTERL syndromes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813487681">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813487681">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0194599813487681">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0194599813487681">28</xref></sup> Indeed, 3 of our unilateral CND children had these syndromes. Not surprisingly, multiple cranial nerve anomalies are characteristic of these and other syndromes where CND has been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813487681">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0194599813487681">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0194599813487681">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0194599813487681"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0194599813487681">31</xref></sup> Genetics consultation should be considered, especially when other anomalies are present.</p>
<p>Finally, we found a surprisingly high prevalence of coexisting ophthalmologic conditions in children with unilateral CND (two-thirds of patients). Ocular findings are known to be more common in children with SNHL, with recent series reporting 22% to 32%, mostly refractive errors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0194599813487681">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0194599813487681"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0194599813487681">34</xref></sup> Our data suggest that abnormalities are not only more common in CND children but also more complex, with oculomotor abnormalities predominating. The latter can arise from abnormalities in cranial nerves, raising the interesting possibility that in some children, CND may represent just one of several concurrent cranial nerve anomalies.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Cochlear nerve deficiency is a common cause of pediatric unilateral SNHL, equaling or surpassing EVA as the most common anomaly in this population. It is especially common in congenital severe to profound hearing loss and may even be the etiology of most infants born with unilateral profound deafness. It is readily diagnosed on MRI, as a CN that is smaller in diameter, area, or grayscale density than the ipsilateral facial nerve. In some cases, MRI may be unable to distinguish an absent from an extremely small CN, especially when the IAC is narrowed. The width of the BCNC is a useful predictor of CND, a finding especially important when only CT imaging is available. In an ear with CND, hearing loss severity correlates with nerve size and can be expected to remain stable over time. Most unilateral cases of CND appear sporadic but can occur as part of syndromes associated with cranial nerve anomalies. Diagnosis should prompt ophthalmologic evaluation, due to an increased risk for significant ocular abnormalities.</p>
