<p>There is something of a disconnect concerning research, knowledge, and policy involving universities and regional economic development. On the one hand, a large and voluminous literature has emerged with a focus on technology transfer, in particular, and university entrepreneurship more generally. Although this has resulted in an explosion of studies focusing on the role and management of technology transfer and university entrepreneurship, most research has been concerned about what policies and practices generate technology transfer and university entrepreneurship, while the actual impact of university entrepreneurship on regional economic development has largely been neglected.</p>
<p>For example, in the recent special issue published by <italic>Research Policy</italic> on “30 Years after Bayh-Dole: Reassessing Academic Entrepreneurship” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891242412473191">Grimaldi, Kenney, Siegel, &amp; Wright, 2011</xref>), the articles included in the special issue all focus on what factors—ranging from the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act itself to management and organizational strategies—are most conducive to university entrepreneurship. However, the exact linkages to and impact on regional economic development are not explicitly analyzed. Rather, the linkages and impacts are implicitly assumed not only to exist but also to be sufficiently important as to render the priority for university entrepreneurship for regional economic development as being self-evident. This is typical of not just the articles included in the special issues but of the entire field on technology transfer and university entrepreneurship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891242412473191">Grimaldi et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, although the importance and potential of the university entrepreneurship as a catalyst for regional economic development has been widely recognized in the regional economic development literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891242412473191">Mayer, 2010</xref>), there is only a paucity of research in the literature on regional economic development that has actually been able to <italic>explicitly</italic> identify and analyze the linkages between university entrepreneurship and regional economic development.</p>
<p>For example, in an important article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891242412473191">Mayer (2010)</xref> provides a compelling framework for state public policy to engage in technology policy to create open innovation regimes with the goal of enhancing innovation. A key element of such open innovation policies is the partnership between universities and industry. Although this study highlights the key role that universities can play in generating innovative activity in states, there is no empirical validation or support provided of this relationship.</p>
<p>In another important article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891242412473191">Gottlieb (2011)</xref> similarly provides a framework for analyzing the impact of universities on regional economic development. In particular, he considers whether a state would be better advised to invest in generating its indigenously created high-tech labor supply or rather invest in attracting such a high-tech labor supply that was actually generated in some other state or elsewhere in the world. However, this article neither considers the entrepreneurial contributions emanating from universities nor does it provide any measurable impact of universities on the actual economic development or growth of states.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891242412473191">Deskins et al. (2010)</xref> does provide an explicit estimate of the impact of state and local expenditures on education on the state growth rate. He estimates fixed-effects regressions for a panel of state-level data and finds no statistically significant support that expenditures on either higher education or on K-12 education positively affects employment or economic growth for a state. His study, however, is unable to explicitly measure or link university entrepreneurship to measures of state economic development.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891242412473191">Lendel (2010)</xref> similarly estimates the impact of leading research universities on the relevant metropolitan economy relative to the national business cycle and finds that having a top research university somewhat insulates a metropolitan area against cyclical economic fluctuations. Although this article does provide an explicit link between universities and economic growth at the metropolitan level, that link does not at all distinguish entrepreneurial activity emanating from universities from other types of university contributions to the local economy.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891242412473191">Feser, Renski, and Goldstein (2008)</xref> do provide a study explicitly linking industry clusters to regional economic development outcomes. Universities can play a key role in the identification and classification of such clusters. There is, however, no explicit link made between the universities, let alone entrepreneurial activity emanating from universities and economic development outcomes. Rather, the link is made between the industry clusters in which the universities are embedded and the regional economic development outcomes.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891242412473191">Nagle (2007)</xref> examines the spatial correlation between university R&amp;D fields and the composition of the labor force and its propensity to concentrate in a compatible technology. He finds that, in fact, there is a spatial correlation between the areas of research in which a university has strengths and a high specialization of the local labor force. Whether such a spatial correlation between inputs in the innovation process actually translates into a superior performance in terms of innovative output and regional economic development, however, is not explicitly analyzed.</p>
<p>These studies are indicative of a large literature in regional economic development that has identified that universities can and do contribute to regional economic development. However, deciphering the exact linkages between one of the specific ways that a university influences regional economic development, university entrepreneurship, and the actual explicit impact on regional economic development has generally eluded researchers.</p>
<p>The purpose of this special issue of <italic>Economic Development Quarterly</italic> devoted to <italic>Academic Entrepreneurship and Regional Economic Development</italic> is to forge together these two disparate literatures by explicitly linking research on university entrepreneurship to regional economic development. In facilitating the special issue, the Basque Institute of Competitiveness graciously hosted a conference on academic entrepreneurship and economic competitiveness in September 2011. The purpose of this event was to assemble international scholars to discuss how the entrepreneurial activity of universities affects competitiveness and regional economic development. This nexus is extremely important to understand as both public and private research and educational institutions begin to embrace seriously a responsibility toward regional economic growth and development. Along with the increased sensitivity to contributing to regional economic development has also come a mandate to universities to embolden their faculty to this broader, and some may say social, responsibility.</p>
<p>This special issue brings together leading scholars presenting state-of-the-art original research focusing on the links between what has been termed as academic entrepreneurship and regional economic development. Several key attributes of the articles comprising this special issue should be highlighted. Each author addresses the topic of academic entrepreneurship from a different perspective, as well as how the impact of academic entrepreneurship affects regional economic development. At the same time, an overarching and integrating theme of the articles is their common focus on the linkages between the university and the economic development of the region.</p>
<p>Taken together, the articles contained in this special issue have a clear and compelling message for regional economic development policy in the United States. First, university entrepreneurship can be a key policy target for spurring the economic development of regions. The articles provide unequivocal empirical evidence that university entrepreneurship contributes to the development of regions in a number of important ways. Thus, universities provide an important instrument to policymakers to promote regional economic development.</p>
<p>Second, although the evolution of universities as an instrument for regional economic development may have been centered in the United States, recognition and application of this economic development instrument is clearly in the process of diffusing to other countries. Unless regional economic development policy in the United States takes full advantage of the potential for university entrepreneurship, the competitiveness of certain American regions may consequently suffer.</p>
<p>The literature in regional economic development has generated a solid and compelling set of studies identifying university spin-offs as an important vehicle for knowledge dissemination and the generation of jobs and economic growth. However, despite its importance, little research exists on the impact of university spin-offs on regional economic development. Christopher S. Hayter, in “Harnessing University Entrepreneurship for Economic Growth: Factors of Success among University Spin-offs,” makes an important contribution to the regional economic development literature by testing the relationship between spin-off success—defined here as technology commercialization—and multiple factors derived from the extant literature. His article finds that several significant variables enable commercialization success within the sample, including venture capital, multiple and external licenses, outside management, joint ventures with other companies, previous faculty consulting experience, and—surprisingly—a negative relationship to post-spin-off services provided by universities. The empirical results from Hayter’s article have important implications for regional economic policy and management and suggest that an overall “open innovation” approach may be particularly conducive to having a greater impact on regional economic development.</p>
<p>Economic development practitioners and scholars have long recognized that the link between universities and regional economic development is predicated on the spillover of knowledge from the university to commercialization and ultimately regional economic development. However, there is considerably less understanding of how and why university-generated knowledge spills over to generate economic growth and development of regions. Most of the extant literature has focused on the supply side, which involves university research and technology transfer mechanisms. In “Regional Appropriation of University-Based Knowledge and Technology for Economic Development,” David Audretsch, Dennis Leyden, and Albert Link provide one of the pioneering studies examining the role played by the demand for university-based knowledge and university-developed technology. In particular, their article identifies links between business and the university as a key conduit facilitating the spillover of university knowledge. Their results suggest that knowledge does not fall like manna from heaven, but rather it is systematically transmitted through research that involves universities.</p>
<p>In “Cluster Sustainability: The Israeli Life Sciences Industry,” Shiri M. Breznitz identifies linkages to the university in facilitating the competitive advantage and sustainability in a region in Israel. Her article is based on an innovation-based cluster, the life sciences industry in Israel. Cristiano Antonelli, in “Knowledge Governance Pecuniary Knowledge Externalities and Total Factor Productivity Growth,” makes an explicit link between the extent of knowledge externalities in a region, which could be generated by universities and subsequent regional economic growth.</p>
<p>In “An Assessment of the Determinants of University Technology Transfer,” José L. González-Pernía, Graciela Kuechle, and Iñaki Peña-Legazkue examine the impact of regional specific characteristics on the impact of university technology transfer and the extent to which the characteristics of universities and technology transfer offices (TTOs) located within different regional contexts affect the transfer of scientific knowledge, both in the form of licensing and spin-off firm creation. They find compelling empirical evidence that TTOs with greater experience and expertise, along with universities that have clearly established rules for creating academic start-ups and with higher patenting records, are more likely to generate a greater economic development impact via technology transfer.</p>
<p>In “Research Output from University–Industry Collaborative Projects,” Albert Banal-Estañol, Inés Macho-Stadler, and David Pérez-Castrillo examine the impact of joint projects between universities and private firms on economic development and other outcomes. In particular, they focus on collaborative and noncollaborative projects that are supported by government grants. Based on a theoretical framework and empirical analysis of a rich data set from the United Kingdom, they find that the quality and the type of both the scientists as well as the private firms involved influence the research output of the project.</p>
<p>In “Entrepreneurial Universities: Socioeconomic Impacts of Academic Entrepreneurship in a European Region,” David Urbano and Maribel Guerrero show how the entrepreneurial university has emerged as an important catalyst for regional economic and social development, particularly because it generates and exploits knowledge as entrepreneurial opportunities. They also point out that the empirical evidence supporting this view is generally fragmented and disorganized. They develop a compelling framework based on Institutional Economics, Resource-Based View, and Endogenous Growth approaches to provide a systematic and rigorous analysis of the impact of the entrepreneurial university on regional economic development. Using the case-study methodology, the study presents the experience of entrepreneurial universities in a European Region (Catalonia, Spain). The article identifies key public policy implications that could stimulate the entrepreneurial activity of universities and, thus, foster their contribution to the development of the modern knowledge economy.</p>
<p>Taken together, the articles contained in this special issue suggest a key and significant role for academic entrepreneurship in stimulating and generating regional economic development. Although these articles have identified some of the important contours of the links between academic entrepreneurship and regional economic development, this special issue highlights the rich opportunities afforded to scholars, practitioners, and policymakers in focusing on academic entrepreneurship as a key engine of regional economic development.</p>
