<p>New developments and trends in selling and sales management are creating demands on sales organizations and academic researchers in order to bridge the gap between theory and practice. Although there is an extensive tradition of research in selling and sales management and robust ongoing research efforts, much of our knowledge rests on models and assumptions advanced in past decades that may need revision to address the realities of the evolving marketplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1523422313488753">Jones, Brown, Zoltners, &amp; Weitz, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The sales landscape has changed dramatically in the last 30 years and is evolving rapidly in response to a changing marketplace. The rate of technology transfer is increasing and the number of competitors has grown considerably due to globalization of markets. A survey of chief sales officers (CSOs) concluded that 85% of companies report increases in their product-line breadth, product complexity, and participation in new markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1523422313488753">Trailer &amp; Dickie, 2006</xref>). The changing marketplace has eclipsed the traditional or transactional selling model with solutions selling and accelerating customers’ results taking its place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422313488753">Cron &amp; DeCarlo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422313488753">Eades, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1523422313488753">Hodge &amp; Schachter, 2006</xref>). With selling models evolving, new kinds of sales professionals, sales managers, and sales leaders are emerging. Innovations in how suppliers and customers interact have necessitated changes in the way sales forces are structured, compensated, developed, and evaluated in order to sustain a high-performance sales culture capable of achieving success in today’s highly competitive and global business economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422313488753">Cron &amp; DeCarlo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1523422313488753">Sujan, Weitz, &amp; Sujan, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, investing in a person’s knowledge and skills is similar to business investments in equipment, with economic effects of investment in competence, providing incentive to both the individual and organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1523422313488753">Becker, 1993</xref>). Often operating at the intersection between the organization’s strategic goals and the capabilities of its workforce, human resource development (HRD) professionals are in a unique position to identify and develop human competence, leveraging intellectual capital to drive growth and spur innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1523422313488753">Cardy &amp; Selvarajan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1523422313488753">McLagan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1523422313488753">Prokopeak, 2008</xref>). Since the 1980s, McLagan has challenged the field to identify clear competency criteria to help select, manage, train, and plan for the careers of individuals engaged in driving the outputs of an organization. While some fields, such as finance, marketing, and training and development have risen to the competency challenge, the sales profession, despite new models of selling demanding new skill sets, has not kept pace with other occupations’ advancement in human resource development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422313488753">Lambert, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Practice in the sales profession and current research on competencies indicate that sales person competencies are key to organizational competitive advantage. The common competency modeling approach provides descriptions of individual level competencies that are core for an “occupational group, entire level of jobs, or for the organization as a whole. The focus is on broad applicability and leveraging what is common or universal,” yet not all competency items or behaviors are equally useful for all jobs, job levels, business segments, or regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1523422313488753">Schippmann et al., 2000</xref>, p. 727). While there has been research in the areas of general management competency and general sales competency, there is a gap in empirical research on role-specific sales competency, particularly that of the frontline sales manager (FLSM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422313488753">Lambert, 2009</xref>). FLSMs are the most critical element in a productive sales force given the potential for sales managers to influence performance through visibility into their employees’ daily workflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1523422313488753">Babakus, Cravens, Grant, Ingram, &amp; LaForge, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313488753">Guest &amp; Meric, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1523422313488753">Piercy, Cravens, &amp; Lane, 2009</xref>). FLSMs lead a team, respond to customers, continually improve products and services, and turn policies into action, resulting in impacting revenues and profits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422313488753">Cron &amp; DeCarlo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1523422313488753">Wickramasinghe &amp; Nimali, 2009</xref>). The skills inherent to, and displayed by, effective sales managers differ from those in other sales roles, specifically the sales representative, with traditional sales manager career paths, once commonly based only on tenure and the ability to sell, now demanding additional skill sets due to evolving sales models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1523422313488753">Deeter-Schmelz, Goebel, &amp; Kennedy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1523422313488753">Dubinsky &amp; Ingram, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422313488753">Lambert, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1523422313488753">Lambert, Ohai, &amp; Kerkhoff, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1523422313488753">Sujan et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1523422313488753">Zallocco, Pullins, &amp; Mallin, 2009</xref>). As the role of a FLSM differs from that of other sales roles combined with the evolution of changing sales models, so too must the composition of respective competency models. An 18-month study on sales manager performance by the Sales Executive Council<sub>TM</sub> included surveys and interviews of 300 sales organizations and experts, resulting in an illustration on the competency tension of changing sales roles and sales models. (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1523422313488753">Figure 1</xref>.) The study further concluded that sales leaders readily admit their FLSMs are ill equipped to succeed in the future model, with nearly three fourths of current managers judged to lack the skills needed to meet future performance requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1523422313488753">Corporate Executive Board [CEB], 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>Effective sales managers must evolve from the historical <italic>super sales performers</italic> to business strategists and coaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1523422313488753">Babakus et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422313488753">Cron &amp; DeCarlo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1523422313488753">Hodge &amp; Schachter, 2006</xref>) which requires a different perspective and lens. What is needed at this time in the literature is a more coherent understanding of the competencies of FLSMs, contributing a framework for understanding the requirements to achieving high-performing levels of individual, team, and organizational sales performance, which can partially address the pressing societal challenges of change and learning in the work activities of this role. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1523422313488753">Engeström, Y.’s (2009)</xref> contributions to activity theory illustrate, “theoretical developments require activist involvement in concrete human practices” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1523422313488753">Sannino, Daniels, &amp; Gutiérrez, 2009</xref>, p. 15), thus a goal of this research is to further bridge theory, research and practice by contributing new knowledge that can partially address a problem with potential “runaway object” proportion given the potential to “expand to a global scale of influence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1523422313488753">Engeström, 2009</xref>, p. 304).</p>

<title>The Solution</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to establish and validate competencies for FLSMs, and determine the similarity of CSO and FLSM perceptions of importance and proficiency. It was hypothesized a role-specific conceptual framework could be developed that could serve as a benchmark for human resources initiatives to increase levels of sales force effectiveness. For the purposes of this study, FLSMs were defined as individuals who manage nonmanagerial sales personnel and often have their own sales and account responsibilities, and CSOs are responsible for all sales/revenue within an organization or business unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422313488753">Cron &amp; DeCarlo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1523422313488753">Dubinsky &amp; Ingram, 1983</xref>).</p>

<title>Method and Results</title>
<p>In selecting the research method, several factors were considered: (a) current research on the topic is limited, yet the demand for informed practice is strong, (b) a systematic approach to inquiry that could collect informed opinions in a timely and cost-effective manner, transcending organization and geographic boundaries was needed, as well as (c) the ability to examine the data in a pragmatic manner, which led to the Delphi technique as the chosen research method. The Delphi technique was developed in the 1950s by Olaf Helmer and associates at the Rand Corporation for defense technology forecasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422313488753">Dalkey, 1969</xref>). Named for the ancient Greek oracle at Delphi from which prophecies are given, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1523422313488753">Figure 2</xref>, the technique is an iterative multistage group facilitation process, designed to collect data through questionnaires, synthesize, explain, and resynthesize in a way that expert opinion and personal experience are formed into group consensus on important issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1523422313488753">Hasson, Keeney, &amp; McKenna, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422313488753">Lambrecht, 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>Considered a flexible approach commonly used within the health and social sciences fields, the Delphi technique has been used by ASTD to create competency models for learning and sales professionals, combining a quantitative design with the use of descriptive statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1523422313488753">McLagan, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1523422313488753">Rothwell, 1996</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section6-1523422313488753">
<title>Panel Selection</title>
<p>Panel selection for the Delphi study is the most important step in the process, as it directly relates to the quality of the results generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1523422313488753">Hsu &amp; Sandford, 2007</xref>). According to Scheele (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1523422313488753">Jackson, 2000</xref>), there are three types of panelists: (a) stakeholders, (b) experts, and (c) facilitators. Stakeholders are individuals directly affected by the study. Experts possess specific knowledge on and in-depth experience with the topic being researched. Facilitators are skilled in clarifying and summarizing views being expressed and offering alternative views as appropriate. Considering former competency studies using the Delphi process, for the purposes of this research, a panel of experts was selected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422313488753">Lambert, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1523422313488753">Lambert, Ohai, &amp; Kerkhoff, 2009</xref>). The literature suggested an appropriate size for a Delphi panel to be not less than 10 and no more than 30 participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1523422313488753">Linstone &amp; Turoff, 2002</xref>). Regarding standards for the selection of Delphi subjects, there is no exact criterion listed in the literature; however, to guide the selection of Delphi subjects, the study targeted individuals who had related backgrounds and experiences concerning the target issue, were capable of contributing helpful inputs, and were willing to revise their initial or previous judgments for the purpose of reaching or attaining consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1523422313488753">Hsu &amp; Sandford, 2007</xref>). Traditional retrospective methods for identifying competencies as outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1523422313488753">McClelland and Boyatzis (1980)</xref> suggested focusing on and gathering input specifically from performers in the position being studied; in this case FLSMs. However, that method has been challenged in the more recent literature, with the expectation that competency models be forward looking to reflect the changing operational requirements of the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1523422313488753">Markus, Cooper-Thomas, &amp; Allpress, 2005</xref>). Considering the need for a balanced approach and strategic perspective, it was determined the study would also include the input of CSOs, who are uniquely positioned to consider the current and future competency needs of FLSMs. Through a nomination process, a purposively selected panel of 35 experts, representative of two subpopulations, 18 frontline sales managers, and 17 CSOs with expertise in the selling occupation were invited to participate in the consensus study involving three computer-based rounds of a Delphi questionnaire. In order to clearly define the universe, global for-profit organizations with more than 250 employees and corporate revenues above US$10 million were used. The panel represented five global organizations in nine industries and was equally split between business to business (B2B) and business to consumer (B2C) markets.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1523422313488753">
<title>Delphi Rounds</title>
<p>For Round 1, a structured questionnaire was developed based on review of the literature conducted in conjunction with a scan of trade magazines and books with a focus on the keywords <italic>manager competence, sales competence, sales manager competence, sales manager, and sales performance.</italic> The review identified taxonomies of sales manager activity, role identification research, and existing task identification research for inclusion into the preliminary list of competencies. At the conclusion of the literature review, a structured questionnaire of 22 competency statements in four clusters and two categories was created for consideration as being relevant to FLSMs. The panelists were provided with directions, examples, relevant definitions, and instructed to prioritize each competency statement based on perceived importance to the FLSM role, using a 5-point Likert-type scale as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1523422313488753">Figure 3</xref>. Panelists were then instructed to use an open-ended section of the data collection tool as a way to provide input, ask for clarification, and make recommendations, with the objective to use their position as thought leaders in their area of expertise to ensure that all competencies required for the exemplary performance of a FLSM were represented. An exemplary performer was defined as a person who is exceptionally talented and outstandingly competent at their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1523422313488753">Dubois &amp; Rothwell, 2004</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The use of descriptive statistics to define consensus at a numerical level and the constant comparative method of data analysis were used to apply rigor in summarizing and presenting the group responses in each round. The constant comparative method of data analysis was used to compare segments of data for similarities and differences in order to identify patterns leading to categorization. This method, developed by Glaser and Strauss, involves making constant comparisons within and between categories, leading to hypotheses and ultimately the formation of grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1523422313488753">Merriam, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Round 1 resulted in identifying 55 statements essential to exemplary performance by FLSMs. As a result of the analysis, groups of like statements emerged, comprising new categories and clusters of competency statements. For Round 2, three categories and nine clusters were named, defined, and used to provide a rich context from which to prioritize the competency statements using the 5-point Likert-type scale as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1523422313488753">Figure 3</xref>. The second round of the Delphi study provided panelists with the opportunity to view how they rated each statement as compared to the group rating, review comments made in the previous round, revise judgments, and move towards consensus of opinion. Descriptive statistics were used to ascertain the level of consensus, and the results of Round 2 were tabulated and presented in Round 3.</p>
<p>The third round of the Delphi study provided the panelists with a final list of core competencies for FLSMs. Using the competencies identified, the panelists were asked to identify perceived levels of competence for FLSMs. An example follows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1523422313488753">Figure 4</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>It has been suggested that a 70% response rate is required for each round in order to maintain the rigor of this technique, which was achieved in Rounds 2 and 3 of the study. Although attrition occurred at each stage of the Delphi study, the final numbers of participants satisfied the need to have 10 or more participants to achieve good reliability. Response rates for this study are comparable to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1523422313488753">Linstone &amp; Turoff, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1523422313488753">Sumsion, 1998</xref>).

<title>Results</title>
<p>Out of the original 55 competency statements that resulted from Round 1, in Round 2, 38 met the consensus criteria for importance. For this study, consensus was defined as statements rated by at least 75% of the panel members as 5 (Essential) or 4 (Very Important). This interpretation of consensus is consistent with other Delphi studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1523422313488753">Jackson, 2000</xref>). To reach a further level of congruity, additional analysis of mean and range resulted in rank ordering of the competencies. Competencies that attained an overall agreement rating mean of 4.0 as well as having a range of 1.00 or less, indicated the strongest congruity within the answers given across all groups and were coded as primary competencies. Fifteen competencies of the 38 were identified as primary based on these criteria. Competencies rated 4.0 or above, with a range of 2.0 or higher, were rated as very important but did not receive as strong a degree of congruity, and were thus coded as secondary. Nineteen competencies of the 38 were identified as secondary. Four competencies with a mean of less than 4.0 and/or range of 3.0 or higher were eliminated from the ranking due to low degree of congruity. The result was a total of 34 prioritized competencies, 19 primary, and 15 secondary in three categories and eight clusters (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1523422313488753">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>It has been established that though Delphi is a useful tool for identifying consensus, it is not without its limitations. Despite attempts to minimize attrition, participants dropped out at each stage of the study, with the greatest attrition between the point of agreeing to participate in the study and responding to the first round of the Delphi questionnaire. However, after this, the rate of attrition was distributed equally in each round among the two groups of CSOs and FLSMs and met the recommended attrition rate of no more than 70% each round, with a minimum of 10 participants.</p>
<p>Future work will establish the reliability, feasibility, and value of the competencies identified for exemplary performance for FLSMs. Specifically, the relative contribution of the competencies in evaluating exemplary performance in FLSMs to predict future outcome requires further investigation. Longitudinal and multiple baseline studies examining the effect of implementing the competency model over time would help to clarify its effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1523422313488753">Markus et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions and Implications for HRD Research, Practice, and Theory</title>
<p>Sales research and practice have arrived at a critical juncture where new ideas to advance the theory and practice of selling and sales management are needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1523422313488753">Jones et al., 2005</xref>). The findings of this study resulted in several key conclusions. First, results support that exemplary performance in FLSMs requires competence in maintaining team and personal effectiveness, and more specifically competence in developing and sustaining inter- and intrapersonal skills excellence as compared to the functional selling skills required for high individual contributor performance. This further supports the conclusion that the skills inherent to and displayed by effective FLSMs differ from those of high-performing salespeople, which are primarily concerned with sales process and influence and secondarily concerned with relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422313488753">Lambert, 2009</xref>). Second, the research findings indicated agreement in how CSOs and FLSMs perceive competency importance, though the research findings indicated strong disagreement in how CSOs and FLSMs perceive FLSM competence. CSOs had less confidence in the competence of FLSMs than the FLSMs themselves. Both groups, CSOs and FLSMs, report they would use the FLSM Competency Model as a coaching tool, though this was the first choice for CSOs and second choice for FLSMs. Further, FLSMs noted the primary use of the competency model would be to benchmark their skills.</p>
<p>These conclusions led to multiple implications for how sales leadership and HR organizations should consider selection, performance, and development for FLSMs. A contribution of this research was the creation of a competency model for human resource development purposes. Through identifying the competencies necessary for exemplary performance in FLSMs, this study contributes to the construct of human competence, a component of expertise, which lies at the core of HRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1523422313488753">Swanson &amp; Holton, 2001</xref>). This study also identified recommendations for further research, practice, and theory.</p>
<sec id="section11-1523422313488753">
<title>Potential Implications for Research</title>
<p>Considering not all competency items or behaviors are equally useful for all jobs, job levels, business segments, or regions; and high performance in one role may not translate into high performance in another using the same skill sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1523422313488753">Corporate Executive Board [CEB], 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1523422313488753">Schippmann et al., 2000</xref>), the development of job-specific and context-appropriate competencies seems prudent. A similar study could be conducted for other sales management role levels, e.g., middle, and senior/top levels to determine if there are consistencies among management levels regarding competency importance, or a study could be conducted to examine the effects different business segments (e.g., B2B or B2C) have on the competencies needed for exemplary performance for FLSMs. Similarly, a study could be conducted to examine the effects of different institutional settings. A study could be conducted to determine any correlation between leadership capabilities required for exemplary performance in FLSMs as compared to frontline managers in general. This might allow for determining leadership development priorities and programs. Further study should be conducted to explore the disagreement between CSOs and FLSMs in perceived competence and identify the potential implications for HRD and the sales profession. There is also an opportunity to expand on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1523422313488753">McClelland’s 1973</xref> individual competency construct and determine if competency testing FLSMs can predict occupational success. Leveraging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1523422313488753">Ven and Chuang’s (2005)</xref> classification model using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1523422313488753">Bloom’s (1956)</xref> cognitive taxonomy, a comparative study of the action verbs in the competency statements could be conducted. Finally, as the sales model continues to evolve, so will the FLSM role. Future research will be necessary to keep the model current.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1523422313488753">
<title>Potential Implications for Practice</title>
<p>This research yields many implications for practice. HRD practitioners could use the results of this study to inform talent acquisition, organization development, learning and development, and/or performance consultation to name a few, thus recommendations for practice in the area of FLSM competency are organized by selection, performance, and development.</p>
<p>For selection purposes, the model could be used to construct a position description and interview guide using a behavioral questioning approach, focusing on the eight competency clusters.</p>
<p>One of the conclusions of the research was that FLSMs noted their primary preferred use of the competency was to benchmark their skills, so a competency-based assessment could be created (a) to benchmark skills, highlighting and reinforcing areas of strength and areas for development and/or (b) for multirater feedback against the competencies. Further a role guide could be designed to (a) help the FLSM understand the eight competency clusters and the 34 competencies he/she is expected to demonstrate in the role, (b) serve as a tool to help assess capabilities using the competencies, and (c) support development planning and career pathing. The model could also be used to aid in identifying top talent and plan for succession. Finally, the model can be used with sales leadership and operations to ensure FLSM objectives and compensation plans are competency aligned for performance management and retention purposes.</p>
<p>A development planning tool, that could be part of a role guide, could further support growth. It might include (a) quick tips—brief, simple suggestions to help enhance the level of capability as it relates to the competency; (b) developmental tips—suggested activities, exercises, experiences, external workshops, and on-the-job assignments that an individual can pursue to facilitate development in specific competency areas; and (c) readings—recommended books and articles for additional information. Further, a sales training organization could use the research to diagnose the organization’s training content aimed at FLSMs, determining if it is competency aligned. This could be expanded on by structuring a FLSM curriculum or modifying existing curricula for education related to increasing competence.</p>
<p>Coaching has a big impact on sales performance, as teams that report receiving low-quality coaching are far more likely to underperform than teams receiving high-quality coaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1523422313488753">CEB, 2008</xref>). Practitioners are urged to create a competency-based coaching guide for sales leaders to use with FLSMs. Further, using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422313488753">Lambert’s 2009</xref> study of competencies for entry-level salespeople, a coaching guide for FLSMs to use with their sales representatives could be created.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1523422313488753">
<title>Potential Implications for Theory Building</title>
<p>Up to this point, the HRD profession has not had clear scholarly literature defining competence and expertise for FLSMs, thus theory-building research can be further conducted and expedited leveraging this study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1523422313488753">Lynham’s (2002)</xref> five phases of the general method of applied theory-building research. HRD practitioners and scholars may find utility in expanding the theoretical insight advanced by this study and engaging in the theory-building process through grounded theory research as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1523422313488753">Egan (2002)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1523422313488753">Becker’s (1993)</xref> classic human capital theory study could be leveraged in a theory-building study on the economic effects of investment in FLSM competence. The model could be used to determine implications for human performance technology theory in application to FLSMs. Given its practical implications, the competency model can be leveraged using the case study research approach to continue testing and building theory as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1523422313488753">Dooley (2002)</xref>.</p>
