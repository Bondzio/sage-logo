<abstract>
<p>Drawing on 20 qualitative family interviews with mothers, fathers, and adolescents (aged 16 to 19 years), we explore the experiences of time in parent–adolescent relationships. Changing time patterns comprised of a range of times including time spent together and apart, and more ambiguous times which incorporate elements of both being together and apart are described by participants. These descriptions highlight not only the amount of time and individual subjective experience of these times, but also the meaning that family members collectively make of these times, and how these elements of time contribute to the emergent relationship between parents and adolescents.</p>

<body>
<p>Contemporary Western culture has many expectations of how parents and adolescents are ‘supposed’ to use time. Parents hear demands from their sons and daughters to ‘leave me alone’, offered simultaneously with requests for a ride. Adolescents are asked by their parents to spend more time at home at the same time as they are directed to get a job, take on volunteer work and spend more time on their schoolwork. They are told when to be home, how late to call, where they should spend their time, while also being encouraged to ‘be more responsible for your own time’. Parents and teens, even during the times of least conflict, tread an uneasy path of dependence and independence, autonomy and connection, frequently negotiated in the context of time. Often the ways in which family members spend their time is a marker for them of the state of their relationship and their relative independence.</p>
<p>The current study provides a qualitative analysis of the subjective experience of time spent together and apart in families as described by Canadian mothers, fathers, and adolescent sons or daughters in conversation together. Analysis of such data contributes a rich description and attention to multiple family times, and the social construction of parent–adolescent relationships.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0961463X10387689"><title>Theoretical perspectives and related research</title>
<p>The current research uses family time as a theoretical construct for examining the nature and changing dimensions of parent–child relationships during adolescence. In turn family time is based on a set of social constructionist ideas. Specifically, a social constructionist framework of social interaction conceptualizes time as both constructed by human experience and constructive in the sense of serving to constrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961463X10387689">Giddens, 1984</xref>) and organize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961463X10387689">Durkheim, 1915/1964</xref>) it. Time is both a subjective and objective experience subject to interpersonal negotiations and expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961463X10387689">Daly, 2001</xref>). Although time provides a context for relational interaction, it can also be seen as a critical element in the way that relationships are socially constructed and enacted. This study thereby provides an opportunity to examine the constitutive, constructing and structuring role of time in parent–adolescent relationships. Family time provides a useful conceptual lens for examining the link between time and relationships.</p>
<sec id="sec2-0961463X10387689"><title>Conceptualizing family time</title>
<p><italic>Family time</italic> can be viewed as a context within which important relationships and interactions unfold, and an emergent construct that is reflective of participants’ experiences. Although time itself is historically situated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961463X10387689">Hareven, 1985</xref>), family interactions also are influenced by broader social and historical influences as well as developmental time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961463X10387689">Daly, 1996</xref>). The concept of family time has been romanticized to some extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961463X10387689">Gillis, 1996</xref>) and families not only live <italic>with</italic> measurable and finite time, but also live <italic>by</italic> idealized and infinite time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961463X10387689">Gillis, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Generally, when family members and social scientists refer to family time, they are suggesting that this represents a quality of time spent together that provides benefits to all family members. Shared time provides families with opportunities to ‘replenish themselves and affirm their experience of “we-ness” ’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961463X10387689">Larson and Richards, 1994</xref>: 217). Family rituals and traditions, many of which occur daily, weekly or annually, involve mental time spent in both anticipation and remembering, as well as the time spent engaging in the actual family event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961463X10387689">Gillis, 2001</xref>). There are also negative aspects to shared family time: conflict, inequalities and differing individual perspectives are some examples. It can be argued that there has been a lack of critical examination of the ways in which family time is constituted. In particular, an idealized view of family time limits our examination of multiple and potentially contradictory meanings and experiences, as well as the complex dimensions of family time itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961463X10387689">Daly, 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0961463X10387689"><title>Family time in families with adolescents</title>
<p>The increasing experience of <italic>time scarcity</italic> in families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961463X10387689">Daly, 1996</xref>) may be particularly true during adolescence. Parents and adolescents spend less time together than earlier in family life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961463X10387689">Larson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961463X10387689">Zuzanek, 2000</xref>), with significant commitments and activities that take place apart from each other. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961463X10387689">Turtiainen, Karvonen, and Rahkonen (2007)</xref> suggest that family time may be overlooked by young people as self-evident, and argue for further investigation of the complexities of quality and quantity of time in the context of family life.</p>
<p>External opportunities such as access to a car, parental permission to stay away from home later, peer involvement and jobs might more accurately be described as providing adolescents with alternative ways of designating their time rather than simply understanding these activities as drawing teens away from family time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961463X10387689">Larson et al., 1996</xref>). Larson et al. demonstrated that, although family time and activities such as TV-viewing which involve less opportunity for communication decrease with age, one-on-one time and talk-based activities between adolescents and their parents remains stable. Adolescents’ outside involvements, when viewed by parents to be positive, do not appear to have a deleterious effect on the quality of the parent–adolescent relationship (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961463X10387689">Mesch, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961463X10387689">Mortimer and Shanahan, 1994</xref>). The element of choice, however, appears to be significant and family time that is seen as a default option rather than a choice might not serve a positive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961463X10387689">Crouter et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Although family time during adolescence may be intermittent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961463X10387689">Weingarten, 1998</xref>), and scarce, it has been positively correlated with ‘warmer, more loving, and more intimate’ relationships between parents and children, siblings and in the couple relationship of parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961463X10387689">Crouter et al., 2004</xref>: 159). Family time is also influenced by the virtual connection afforded by electronic means such as cellphones, the internet and pagers when family members are physically apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961463X10387689">Daly, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The current study seeks to deepen our understanding of the complexities and contradictions of idealized family time. Research in the area of family time during adolescence has focused primarily on the scarcity of shared time and the intrinsic threat to shared time of competing adolescent interests such as peer activities. Elements of choice, intermittency, and the nature of time spent together and apart have been identified as important aspects of the time dimensions of adolescent family life.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0961463X10387689"><title>Research design and methodology</title>
<p>A social constructionist perspective on family relationships suggests that multiple perspectives are a critical component of an investigation of the subjective experience of time in families during adolescence. To that end, the interview protocol for this research study included the participation of three family members: mother, father, and adolescent son or daughter, in conjoint family interviews (all family members interviewed at the same time). Conjoint interviews allow for specific attention to the meanings constructed about family time and relationships within the context of these family relationships. Although conjoint interviews potentially attend to the complexity of family experience by keeping in play multiple perspectives, there will also be unstated perspectives and, as with individual interviews, data must be treated as selective and partial. The interviews and data analysis followed a grounded theory methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961463X10387689">Strauss and Corbin, 1990</xref>) utilizing a constructionist orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961463X10387689">Charmaz, 2002</xref>). This methodology allows for an analysis which goes beyond a singular understanding of family time/relationships to incorporate the complexities attending various aspects of family time.</p>
<p>Twenty families (20 mothers and fathers, 11 daughters, 9 sons) were recruited for this study, described to them as an exploration of what teenagers and their parents think about their relationship with each other and how they think time spent together and apart affects it. Families were invited to participate through local media and snowball sampling. In the interest of incorporating both male and female voices for this particular study, families were recruited in which mothers and fathers were both willing to participate and efforts were made to include both adolescent sons and daughters across families. In order to elicit reflections on family time over the course of adolescence, the study targeted families of older adolescents who were still living at home and in their final years of high school (<italic>n</italic> = 17), working (<italic>n</italic> = 1) or attending the first years of post-secondary education (<italic>n</italic> = 2). Adolescents ranged in age from 16 to 19 years (16 yrs – 2, 17 yrs – 15, 18 yrs – 1, 19 yrs – 2). Parents were biological (<italic>n</italic> = 37), adoptive (<italic>n</italic> = 2) or step-parents (<italic>n</italic> = 1) in common-law or marital relationships. Although numbers of adoptive and step-parents were very small, they met the criterion for having lived together with partner and target adolescent for at least 10 years. A study that incorporated more step or adoptive parents would be expected to identify key themes that are unique to these groups, which the current analysis cannot do. While not a selection criterion, all of the adolescents interviewed had siblings – at least one, both older and younger, with one family having four children, six having three children and 13 having two children (eldest child interviewed – 11, middle – 3, youngest – 6). Families resided in urban and rural communities in central Canada, representing some diversity in work status and profession, although they fell predominately within a middle-class family income category &gt;$100,000 – 8 families; $50,000 to $99,999 – 10 families; &lt;$50,000 – 1 family; not disclosed – 1 family).</p>
<p>Interviews were conducted by the first author who is herself a family therapist and parent of young adults. The first question in each conjoint interview asked family members to describe a recent time they, or one of the parents and the adolescent, spent together, with no specific order to which family member answered first. Each family member was invited to contribute a response prior to moving on to follow up questions. The general interview guide included the following topic areas: time spent together – enjoyable and not enjoyable; time spent apart – enjoyable and not enjoyable; how does time spent together/apart influence your relationship with each other; how has the quantity/quality of time spent together/apart changed in your family over the past 7–8 years; if you could change the current balance of time together/apart how would you change it; how do you get more/less time together if you want it and how does that work; and differences in mother/adolescent and father/adolescent time. Not all of these questions were asked in each interview as primary attention was paid to following up on responses with a particular emphasis on the definitions and subjective experience described by the research participants and interesting leads and emergent themes. This follows a process of theoretical sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961463X10387689">Strauss and Corbin, 1998</xref>). Emergent themes were also explored in subsequent interviews with other families. Theoretical saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961463X10387689">Strauss and Corbin, 1998</xref>) was assessed at the point where no new information was emerging from interviews. Over the course of the interview, the interviewer ensured that all participants had equal opportunities to speak, actively soliciting the voices of less talkative family members and normalizing from the beginning the different perspectives that family members could have. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.</p>
<p>Transcripts were analysed on a line-by-line basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961463X10387689">Charmaz, 2003</xref>), with a view to identifying the research participants’ descriptions of their experience. Initial coding of concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961463X10387689">Charmaz, 2002</xref>) was further classified into categories based on an array of dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961463X10387689">Glaser and Strauss, 1967</xref>). Field notes and memo-writing allowed for a contextualizing of interviews and a record of the process of categorization, ensuring that emergent ideas were fully grounded in the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961463X10387689">Glaser and Strauss, 1967</xref>), and to identify potential gaps in earlier interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961463X10387689">Charmaz, 2002</xref>). One of the primary categories to emerge in this analysis included the changing time patterns associated with adolescence, which is the focus of this paper.</p>

<p>Note that for ease of identifying the qualitative data presented here, informants are presented as Mother, Father, Daughter and Son, followed by a hyphen and number designating the family. We have endeavoured to capture the collaborative flavor of these data and the various contributions of parents and teens, while still ensuring clarity and highlighting sections of transcripts that most clearly articulate the concepts being presented. Although these quotes are from individuals, they emerged in the context of a family conversation and are, therefore, reflective of the family’s and individual family members’ construction of meaning within that context.</p>
<p>The themes which emerged from these data that were related to changing time patterns provide a descriptive and orienting view to the types of time that parents and adolescents experience within families. These themes are incorporated in the following section under the headings of: (i) time spent together (ordinary/special, planned/unplanned, mutually engaged, and ambiguous times); (ii) time spent apart (adolescent social life/work, making space in the relationship, and new experiences); and (iii) changing time patterns (including the meaning and value attached to time together/time apart).</p>
<sec id="sec6-0961463X10387689"><title>Time spent together</title>
<sec id="sec7-0961463X10387689"><title>Ordinary and special time</title>
<p>Parents and adolescents described both ordinary time (such as mealtimes and traveling together to school or other activities) and special time (such as birthday celebrations and vacations) spent together. Ordinary times are those which occur with some regularity or dependability and in which discussions of the important or mundane occur, initiated by teens or their parents. These times were typically described by family members as being subjectively experienced as relaxing or non-stressful, as Daughter-9 said of family meals: ‘It feels <italic>normal</italic> to be here, and kind of it’s, like, the <italic>unusual</italic> thing if I go out, like, even if it is, like, frequent that I go out.’</p>
<p>Special times, such as family celebrations or vacations were experienced by these parents and adolescents as qualitatively different from ordinary time. Family traditions appeared to hold a significant position as both historical markers and current celebrations. Father-10 talked about their annual time with extended family at the beach as serving as a ‘touchstone … a reference point, you know, of things we used to do, things we’re doing now’. In addition, there appeared to be a future-orientation in that ‘there’ll always be those traditions where the whole family gets together’ (Daughter-8). The quality of time described as attending vacation time was generally less hurried and allowed for more relaxed interaction between family members. Son-4 suggested that ‘time in the city is so hurried and, you don’t necessarily have the time to sit around for half an hour and just talk, so that’s what we do [on vacation], obviously that’s really good for our relationship’. In some families, adolescents expressed less interest in family vacations as they got older, and in others they continued to be very interested in traditional or changed vacation plans, even taking on new roles in organizing for these. Parents reported being responsive to adolescents’ wishes in cancelling or maintaining shared summer vacations, and in changing family activities to fit new interests such as learning new sports together, attending theatre productions or arranging restaurant dinners. Parents stated that although their own preferences or interests would not necessarily direct these changes, they expected these types of changes to occur in family scheduling as children got older, contributed to family decisions and developed new interests. Adolescents made time for family plans, organized camping gear, and engaged in making suggestions for where and what these plans might entail. An evolution was described that moved away from parent-initiated activities in response to altered schedules and preferences associated with adolescence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0961463X10387689"><title>Planned and unplanned time</title>
<p>The nature of time spent together was described as ranging from spontaneous time in the midst of busy family schedules to intentionally planned time for activities or conversations. Adolescents were seen as taking on more responsibility for their own schedules, frequently requiring that family plans be ‘built around what she [adolescent] has organized or in place’ (Mother-2). Unplanned, or incidental, time together was perhaps more the norm than planned and structured time for these families. Parents and adolescents stated that they had become adept at making the most of positive time that presented itself, as well as dealing with unanticipated crisis management or problem-solving. One family described the importance of spontaneous or unplanned time together from several perspectives. Daughter-3 suggested that this brief one-on-one time with her parents around her busy schedule was ‘relaxing’ and preferable to spending time with both of them together. Her father (Father-3) described a time when he went to her workplace for a brief chat and suggested that because ‘so much of it [interaction between parents and their daughter] is negative stuff, that it’s nice to be in a place where it isn’t … we actually talked about something we needed to talk about’. Mother-3 will spontaneously invite her daughter to go for coffee and described this one-on-one time as ‘fun … I probably get to know her a bit better than when I’m cleaning, running around with all the kids [younger siblings]’. Each of these family members was describing intentional action they were taking to ensure that shorter amounts of found time were structured so as to enhance the possibility of positive interaction and avoid potential conflict – the daughter by approaching only one parent at a time for brief interactions and the parents by finding a context that they found more amenable to positive interactions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0961463X10387689"><title>Mutual engagement</title>
<p>These parents and teens described times spent together that involved the full and present participation of each family member. They described the direct interaction and mutual engagement entailed, for example, in shared activities such as chores or recreation, or conversations arising incidentally or occurring during time set aside for the discussion of important issues.</p>
<p>Family members described enjoyable shared activities, both household tasks and leisure-time pursuits. Daughter-19 suggested that time spent together engaged in a shared activity like ‘going for a ski or even driving listening to music and talking about music’ has a greater ease to it than time that is limited to talk. Father-2 talked about his increased enjoyment in spending time with his adolescent children who now find pleasure in shared activities that ‘I enjoy as well … I think socializing with them now is like socializing with peer groups, um, it’s fun and it’s nice to see them enjoying it as well’.</p>
<p>Not all of the mutually engaging time spent together was identified as pleasurable by family members. Working out conflict or working together to meet school expectations generally demands the full engagement of all participants but was seen by parents as ‘work’ and by adolescents as something to be avoided. Father-5 talked about their joint efforts with respect to schoolwork as ‘all of a sudden, we’re into … crisis management’. Son-10 said that when he hears ‘you have to get this done’ from his parents, he ‘ignore[s] them’ and ‘just sorta push[es] it off until later’. Sometimes the challenge or effort is in finding ways to spend time together that will allow for mutual engagement. Mother-3 talked about it being ‘hard to catch up with her’ daughter, and Father-3 suggested that it’s ‘hard to find stuff where there’s common ground.’ Daughter-3 agreed with these statements and pointed to the complexity of mutual engagement with both parents when she said that ‘it’s always one parent who I’m fighting with and the other parent’s … on my side’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0961463X10387689"><title>Ambiguous togetherness</title>
<p>Families who were interviewed for this study pointed to times when they were ‘together’ in the sense of being in the same place, but not necessarily directly engaged with each other. In addition, they identified times when they were physically separated but able to connect with each other across distance in order to be together in time. We have chosen to refer to this as <italic>ambiguous togetherness</italic>, referring to the ways in which this might be experienced as time spent both together and apart. Father-16 described one form of ambiguous togetherness:<disp-quote>
<p>Okay, this is a different sort of a time – it’s more like being in the audience. ‘Cause he enjoys playing music. So I like being around him – it’s not like we’re – I’m spending time with him, but I’m – I don’t know what to say. I’m appreciating just being in the same house with him. I can be upstairs and still be hearing it. But when other musicians have been over or when Isaac and his brother are playing, that sort of thing.</p></disp-quote>This father (Father-16) indicated that being in the position of ‘audience’ member allows him to know and understand his son in an important way. They are together in the sense of sharing, indirectly, his son’s performance of music. Although they are sharing time, they are not physically in the same space or directly interacting, and in fact, the son is more directly engaged with his peers at the time. Other families identified this parental position of audience member or observer as occurring during adolescent sporting events, theatre or concert presentations and school events. Parents described these as opportunities to learn about their sons and daughters in new and different ways. Son-6 described the value, for him, of having such an audience for his performance of an important aspect of his identity while not directly interacting with his parents:<disp-quote>
<p>Son: She [my mother] comes to my sports all the time. Like, comes to games and stuff, forgot about that.</p>
<p>Interviewer: Yeah. And is that something that’s important to you?</p>
<p>Son: Yeah, I like having people, my family, there when I’m playing.</p>
<p>Interviewer: What do you like about that?</p>
<p>Son: I don’t know, just to see, ‘cause [my brother]’s like the smart one, he gets all the good marks, but he never played sports competitively like I do. I just like to show off in that way. [laughs]</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Another type of ambiguous togetherness occurs when family members are physically apart but find other means to connect. For example, telephones and cellphones allow teens to call home and parents to know where their sons and daughters are and when they will be home. This can be experienced as direct time shared over the phone lines while family members are in quite separate spaces. This decoupling of space and time, and the importance of being linked in time while being physically apart was described by Daughter-11: ‘I love – it may sound – I don’t know, but I love that I can just phone home, like from school or from work, and just be like, okay, what are you guys doing?’ Carrying a cellphone also provides the potential to share time even though it may not be utilized. Son-16 said ‘I guess whenever I’m out I always have my cellphone on me so if my parents ever need to contact me they can’. His mother (Mother-16) responded that this ‘gives me some peace of mind knowing that he’s just a phone call away … if something came up, or I did need to know or if he didn’t show up the next morning … I have a means of locating him’. This latter example points to an even more ambiguous type of potential connection, not grounded in time or physical space, that provides a sense of presence in each others’ lives even when not utilized.</p>
<p>In addition, technology such as instant messaging and e-mail can allow for adolescents to be in contact with their peers while in the same physical space as their parents. In these cases time might be considered to be shared with parents in the sense that they are physically together, but engagement and focus could be directed elsewhere suggesting that time is actually being spent apart. Son-17 described the time that he and his brother spend after dinner, while his parents are spending couple time together: ‘Electronics. Computers. I’ll be honest. After dinner, what happens is [brother] and I will go downstairs. He’ll hop on his computer and I’ll hop on mine and find something to do.’ His mother (Mother-17) interjected that he will be multitasking at this point, looking up articles on the computer, listening to music and communicating with his friends using instant messaging software. Son-17 normalized this: ‘Well, I’m an adolescent of the 2000s’ and went on to say, in response to the interviewer’s question about how he thinks this influences time together, that ‘at that time we’re in the same building but we’re worlds apart’.</p>
<p>Considering these more ambiguous times when parents and adolescents are together and not together, or apart and not apart, captures the complexity of time when adolescents are engaging in new and varied activities away from family at the same time as parents and adolescents are maintaining varying levels of connection.</p>

<p>All of the families interviewed for this study agreed that parents and adolescents were spending more time apart relative to younger years. Various attributions regarding time apart were made by parents and adolescents. The influence of time apart on overall family interaction and parent–adolescent relationships was also articulated by family members.</p>
<sec id="sec12-0961463X10387689"><title>Adolescent social life and work</title>
<p>Not surprisingly, adolescent social life and work provide a major impetus for time spent apart from parents. This was viewed by both parents and adolescents as a normal developmental expectation. Parents saw this as ‘natural, when a kid gets to be 17 years old, he wants to spend time with his friends’ (Father-6). Adolescents also saw increased time, and specific times, with peers as ‘so obvious, like, that on a Friday night, like, when you’re 17 you go out with your friends … it’s not so much of a choice that it’s just, like, the natural way’ (Daughter-1). Father-2 talked about the value of this increased independence in allowing adolescents to ‘try things out that they might not be quite so comfortable in doing with their parents’. In addition to new opportunities, there are benefits to being employed according to him: ‘with [Daughter-2] now working part time and things like that, she has the financial ability to go out and do some of these things that she would have needed our financial help with in the past’. This observation points to the value, not only of the increased independence for adolescents, but also of an accompanying decrease in parental responsibility.</p>
<p>These parents also appeared to be assessing their sons’ and daughters’ developing independence based on their observations of how they handled time away from family. Permission-giving for future opportunities was frequently described as being based on how past events have unfolded. This information was identified as ‘reference material’ related to an adolescent’s developing maturity and ability to handle situations on his/her own. Parents talked about ‘checking in’ to ensure that adolescents are feeling ‘safe’ or ‘okay’ on their way out with friends or late at night when they come home. Both parents and adolescents spoke of using some of their time together to discuss what has happened during work or while out with peers as a way to ‘connect’ with each other regarding this time apart.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0961463X10387689"><title>Making space in the parent–adolescent relationship</title>
<p>Parents and adolescents referred to taking time apart, frequently using the language of distance or space, in order to allow for a ‘cooling off’ period or to deal with conflict without threatening their relationship. Some adolescents indicated that this is easier with one parent than the other, or that parents don’t step back sufficiently to allow for tension to dissipate, even if they say that they do. Daughter-13 talked about recognizing when she fails to step back when she is angry, expecting her parents to do the moving for her:<disp-quote>
<p>Well I think if one of us is in a bad mood it kind of sets alarm bells off … I’ll be kinda mean in a bad mood, and I sometimes feel I have a right to be because I’m a teenager … and they should just have to, you know, step back and get out of my way, but then I end up angering them and I don’t understand why they’re angry, because this is my right, and then afterwards … when I calm down and I think about it, I realize I was a total jerk to them and it’s not really fair.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Time apart was viewed as helpful in maintaining relationships and as difficult to do. It was described as ‘taking the stress off ’ (Son-7) the relationship and providing for some ‘absence [which] makes the heart grow fonder’ (Father-14). Parents and their sons and daughters talked about the importance of being able to read the verbal and non-verbal signs to ‘give me space when I need it’ (Daughter-8), and to appreciate that each family member is allowed to ‘have our own time’ (Son-18) and ‘have our own rhythm’ (Father-18). Family discussions highlighted that individuals vary with respect to their skill level in stepping back from conflictual interactions and difficulties in doing this were not limited to only parents or only adolescents.</p>
<p>In addition to valuing time apart as a way to maintain and perhaps repair relationships, family members talked about the importance of noticing when they have been spending too much time apart and taking action to initiate time together. Parents and teens indicated that they will suggest time together in order to compensate for time apart, an initiative which can be viewed as action taken in the service of relationship maintenance or repair.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0961463X10387689"><title>New experiences and story-telling</title>
<p>Families talked about time spent apart as providing for new experiences that in turn can contribute to time shared with family. Daughter-11 talked about being able to share stories with her parents:<disp-quote>
<p>And I love that I’ll come home from work, and … they’ll both ask me about how it went, and I’ll always have stories from [workplace], because something always happens, or I learn something new about a new culture that I want to go travel there. And so I love being able to share that with my parents, because it’s another thing that we can talk about.</p></disp-quote>Adolescents were described as learning new skills from people outside of their family, developing relationships with peers who come from different backgrounds, and bringing this revised view of the world and these new skills and experiences back to the family. Father-11 talked about seeing the influence of others in his daughter’s life:<disp-quote>
<p>For a long time they spend a lot of their time here at home, and we’re their focus and that. And all of a sudden – and it’s not all of a sudden, it changes … you see that their time with you is being cut down, and when you meet certain people … see certain things that come out of your children’s mouth, or some ideas or whatever, as being, you know, coming from another source. And sometimes you look at that as a rival, and sometimes you’re going, okay, well this gives them a good idea and a way for growth.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Not all of what is brought back to families was seen as positive, but this time apart was viewed as dynamic and influential.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-0961463X10387689"><title>Changing time patterns</title>
<p>Beyond a simple description of time, participant families were asked to reflect on their experience of time and the meaning of time spent together and apart in the context of their relationships. Their responses indicated that time patterns for the parent–child relationship are changing during adolescence.</p>
<p>Family life, parental expectations and adolescents’ engagement in their daily lives appear to be organized around the expectation that they will be spending considerable time apart. Families viewed themselves as functioning well when there was a significant balance of time that adolescents spent away from home. There was also an acknowledgement of the importance family members placed on spending some time together. Both parents and adolescents described their intentions regarding ‘making time’ by planning for time together and an articulation of the types of times that are most significant to them.</p>
<sec id="sec16-0961463X10387689"><title>Value and meaning attached to time spent together</title>
<p>Time together was seen as a reflection of the importance of this relationship. Time was viewed as the currency or form of expression within relationships, an overt expression of caring. Making time to spend together in the midst of other commitments was seen as an expression of the priority or value placed on this particular relationship. Son-10 said that ‘if you want to have a good relationship, you have to make time’. Father-2 supported this notion:<disp-quote>
<p>I think we all go around kind of looking for a sense of validation because of how much [time] you spend with me, you know, if adults were doing it you’d call it dating or something … if there is some sense of affection, or liking each other, then it’s going to translate into the amount of time you spend with them.</p></disp-quote>In addition, time that is spent together with family members appears to take on an added significance during adolescence because of the degree of choice that adolescents are seen as being able to exercise with respect to their own time. When teens do spend time with their families, parents acknowledge that they have actively made time to do this and see it as an ‘honor’. Son-4 observed that, ‘as I have had less family time … I think I have, definitely, appreciated it more’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-0961463X10387689"><title>Value and meaning attached to time spent apart</title>
<p>Time apart appears to be utilized by these parents and teens to expand and adapt their relationship with each other, as well as their knowledge of themselves. Father-5 described the important role that he sees time apart playing in their relationship, as well as a sense of ongoing connection between parent and child:<disp-quote>
<p> … you’ve gotta use your own experience as a son with a parent … I know how important it was for me to have a sphere of influence out here, away from, away from the home, and I’m quite prepared for him to be able to have that and feel like I’m still connected with him, you know, that somehow I haven’t, I haven’t lost him, at least not altogether.</p></disp-quote>Daughter-9 talked about this evolution of separateness while maintaining some connection in a slightly different way:<disp-quote>
<p>like, it is a different relationship’ cause it used to just be you guys [parents] were completely involved in what I was doing … and now, it’s like I have this separate life that I, like, give you little bits of, you know?</p></disp-quote>Knowledge acquired over the course of their lifetime to-date can be seen as informing the ways in which parents and adolescents use time in their interactions during adolescence. Mother-16 spoke of how important it is to her to remember who her son is and to honor the space or separateness that he needs for processing information. She described their interaction in this way:<disp-quote>
<p>… if there’s something that I feel is really important that he needs to do, and I know that that’s going to incite a lot of fear in him, pushing harder only makes it worse and so, I just need to back away and give him time to think and come back at it later when he’s calm and approach it very softly with him … would you agree [son] that, that you need time to think and know? <italic>[Son-16: Yeah]</italic></p></disp-quote>All family members spoke of gaining new perspectives on each other as they hear about, and observe, the successes and failures associated with individual pursuits. Parents talked about their awareness of how their sons and daughters are ‘maturing’, and spoke of recognizing what is a ‘big deal’ for them, a sign that they are ‘taking a step forward’. Adolescents identified that they have an increased appreciation of their parents’ ‘couple’ time: ‘when you guys do your own thing, I’ve learned that that is your own thing like I have my own thing. It’s just this almost unspoken rule that you can’t intrude because that is their territory for this time’ (Son-18).</p>

<sec id="sec18-0961463X10387689" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>When asked about time spent together and apart, these family members described a range of times: special, ordinary, spontaneous and intentionally planned time together, as well as ambiguous times that contain elements of being both together and apart; and the designation of time within and outside of families that enhances or obstructs parent–teen relationships, couple relationships and individual pursuits. When questions are posed within the context of time, family members’ responses highlight not only the amount of time and their individual subjective experience of these times, but also the meaning that they collectively make of these times, and how these elements of time contribute to the emergent relationship between parents and adolescents. In reflecting on time then, activities, space, intention, spontaneity, and relational connection are incorporated as important aspects of descriptions of the time dimensions of family life.</p>
<p>Although family time during adolescence has been examined more frequently from the perspective of adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961463X10387689">Larson and Richards, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961463X10387689">Larson et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961463X10387689">Turtiainen et al., 2007</xref>), the current study contributes the experience of both parents and teens, and focuses in particular on their co-construction of meaning associated with time together and apart. As described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961463X10387689">Gillis (1996)</xref> these family members demonstrate the ways in which they are utilizing time as an ‘active agent’ (1996: 6) to create their own family time and enact change within their relationships and selves. Gillis identifies the time we ‘live by’ as ‘something we use to think about the world and to act on it’ (1996: 6). The families who participated in this study demonstrate the ways in which they use the time they ‘live with’ as a tool in the active construction of their relationships and their own developmental change, frequently pointing to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961463X10387689">Weingarten (1998)</xref> refers to as intermittent time. They also point to the idealized time they ‘live by’ when they identify the constraints and limits to the kinds of time they most appreciate.</p>
<p>Jointly constructed family descriptions of time spent together and apart demonstrate support for previous findings grounded primarily in the experience of adolescents. As originally described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961463X10387689">Larson et al. (1996)</xref>, these results indicate a continuation of parent–adolescent connection in the face of decreased time spent together, with adolescents more frequently taking on leadership roles in interactions with their parents. Larson and his colleagues suggest that adolescents, rather than ‘leaving’ families in order to avoid conflict, are instead moving toward opportunities provided by interactions outside of the family. The current study suggests some added complexity to these ideas: (i) there are competing time demands for both parents and adolescents; and (ii) although teens are taking time (often with parental encouragement) directed toward new experiences for themselves, both parents and adolescents also use time apart (as well as time together) to manage their relationships. Time is not simply used only to further adolescent autonomy, but also to maintain the evolving relationship and to meet parental needs. Further complexity in conceptualizing time apart and time together is added by the identification of more ambiguous times that have not previously been described in the literature.</p>
<p>Examining the meanings that are attached to time spent apart and together provides a view of how parents and adolescents are constructing time within their relationship: what is expected or accepted as ‘normal’ or ‘natural’ in the context of adolescence and what is contested or challenged. This analysis supports current literature that describes less time spent together during adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961463X10387689">Bianchi et al., 2006</xref>), and demonstrates that both parents and teens accept this as a natural change. As posited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961463X10387689">Crouter et al. (2004)</xref>, this study points to the important influence of choice on how family time is perceived, and extends this to incorporate the potential for the perceived availability of choices to be contested territory for parents and adolescents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961463X10387689">Best (2006)</xref>, in her examination of parent–adolescent negotiation of driving privileges, describes the important distinction between adolescent ‘freedom from’ (defined in terms of parental control) and ‘freedom to’ (defined in terms of opportunities previously unavailable to them) and this may be an important aspect of time designation. Choosing to spend time together may be viewed as a demonstration that this is a significant relationship, particularly as the value of time increases in relation to its decreased availability during adolescence. The expenditure of time apart is also viewed as an important investment in adolescent development and autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961463X10387689">Larson et al., 1996</xref>). The current study suggests that time apart can benefit parents in addition to adolescents, and serve parent–teen relationship needs by facilitating conflict resolution and relationship maintenance. Similar to the examples provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961463X10387689">Hochschild (1997)</xref>, demonstrating the ways in which adults may use work time to compensate for negative family interactions, the analysis of these data suggests that time apart can benefit parent–adolescent relationships. Furthering our conceptualization of how times spent apart and times spent together interact serves to integrate some of the complexities of non-idealized family time and more critically examine family time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961463X10387689">Daly, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Although parents and adolescents identify new ways of being together with less obligatory time or dependency requirements, they also talk about what has been maintained in the face of other demands (for example, family meals and special occasions). These results provide support for the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961463X10387689">Hutchinson et al. (2007)</xref> which suggest that shared family activities provide an opportunity for ‘family making’ in the face of challenges and changes to family structure. Similarly to the current study, adolescents in divorced families expressed the importance of being able to connect with their parents, particularly around mealtimes and ‘everyday’ activities, in order to preserve family cohesion, as well as using e-mail and telephone contact to maintain connection with non-present parents. The current analysis indicates that adolescence also provides an opportunity for families to reassess what to keep and what to change about family traditions such as vacations – further evidence of the flexibility of family making.</p>
<p>Decreased dependency and a reduced role for parents in adolescent time allocation allows for the gradual separation of an adolescent’s schedule from the family schedule. This separation is not complete, but what is emerging is more autonomy with respect to time, and changed opportunities for expression of oneself through the use of time outside and inside of the family context. In families with young children, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961463X10387689">Thorpe and Daly (1999)</xref> observed that parents’ experience of time is radically adjusted upon becoming parents, and that their time becomes ‘parented’ in the sense that it is time that is ‘tethered to the needs, identities and activities of children’ (1999: 209). The current analysis suggests that parents’ experience of time is again transformed during adolescence. Although responsibility continues to provide a framework for a portion of parents’ time and time decisions, there is a de-coupling of parent and adolescent time that leads to a different experience of time for both. This allows parents to reduce and adapt their ‘time-management’ role, attend to being ‘available’ while not necessarily directly involved in their child’s activities, and to potentially engage in less hierarchical interaction that is premised on parent and adolescent shared interests. These results suggest that parents of adolescents, although still prioritizing time for parenting activities and responsibilities, begin to experience more autonomy with respect to their own time.</p>
<p>The families interviewed for this study are, generally speaking, members of the dominant culture. Although representing some diversity with respect to socioeconomic background, they are not demonstrably marginalized within the communities in which they live. The results of this study suggest that these families are adopting accepted meanings associated with time together and apart and the negotiation of autonomy and family connection that are held within the dominant culture. We would expect that families who are part of more marginalized sub-populations could hold quite different views of the meaning and negotiation of time. For example, time apart could be potentially viewed by immigrant families as pulling adolescents away from their cultural roots and into dominant cultural values, and time together might be seen as an opportunity not only for sustaining family connection but also cultural identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961463X10387689">Ashbourne et al., 2009</xref>). In addition to considering cultural influences on family experience, we would expect the experience of time and space in families who live across two households as a result of separation or divorce to be somewhat different from that which the families in this study have described. Further investigation of the diversity of these family experiences of time is warranted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-0961463X10387689"><title>Implications and conclusions</title>
<p>These data tell us something about families who have navigated some years of adolescence together, and who are reportedly making their relationships, and the time aspects of family life, work fairly well for them. While family members described both positive and negative interactions, and successes as well as failures in making time and space negotiations work for them, they were also willing meet with a family researcher to talk about time and their relationships, suggesting that this may be a somewhat unique group vis-à-vis other families. Their willingness to talk together about their experience in the presence of a researcher provides us with a window on some of the complexities of their negotiations of time patterns in response to adolescence. This methodology could also be utilized in exploring the construction of meaning in families during other times of transition or adaptation. While not more complete than the data collected through interviews with individual family members, conjoint interviews do provide an additional perspective on the collective meaning-making and experience in families. Various family members were able to contribute their own perspectives to the family discussion and this introduced new ideas that had not been directly elicited by the interviewer These new ideas could either be taken up in agreement by others, with additional description provided, or challenged from alternative perspectives. For example, parents initially talked about appreciating their role as observers and listeners in the ambiguous shared time and adolescents agreed that this was time that they valued as well for somewhat different reasons. There were also instances when adolescents or parents would challenge a family member’s assertion, for example that he/she would walk away from arguments or bring specific concerns to the others. Both agreement and disagreement from different perspectives within the family provide rich data from which to understand family processes.</p>
<p>These parents and adolescents generally agree that adolescence has associated with it a decrease in the amount of time spent together and the types of activities which will accompany shared family time. They are not, however, expecting that there will be no time spent together and participate in active negotiation to allow for planned or spontaneous shared time. While parents demonstrate responsiveness to their sons’ and daughters’ interests and wishes when they agree to cancel family vacations, or continue traditional camping trips, they also indicate their commitment to finding ways to continue some forms of time together by pushing or inviting new types of time together. Adolescents, with increased demands on their time from outside of their families, make room in their schedules for talks, dinners, and special occasions, with variations in these time patterns reflective of family and individual differences. The family discussions of time influences are not solely about time together and how to get it, nor do they only reflect on the positive aspects of shared time. Some types of time together can be experienced as stressful and as very hard work. Time spent apart can serve to enrich family life by contributing new and different experiences and stories, and time apart can be used in the service of managing the relationship space between parents and adolescents. Technology and more ambiguous times together demonstrate the ways in which families may actively decouple time and space to allow for connection and distance, an important dialectical tension in parent/adolescent relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961463X10387689">Ashbourne, 2009</xref>). This initial study of temporal dimensions of family life exploring a relatively homogeneous group of families can be extended in the areas of family form and other influences on the construction of meaning in families as indicated above. In particular, the dimensions of time and space that attach to separated/divorced families living in two households, or migrant families adapting across cultures and in the face of dominant cultural norms and expectations of family time and adolescence itself, may illuminate some of the stable and changing patterns of family relationships during adolescence. The current data suggest that time takes on new meanings for families during adolescence which can be described in terms of providing for and adapting to autonomy and change, as well as serving as a means of maintaining connection and stability. Enhancing our awareness of these meanings, particularly as they are given voice from the multiple perspectives of parents and adolescents, can contribute to the knowledge base that is utilized by family therapists and family policy-makers interested in supporting families during adolescence and broader transitions such as those associated with migration and family separation.</p>
