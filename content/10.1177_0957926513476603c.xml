<p><italic>Multimodality in Practice</italic> distinguishes itself from many other volumes on multimodal studies with its distinctive organizing theme. The first eight chapters in Part I primarily investigate social actors and the actions they take. Chapter 1 is the introductory chapter to this part, in which the main ideas of each chapter are introduced with technical terms from mediated discourse analysis. Chapter 2 by Sigrid Norris tackles touch/response-feel, a mode that has received very little attention, by analysing instances of horseback riding and teaching with respect to the utterance-foot/leg-hand modal aggregate. The findings shed new light on the study of teaching and learning a touch/response-feel in other pedagogic contexts. Through analysing technologically mediated sensory perceptions in video conferencing, Chapter 3 by Jens Leonhoff points out the inappropriateness of pre-reflexive notions about perception, showing that technology is a significant determinant of the conditions of realization of communication. Chapter 4 by Helen Sissons critically examines public relations by looking at the interactions in meetings between public relations officers and between officer and mayor. It unveils how the underlying power structure may exert an influence on media coverage. Through investigating visitor interactions with scientific visualizations in a science museum, Chapter 5 by Shawn M Rowe argues that complex visualizations do not afford enough opportunities for public audiences to actively make meaning in informal education settings. Chapter 6 by Gudrun Frommherz looks into temporal rhythms and ritual actions in Indian Aipan art making. It shows how a purposeful synchronization of the rhythms distinguishes ritual practices from everyday actions, revealing the affordance of temporal density facilitated by modal attention. Chapter 7 by Rodney H Jones examines how gay men construct and consume multimodal displays of themselves on social networking websites. It demonstrates that diverse semiotic artifacts (pictures, textual descriptions, videos, etc.) are deployed strategically with various staging and viewing equipment, which allows users to control and negotiate access. Taking social semiotic theory as its theoretical underpinning, Chapter 8 by Carey Jewitt reveals that resources in digital texts, layering and hyperlinks in particular, challenge the traditional notion of text as stable and thus make visible the active process of reception as dynamic remaking.</p>
<p>The subsequent eight chapters in Part II focus on cultural tools that mediate a social actor’s actions, with the introductory Chapter 9 helping readers gain the main idea of this part from the perspective of mediated discourse analysis. Taking a social semiotic approach to studying PowerPoint design and its use, Chapter 10 by Emilia Djonov and Theo van Leeuwen redefines the notions of markedness and foregrounding, and through employing a model of the relationship between discourse and social practice it points out that software design regulates its use. Through analysing the attention that marketing communications require in getting their messages through in billboard advertising, Chapter 11 by Paul White demonstrates that the convergence of media technologies gives rise to hybrid sites of engagement and spaces of communication, revealing how time and space are being redesigned through the use of convergent media in marketing contexts. Chapter 12 by Marissa KLE, Kay L O’Halloran and Kevin Judd mathematically models multimodal discourse by using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compute visualizations that describe the main features of texts from a systemic functional perspective. Chapter 13 by Denise M Conroy and Richard W Brookes adopts historical and geosemiotic approaches to the co-construction of a brand of children’s hospital, demonstrating how a brand may have different meanings for managers and consumers by considering indexicality, dialogicality and selection. Through examining the construction of voice, synchronization and layered simultaneity in visual images of Oman’s magazine <italic>Challenge</italic> from the perspective of mediated discourse analysis, Chapter 14 by Najma Al Zidjaly shows how visual texts may unintentionally hinder social causes, highlighting the importance of personal agency in the analysis of multimodal texts on disability. Through a social semiotic analysis of the discursive elements in an animation series, <italic>The Unsustainables</italic>, Chapter 15 by Carmen Daniela Maier reveals how environmental knowledge is recontextualized multimodally through animation techniques which facilitate the communication of environmental messages to young audiences. The concluding Chapter 16 recapitulates the connections between the key notions in mediated discourse analysis in relation to the major contributions of the chapters in the volume. As emphasized throughout the volume, cultural tools, social actors and actions are interconnected in all multimodal phenomena. Based on a comparison of the understandings of mode in social semiotic theory and mediated discourse theory, it proposes that communicative modes are ‘complex cultural tools’ and can be viewed as ‘an integral part in social action’ (p. 223).</p>
<p>Overall, this volume is innovative in introducing and explicating the rationale for mediated discourse analysis by taking stock of diverse theories and methodologies in state-of-the-art research on multimodality. It will be of great value to those who are working on multimodality on theoretical, methodological and practical levels.</p>
