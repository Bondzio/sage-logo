<p>Sociology professor Steve Fuller’s latest book deals with contemporary treatments of the notion of ‘the human’, with an eye set on its future developments, anchored on disruptively pervasive technologies that are already being felt. A contextual account of its historical unfolding is provided, so that the reader can locate the evolution of the notion within the bigger setting of the evolving philosophical landscape in the West.</p>
<p>The book is not destined to be a pop-culture best seller; the language requires a training familiar to those pursuing graduate studies – or at least last year honor undergraduate – in fields related to philosophy, sociology, humanities, or science studies. One could identify a style found in post eighteenth-century German philosophy: dense paragraphs composed of sentences that are each an encapsulated rational equation. Accordingly, one could also certainly expect that, as is the case with several German philosophers (e.g., Immanuel Kant, Jürgen Habermas), many will struggle to capture the ultimate gist of Fuller’s argument. Rigorous thinking, when conveyed, will always require patience. Once the rigor challenge has been met, the book stands out, in the opinion of this reader, as the most informed account of the current state of affairs regarding what we dare to call ‘the human’ vis-a-vis the latest and gravest challenges coming from technology and science. Indeed, one of the features that sets this book apart is the addressing of issues that other authors are years away from even acknowledging – let alone philosophically digesting.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 provides an account of the deployment of the notion of <italic>humanity</italic> in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This depiction is given through the lens of a conflicted duality of, on the one hand, a biological and naturalized take on humans (race), and, on the other, an ‘exalting’ theological anthropocentrism (religion). This dichotomy’s narrative is portrayed in the recounting of Britain’s development of sociology per se, from a biology-based approach – which collaborated with the theoretical core of the European ‘welfare state’ – to a distancing from this position, focusing instead until today on the distinctly ‘human’ aspect of the social.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 dwells deeper in history, going as far back as the twelfth century, in order to evince the two major competing worldviews in the still forming European mind: the Dominicans and the Franciscans. The distinct existential cosmologies that these pre-Reformation orders portrayed can give us cues to what later evolved into the current – but most importantly, future – notion of what it means to be human. Franciscans tended to refer to the relation between God and humans as one of univocity (the adjectives that apply to the Creator also apply to the creatures, in different degree, not kind); humans are unique beings (created in <italic>imago Dei</italic>) that have a destiny that will close the gap with their Creator by means of transcending themselves. Here we can allegedly find a proto- <italic>transhumanism</italic>. Dominicans, on the other side, would defend an analogical referring to the Creator, siding with a more egalitarian outlook between humans and the rest of the nature: an incipient <italic>post-humanism</italic> could be identified here instead. The former epistemic attitude (Franciscan) would provide the impetus for the eventual Scientific Revolution: the other side of the coin of what is now known as the Protestant Reformation.</p>
<p>For those eager to have a glimpse into what is currently going on in technology and science that we should be aware of – even concerned about – in terms of their pervasive modification of the human, Chapter 3 will furnish plenty of worrisome material. Acknowledging that post-Cold War science funding has been almost exclusively focused on the biological sciences, with a proclivity for a non-interventionist state role, the current strategy for a new techno-science unification is portrayed. Focusing on nanotech, infotech, biotech and cognitive science, the Converging Technologies Agenda promises positive and radical human enhancements for the near future. Here the heretical Christian epistemic ethos christened in the deeply invasive Chemical Worldview, whose Franciscan themes inspire a penchant for ‘reality modification’, lets itself be felt. Fuller, however, is quick to perform a reality-check of this project, reckoning the hype that is usually found lurking. Be as it may, some of these enhancements (such as pharmaceutical cognitive enhancements and surgical machine extensions) seem to be already here. Accordingly, the prospects of what we understand as ‘human’ will likely undergo revision. Beyond the alleged aim for unifying the sciences, one major drive behind this mega-enterprise might be the possible economic benefits that entire societies could receive from these enhancements (e.g., more productive workers retiring at an older age; healthier individuals placing less of a burden on a health care system; cognitively enhanced individuals pushing innovation to the next level, faster; and surviving a global climate catastrophe).</p>
<p>Chapter 4 will likely be found as the most problematic section of the book. It is controversial as it is insightful. Fuller advances here an intense conjecture. The so-called ‘New Synthesis’, namely, the result of the merge of Darwinian evolution and Mendelian genetics, being the contemporary wishful paradigm for understanding life and, by extension, humanity, betrays the hard-core of (modern) science itself. This claim is spelled out the following way: the Neo-Darwinian Synthesis fosters a species egalitarian view on humans that flies in the face of the very impetus behind the Scientific Revolution, namely, the attained possibility of understanding reality in virtue of being created in <italic>imago Dei</italic>. Specifically, a machine-based view of the universe is amenable to having both God and humans regarded as ‘engineers’ – differing only in degree, not in kind, in line with the Scotist view of univocity. This theological drive is behind non-conformist Christians (e.g., Bacon, Newton, Boyle) who triggered the Scientific Revolution. And to close the circle in irony, without the Scientific Revolution, Neo-Darwinism would have never occurred in the first place. Furthermore (to exacerbate the already altered emotions of some contemporary scholars), the theological drive compelling the 17th- century natural philosophers that we now revere, has a familiar name: Intelligent Design (ID). This effectively pitches Neo-Darwinism against the essence of science itself – the reason behind Fuller’s advocacy of a sophisticated and historically enhanced version of ID – to the chagrin of those who have simplistically equalized this view (ID) to the less enlightened one known as Creationism. Despite the unambiguous efforts by Fuller to further clarify this distinctly linked chain of conceptual pointers, it would seem that some critics cannot swallow the ID pill regardless, and so they remain almost purposely blind to the explanation – and quite possibly, to <italic>any</italic> explanation.</p>
<p>The concluding Chapter 5 involves an interesting exercise in the nature of technology, which brings up some of its historically evinced religious nuances. The familiar idea of technological development as a facilitator for the flourishing of human life in the midst of possibly hostile environments, and the consequent mitigation of pain and suffering, is here brought to the fore. ‘Suffering’ serves as the conceptual bridge that reaches onto the allegedly mutually exclusive ideas of a maximally good God having created an evidently flawed reality – in other words, the issue dealt with in the theological sub-discipline of <italic>theodicy</italic>. This purported deep correlation (between the mitigation of suffering provided by technology and God’s plan for our survival – and even happiness) provides an intriguing backdrop to the otherwise famously secular notion of the welfare state, which could under this prism be depicted as the spatio-temporal concretion of a positive theodicy.</p>
<p>Fuller unapologetically brings to the surface many largely forgotten icons of western civilization, particularly from the Medieval tradition (Duns Scotus, Thomas Aquinas) and from the non-Protestant side of the Scientific Revolution and beyond (Galileo, Copernicus, Mendel and de Chardin). This will likely upset many crusaders of political correctness, as well as confuse many recalcitrant Anglo-Analytic traditionalists in disguise. Fuller is however quick in pointing out that the return to a discourse based upon the notion of the ‘human’ is not precisely coming from right-wing pundits, but rather from agnostic science thinkers and practitioners. It is thus particularly refreshing to see his dismissal of stale dichotomies that mar much of the academic debate (liberal vs conservative, atheists vs theists, etc.), which tend to reduce it to an uneventful dialogue between two camps where each submits to the reactions we came to expect from them. Avoiding this puts Fuller’s account, in the view of this reader, in a qualitatively different angle, free from these (to some extent) artificially constructed dualisms, particularly the one that forces a pseudo-rational separation between religion and culture. In line with this, and unbeknownst to whether or not the Church has noticed it, I would venture to submit that Fuller’s views on the nature and future of humanity would make a European secular Catholic worldview relatively at ease in his turf.</p>
<p><italic>Humanity 2.0</italic> will not only trigger debate within those areas that tend to be often cocooned by race/religion taboos, but will also serve as an intellectual lighting post which may guide the research into the articulation of what it means to be human – which is gradually, relentlessly and seamlessly embedded into the machinal (both the discourse and the artifact).</p>
