<p>This book may be familiar to many of us. It has been a respected core text in learning disability nurse education for a number of years.</p>
<p>Atherton and Crickmore, the editors, have introduced a few changes to this new edition but have kept to the original successful format and the principles of inclusion within learning disability practice. The reader is given crossreferences to other chapters to minimise repetition and to online resources for further learning.</p>
<p>The editors provide the reader with 30 in-depth aspects of health, social care and educational information. Of particular note is a stimulating new chapter on the social constructivist perspective towards learning disability. The explanation of this perspective is clearly outlined and grounded in the reality of practice without meandering too far into abstract thought. The material on eugenics from the fifth edition has been expanded upon. The text is referenced comprehensively and bullet points at the start of the chapter clearly identify the purpose of each section to enable the reader to navigate successfully through the text.</p>
<p>This book always has been and still is a weighty tome. The greatest strength of this new edition is that a paper copy also comes with instructions on how to access an electronic copy that can be used on a portable electronic device, phone or computer. This works beautifully, and it is clear that the new edition has been specifically edited to be read as an electronic book. Type in a word or a reference and the book takes you there quickly. As this book is packed full of information, it means that the student and nurse has a ‘hitchhikers guide to the galaxy of learning disability practice’ in their pocket. The online additional learning which supports the book could be more developed. The potential of online learning is that it can be used to exploit advantages with visual and aural learning which would facilitate different learning styles.</p>
<p>Students and professionals of learning disability care, both nursing and other health-related professions, will find this text informative, stimulating and useful.</p>
