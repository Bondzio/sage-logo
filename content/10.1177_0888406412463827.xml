<abstract>
<p>Training and technical assistance programs for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have emerged in many states as educators, administrators, and institutions of higher education attempt to address the increasing needs for enhancing the knowledge and skills of educators and disseminating the ever-growing knowledge of educational practices. This report provides data from an evaluation study of a professional development effort conducted by a state-sponsored autism spectrum disorders network. Results documented the positive impact of an 18-month, mentored professional development experience for school-based professionals throughout the state. Surveys of trainees’ knowledge before and after training indicated shifts in their confidence, from basic knowledge of ASD characteristics and practices to confidence in their ability to implement ASD-related practices. In addition, mentors documented increased use of ASD practices in trainees’ classrooms using a checklist of ASD evidence-based practices.</p>

<p>The prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in the United States has risen to an estimated 1 in 88 children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0888406412463827">Centers for Disease Control, 2012</xref>). The significant increase in the number of students with ASD in the past 20 years has prompted a call to expand the understanding and use of evidence-based educational practices to more educators who interact with students with ASD every day. As school districts and individual educators serve more students with ASD, their confidence in providing high-quality instruction to learners with ASD is under strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0888406412463827">Lehrman, Vorndran, Addison, &amp; Kuhn, 2004</xref>). Specialized training is required for education professionals to have the breadth of understanding and skill to implement effective intervention and educational programs for students with ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0888406412463827">McCabe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0888406412463827">Scheuermann, Webber, Boutot, &amp; Goodwin, 2003</xref>). School-based practitioners are expected to understand the spectrum of ASD characteristics and the range of possible interventions for students with ASD, and also to be able to implement a myriad of evidence-based and promising practices identified in the literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0888406412463827">Iovannone, Dunlap, Huber, &amp; Kincaid, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0888406412463827">National Research Council [NRC], 2001</xref>). To that end, it is often necessary that practitioners receive ongoing information and instruction beyond the basic competencies addressed in their pre-service teacher certification programs, 5−, 10, or 15+ years earlier.</p>
<p>In 2001, the NRC’s <italic>Committee on Educational Interventions for Children With Autism</italic> called for attention to be given to providing pre-service and practicing educators with specialized training and technical assistance on ASD practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0888406412463827">NRC, 2001</xref>). The Committee summarized concerns related to the lack of ASD professional development by stating that “personnel preparation remains one of the weakest elements of effective programming for children with autistic spectrum disorder and their families” (p. 225). This issue is confounded by the emphasis in the last decade on noncategorical or cross-categorical training, certification, and/or licensure for teachers. Pre-service programs are not always adequately preparing educators to implement effective, evidence-based programming for children with ASD in their classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0888406412463827">Simpson, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>A perception of professional confidence and competence encompasses teachers’ beliefs that they possess the ability to manage the learning and behaviors of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0888406412463827">Bandura, 1994</xref>). Practitioners in special education report benefits from ongoing in-service experiences that make them confident and competent to work with families and other professionals in designing appropriate, evidence-based instructional programs for students with ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0888406412463827">Dow &amp; Mehring, 2001</xref>). When educational professionals participate in training and follow-up technical assistance experiences, they are more likely to report increases in their confidence and skills, and demonstrate ongoing practice of newly acquired skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0888406412463827">Dow &amp; Mehring, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0888406412463827">Dunst &amp; Trivette, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0888406412463827">Joyce &amp; Showers, 2002</xref>). In fact, the importance of supervision and ongoing feedback and consultation in effective educational training are emphasized as critical components for educators to be able to implement targeted interventions and teaching practices with students with ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0888406412463827">NRC, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0888406412463827">Scheuermann et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>National efforts to enhance ASD-related training and technical assistance to practicing educators began in the 1990s. Federal education agencies undertook efforts to prioritize the development of autism research and leadership projects focusing on expanding and increasing the level of information and training available to schools. In 2003, the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP; U.S. Department of Education) earmarked funding for the “National Professional Development Center on Autism Spectrum Disorders,” a multi-university project charged with promoting the use of evidence-based practices with children and youth with ASD through technical assistance and development efforts. The Center has since identified practices that meet specific criteria for being “evidence-based,” and developed partnerships with several states across the country to expand those states’ use of evidence-based practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0888406412463827">National Professional Development Center on Autism Spectrum Disorders, n.d.</xref>). Furthermore, the National Association for State Directors of Special Education (NASDSE) and National Association for State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services (NASDDDS), together with state and national partners, have organized a national community of practice around ASD; partners have conducted state-team forums and an Autism Leadership Summit with outcomes for enhancing ASD professional training in participating states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0888406412463827">NASDSE, n.d.</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0888406412463827">Ohio Center for Autism and Low Incidence, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>States across the country also have attempted to respond to local needs by developing training and technical assistance programs funded through, or affiliated with, state departments of education and/or state universities. In a 2006 survey of state education agencies (SAEs) conducted by NASDSE, 34 of the 46 responding agencies reported that they had at least one staff member specifically assigned to handle issues around students with ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0888406412463827">Müller, 2006</xref>). The reported findings suggested that programs offered in different states vary in the types of services they provide and models of delivery used. For example, some state ASD programs may provide training and technical assistance grounded in a specific intervention, whereas others may take a more eclectic approach. Professional development opportunities offered may range from large-scale workshops or seminars to individualized consultations.</p>
<p>Regardless of the format, the focus of ASD training and technical assistance should address the use of treatments objectively deemed to be evidence-based, such as those based on principles of applied behavior analysis. In addition, training should focus on outcomes not only related to increasing the skill of educators to use ASD strategies but also on essential programming elements, such as creating individualized supports and services, working with families, and structuring environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0888406412463827">Barnhill, Polloway &amp; Sumutka, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0888406412463827">NRC, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0888406412463827">Strain &amp; Bovey, 2011</xref>). In general, it is agreed that effective models of professional development include ongoing opportunities for mentored experiences to aid application of training content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0888406412463827">Dow &amp; Mehring, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0888406412463827">Scheuermann et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, standards of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0888406412463827">National Staff Development Council (2001)</xref> support the importance of multiple and ongoing opportunities for practitioners to network with other practitioners serving similar-type students and apply learning in their classrooms with feedback from a mentor or trained consultant.</p>
<sec id="section1-0888406412463827">
<title>Autism Spectrum Disorders Network (ASDN)</title>
<p>In an effort to meet the needs of students with ASD birth to age 21, their family members, school practitioners, and district special education teams, one geographically large, mostly rural, Midwestern state with a population of fewer than 1.5 million citizens designed a statewide technical support and training network. In 2011, this state’s Department of Education reported that 48,246 students were eligible for special education programs, under the category of autism, representing 5% of all students with disabilities in the public schools that year (S. Sinani, personal communication, March 19, 2012). The ASDN is administered by the state Department of Education and receives advice from the state’s Special Education Advisory Council and contractual support from the state’s largest university. Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part B “set-aside” dollars are allocated annually by the state’s Department of Education to support these contractual efforts with the university and five Regional Directors at geographically distinct Educational Service Units across the state. A representative from the Department of Education acts as a fiscal representative for the ASDN.</p>
<p>The ASDN services have evolved and expanded over the years in response to state and regional needs. Five approaches characterized the ASDN annual activities statewide. An annual, 2-day ASDN state conference provides awareness-level training and exposure to evidence-based practices and current issues. Attendance has grown from 340 participants in 2003 to more than 800 in 2011. Second, the ASDN initiated its first District-Level Leadership Training in 2010 for professionals in local school districts. This effort advanced the ability of 150 local administrators and practitioners to make systemic changes in how their students with ASD are referred, assessed, taught, and monitored over time. This project was built on the belief that local ownership for staff development and mentoring can build the administrative and technical capacity to respond to the changing demands for staffing and individual needs of students. Third, regional teams offer onsite consultation for student-specific ASD educational planning. Fourth, topical workshops are offered regionally, as well as statewide, to provide current ASD information and resources to educators and families.</p>
<p>Finally, the most in-depth ASDN training program is an 18-month professional development program titled “Strategies and Techniques for Effective Practices in Schools (STEPS): Educating Children With Autism.” Since 2006, 110 school-based practitioners have completed the STEPS program. The program includes (a) a series of eight workshops over 12 months focused on effective practices for teaching students with ASD and (b) assigned mentors for 18 months to help participants develop and implement individual action plans in their own classrooms/schools for specific students with ASD. This training program provides “multiple exposures, opportunities for practice and active involvement following initial training,” as recommended by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0888406412463827">NRC (2001</xref>, p. 225).</p>
<p>A state ASDN director is housed at the university full-time to oversee all the ASDN activities and five ASDN regional teams. These teams comprised 10 to 20 members who represent regional stakeholders and include, at a minimum, a regional director of finance, a regional coordinator, a parent of a student with ASD, a school administrator, and district-employed practitioners. At the inception of the ASDN, efforts were made to recruit dedicated and skilled personnel in the region to participate on each regional team. Founding members of each team independently completed state-sponsored professional development experiences to establish a baseline of competence and confidence related to educating students with ASD. The regional teams provide advisement as well as staff development, technical support, and onsite consultation for case-specific assessment and intervention issues to local administrators, practitioners, and families in their geographic region. State funds allocated annually to each ASDN regional team may be used to support ongoing professional development of team members, travel expenses and stipends, costs for substitute teachers, development and purchase of training materials, expenses related to bringing in national consultants and trainers, and/or the employment of skilled consultants. In addition, some regional team members may be compensated or employed exclusively for mentoring, consultation, and capacity-building of local practitioners and districts. Regional directors and teams submit applications to the state Department of Education annually stating proposed budgets for specific training objectives and evaluation procedures, along with end-of-the-year reports describing the regions’ past year’s activities and achievements.</p>
<p>Most ASDN efforts are evaluated on an ongoing basis through the use of participant surveys; conferences and workshops are evaluated for participants’ satisfaction of content and format. The regional coordinators verbally provide ongoing feedback about local needs and successes to the ASDN state coordinator during scheduled monthly meetings. Regional team annual reports provide an index of activities completed across the state. A qualitative evaluation of the ASDN strengths, problems, opportunities, and threats (SPOT Analysis) was conducted in 2007. Results provided the Department of Education with a guide for future planning with regional teams.</p>
<p>It is critical that outcomes of professional development are documented to guide states and organizations in decision making and ensure that training and technical assistance are providing educators with the knowledge and skills required to implement evidence-based educational programs for students with ASDs. Literature reporting outcomes or effects of professional development programs for educators of students with ASD, however, are lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0888406412463827">Barnhill et al., 2011</xref>; B. Smith-Myles, personal communication, February 2, 2012). This report describes the preliminary findings in an evaluation of one state’s efforts to offer a comprehensive, ongoing training and technical assistance program for practitioners working with students with ASD in the public schools. The primary goal of this evaluation study was to examine the effects of the ASDN’s STEPS training as documented by the program’s trainees themselves and their program mentors.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Prior to initiating the current evaluation study, the ASDN state coordinator and evaluators met to discuss mutual interest in evaluating the ASDN programs. Two subsequent meetings were used to pursue an understanding of desired evaluation questions from the ASDN coordinator as well as the State Department of Education representative who oversees the fiscal budget for the ASDN. Because STEPS requires substantially more financial and personnel resources than traditional one-shot, short-term training, and technical assistance practices (e.g., workshops, conferences), and instructs fewer trainees annually than other ASDN efforts, the need to assess the benefits of this training was selected as a priority for more focused evaluation. The evaluators shared a draft of the evaluation plan with the two ASDN administrators and secured a letter of support to cooperate with the evaluators. The university’s Institutional Review Board for Protection of Human Subjects reviewed and approved the letter, along with copies of the evaluation instruments, a description of the methods, and the plan for obtaining informed consent from intended participants.</p>
<sec id="section3-0888406412463827">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A recent cohort of STEPS Trainees (hereafter Trainees) and their Mentors were the participants of this study. Consistent with recruiting practices each year, the ASDN state and regional coordinators recruited Trainees into the STEPS program by initiating a call for applications via email to school district administrators. Criteria for STEPS participation included documentation of prior introductory ASDN training and support of a local school administrator. A total of 33 Trainees, representing all five ASDN regions began the STEPS program. Each Trainee was assigned a STEPS Mentor (hereafter Mentors) for the duration of the project. Mentors were ASDN regional team members or previous STEPS graduates, invited to play this role by ASDN regional coordinators because they were known to demonstrate high-level skills related to educating children with ASD and had experience providing formal or informal ASD-related training and/or consultation within their districts or region. No compensation, other than mileage reimbursement, was provided to the Mentors.</p>
<p>In this particular cohort, five of the original Trainees voluntarily chose not to complete all of the STEPS training requirements. The remaining 28 Trainees and their 21 Mentors (some Mentors coached two Trainees) were the participants for this study. The Trainees represented all five ASDN regions in the state and included 18 classroom teachers, 4 speech-language pathologists, 3 occupational therapists, a psychologist, an inclusion facilitator, and a special education consultant. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0888406412463827">Table 1</xref> provides a listing of key demographics for these participants.</p>

<title>STEPS training and mentoring</title>
<p>The 18-month STEPS program began with an all-day workshop for Mentors and focused on their role and responsibilities, as well as effective mentoring practices. Eight subsequent, full-day workshops were required for Trainees and Mentors together over the course of the next 12 months. These ASDN-sponsored workshops were offered in two locations across the state and were facilitated by the ASDN coordinator and ASDN regional team members. The topics for the workshops included Assessment, Program Planning, Communication, Educational Strategies, Behavior, Social Skills, Sensory Issues, and Transition.</p>
<p>As a requirement for their participation, Trainees were asked to independently complete a self-assessment checklist of classroom practices relative to their efforts to meet the needs of one student with ASD prior to initiating their mentor relationships. In addition, Trainees were required to draft three goals and accompanying action plans for improving their classroom practices with students with ASD. Trainees and Mentors collaborated to decide on the Trainees’ goals and action plans. One goal was required to focus on teaming; the other two goals could be relevant to specific classroom intervention practices addressed in the workshops, and of importance to the specific Trainees and the students with ASD in their classrooms.</p>
<p>Mentors were required to visit Trainees in their classroom a minimum of two times over the course of the STEPS program; email and phone contacts often complimented these visits. On the first visit, Mentors observed the Trainees’ efforts to meet the needs of one or more students with ASD and completed a checklist of observed classroom practices. Trainees and Mentors used their individual checklist results to cooperatively target possible goals for the Trainees’ improvement. In subsequent visits, Mentors used the same checklist to guide their classroom observations and share their impressions with Trainees relative to (a) overall changes in classroom practices, (b) progress toward Trainees’ goals, and (c) benefits to specific students with ASD. Mentors generally spent about 8 to 10 days with their Trainees, either in their classrooms or attending the STEPS workshops, over the 18-month training experience.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section5-0888406412463827">
<title>Evaluation Instruments</title>
<p>STEPS Trainees were required to document their knowledge and skills before, during, and after the STEPS training as well as their goals and efforts to improve their services for students with ASD. Each Trainee was asked to keep a portfolio throughout the 18-month training experience that included evaluation instruments completed by the Trainee and their Mentor. Portfolios were reviewed by Mentors during site visits and then submitted to the ASDN state coordinator for review at the completion of their STEPS participation. Specific portfolio materials used for this evaluation study are described below.</p>
<sec id="section6-0888406412463827">
<title>Trainee survey</title>
<p>STEPS Trainees were asked on two occasions to complete a self-assessment of knowledge and skills related to ASD. Trainees completed a pre-STEPS survey prior to their first workshop and a post-STEPS survey when they fulfilled the training requirements, 12 to 18 months later. The online STEPS survey included 42 items, reflecting practices presented during STEPS workshops, as well as major practice components addressed in the Effective Practices Checklist (see checklist information below). The survey instrument used a 4-point Likert-type scale with response options that reflected levels of knowledge and skill in working with students with ASD and included 1 = <italic>I have little or no awareness</italic>, 2 = <italic>I have basic knowledge</italic>, 3 = <italic>I can implement</italic>, and 4 = <italic>I am comfortable providing training in this area</italic>. The survey practice categories included ASD characteristics, assessment, program planning, behavior, social skills, communication, general instruction, and ASD-specific strategies. The survey instrument is available upon request.</p>

<sec id="section7-0888406412463827">
<title>Effective Practices Checklist</title>
<p>The organizers of the STEPS project adopted an evaluation tool designed originally for formative purposes by the ASDN state coordinator. The Effective Practices Checklist for Students With Autism (henceforth referred to as the Checklist) can guide self-assessment or observation of classroom practices and facilitate discussion between classroom staff (Trainee) and a consultant (Mentor). The Checklist’s content was influenced by the recommended practices of the NRC’s “Committee on Educational Interventions for Children With Autism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0888406412463827">2001</xref>) and effective educational practices described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0888406412463827">Iovannone et al. (2003)</xref>. The Checklist includes eight practice domains, including (a) Individualized Supports, (b) Systematic Instruction, (c) Teaming, (d) Environmental Structure, (e) Communication Skills, (f) Social Skills, (g) Functional Behavioral Approaches, and (h) Family Involvement. Each practice domain has two to eight specific practices associated with it. For each specific practice, a hierarchical, nominal rubric describes four levels of practice evidence, with 1 = <italic>no evidence of practice</italic>, 2 = <italic>basic or partial evidence of practice</italic>, 3 = <italic>desired practice</italic>, and 4 = <italic>optimal practice</italic>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0888406412463827">Table 2</xref> provides an example of two specific practices from the Checklist. The Checklist is currently under revision and further field-testing, but a copy of the version used for this evaluation is available upon request.</p>

<p>The ASDN state coordinator supplied the evaluators with requested documents. These included pre- and post-STEPS survey data and any documents or copies gathered from Trainees and Mentors during the STEPS project year or from the Trainees’ portfolios. These portfolios were to include the Entrance-Checklists completed by Trainees and Mentors, as well as Trainee goals, action plans, student data, and Mentor evaluation notes. The evaluators found that despite having been awarded Certificates of Completion, some Trainees’ portfolios were incomplete. At the request of the evaluators, the ASDN state and regional coordinators made efforts to collect missing portfolio documents and produce additional data. Ultimately, the number of requested portfolio documents varied across Trainees and Mentors and provided unequal sets for systematic analyses. At a minimum, this evaluation focused on the available Trainee-completed pre- and post-STEPS survey data and Trainee and Mentor-completed Entrance- and Exit-Checklists. Other available documents were used to provide anecdotal evidence in the final evaluation report to the state. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0888406412463827">Table 3</xref> lists the available documents that were used for data analysis.</p>

<p>The ASDN state coordinator provided electronic data files containing the Trainees’ pre-and post-STEPS survey results. Although all 28 Trainees completed the pre-STEPS survey, only 24 of 28 (86%) Trainees completed a post-STEPS survey; reasons for this shortage were not provided. Mentors were not expected to complete the survey, as the STEPS survey was intended as a self-assessment of Trainee knowledge and skills related to ASD populations and practices.</p>
<p>Exit-Checklists were not required by STEPS organizers but were required for the evaluation study. The 28 STEPS Trainees and 21 STEPS Mentors were mailed letters that described the evaluation study and asked them to submit a signed consent to use their STEPS-related data/documents, and included a blank copy of the “Effective Practices Checklist for Students With Autism” (Exit-Checklist). Mentors were asked to revisit the Trainees’ classrooms/work settings to complete the Exit-Checklist. Two weeks after the initial letters were sent, post card reminders were mailed. A second reminder was sent after 1 month to those Trainees and Mentors who had not yet returned their consent forms or Exit-Checklists.</p>
<p>The available data from Trainees and Mentors who completed the STEPS training during an 18-month training cycle were used for analyses. Twice as much data were available for the analyses of pre- and post-STEPS surveys than for Entrance- and Exit-Checklists. Despite program requirements for documentation and letters requesting missing documents, only 16 Trainees and 15 Mentors (12 matched pairs) responded to the mailed request for missing portfolio information; not all respondents, however, provided all requested information, so the number/percent of Trainee- or Mentor-related data varies for specific analyses that follow.</p>
<sec id="section9-0888406412463827">
<title>Data analyses</title>
<p>To maintain anonymity, codes were assigned to each STEPS Trainee and Mentor and data from the requested documents and files were entered into a new evaluation database with the ID codes. The Trainees’ pre- and post-STEPS survey data were analyzed using paired-samples <italic>t</italic> tests to determine changes in the Trainees’ knowledge and skill as a result of their participation in the STEPS training and mentoring. Similarly, the Trainees’ self-ratings on the Entrance- and Exit-Checklist of effective practices were compared (paired-samples <italic>t</italic> tests), using overall mean ratings and item-by-item mean ratings to examine the self-reported changes in classroom environments and practices for students with ASD as a result of the STEPS training and mentoring.</p>
<p>Pairwise <italic>t</italic> tests were used to examine Mentor- completed Entrance- and Exit-Checklists to note possible changes the Mentors reported for their Trainees. In addition, Mentor-completed Exit-Checklists were compared with matched Trainee-completed Exit-Checklists using overall mean ratings as well as item mean ratings to explore the perceptions of both participants about the Trainees’ exit practices after the training ended. Finally, a Pearson’s rho correlation statistic was used to analyze the relationship between the Mentors’ final assessment of the Trainees’ effective classroom practices, as documented on the Mentors’ Exit-Checklist, and the Trainees’ perceptions of their own knowledge and skill as reported in their post-Survey ratings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0888406412463827">
<title>Reliability</title>
<p>To assess the reliability of the Mentor-completed Checklist ratings, three trained independent observers completed an Exit-Checklist, within 4 weeks of the Mentors completing their Exit-Checklist, by visiting the same classrooms of three participating Trainees. The independent observers included a graduate-level special education student and two ASDN regional coordinators who were familiar with, and had previous experience using, the Checklist but who were not acquainted with the classrooms in which the observations were conducted. Overall agreements between the Mentor and the independent observer for each classroom were calculated using the formula: Percent Agreement = Total agreements/total agreement + Total disagreements × 100. Kappa coefficients were calculated item-by-item for exact matches and for matches within one rating level, such that a rating of 1 and 2 equaled a match of limited or no evidence of desired practice in the classroom and a rating of 3 and 4 were a match of desired practices evidenced.</p>
<p>Chance agreements were noted between Mentors who completed Exit-Checklists and the independent observers for the three classrooms observed; agreements of 50%, 36%, and 50% were calculated when an exact match in ratings was considered. When contiguous ratings were considered (one rating difference), agreements were 91%, 90%, and 93%. Furthermore, when categorical matches were considered (i.e., limited evidence [1 or 2] vs. evidence of desired practice [3 or 4]), agreements were 91%, 90%, and 79%.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The 24 (86%) Trainees who completed a post-STEPS survey upon completion of the STEPS training showed a significant increase for perceived knowledge and skill related to ASD and associated interventions. The overall mean ratings shifted from 2.27 (<italic>SD</italic> = .30) on the pre-STEPS survey, suggesting the Trainees’ confidence in basic knowledge, to 3.24 (<italic>SD</italic> = .38) on the post-STEPS survey suggesting a confidence in implementing the content surveyed at the end of the training, <italic>t</italic>(23) = −11.63, <italic>p</italic> = .000.</p>
<p>Further analysis indicated significant upward categorical shifts in Trainees’ perception of knowledge and skill within each of the eight categories (<italic>p</italic> values = .000). The mean ratings in all categories on the pre-STEPS survey indicated Trainee confidence was at basic knowledge levels; following STEPS training, Trainees reported mean ratings that suggested a confidence in implementation of ASD practices. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0888406412463827">Table 4</xref> presents the mean ratings in each of the survey categories.</p>

<p>Data from Entrance-Checklists were available from 19 of 28 Trainees’ portfolios, and Exit-Checklists were available for 14 of the 28 STEPS Trainees who completed the training. The overall Exit mean rating for these 14 Trainees’ self-assessment was 3.42 (<italic>SD</italic> = .65), reflecting their perception of evidence for desired or optimal practices in their classrooms. Trainees’ average ratings in six of the eight Checklist domains also reflected optimal or desired use of the practices, with slightly lower ratings in the Systematic Instruction (<italic>M</italic> = 2.92, <italic>SD</italic> = .15) and Behavioral Strategies (<italic>M</italic> = 2.95, <italic>SD</italic> = .24) domains.</p>
<p>Trainee-completed Entrance- and Exit-Checklists were available for only 9 of the 28 Trainees. A significant change was noted in these nine Trainees’ reports of classroom practices related to supports used for students with ASD following the STEPS training and mentoring. Overall mean ratings for the nine Trainees’ Checklists increased from 2.85 (<italic>SD</italic> = .33) at entrance to 3.39 (<italic>SD</italic> = .43) on the Exit-Checklists, <italic>t</italic>(8) = −2.83, <italic>p</italic> = .022. Domain-by-domain analyses revealed that Trainees’ ratings on Exit-Checklists were significantly higher than their Entrance-Checklist ratings for Individual Supports and Services (<italic>p</italic> = .000), Communication (<italic>p</italic> = .016), Behavioral Supports (<italic>p</italic> = .045), and Family Involvement (<italic>p</italic> = .047). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0888406412463827">Table 5</xref> provides a summary of these Trainees’ Entrance- and Exit-Checklist ratings by domain. Overall, Trainees’ mean ratings for most Exit-Checklist domains were 3.0 or higher on the 4-point scale, suggesting that some of the Trainees were reporting desired practices in many domains, after completing the STEPS training. Although basic or less than desirable evidence was reported for the use of desired Behavioral Supports (<italic>M</italic> = 2.9), a significant shift was noted in this domain toward desired practices from the time the Trainees began the training to when they finished.</p>

<p>Mentors for 17 Trainees (81%) agreed to complete an Exit-Checklist for their assigned Trainee’s classroom practices. An overall mean rating of 3.53 (<italic>SD</italic> = .23) reflected the Mentors’ observation of desired or optimal practices in many Trainees’ classrooms at completion of STEPS training. A comparison of the available Mentor-completed Entrance-and Exit-Checklists (<italic>n</italic> = 11) revealed significant improvement in mean ratings from 2.82 (<italic>SD</italic> = .44) when the program began to 3.62 (<italic>SD</italic> = .28) for the group of Trainees they mentored, <italic>t</italic>(10) = −5.14, <italic>p</italic> = .000.

Furthermore, the Trainees’ post-Survey ratings were positively and significantly correlated with their Mentors’ Exit-Checklist ratings (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = .539, <italic>p</italic> = .047). When the STEPS project ended, those Trainees with a higher self-rating of knowledge and skills related to ASD were more likely to have Mentors who noted evidence of desired practices in their classrooms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0888406412463827" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current evaluation study was a preliminary attempt to examine one aspect of a state-sponsored ASDN training and technical assistance program. Given the outcomes from the available data, this state’s ASDN appears to be meeting its mission of offering relevant training related to quality services for students who have ASD through its model of a mentor-supported professional development project (STEPS). These findings may encourage administrators in other states to invest in statewide professional development and technical assistance programs related to the needs of practitioners and students with ASD. The need for more stringent monitoring of training outcomes and collection of data for evaluation purposes are also evident from the current study.</p>
<p>The 18-month STEPS training program provided Trainees with ongoing ASD professional development through workshops, action planning and mentor-supported, onsite implementation of ASD strategies and techniques. STEPS training significantly improved Trainees’ perceived knowledge and skill, as well as some Trainees’ classroom practices. This evaluation study was unable, however, to identify the influence of specific variables that account for the positive results of training and the Trainees’ satisfaction with the program. Evaluations of the eight Trainee workshops were limited to participant satisfaction, not pre–post knowledge or skill. Furthermore, completion of the ASD Effective Practices Checklist at only two points in time (Entrance to and Exit from STEPS) prevented analyses of Trainee change over time as a result of their participation in the 18-month program. Future evaluations would benefit from periodic assessment of classroom practices and/or documented evidence of action plan successes. Furthermore, the ultimate purpose of statewide training and technical assistance programs is to improve educational programs and services for children. Although the STEPS training program did include measures of student outcomes as part of the Trainees’ action plans, too few Trainee portfolios included complete student data (photographs, projects, graphs, worksheets) to assess Trainee goal achievement and student progress as a result of the STEPS training. More focus on specific and quantifiable outcomes related to critical developmental and learning skills for the children with ASD should be a focus of future evaluation.</p>
<p>A Trainee–Mentor partnership was reflected in their similar independent ratings of Trainees’ classroom practices following completion of the STEPS project. Most notable was the Trainees’ significant improvement in self-efficacy as reflected in improved self-ratings on the survey and the moderate positive correlation with the Mentors’ observations and ratings of effective classroom practices. Trainees’ self-reported movement into the category of “I can implement” for all of the ASD practices, and Mentors’ documentation of their use of desired or optimal practices in the classrooms with students with ASD, could reflect the utility of this type of professional development program in addressing the need for high-quality educators of children with ASD. In addition, the positive categorical shift in all eight survey domains indicates that Trainees’ benefited from the STEPS training and mentoring, such that their confidence regarding most ASD practices could result in their implementing the practices with future students with ASD as well. Replication of these ratings, however, with new students with ASD and in subsequent school years could assure that these Trainees could now competently implement these practices and possibly offer training and consultation to others in their district/region.</p>
<p>Although the exact reliability is not impressive, contiguous and categorical reliability of the Mentor ratings on the Effective Practices Checklist are promising, with caveats. This instrument was designed for formative assessment purposes; however, it may show promise of having utility as both a formative and summative tool. Therefore, the respectable agreement between Mentors and naïve observers for categorical and contiguous ratings in the desired or optimal use of ASD practices provides some support for the reported shift in Trainees’ classroom practices. The naïve observers, familiar with the tool and ASD content, were just as likely to note evidence of desired practices as the Mentors, who were familiar with the classrooms, students, and teachers, and who may have had a bias in favor of Trainee change. The less impressive agreement for exact ratings on the Checklist suggests the need for further evaluation of this tool for use in guiding and evaluating discrete changes in Trainees’ professional development.</p>
<p>This preliminary evaluation of the ASDN STEPS training model is encouraging for advancing the knowledge and skills of practitioners serving students with ASD. As has been suggested in broader studies of professional development models, ongoing technical assistance provided by periodic workshops and mentoring can be effective in advancing teaching efficacy and observed application of recommended ASD practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0888406412463827">Barnhill et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0888406412463827">Dunst &amp; Trivette, 2009</xref>). Sustained changes in practitioner’s knowledge and skills across time should be assessed over multiple years and in working with multiple students with ASD. In addition, future investigations should explore financial benefits of programs like STEPS, such as cost savings brought about by districts no longer needing to access costly expert consultation services for many students with ASD. Depending on the size and demographics (e.g., urban/rural) of the training area, populations of students with ASD, and individual participant’s competencies, states’ investments in trainings like STEPS may be needed for a number of years before robust cost savings can be observed regionally and statewide.</p>
<sec id="section13-0888406412463827">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>States considering the development or modification of ASD professional development activities would be advised to consider the regional design of this state’s ASDN and the benefits of intensive trainings/mentoring programs like STEPS. Especially in large rural states where travel between communities and experts is long and costly, the regional team concept offers a way to localize expertise and provide access to support/consultation in a timely manner. Mentoring programs may offer a less expensive and more individualized approach to training than large-scale conferences and could prove cost-effective and desirable when implemented regionally with familiar practitioners as expert resources. States that choose to implement mentoring programs, however, need to make an ongoing commitment to invest in maintaining and increasing the level and knowledge of individuals charged with providing training and technical assistance.</p>
<p>The current study provided insight into outcomes of one exemplar of a statewide ASD training and technical assistance project that was specifically designed to provide educators with recommended, comprehensive, and evidence-based training. The promising outcomes indicate that this program may provide an effective avenue to address the need to advance the knowledge and skills of educators working with students with ASD. It is critical that other, similar entities charged with providing professional development related to ASD present additional evaluation data to provide guidance to state agencies and legislators facing increasing demands from constituents for improving educational practices for children with ASD. State-specific evaluations offer a small, albeit sometimes, idiosyncratic look at how professional development may be implemented for a specific geographic and demographic population. They also may reveal practices that may be attractive but too complex or costly to initiate elsewhere. Collaborative evaluations across states could provide large-scale assessment of training models and spur research investigations that aid in the adoption of effective practices in ASD professional development.</p>
<p>This study prompts a number of questions that have implications for such future research. What effects do shared trainings have on mentor–trainee relationships and effective outcomes for practitioners working with students with ASD? Given the proliferation of alternative mechanisms for delivery of professional development (e.g., web-based, group, and individual formats), what amount and type of mentor–trainee direct interaction is necessary to assure trainee growth in self-efficacy and application of skills? What mentor qualities prove most important to assure trainee growth and development? In addition, this type of training offers ongoing opportunities for practitioners to network with other practitioners serving similar students in their classrooms. Ongoing opportunities for networking are identified as positive staff development practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0888406412463827">National Staff Development Council, 2001</xref>); however, the implications of these networking opportunities need further exploration. How do opportunities for peer networking enhance trainee’s knowledge and implementation of ASD strategies?</p>
<p>Because this study focused on a cohort of Trainees who had completed the STEPS requirements, there was some difficulty in collecting all of the documentation needed for analysis. Having to attempt to collect missing documentation presents concerns; it introduces the possibility, albeit minimal, that data could be altered prior to submission. It is important that entities funded to provide ASD training and technical assistance make program evaluation a priority by ensuring that outcomes are being measured and data are collected immediately, consistently, and thoroughly. This will not only help guide ongoing program improvements but also ensure that data are available to showcase desired outcomes to current and potential funding sources.</p>
<p>Although the results of this study cannot be entirely generalized to other states, it provides insight into the challenges and effects of one state’s investments in an ongoing, mentored program of ASD professional development that, based on the current findings, is a successful approach to enhance the skills of education professionals from a variety of disciplines who teach students with ASD. These findings may provide information that other states could use to develop and evaluate systemic approaches to the professional development of practitioners who are working daily with students with ASD, and share their findings.</p>
