<abstract>
<p>The purpose was to determine differences by gender and over time in use of coping strategies by students following the 2008 mass shootings at Northern Illinois University. Students (N=336) completed questionnaires about use of specific coping strategies at two time periods: immediately following the incident, and 3-6 months later. Students reported more use of acceptance-coping approaches initially, and use increased over time. Students’ use of avoidance-coping approaches declined over time. Women used more religious- and emotion-focused coping strategies than did men at both time periods, but use of these strategies declined for all students over time. Men used more active coping initially, but over time, use declined for men and increased for women. Overall, students displayed resiliency. The differences in the use of coping strategies by men and women and the changes in use over time demonstrate the unfolding transitional process of coping, and make it clear that people cope in different ways and in their own time. The findings provide strong support for the usefulness of different combinations of coping strategies, especially based on the tendency of men and women to approach coping differently.</p>

<p>On February 14, 2008, Northern Illinois University experienced a tragic event when a lone gunman opened fire in a lecture hall of more than 150 students, killing 5 people and injuring 18 others before fatally shooting himself. This event marked the fourth-deadliest university shooting in the United States. The effects of this tragedy were far-reaching, and students, faculty, staff, and families were greatly affected.</p>
<p>Individuals experiencing a traumatic situation can face emotional challenges, and the response to trauma can be highly variable. Studies have shown that individuals who have been through highly stressful personal events often experienced anger, fear, anxiety, helplessness, and depression, among other symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534765612437381">McIntosh, Cameron, &amp; Camp, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534765612437381">Overcash, Calhoun, Cann, &amp; Tedeschi, 1996</xref>). Some experiencing trauma also reported the sense of lack of predictability and safety of their surroundings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534765612437381">McIntosh et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In recent times, society has witnessed several mass violence incidents in schools and universities (i.e., Columbine 1999, Virginia Tech 2007, and now, Northern Illinois University 2008). To date, few studies have explored the coping strategies of individuals who were directly or indirectly exposed to mass violence in academic settings. The purpose of this study was to identify coping strategies used by college students in the aftermath of the mass shootings at Northern Illinois University. In particular, the focus was on whether men and women coped differently, and whether the use of specific coping strategies changed over time.</p>
<p>Coping is defined as cognitive and behavioral attempts to deal with the effects of a stressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765612437381">Folkman &amp; Lazarus, 1980</xref>). The cognitive theory of coping emphasizes that coping is dynamic in nature, meaning that coping is dependent on the primary cognitive appraisal of the threat in conjunction with the secondary appraisal of a person’s own resources to deal with it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765612437381">Folkman, 1984</xref>). Coping is a multidimensional process that develops in the existence of a contextual situation believed to be personally impactful or beyond one’s ability to deal with it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765612437381">Folkman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534765612437381">Folkman &amp; Moskowitz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534765612437381">Lazarus, 1993</xref>). That is, the nature of the situation itself could produce different coping responses which also evolve differently for individuals over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612437381">Harnish, Aseltine, &amp; Gore, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534765612437381">Liverant, Hofmann, &amp; Litz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1534765612437381">Tamres, Janicki, &amp; Helgeson, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Scholars have defined the main categories and methods of coping in different ways based on various theoretical perspectives. Such differences may explain why studies using similar samples may produce different findings. For example, scholars who have studied coping from the socialization theory perspective contend that men and women approach the process of coping differently. Some studies have supported this view, at least with respect to situation-specific stressful events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612437381">Billings &amp; Moos, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765612437381">Gavranidou &amp; Rosener, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534765612437381">Karanci, Alkan, Askit, Sucuouglu, &amp; Blata, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534765612437381">Sigmon, Stanton, &amp; Snyder, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534765612437381">Stone &amp; Neale, 1984</xref>), but this does not necessarily indicate that men are able to cope more effectively than women. An alternative view based on role constraint theory posits that when men and women occupy the same social role (e.g., college student), gender differences in coping with stressors are not found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534765612437381">Rosario, Shinn, Mørch, &amp; Huckabee, 1988</xref>). With respect to studies of men and women in the similar role of college student, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534765612437381">Hamilton and Fagot (1988)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534765612437381">Ptacek, Smith, and Zanas (1992)</xref> found no differences by gender in the use of coping strategies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612437381">Carver, Scheier, and Weintraub (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534765612437381">Sigmon et al. (1995)</xref>, however, in their studies of undergraduate students, found that women were more likely to use an emotional approach to coping in both general- and situation-specific situations. They found no gender differences in the more active, problem-focused approach to coping by college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612437381">Carver et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534765612437381">Sigmon et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Much of the literature with respect to gender differences in coping by undergraduates has been based on how students have dealt with chronic stressors, daily hassles, or stress in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612437381">Carver et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534765612437381">Hamilton &amp; Fagot, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534765612437381">Ptacek et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534765612437381">Sigmon et al., 1995</xref>). In the current study, the interest was in determining whether there were gender differences in the use of coping strategies over time following a particular shared experience of campus mass violence. As there is stronger support in the literature for gender differences following exposure to traumatic events, the hypotheses for this study were based on the literature supportive of socialization theory (women are socialized to take an emotional approach when coping with stressors, whereas men are taught to take action) rather than role constraint theory (men and women occupying the same social roles cope similarly). Although it is acknowledged that the participants shared a common social role (i.e., college student), the unique, traumatic circumstances presented by the episode of mass violence lent credence to the choice of grounding the study in socialization theory.</p>

<title>Review of the Literature</title>
<p>For decades, researchers have concentrated efforts on the study of coping strategies used in response to stressful situations or events. Choice of coping strategies to deal with a stressor ultimately has been rooted in the perceived context of the event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765612437381">Folkman &amp; Lazarus, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612437381">Harnish et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534765612437381">Mattlin, Wethington, &amp; Kessler, 1990</xref>), how an individual reacts to the event, and the resources the individual has made available to deal with the event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765612437381">Folkman, 1984</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765612437381">Folkman and Lazarus (1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534765612437381">1985</xref>), for example, posited that the coping process stems from the two dimensions of problem-focused and emotion-focused coping. Problem-focused coping represents a problem-solving response to a stressor involving actively seeking ways to solve the problem or reduce the stress caused by it. Emotion-focused coping involves an attempt to deal with and reduce the negative feelings evoked by the stressful event or situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765612437381">Folkman &amp; Lazarus, 1980</xref>). While responding to most stressful situations involves both types of coping, people usually adopt problem-focused coping approaches when they perceive they have some control over the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612437381">Carver et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765612437381">Folkman &amp; Lazarus, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1534765612437381">Scheier, Weintraub, &amp; Carver, 1986</xref>). An emotion-focused response, including seeking emotional social support, results when there is a perception of little control over the stressful event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612437381">Carver et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765612437381">Folkman &amp; Lazarus, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612437381">Carver et al. (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534765612437381">Sigmon et al. (1995)</xref> have demonstrated support for the usefulness of problem-focused and emotion-focused approaches to coping, but have expanded the coping repertoire to include additional types of strategies. Sigmon et al. conducted two studies of college students to assess dispositional coping (typical perception of stressful events) and situational coping (most stressful occurrence in past month). Using secondary factor analysis, Sigmon et al. grouped 14 specific coping strategies identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612437381">Carver et al. (1989)</xref> into 4 general coping approaches that included emotion-focused, problem-focused, acceptance, and avoidance strategies. Emotion-focused coping was made up of three strategies: seeking social support for instrumental reasons, seeking social support for emotional reasons, and focusing on and venting of emotions. The problem-focused coping approach comprised active coping, planning, suppression of competing activities, and turning to religion. Acceptance coping approaches included acceptance, and positive reinterpretation and growth, both of which may provide pathways to resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765612437381">Bonanno, 2004</xref>). Sigmon et al. also identified a group of coping strategies thought of as maladaptive, and termed this group of approaches avoidance coping strategies. Avoidance coping strategies comprise mental disengagement, behavioral disengagement, denial, restraint coping, and alcohol and drug disengagement. Maladaptive approaches have been found to be related to the prolonging of stress following a traumatic experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612437381">Harnish et al., 2000</xref>). The coping methods identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612437381">Carver et al. (1989)</xref> and grouped into four main categories of coping by Sigmon et al. were used to define the coping approaches of the men and women in the current study. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534765612437381">Table 1</xref> for definitions and examples of specific coping strategies within the four dimensions of coping.</p>

<p>In a meta-analysis of studies examining the usefulness of coping strategies following stressful events, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534765612437381">Prati and Pietrantoni (2009)</xref> distinguished between the emotion-focused coping strategies of <italic>seeking</italic> social support and <italic>receiving</italic> social support. Seeking social support may provide a way to stir needed feelings of sympathy and help reduce the feeling that one is alone. Receiving social support, however, is dependent on the responses and actions of the giver. Both may contribute to positive growth following a traumatic event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534765612437381">Prati &amp; Pietrantoni, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534765612437381">Schaefer &amp; Moos, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1534765612437381">Tedeschi &amp; Calhoun, 2004</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1534765612437381">Tedeschi and Calhoun (2004)</xref> contended that social support has fostered positive coping strategies. Satisfaction with the social support one receives following a stressful event also has contributed to stress-related growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534765612437381">Park, Cohen, &amp; Murch, 1996</xref>). Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1534765612437381">Schwarzer, Luszczynska, Boehmer, Taubert, and Knoll (2006)</xref> determined that emotional support was most critical to well-being immediately following a medical crisis, but it was not necessarily beneficial in promoting well-being later on.</p>
<p>Problem-focused coping strategies may be effective in resolving stressful situations, as use of such strategies has led to shorter durations of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612437381">Harnish et al., 2000</xref>). Researchers have noted that adaptive, problem-focused coping strategies have helped contribute to recovery and growth from a stressful experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534765612437381">Armeli, Gunthert, &amp; Cohen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612437381">Harnish et al., 2000</xref>). For example, researchers have found strong links between the problem-focused strategy of religious coping and a reduction in stress following an adverse experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534765612437381">Ano &amp; Vasconcelles, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534765612437381">Meisenhelder &amp; Marcum, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534765612437381">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534765612437381">Prati &amp; Pietrantoni, 2009</xref>). Some people use religious or spiritual coping strategies to help make sense of a traumatic event, which may indicate an attempt to begin active movement toward a positive reassessment of the experience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534765612437381">Solomon, Gelkopf, and Bleich (2005)</xref> found that religious coping strategies were reported as most effective by more than half of both males and females who experienced a terrorist attack. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534765612437381">Park et al. (1996)</xref>, in a study of college students, found that religious coping was positively related to stress-related growth following a negative stressful event. Ano and Vasconcelles, in a meta-analysis of religious coping and psychological adjustment, found that positive religious coping (e.g., seeking spiritual support) led to increased positive adjustment to stress. Other researchers have found that women were more likely than men to find religious coping valuable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534765612437381">Levin, Taylor, &amp; Chatters, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534765612437381">Prati &amp; Pietrantoni, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534765612437381">Spencer, Lachlan, &amp; Burke, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>It is understood that coping following a stressful event involves an active exchange between the individual and the environment, and the process changes over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765612437381">Folkman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765612437381">Folkman &amp; Lazarus, 1980</xref>). For some people, the coping process may take a great deal of time. A newer perspective is that many people display resiliency and move quickly into acceptance following a traumatic event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765612437381">Bonanno, 2004</xref>). Bonanno distinguishes between resilience and recovery following a traumatic event. Recovery suggests that there is a disruption of normal functioning which may take weeks, months, or even years to recover from, whereas resilience indicates the ability to maintain a steady state over time with regard to normal functioning. Bonanno contends that, rather than resiliency being a rare and perhaps pathological state characterizing people quickly able to bounce back from a traumatic occurrence, it likely is a fairly common condition. In a review of aggregate data on bereaved individuals, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765612437381">Bonanno and Kaltman (2001)</xref> reported that approximately half displayed low levels of distress. In other words, resiliency and the ability to move into acceptance following a stressful or traumatic event has been underestimated, and rather than being suggestive of pathology, it may serve as a protective mechanism for some.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765612437381">Hartnett and Skowronski (2010)</xref> studied Northern Illinois University students following the 2008 shootings, using a different sample of students from that used in the study reported here. The researchers had collected data on mood states (depression, tension, anger, fatigue, confusion, and vigor) from 307 undergraduate students in an unrelated study during the semester prior to the shootings. During the weeks following the shootings, they collected data on mood states from 63 of those same students who were attending Northern Illinois University at the time of the incident. Fourteen months later, data on mood states were collected from a different sample consisting of freshmen students who had not been enrolled at the time of the shootings. The freshmen were asked to imagine how they would have felt 2 to 3 weeks following the incident had they been students at the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765612437381">Hartnett &amp; Skowronski, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Findings from the two samples were interesting. They indicated that people in general are resilient following a traumatic event and are likely to be more resilient than they themselves would have predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765612437381">Hartnett &amp; Skowronski, 2010</xref>). For the sample who were students at the time of the shootings, there were no differences in mood states pre- and post-event on four of the subscales (depression, tension, fatigue, and confusion). For the sample who had not experienced the event, for these four subscales, imagined mood states following the shootings were more negative than the originally recorded mood states, and also more negative than the experienced group post-event. These findings indicated that people tend to overestimate the effect of trauma on their emotional states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765612437381">Hartnett &amp; Skowronski, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, some resilient people may successfully use coping strategies considered maladaptive in order to move past a traumatic event. One such approach is the use of denial or mental and behavioral disengagements by some to distract themselves from unpleasant thoughts and memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1534765612437381">Weinberger, 1990</xref>). Some individuals using such coping strategies have been found to display little distress or grief over the years following the death of a loved one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534765612437381">Bonanno &amp; Field, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In a variety of stressful circumstances individuals experienced, gender has been found to be an important consideration in response to traumatic events. In a review of 160 studies of coping by victims of terror and natural disasters, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534765612437381">Norris, Kaniasty, Conrad, Inman, and Murphy (2002)</xref> indicated that females were more likely to have higher levels of distress and be more adversely affected by a stressful experience. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534765612437381">Park et al. (1996)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534765612437381">Tedeschi and Calhoun (1996)</xref>, found that women reported more stress-related growth than did men following a self-identified traumatic experience.</p>
<p>In past studies, researchers have found differences in the use of emotion-focused versus problem-focused coping strategies by gender. In a variety of disaster situations (e.g., natural disasters and mass violence), women reported using more emotion-focused coping strategies, whereas men used more problem-focused strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765612437381">Gavranidou &amp; Rosener, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534765612437381">Karanci et al., 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534765612437381">Solomon et al. (2005)</xref> investigated coping strategies of individuals exposed to terrorist attacks in the Middle East. Israeli women were more likely than men to use more emotional support (emotion-focused), self-distraction through activity (mental disengagement), and religious coping strategies. Men used more problem-focused strategies, like talking about the terrorist attacks and finding out what could be done about them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534765612437381">Solomon et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534765612437381">Sigmon et al. (1995)</xref> noted that in self-identified stressful situations, females used more emotion-focused coping strategies and males used more avoidance coping strategies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612437381">Carver et al. (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765612437381">Gavranidou and Rosener (2003)</xref> found that men were more likely to abuse alcohol in their efforts to cope, providing additional evidence that men may be more likely to adapt avoidance coping strategies.</p>
<p>The February 14, 2008 tragedy on the campus of Northern Illinois University occurred less than a year after the Virginia Tech mass shootings on April 16, 2007. Initial research studies on the Virginia Tech shooting were, for the most part, descriptive in nature and focused on accounts of people’s experiences and their emotional responses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534765612437381">Alvis-Banks, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534765612437381">Cox, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765612437381">Figley &amp; Jones, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534765612437381">Geller, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534765612437381">Gervich, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534765612437381">Immel &amp; Hadder, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765612437381">Jones, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534765612437381">Keeling &amp; Piercy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534765612437381">Nowak &amp; Veilleux, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534765612437381">Piercy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1534765612437381">Ryan &amp; Hawdon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1534765612437381">Yoder, 2008</xref>). In a recent study, researchers reported on the behaviors of Virginia Tech students following the 2007 shootings and Northern Illinois University students following the 2008 tragedy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1534765612437381">Vicary &amp; Fraley, 2010</xref>). For each of the separate shooting events, the authors surveyed students at two time periods: 2 weeks following the shootings and again 8 weeks after the incident took place. The focus was on the usefulness of social networking about the incident via Facebook. Although students reported some immediate benefits from Internet postings, there were no significant changes in their well-being over time due to the use of social networking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1534765612437381">Vicary &amp; Fraley, 2010</xref>). Another recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1534765612437381">Wang &amp; Hutchins, 2010</xref>) focused on the changes appropriate for human resource management following crisis events at educational institutions such as Virginia Tech. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765612437381">Hartnett and Skowronski (2010)</xref> examined the well-being of Northern Illinois University students prior to and following the 2008 shootings, but did not study the coping strategies used by the students. No studies were found that have examined changes in the use of multiple coping strategies by students at either Virginia Tech or Northern Illinois University.</p>
<p>The current study attempted to determine differences by gender in how students coped over time following the shootings on the Northern Illinois University campus. From a theoretical perspective, scholars have posited that coping is a dynamic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765612437381">Folkman &amp; Lazarus, 1980</xref>), and that coping responses evolve differently for individuals over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612437381">Harnish et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534765612437381">Liverant et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1534765612437381">Tamres et al., 2002</xref>). Specifically, based on socialization theory and past research, we expected that men and women would cope differently initially, and that coping behaviors would change differently by gender over time. It is important to determine whether such differences were manifested following mass violence in an academic setting, as counselors and other practitioners may find this information useful when assisting in similar situations. For example, if women favored emotion-focused coping and men gravitated toward problem-focused approaches, as socialization theory has suggested, it would be useful to know whether both men and women also increased in positive reinterpretation and growth. If this were the case, it would indicate that people may choose differing combinations of adaptive coping strategies, based on gender or preference, with similar positive results.</p>

<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>On the basis of socialization theory and a review of the literature surrounding coping with traumatic events, hypotheses were formulated to determine whether time and gender affected the use of 14 coping strategies initially and 3 to 6 months following the shootings. The grouping of specific coping strategies followed the four dimensions identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534765612437381">Sigmon et al. (1995)</xref>.

Some hypotheses were nondirectional due to paucity of research on the topic (e.g., little research was found on changes in the use of certain coping strategies over time); other hypotheses were directional and predictive of specific within-subjects effects (time), between-groups effects (gender), or both.</p>

Although some men have reported using religion as an effective coping strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534765612437381">Solomon et al., 2005</xref>), use of this strategy by women has been more prevalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534765612437381">Levin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534765612437381">Prati &amp; Pietrantoni, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534765612437381">Solomon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534765612437381">Spencer et al., 2007</xref>).

<title>Data Collection: Sample and Procedures</title>
<p>Permission to conduct the study was granted by the Institutional Review Board of Northern Illinois University. A nonprobability sample of 336 Northern Illinois University students completed surveys after signing informed-consent forms. Students completed the surveys independently and were informed that all information would be kept confidential and anonymous. Participants were instructed not to confer with fellow classmates while completing the survey.</p>
<p>Data first were collected in undergraduate classes during regularly scheduled classes at the end of the Spring 2008 semester (3 months following the February 14, 2008 incident). Due to the low number of males in the first wave of data collection, additional data were collected from a different set of students at the beginning of the Fall 2008 semester (6 months following the shootings) in classes with representative numbers of male students. Only students who were enrolled at the time of the shootings were eligible to participate. Data from the second wave of data collection were combined with the data from the first wave. Time periods for use in data analyses were then designated as follows: Time period 1 = the week following the shootings and Time period 2 = 3 to 6 months later.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1534765612437381">
<title>Instrumentation</title>
<p>The survey questionnaire was designed to collect data retrospectively as well as in the present; that is, students were asked to think back to the week following the shootings and to recall the coping strategies they used. They, then, were asked about coping strategies used “today” (at the time of data collection). The data from the two data collection periods (at 3 months following the incident for the first group of respondents and at 6 months for the second group) were combined. That is, no distinction was made between those completing questionnaires at the 3-month and 6-month periods. The survey questionnaire comprised items to measure coping strategies, gender, and other demographic characteristics. The following additional demographic items were included to describe the sample: age, education type (undergraduate/graduate), and ethnicity.</p>
<p>Coping strategies were measured using the COPE Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612437381">Carver et al., 1989</xref>). The COPE Inventory was developed to identify coping strategies applied to a person’s normal disposition of coping and/or to the situational response of an event. Developed from a theoretical perspective, the COPE Inventory tapped into a multitude of dimensions of coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612437381">Carver et al., 1989</xref>). The instrument comprised multiple-item measures representing both adaptive and maladaptive coping approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612437381">Carver et al., 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Each of the 56 items making up the COPE Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612437381">Carver et al., 1989</xref>) had response choices ranging from 1 to 4 (1 = <italic>I usually don’t do this at all</italic>, 4 = <italic>I usually do this a lot</italic>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612437381">Carver et al. (1989)</xref> grouped the 56 indicators on the original COPE Inventory into 14, 4-item, theoretically reasonable strategy subscales, each having a range of possible scores from 4 to 16, with higher scores indicating more use of the strategy. The instrument has been tested for reliability and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612437381">Carver et al., 1989</xref>), and the subscales have shown varying levels of reliability with Cronbach’s α ranging from .45 to .92, with only one falling below α = .60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612437381">Carver et al., 1989</xref>). The COPE Inventory has undergone multiple techniques and statistical tests to establish face, content, criterion, concurrent, predictive, and construct (convergent and discriminate) validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612437381">Carver et al., 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612437381">Carver et al. (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534765612437381">Sigmon et al. (1995)</xref> conducted secondary factor analyses using the 14 subscales of the COPE Inventory and produced somewhat similar results. The same four distinct dimensions of coping were identified by both Carver et al. and Sigmon et al.: problem-focused, emotion-focused, avoidance, and acceptance, but individual strategies loaded slightly differently on the factors in the two studies. In the Sigmon et al. study, the 14 coping responses to situational stressful events factored into the 4 dimensions as follows, and this is the grouping we used in the current study to guide the development and organization of hypotheses. The first factor, avoidance, included both mental and behavioral disengagement, and denial, restraint coping, and alcohol/drug disengagement. The second factor, problem-focused coping, consisted of active coping, planning, suppression of competing activities, and turning to religion. The third factor, emotion-focused coping, was made up of the seeking of social support for both instrumental and emotional reasons, and the focusing on and venting of emotions. The final factor, acceptance, included positive reinterpretation and growth, acceptance, and the use of humor, a 15th subscale later added by Carver, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534765612437381">Sigmon et al.

<sec id="section10-1534765612437381">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>As the purpose was to determine how both time and gender influenced the choice of coping strategies, a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was chosen to test each hypothesis. Using this technique allowed for the determination of both between-groups effects (gender) and within-subject effects (time). That is, we were able to pinpoint whether men and women differed in their use of coping strategies, whether their use of a specific strategy changed over time, and whether there were interactions between time and gender.</p>

<title>Hypotheses Testing</title>
<p>Responses to all four items making up each distinct coping strategy were necessary for computation of subscale scores. For hypothesis testing, therefore, only data from those participants who provided responses for all items on a specific coping strategy could be included. This reduced the sample sizes used in the testing of hypotheses; sample sizes ranged from <italic>N</italic> = 288 to <italic>N</italic> = 294 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534765612437381">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Hypothesis 1, that males would be more likely than females to use active coping, and that use of active coping would change over time, was partially supported. There was an interaction effect of time and gender, <italic>F</italic>(2, 289) = 5.58, <italic>p</italic> = .019, but no main effects of either time, <italic>F</italic>(2, 289) = 1.69, <italic>p</italic> = .194, or gender, <italic>F</italic>(2, 289) = 0.13, <italic>p</italic> = .723. Males and females changed differently in their use of this strategy over time. Males decreased use of active coping and females increased use of the strategy over time.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 2, that males would be more likely than females to use planning as a coping strategy, and that use of planning would change over time, was not supported. There were no main effects in the use of planning as a coping strategy for gender, <italic>F</italic>(2, 292) = 1.15, <italic>p</italic> = .284, or time, <italic>F</italic>(2, 292) = 1.41, <italic>p</italic> = .236, and no interaction effect of time and gender, <italic>F</italic>(2, 292) = 3.06, <italic>p</italic> = .081.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 3, that males would be more likely than females to use suppression of competing activities as a coping strategy, and that use of competing activities would change over time was partially supported. There was a main effect for time, <italic>F</italic>(2, 291) = 24.96, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. That is, suppression of competing activities declined equally for males and females over time.

<p>Hypothesis 4, that females would be more likely to turn to religion as a coping strategy, and that use of turning to religion would change over time, was partially supported. Females were more likely than men to use turning to religion as a coping strategy, <italic>F</italic>(2, 291) = 6.58, <italic>p</italic> = .011, and there was less use of this strategy over time by both men and women, <italic>F</italic>(2, 291) = 10.22, <italic>p</italic> = .002.

<p>Hypothesis 5, that females would be more likely than males to use social support for instrumental reasons as a coping strategy, and that use of this strategy would change over time, was supported. There was both a gender effect, <italic>F</italic>(2, 286) = 7.61, <italic>p</italic> = .006 and a time effect, <italic>F</italic>(2, 286) = 50.11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .006, but no interaction of gender and time, <italic>F</italic>(2, 286) = 1.87, <italic>p</italic> = .173. Females were more likely than males to seek social support for instrumental reasons, and use of this strategy declined over time for both females and males.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 6, that females would be more likely than males to use social support for emotional reasons as a coping strategy, and that use of this strategy would change over time, was supported. There were main effects for both gender, <italic>F</italic>(2, 290) = 47.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and time, <italic>F</italic>(2, 290) = 52.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.

There was no interaction between time and gender, <italic>F</italic>(2, 290) = 3.54, <italic>p</italic> = .061.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 7, that females would be more likely than males to use focusing on and venting of emotions as a coping strategy, and that use of this strategy would change over time, was supported. There was both a gender effect, <italic>F</italic>(2, 287) = 35.61, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and a time effect, <italic>F</italic>(2, 287) = 83.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.

<p>Hypothesis 8, that females would be more likely than males to use mental disengagement as a coping strategy, and that use of mental disengagement would change over time, was not supported. There was a trend toward less use of this strategy by both men and women over time, but this difference did not reach significance, <italic>F</italic>(2, 286) = 3.82, <italic>p</italic> = .052. There was no difference in the use of this strategy by gender, <italic>F</italic>(2, 286) = 0.88, <italic>p</italic> = .348, and no interaction between time and gender, <italic>F</italic>(2, 286) = 0.26, <italic>p</italic> = .608.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 9, that males would be more likely than females to use behavioral disengagement as a coping strategy, and that use of behavioral disengagement would change over time, was partially supported. There was a main effect of time, <italic>F</italic>(2, 287) = 16.54, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.

<p>Hypothesis 10, that males would be more likely than females to use denial as a coping strategy, and that use of denial would change over time, was partially supported. Use of denial to cope declined over time for both men and women, <italic>F</italic>(2, 290) = 87.00, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.

<p>Hypothesis 11 was that males would be more likely than females to use restraint as a coping strategy and that use of restraint would change over time. While both men and women reported significantly less use of restraint coping over time, <italic>F</italic>(2, 287) = 4.73, <italic>p</italic> = .030, there was no difference in the use of this strategy by gender, <italic>F</italic>(2, 287) = 0.03, <italic>p</italic> = .866, and no interaction effect, <italic>F</italic>(2, 287) = 0.70, <italic>p</italic> = .403.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 12, that males would be more likely than females to use alcohol and drug disengagement as a coping strategy, and that use of this strategy would change over time, was supported. There were main effects for both gender, <italic>F</italic>(2, 286) = 7.38, <italic>p</italic> = .007, and time, <italic>F</italic>(2, 286) = 19.92, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, but no interaction effect, <italic>F</italic>(2, 286) = 1.07, <italic>p</italic> = .302. Males were more likely than females to use alcohol and drugs to cope, and use of this strategy declined over time for both males and females.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 13, that use of acceptance as a coping strategy would increase over time for both males and females, and that increases in use would be greater for females, was supported. There was a main effect of time, <italic>F</italic>(2, 287) = 118.47, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, but no main effect for gender, <italic>F</italic>(2, 287) = 3.30, <italic>p</italic> = .070. There was an interaction effect of time and gender, <italic>F</italic>(2, 287) = 9.44, <italic>p</italic> = .002. Acceptance increased significantly over time for both men and women, but the increase was greater for women. Although women were slightly less likely than men to report the use of acceptance initially, 3 to 6 months later, frequency of use was equal by men and women.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 14, that use of positive reinterpretation and growth as a coping strategy would increase over time for both males and females, and that increases in use would be greater for females, was supported. There was a main effect of time, <italic>F</italic>(2, 290) = 31.85, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and an interaction between time and gender, <italic>F</italic>(2, 290) = 6.91, <italic>p</italic> = .009. Initially, reported use of this strategy was nearly identical for men and women, but both men and women changed in their use of positive reinterpretation and growth over time. This change was more pronounced for females. Females reported increased use of positive reinterpretation and growth than did males. There was no main effect for gender, <italic>F</italic>(2, 290) = 1.69, <italic>p</italic> = .195.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study sought to examine how male and female students at Northern Illinois University coped with the February 14, 2008 on-campus mass violence the week following the shootings, and to determine how coping had changed 3 to 6 months after the event had taken place. Learning about coping strategies used after large-scale violence is of particular importance in providing trauma-related educational and interventional insight to mental health professionals and to the community.</p>
<p>For the four coping strategies considered problem-focused approaches (active coping, planning, suppression of competing activities, and turning to religion), only active coping and turning to religion had significant effects. Both men and women relied on active coping initially, but their use changed differently over time. Men decreased their use of the strategy, whereas women reported increased use of active coping over time. This is not surprising, as women tended to concentrate on dealing with emotions during the week following the shootings, but their use of emotion-focused coping declined over time. Likely, women were able to take action to progress in the healing process only after they had spent time seeking social support and processing emotional issues. This is supportive of past research, which indicates that women tend to deal first with the feelings surrounding a stressful experience, whereas men gravitate toward activities that deal with solving the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765612437381">Gavranidou &amp; Rosener, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534765612437381">Karanci et al., 1999</xref>). Nevertheless, both men and women indicated increases in acceptance, positive reinterpretation, and growth 3 to 6 months later, all of which are markers of resilience. Perhaps the activity generated during problem-focused coping served to prevent men from having to engage emotionally and experience the pain associated with the event. The process of <italic>doing</italic> rather than <italic>feeling</italic> may have served as a protective mechanism for men trying to work through the horror of the experience. There is evidence, though, that emotion-focused coping also can serve as an adaptive strategy for some in dealing with a traumatic event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1534765612437381">Tedeschi &amp; Calhoun, 2004</xref>), and this appeared to be true for the women in this study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1534765612437381">Schwarzer et al. (2006)</xref>, in a study of patients prior to and 1- and 12-months postsurgery for a grave illness, noted that receipt of social support contributed to patient well-being initially but was not associated with well-being later on. It is important to note that in the current study, women adapted strategies involving emotional support initially, but decreased use of these as they began to focus on active coping later on.</p>
<p>Past research has indicated that coping is an active, dynamic exchange between the person and the environment, and it changes over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534765612437381">Lazarus, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534765612437381">Liverant et al., 2004</xref>). The declining use of emotion-focused coping and the increase in active coping over time by women may indicate that problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies are not as distinctive as they were thought to be. Up to this time, coping research indicated that problem-focused coping strategies were distinctive and produced different mental health outcomes from emotion-focused strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612437381">Carver et al., 1989</xref>). Based on the current findings about coping strategies used following a traumatic event, however, the distinction between outcomes from the use of problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies may be more blurred. As pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534765612437381">Maguena, Papa, and Litz (2008)</xref>, bipolar conceptualization of coping fails to take into consideration that problem-focused and emotion-focused strategies may not be mutually exclusive and orthogonal. Perhaps following an unexpected mass trauma, people, especially women, rely on both types of coping over time during the healing process. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534765612437381">North, Spitznagel, and Smith (2001)</xref> found that individuals who experienced firsthand mass violence reported using both active outreach (emotion-focused) and logical reasoning (problem-focused) to cope with the traumatic event.</p>
<p>In times of crisis, people often turn to their faith as a means of support, guidance, and strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534765612437381">Levin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534765612437381">Pargament, Tarakeshwar, Ellison, &amp; Wulff, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534765612437381">Spencer et al., 2007</xref>). Turning to religion represented an important coping approach for students following the shootings. While the term, <italic>turning to religion</italic> is used here based on the coping strategy terminology of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612437381">Carver et al. (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534765612437381">Sigmon et al. (1995)</xref>, the use of this wording is not intended to suggest that students suddenly “became religious.” Rather, students’ faith likely served as a rich and positive source of strength as they tried to make sense of the tragic event. Perhaps the term, <italic>spiritual coping</italic>, would have better conveyed the concept.</p>
<p>Use of religion as a coping strategy was reported to be important at both time periods but was embraced more by women than by men. The findings of the current study were supportive of most of the past research which has emphasized the prevalence of use of the strategy by women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534765612437381">Levin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534765612437381">Prati &amp; Pietrantoni, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534765612437381">Solomon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534765612437381">Spencer et al., 2007</xref>). Given the magnitude and nature of the traumatic event at Northern Illinois University, it was not surprising that women sought a closer relationship with their faith for meaning and comfort the week following the shootings.</p>
<p>The use of religious coping in the current study is similar to results on posttraumatic stress of U.S. citizens after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534765612437381">Marshall &amp; Galea, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534765612437381">Meisenhelder &amp; Marcum, 2009</xref>) and among those who were displaced by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534765612437381">Spencer et al., 2007</xref>). Researchers who conducted meta-analyses of studies on adjustment and growth following trauma found positive religious coping to be highly predictive of positive growth and change following trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534765612437381">Ano &amp; Vasconcelles, 2005</xref>), particularly for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534765612437381">Prati &amp; Pietrantoni, 2009</xref>.)</p>
<p>Both men and women in this study declined in their use of avoidance approaches (mental disengagement, behavioral disengagement, denial, restraint coping, and use of alcohol and drug disengagement) from Time 1 to Time 2. Although the change in the use of mental disengagement did not reach significance at <italic>p</italic> = .052, there was a definite downward trend in its use over time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765612437381">Bonanno (2004)</xref> has pointed out that there are multiple pathways to resilience, and that repressive coping, or the avoidance of dealing with unpleasant or painful thoughts and memories (e.g., denial, mental disengagement, behavioral disengagement) may serve as a protective factor for those struggling to cope with a traumatic event. Use of such strategies initially may have allowed Northern Illinois University students time to adapt to what happened. As time passed, students reported less use of avoidance strategies and greater acceptance, positive reinterpretation, and growth, lending credence to Bonanno’s contention that people in general are resilient, and use multiple coping approaches to adapt and heal.</p>
<p>While overall, the Northern Illinois University students in this study reported little use of alcohol and drug disengagement, one of the avoidance strategies, men did report significantly more use of this maladaptive approach than did women. This finding was in keeping with past research which indicated that in stressful situations, men tend to use more avoidance coping strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534765612437381">Sigmon et al., 1995</xref>), and in particular, they are more likely to abuse alcohol in their efforts to cope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612437381">Carver et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765612437381">Gavranidou &amp; Rosener, 2003</xref>). Over time, though, use of alcohol and drugs as a coping strategy following the Northern Illinois University shootings declined for both men and women. Heavier reliance on more growth-promoting strategies throughout the process may have reduced the tendency to continue to use drugs and alcohol as a way to cope and may have contributed to the resilience evidenced by the self-reported increases in acceptance, positive reinterpretation, and growth.</p>
<p>An interesting finding was that students reported heavy reliance on acceptance strategies beginning the week following the shootings, including both acceptance of the situation, and positive reinterpretation and growth. Use of these strategies increased over time for men and women, but women reported greater use of both than did men over time. This lends support to the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765612437381">Bonanno (2004)</xref> that, in general, people are resilient following traumatic events and to the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765612437381">Hartnett and Skowronski (2010)</xref> that Northern Illinois University students displayed resilience following the shootings, returning quickly to their pre-event emotional states. It also supports the argument that, like the women in this study, people using both emotion-focused and problem-focused coping approaches following mass trauma also may increase their use of acceptance and growth-promoting strategies over time.</p>
<p>The fact that students moved into acceptance during the week following the shootings was not an unexpected finding, based on the body of literature on resilience following a traumatic event (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765612437381">Bonanno, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534765612437381">Bonanno &amp; Field, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765612437381">Bonanno &amp; Kaltman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765612437381">Hartnett &amp; Skowronski, 2010</xref>). People are more resilient following adverse episodes than they think they will be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765612437381">Bonanno, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765612437381">Hartnett &amp; Skowronski, 2010</xref>), but the response of the university and the larger community immediately following the incident could have helped foster the resilience shown by the Northern Illinois University students. The university took multiple active steps in providing comfort and reassurance to the students, faculty, and staff of the close-knit campus. The slogan from the university’s school song, “Forward, together forward,” was adopted as a guide for recovery to emphasize the importance of social support and unity. A counseling task force was established within days of the shootings, and a counseling hotline was put into place. When classes resumed 1 week later, a counselor was in the classroom at the start of the first class period for every class on the campus. The purpose was facilitation of discussion as needed, and provision of information about supportive resources available on campus and in the surrounding community. These measures indicated the administration’s understanding that people dealing with the aftermath of the traumatic event should not be left to handle it alone.</p>
<p>The university also received an outpouring of support from the local community and beyond. Many departments at Virginia Tech, for example, sent cards and supportive messages to their departmental counterparts at Northern Illinois University. The proactive steps taken by the university and the larger community may have contributed to coping through acceptance of the incident 1 week later. Social support has been found to be predictive of positive growth following a traumatic event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1534765612437381">Tedeschi &amp; Calhoun, 2004</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1534765612437381">Schwarzer et al. (2006)</xref> pointed out that social support immediately following a traumatic situation is crucial to the promotion of well-being.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1534765612437381">Tedeschi and Calhoun (2004)</xref> determined that social support fosters positive coping strategies. The abundance and variety of social support resources offered immediately following the shootings was found to be growth-promoting, and likely provided students with safe, appropriate alternatives for dealing with the traumatic event. The fact that students reported they were moving increasingly toward acceptance, positive reinterpretation, and growth over time was indicative that the supportive response by the university and the community was effective and appropriate in helping to promote resilience.</p>
<p>The differences in the use of coping strategies by men and women and the changes in use over time in the current study undoubtedly demonstrate the unfolding transitional process of coping, and make it clear that people cope in different ways and in their own time. Some findings from this study were different from those of past studies, but such differences may be due to the use of different theoretical approaches and groupings of coping methods among the study methodologies. The findings of this study, however, provide strong support for the usefulness of different combinations of adaptive coping strategies, especially based on the tendency of men and women to approach coping differently.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>Counseling professionals working with individuals who have directly or indirectly experienced a mass violence event may find the results of this study helpful. For example, professionals helping clients through the process of dealing with a traumatic event should be cognizant that a combination of adaptive coping strategies based on the gender and preferences of the client may be useful. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612437381">Carver et al. (1989)</xref> pointed out, there are stable coping dispositions that people bring with them to the stressful situations they encounter, and this was supported by the current study. For example, women’s use of emotion-focused coping declined over time, whereas their use of active coping increased. Men relied heavily on active coping initially, but its use declined over time. Nevertheless, both men and women indicated increases in acceptance, positive reinterpretation, and growth 3 to 6 months later. The implication is that people cope in their own way, with women tending to process feelings first and focus on solutions later, whereas men are prone to begin immediately to engage in active coping behaviors. The bottom line is that both approaches have merit, and selection of adaptive coping strategies should be based on client preference.</p>
<p>In the current study, men tended to seek active ways to deal with the situation right away. Although this may have served as a way to distract them from dealing with the negative emotions associated with the traumatic event, the approach likely was an adaptive one, as the men in this study reported an increase in “growth as a person” from the experience. Such findings indicate that people may need assistance exploring adaptive coping strategies that work for them following a traumatic event such as a mass shooting. The kind of support available in a professional counseling setting, for example, can help survivors work through negative feelings including fear, anger, and sorrow, all of which are natural reactions to such experiences.</p>
<p>The immediate outpouring of support from those in the near and far environments following the shootings may have contributed to engagement in emotion-focused coping, especially for women students at Northern Illinois University. The responses of Northern Illinois University, other universities, including Virginia Tech, the surrounding communities, and people across the nation provided much-needed support that likely contributed to students’ ability to heal from this traumatic experience. Indeed, other researchers have found that social support immediately following a traumatic event is crucial to recovery and resilience. The presence of counselors in every classroom when classes resumed, and the counselors’ encouragement to seek help if students were struggling in the aftermath of the event may have been instrumental in the seeking of social support for emotional reasons, a strategy particularly useful to the women in this study.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There were several limitations to the study, including the use of convenience sampling, which limits generalizability of the findings. It is interesting to note, though, that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765612437381">Hartnett and Skowronski (2010)</xref>, in a separate study using a different sample of students who had experienced the same event, reported similar findings. That is, students demonstrated resiliency within a relatively short period of time. This leads us to believe that the resiliency reported in the current study was not unique to our convenience sample of Northern Illinois University students.</p>
<p>Another limitation was the lack of data on individuals’ mental health status, their perceptions of threat, their relationships with victims, or pre-trauma stressors prior to the event. Such variables undoubtedly could have influenced the outcomes along with or instead of students’ coping methods following the shootings. In addition, the researchers did not collect outcome coping data on the participants (who coped well and who did not), so the connection between coping strategies used and outcomes of coping was not able to be determined from this study.</p>
<p>A third limitation of the study was that it was retrospective in design. The findings depended on students’ ability to recall the coping strategies they used 1 week after the incident happened. Retrospective data always are influenced by the re-creation of events due to limitations in recall and new learning that has taken place over time. Anecdotal evidence from some students indicated they clearly remembered details months later about how they coped immediately after the incident, but whether this was true for all participants is not known. This may call into question the validity of the findings.</p>
<p>No distinction was made between students completing surveys at the 3-month time period and the 6-month time period. Those who had additional time to process and recover from the traumatic experience may have responded differently from those surveyed at the 3-month time period, but there is no way to determine this, as the data collected at the 3- and 6-month time periods inadvertently were comingled. In addition, in the first wave of data collection, more females participated in the study. However, in the second sample, there were more males included in the study. It is not known how this different gender representation in the data collection process might have affected the results of this study. These methodological limitations should be taken into consideration by the reader, and caution should be used in the generalization of results.</p>

<p>The authors have attempted to capture and make sense of the coping behaviors in which students engaged following a very real and very traumatic event. The authors thank the students of Northern Illinois University who were willing to participate in our study and endure focusing on the memory of this extremely tragic experience. May they know that their efforts are advancing the science that informs those in the helping professions to assist and empower future victims of traumatic experiences to move forward, together forward.</p>
