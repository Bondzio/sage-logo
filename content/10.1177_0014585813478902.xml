<p>Despite the ‘poca scienza’ announced in the acknowledgements, this essay about the massive phenomenon of translations into vernacular in 13th- and 14th-century Italy stands as an important contribution to the field of medieval studies. In her work, Cornish investigates the complex implications of <italic>volgarizzamento</italic>, traditionally the gate to the classics for those who could not read Latin, and casts light on the illiterates, a group that this book helps to define with less approximation and to account for its cultural agency.</p>
<p>Cornish employs the prolific activity of <italic>volgarizzamento</italic> – she uses the Italian term in order to keep ‘the odour of vulgarity associated with the language of the <italic>volgo</italic>’ (p. 4) – as an indicator of social, cultural and literary dynamics. In response to the unalterable texts of the <italic>auctores</italic>, accessible only to readers learned in Latin, translators proceeded by ‘domesticating’ the canon. As Cornish points out, these writers did not aim at moving their readers to a higher level of literacy, but instead debased the text by adapting it to the horizon of the new audience. Cornish illustrates through convincing examples that in doing so the <italic>volgarizzatori</italic> prepared the ground for the philological discipline of the Renaissance – contrary to popular belief – and they empowered their readers to participate in the cultural undertaking (Cornish connects this strategy to contemporary practices such as the compilation of a reader-based canon or the internet-driven transformation of readers into writers). Each <italic>volgarizzamento</italic>, Cornish claims, substantially affected the general reception of the translated works and altered its own source, by making the crystallized texts of the <italic>auctores</italic> unstable.</p>
<p>In Chapter I, ‘Dressing Down the Muses’, Cornish sets off to inquire into two short stories from Sacchetti’s <italic>Trecentonovelle</italic> (66, 137), a text that speaks to the end of the age of <italic>volgarizzamenti</italic> – as is marked by Boccaccio’s gradual turning away from the literary use of the vernacular. Sacchetti describes the <italic>volgarizzamento</italic> as a two-fold process of corruption produced by both authors and readers. Cornish emphasizes also an interesting gender implication: the sumptuary laws included in the narration of novella 66 serve the purpose of connecting high culture and <italic>haute couture</italic>, the former out of the illiterate audience’s reach, the latter out of the women’s. In Chapter II, ‘The Authorship of the Reader’, Cornish analyzes the <italic>volgarizzamenti</italic>’s tradition, dictated less by the faithfulness to the original than by the mutability of the vernacular. However incompatible with the Lachmannian method, the study of this tradition provides important information on the composite subjects involved, that is, ‘the anonymous translator-editor-compiler-transcribers who were not just copying literature, but <italic>reading</italic> it’ (p. 55). Recalling the four-fold Bonaventura’s classification of those who make books, Cornish posits the <italic>volgarizzatori</italic> between scribes and authors. Among the documents of the <italic>volgarizzatori</italic>’s inventiveness presented in this chapter are the translations of the Ciceronian <italic>Rhetorica ad Herennium</italic> (rhetorical works were particularly popular in the communal Italian society) and the <italic>Fatti dei Romani</italic>, the <italic>volgarizzamento</italic> of a French translation-compilation of Roman historians. In the context of the long-debated role of Transalpine vernacular in the origins of Italian literature, Cornish demonstrates in Chapter III, ‘Cultural Ricochet: French to Italian and Back Again’, that <italic>volgarizzamenti</italic> did not follow a linear trajectory departing from the original, but created a linguistic dynamic affecting both the original and the target culture. Cornish questions the association of language and national identity on the grounds of Dante’s argumentations in the <italic>De vulgari</italic> as well as of Brunetto Latini, who wrote his <italic>Tresor</italic> in French but assigned to his work a distinct Italian-ness. The <italic>Fait des Romains</italic> is another example of these ‘cross-currents of cultural exchange’ (p. 79) since its <italic>volgarizzamento<italic>,</italic> Fatti dei Romani</italic> facilitated the entrance of the matter of Greece and Rome in the Italian vernacular and made French readership interested in ancient history and historical prose, in addition to just romances. Similar examples include the <italic>Pharsale</italic> by Niccolò da Verona (the <italic>Fatti</italic> re-translated into the French form of the <italic>chanson de geste</italic>), the <italic>Roman de la Rose,</italic> and the <italic>Historia Destructioni Trioae</italic> by Guido delle Colonne, all of which substantiate the reverberation in France of the Italian ‘translations’ of French literature. The process of textual modification became particularly interesting in the case of religious literature. In Chapter IV, ‘Translation as Miracle: Illiterate Learning and Religious Translation’, Cornish illustrates how the vernacularization of a sacred text shows even more freedom of adaptation, as if the text were a relic calling for manipulation. The transformation of the Scripture resulted from vernacularization, as well as glossing and preaching, and included among its readers laymen and women. Cornish demonstrates that despite the lack of theological education, the <italic>illiterati</italic> reader-writers dealing with sacred texts contributed to the production of religious themes, especially connected to the idea of book learning without being able to read, which is ultimately the premise of every <italic>volgarizzamento</italic>: ‘vernacular translation was a modern Pentecostal gift’ (p. 122). The mediation of religious texts, Cornish argues, was probably a source of inspiration for <italic>Decameron</italic> I(1), in which the horizontal translation (from French to Italian) and subsequent misunderstandings produce in the end an effective exchange. The fruitfulness of vernacular translations is the central theme for Cornish’s compelling reading of the encounter between Brunetto Latini and the pilgrim in the <italic>Divine Comedy</italic>. In Chapter V, ‘The Treasure of the Translator: Dante and Brunetto’, she explains the accusation of sodomy in <italic>Inferno</italic> XV with Brunetto’s wide production of <italic>volgarizzamenti</italic>, which, to Dante’s eyes, was ‘sterile’ translation. Cornish applies here to the <italic>Comedy</italic> the notion that Walter Benjamin elaborated in his essay ‘The Task of the Translator’: in order not to be ‘sterile’, a translation must give the original text an afterlife, must be the original’s organic, physiological continuation, or better, transformation (as it is epitomized by Dante with Statius’ ‘fruitful’ misunderstanding of the <italic>Aeneid</italic>, in <italic>Purgatorio</italic> XXII). Recalling the defining ‘knot’ in <italic>Purgatorio</italic> XXIV and Statius’ lecture on embryology in the following canto, Cornish rightly focuses on the connection in the <italic>Commedia</italic> between the vernacular and procreation (a fact that reinforces the condemnation of Brunetto Latini as a sodomite): ‘The crux of the matter becomes the transformation of an animal into a <italic>speaking</italic> thing, and has become cognate with the production of divinely inspired poetry in the vernacular’ (p. 153). In the final chapter, ‘A New Life for Translation: “Volgarizzamento” after Humanism’, Cornish seals her original reading by pointing out that the Renaissance commitment to an impeccable philological work was not a sharp break with, but an evolution from, the age of <italic>volgarizzamento</italic>. The humanistic education included transcriptions and translations, and was grounded in the attempt to understand the original material that had been created by the <italic>volgarizzamenti</italic>. Further, although the new philologists had declared any production in vernacular of no interest, <italic>volgarizzamenti</italic> resurface, with a different, nationalistic agenda – embodied, for instance, by Florentine vernacular in the age of the Medicis.</p>
<p>In her essay, Cornish produces well-documented conclusions and addresses ‘fertile’ topics that trigger interesting reflections regarding the issue of medieval alleged ‘low’ culture. By illustrating a widespread cultural phenomenon often relegated to a secondary role, Cornish throws light on the complexity and mutability of the medieval cultural scenario.</p>
