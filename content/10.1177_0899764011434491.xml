<p><italic>Nonprofit Financial Management</italic> concisely discusses many financial management topics, including accounting, internal controls, budgeting, purchasing, banking, and insurance. The breadth of the nonprofit sector and the wide range of topics make this a very ambitious undertaking. Charles Coe acknowledges help from experts in various subspecialties to assist with the diversity. The book is likely to be most useful for people with relatively little financial management experience and for those charged with governance of smaller organizations. The book is also supported by the publisher as a textbook. Although the book contains no problems or exercises, the Wiley website provides various instructional resources, including cases, a test bank of questions, and instructional slides.</p>
<p>The coverage of a wide range of financial topics at a basic level, and the numerous exhibits and checklists are the book’s major strengths. It introduces lay people to a wide variety of basic topics. For example, Chapter 2, Account for Transactions, defines such accounting basics as the difference between cash and accrual accounting. Chapter 5, Evaluate Financial Condition, explains widely used ratios that can be calculated from financial statements. Chapter 6, Prepare and Manage the Budget, explains common fringe benefits and payroll-related taxes, as well as the steps that the organizations can take when they are having financial trouble. Chapter 11, Invest Funds, defines several common types of investment instruments. Each chapter contains numerous exhibits and tables that provide examples of good procedures. The book includes a sample conflict of interest policy, a sample audit-engagement letter, a list of typical accounts found in Form 990, and lists of basic internal controls for organizations of various sizes.</p>
<p>The diversity of the nonprofit sector is so great that no list of recommended practices can fit all needs. Users of this book must tailor its recommendations to their organization’s size and needs. Many of the suggested procedures seem applicable only for sizeable organizations. For example, the discussion of purchasing procedures indicates that vendor bids should be solicited and then opened “in a public meeting.” (p. 145) Small organizations might instead involve some designated board members in the purchasing process.</p>
<p>Trying to deal with all varieties of nonprofit organizations in a single text creates problems beyond those related to size. For example, the sweeping statement “every nonprofit must file an IRS 990 Form with the Internal Revenue Service” (p. 63) should be qualified, because churches and similar religious organizations are exempt from this requirement. A problem pervading several chapters is that while Chapter 1 indicates that 70% of the revenues of nonprofit organizations come from fees for services and goods, most of the text and advice ignores this part of the organization’s operations. Thus, the chapter on budgeting offers little guidance on budgeting fees and costs of goods sold, and the chapter on managing risks does not address business risks to this critical source of nonprofit support.</p>
<p>As the range of topics is so great, it is understandable that some inaccuracies have crept in. Chapter 2, Account for Transactions, for example, has a number of annoying errors. The statement that under the accrual basis of accounting “an expense is recorded when it is obligated in the form of a purchase order or contract” (pp. 11, 12) is incorrect, because expenses would not be recorded until the vendor actually delivers the goods or services. The exhibit on the page 18 calls such expense accounts as travel and occupancy “functional” expenses, but the “functional” expense categories for nonprofit organizations are program expenses, management expenses, and fundraising expenses. Coe states that an organization must retain outside accountants, other than its auditors, to help convert to the accrual basis of accounting at the end of the year, but actually accountants’ professional standards allow them to help with this (for organizations not subject to government auditing standards) without impairing the independence needed to do an audit. The statement that double entry bookkeeping dates to the Roman Empire has no supporting reference, and is not widely accepted by accountants.</p>
<p>Coe uses findings from a variety of studies to provide context and to motivate the importance of various topics. Although these are often useful, I wish that he had either in the text or in the notes explained the limits of the underlying studies. Thus, when he cites the alarming statistic that “92% of the claims against Board members and top management are employee-related” (p. 211), I found myself wondering how many claims there were in total, how large they were when the study was done, which type of nonprofit organizations it included, and what its sample size was. Some of the statistics are cited imprecisely. As another example, Coe states that “about 50 percent of all fraud cases are discovered by tips from employees” (p. 40), with an endnote reference to a 2008 study by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE). That study actually cited a percentage of 46% for tips from vendors, customers, employees, and others, combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0899764011434491">ACFE, 2008</xref>). The statistic cited in Chapter 13 that 21% of nonprofit organizations had tax-exempt bonds outstanding in 2004 seems hard to believe, based on the fact that the vast majority of nonprofit organizations are quite small. Tracing the reference back to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764011434491">Denison (2009)</xref>, the underlying data being studied were not the entire population of nonprofit organizations, but an IRS sample weighted towards those organizations with more than US$50 million in assets. The brief mention of the United Way of Central Carolinas uproar in 2008 (p. 100) incorrectly states that the executive director received US$1.2 million in salary—a very eye-catching claim. Actually more than US$822,000 of that sum was a one-time catch-up pension contribution that should have been spread over several prior years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0899764011434491">Maley, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>As a final matter, I would have liked to see Coe stand up for nonprofit organizations against critics who argue that overhead and salaries should always be kept at very low levels. Chapter 5, Evaluate Financial Condition, explains ratios, such as the program efficiency and fundraising efficiency ratios, that monitoring groups use to evaluate organizations, but does not explain why this method of analysis is badly flawed. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0899764011434491">Pollatta (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0899764011434491">Tinkelman and Donabedian (2009)</xref> for critiques of the use of ratios. I find it troublesome that the advice on budgeting is that salaries should be based on those paid in similar organizations, and not those of people performing similar tasks or using similar skills. Why should secretaries, accountants, programmers, or executives be paid less in nonprofit organizations than they are worth in a free market?</p>
<p>Although it has some flaws, I would recommend <italic>Nonprofit Financial Management</italic> as a starting point for people trying to learn the basics of the financial and reporting issues that affect nonprofit organizations. Nonprofit boards and executive directors will find this book’s chapters and exhibits very helpful in organizing useful discussions of their organizations’ policies and finances.</p>
