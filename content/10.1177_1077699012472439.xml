<p>Getting it wrong and getting it right. That is a recurring theme in journalism (witness Obama’s “surprise” near-landslide in November’s election), so it makes sense that this is a common thread running through this set of new books reviewed in <italic>JMCQ</italic>.</p>
<p>“Better reporting would have avoided misinforming the public on these stories,” concludes Guido H. Stempel III in his review of W. Joseph Campbell’s book, <italic>Getting It Wrong</italic>, which documents ten “misreported” stories (read: mistakes, myths, or hoaxes) in American journalism. “All journalists should heed that message.” That’s good advice for all of us.</p>
<p>Former <italic>Business Week</italic> chief-turned-journalism dean Stephen B. Shepard got it right more often than wrong, concludes Chris Roush in his review of <italic>Deadlines and Disruption</italic>, a memoir that both recalls Shepard’s magazine career and, more important, describes the CUNY dean’s efforts at reinventing journalism education today. Another author who has gotten it right is Christopher Daly, whose new journalism history, <italic>Covering America</italic>, earns what is pretty close to a rave from reviewer Giovanna Dell’Orto, even as Daly documents the many times journalism has gotten it wrong—“the strange bed-fellowship of journalism and money,” for example.</p>
<p>And where to list Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart, the <italic>faux</italic> journalists of Comedy Central, in terms of getting it right or so very wrong? One of the anomalies of the Colbert phenomenon is that his audiences apparently see him as they want to see him: conservative viewers in one poll think he’s truly conservative, for example (although they can’t be paying very close attention). Reviewer Samuel Wallace took up Amarnath Amarasingam’s volume of essays on <italic>The Stewart/Colbert Effect</italic> with some trepidation, understanding that seeing how either sausage or humor is made can easily ruin it. But Wallace found this a thoughtful and even scholarly collection of spices that enhanced the flavor. As I once heard a helpful waitress advise, it’s good if you like it: “I wonder if Stewart and Colbert are actually as deep and strategic in their humor and intentions as some of the essays imply, or are we just attributing that quality to them?” Wallace reflects.</p>
<p>Stewart/Colbert provide a good context for Jeff South’s review of John McManus’s pair of handbooks on <italic>Detecting Bull</italic> in the digital age. These are resources to help media consumers answer that question about whether what they’re consuming is right or wrong, South says: “Here’s something to chew on: News is like food—you are what you eat,” and McManus has some valuable dietary supplements to offer. <italic>Bull</italic>, a media literacy textbook updated in a new edition that tries to keep up with the “Wild Web,” and its new companion for civilians, <italic>Don’t Be Fooled</italic>, offer “a disturbing critique of today’s media landscape and a guide for seeking truth in a world of spin.”</p>
<p>Still both right and wrong in all its complexities, Watergate endures as a scar on the psyche of American politics and journalism, but it’s impossible to minimize the iconic stature of the <italic>Washington Post</italic> and its larger-than-life editor, Benjamin C. Bradlee. Jeff Himmelman’s new biography may be a little fawning, suggests reviewer Jan Whitt, but she says <italic>Yours in Truth</italic> adds significantly to the <italic>Post</italic> lore, whether you’ve had enough of Ben Bradlee or not. “A towering presence in the newsroom, Bradlee left a legacy to the nation and to the newspaper industry,” Whitt concludes. “His decades of service may best be explained by citing his famous phrase: ‘So whaddaya got for tomorrow?’”</p>
<p>This is an appropriately recurring question for journalism and journalists. It’s also something I contemplate as I conclude five years as <italic>JMCQ</italic> book review editor. The editor’s role aside, the authors and their reviewers who have filled these pages—commentary on some six hundred books—over the past five years have gotten it right much more often than wrong, and I am grateful for their good work and good words, which invariably made their editor look right and smart.</p>
<p>Now, whaddaya got for tomorrow?</p>
