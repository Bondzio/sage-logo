<p><italic>Background</italic>: Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) is the most serious long-term infectious complication of long-term home parenteral nutrition (PN). Ethanol is being used more commonly as a catheter locking solution in the home PN setting for prevention of CRBSI; however, no current literature reports the use of ethanol lock (ETL) in skilled nursing facility (SNF) patients. <italic>Methods</italic>: The authors evaluated the number of hospital readmissions for CRBSI and length of stay between SNF (not receiving ETL) and home patients (receiving or not receiving ETL) receiving PN or intravenous fluid therapy. <italic>Results</italic>: SNF patients had a significantly longer length of stay (LOS) for CRBSI hospital admissions compared with patients receiving PN at home with or without ETL (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001; 16 vs 8 vs 8 days). There was no LOS difference for CRBSI between home patients with or without ETL. Home PN patients not receiving ETL were more likely to have a CRBSI from <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> sp (48% vs 27%; <italic>P</italic> = .015), whereas SNF PN patients not receiving ETL were more likely to have a CRBSI from <italic>Enterococcus</italic> sp (16% vs 3%; <italic>P</italic> = .004). <italic>Conclusion</italic>: Despite different causative organisms and medical acuity likely affecting the differences observed in LOS, the SNF population is another setting ETL can be used to prevent CRBSI.</p>

<body>
<p>Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) is associated with hospital admissions, morbidity, and mortality, as well as an impact on health system costs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for the prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections estimated 250,000 cases of CRBSIs annually in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112448400">1</xref></sup> Efforts to decrease CRBSIs include staff training on catheter care, adherence to institution hand hygiene policies, maximal barrier precaution during catheter insertion, aseptic technique during catheter insertion, and removing catheters that are no longer necessary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112448400">2</xref></sup> In long-term tunneled catheters, intraluminal hub contamination is often the cause of CRBSI.</p>
<p>An inexpensive method is needed to prevent CRBSI that is free of potential for development of resistance, has a low risk for side effects, and is easy for both clinicians and patients to use. Ethanol lock has been shown to be a promising therapy for the prevention of CRBSI in hemodialysis, oncology, and both adult and pediatric home parenteral nutrition (PN) patients. Benefits of using ethanol include no concern for resistance as seen in antibiotic lock therapy, bactericidal and fungicidal properties, and low cost.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112448400">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112448400">4</xref></sup> The inherit flaw of antibiotic lock is the potential for the development of resistance, which is of particular concern for patients requiring long-term or life-long PN therapy. Ethanol lock is still not an Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved therapy, nor is it currently recommended by infectious disease societies or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at this time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112448400">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112448400">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ethanol has emerged as a catheter locking solution in the home PN setting for the prevention of CRBSI; however, it also has potential to benefit patients receiving PN in a skilled nursing facility (SNF). Regardless of the location patients reside receiving PN, either at home or a SNF, CRBSI is an all too common and life-threatening infectious complication. Standard practice at our institution is to initiate ethanol lock (ETL) either as prophylaxis or after initial CRBSI in home PN or intravenous fluid (IVF) patients with silicone catheters by administering 3 mL of 70% ethanol after cycled PN or IVF. The dwell time of the lock may vary based on the number of hours the PN or IVF solution is cycled over.</p>
<p>Our literature review identified no reports of using ETL in the skilled nursing setting or if there were any differences between catheter sepsis in these patients compared with patients receiving the same therapy at home. Patients on PN in SNFs may stand to benefit from ETL just as home PN patients do. Our aim was to evaluate the number of hospital readmissions and length of stay (LOS) for CRBSI between patients receiving PN or IVF at home (with or without ETL) vs at an SNF.</p>
<sec id="section1-0148607112448400" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>After obtaining institutional review board (IRB) approval, a retrospective chart review was completed for all patients sent home with PN or IVF followed by the Cleveland Clinic (CC) Nutrition Support Team and patients sent to an SNF with PN from January 2010 to March 2011. The hospital electronic medical record was reviewed for all patients residing at an SNF, and the CC Home Parenteral Nutrition Clinical Management Database was used for all home PN and IVF patients.</p>
<p>Data collection included primary diagnosis, reason for PN or IVF therapy, vascular access device and number of lumens, hospital readmission(s) for CRBSI only, LOS for CRBSI hospital admission(s), name of hospital, causative organism(s), presence or absence of ETL therapy, compliance with ETL (if known), and the number of readmissions for CRBSI of patients who started ETL after the first episode of CRBSI. Blood cultures were drawn from both the catheter and the peripheral blood, and the organism was identified from the cultures collected. CRBSI was defined as a positive blood culture from the catheter with the absence of infection from another source.</p>
<p>Home PN and IVF patients followed by our home nutrition support team (HNS) had CRBSI readmissions tracked at CC hospitals and hospital systems outside CC due to our clinical management database, whereas SNF patient readmissions included only hospital readmissions back to the CC hospital system (this is a limitation of the study that will be discussed later).</p>
<p>Descriptive statistics were calculated for all factors. <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and R (version 2.13.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0148607112448400" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 364 patients cared for at home by our HNS service during the study period, 93 had CRBSI (6 patients with home IVF and 87 received home PN). The other 271 home patients were excluded from the study because they did not experience CRBSI. There were 136 patients discharged to an SNF and 38 SNF patients readmitted to CC hospitals for CRBSI (2 with IVF and 36 received PN). The remaining 98 SNF patients were excluded because they did not have known hospital readmissions to the CC hospitals for CRBSI.</p>
<p>Of the 38 patients in the SNF group, there were 56 readmissions for CRBSI, and of the 93 patients in the home PN group, there were 106 readmissions for CRBSI (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607112448400">Figure 1</xref>). No evidence suggested a significant association between location of PN delivery (home vs SNF) and number of readmissions for CRBSI, but a trend toward significance was seen (<italic>P</italic> = .056).</p>

</fig>
<p>There were multiple instances when patients had more than 1 readmission for CRBSI (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0148607112448400">Figure 2</xref>). In the SNF group, 6 patients had 2 admissions for CRBSI, 2 patients had 3 admissions for CRBSI, and 2 patients each had 5 readmissions for CRBSI. In the home group without ETL, 6 patients had 2 admissions for CRBSI (2 home IVF patients, 4 home PN patients), and 1 patient had 3 readmissions. In the home group with ETL, only 5 patients had 2 readmissions for CRBSI, but no patients had more than 2 admissions for CRBSI. There were no readmissions for CRBSI in 81% of home PN patients after starting ETL. This is suggestive that home patients have a lower incidence of CRBSI with ETL.</p>

<p>SNF patients had a significantly longer LOS for CRBSI hospital admissions compared with patients receiving PN at home with or without ETL (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001; 16 vs 8 vs 8 days). There was no LOS difference for CRBSI between home patients with or without ETL.

<p>No significance was seen with polymicrobial CRBSI and multiple lumen catheters (<italic>P</italic> = .69). No differences were seen in the type of vascular access device or the number of lumens between the patient groups. The home population had a higher incidence of inflammatory bowel disease as the underlying diagnosis, and the SNF population had a higher incidence of cancer as the underlying diagnosis (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112448400">Table 1</xref>). For the indication for PN, the home population had more malabsorption, and the SNF population had more fistulas.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main limitation of our study is that hospital readmissions for CRBSI may be underreported in the SNF group, as SNF patients may not be readmitted to a CC hospital but rather to a hospital system in closer proximity to the SNF location. The true incidence of CRBSI in the SNF population is unknown.</p>
<p>Other limitations also exist. The SNF patients had double the LOS of the home patients. With regard to the difference observed in LOS, differences in medical acuity may not have been accounted for in this chart review (how the patients are handled, the way the catheter is maintained differently among SNFs, antibiotic use, and wounds). True compliance with ETL is unknown because it is self-reported, as patients are not observed in the home setting administering the therapy. It is therefore a limitation that is difficult to account for when looking at readmissions for CRBSI, despite patients being prescribed ETL. A few patients admitted they did not take the ETL at all or as frequently as prescribed. However, the optimal number of infusions per week to see a benefit from ETL (eg, daily vs every other day or 3 days a week) is not known.</p>
<p>A small number of home IVF patients were included in this study because they are followed by our HNS service due to malabsorption of fluid and electrolytes and no longer require PN support. These patients were included as they had long-term therapy with vascular access devices and had experienced CRBSI. With a large enough sample size, it would be interesting to evaluate if there are any differences between patients receiving long-term IVF and PN.</p>
<p>Because of limited available research, the optimal dwell time and concentration of ETL remain unknown. Many clinicians caring for home PN patients instill 70% ethanol as lock into silicone catheters or implanted ports for the longest number of hours that the patient is free from cycled infusions. Reduction in the ethanol concentration (to either 50% or 25%) can be considered if tolerance problems occur. Reported side effects are minimal (warm flush, nausea, dizziness, taste of alcohol) to none at all. At present, ETL must be compounded by a pharmacy and provided to patients in a prefilled syringe because no commercialized products are available for purchase. Stability of the compounded ETL within the syringe has been studied and well documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112448400">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112448400">6</xref></sup> Ethanol has been studied in the laboratory in catheters, but little is known about physical effects of ethanol in different catheter brands or in polyurethane catheters.</p>
<p>The use of ETL for preventing CRBSI has been studied in adult and pediatric patients receiving home PN. Opilla and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112448400">4</xref></sup> studied 9 home PN patients with a crossover design using ETL. The patients had 81 CRBSIs before ETL and 9 CRBSIs after (8.3 vs 2.7 per 1000 catheter-days). A larger group of 31 patients on home PN at the Cleveland Clinic were studied pre- and post-ETL. A statistically significant decrease in CRBSI admissions (10 vs 6.5 per 1000 catheter-days) showed the efficacy as well as safety of 70% ETL therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112448400">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>A retrospective review of pediatric patients requiring PN due to intestinal failure showed a decreased rate of CRBSI from 9.9 to 2.1 per 1000 catheter-days after use of 70% ETL as a preventative therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112448400">8</xref></sup> Similarly, Mouw and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112448400">9</xref></sup> showed a reduction in CRBSI (11.15 to 2.06 per 1000 catheter-days) in 10 pediatric patients with short bowel syndrome using 70% ETL for prevention.</p>
<p>Although we did not see a difference in LOS between home patients who had ETL and those who did not, we continue to support the use of ETL as 81% of patients did not have a future admission for CRBSI after ETL initiation. A large prospective trial initiating all newly discharged PN patients with ETL is warranted to evaluate readmissions and incidence of CRBSI. Despite many studies supporting a decrease in CRBSI with ETL, there are barriers to starting patients on the therapy. Barriers include patients declining silicone catheter placement and therefore not able to use ETL, insurance not covering the cost (therefore homecare pharmacies are providing this as charity care), patients unwilling to pay for ETL if the homecare pharmacy will not provide free of charge, homecare pharmacies not willing or able to compound ETL due to a recent shortage of sterile ethanol, and nursing agency regulations prohibiting homecare nursing if ETL is prescribed. Non-ETL home PN patients with 1 or multiple admissions for CRBSI are started on ETL upon hospital discharge when returning home whenever possible. SNF patients return back to the facility after a CRBSI without ETL for the prevention of CRBSI. During a hospital admission for CRBSI, home patients are reeducated on catheter care prior to discharge, whereas SNF patients do not receive this education (because the SNF staff complete catheter care).</p>
<p>When patients decline a silicone catheter, our institution does not use ETL in catheters made of polyurethane, such as peripherally inserted central catheters, at the present time. Due to the composition of polyurethane, alcohol has potential to act as a solvent. Crinch and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112448400">10</xref></sup> examined the mechanical properties of polyurethane and silicone catheters after exposure to 70% ethanol for 10 weeks in the lab to investigate the effect on the integrity of the catheters. The authors report that there was a negligible impact on the mechanical properties of polyurethane and silicon catheters and suggest that concerns about using ethanol in these catheter types should be alleviated. There are currently no published data regarding efficacy in humans using ETL with polyurethane catheters.</p>
<p>The recent shortage of sterile ethanol to compound ETL has led to a report of patients redeveloping CRBSI. Our institution identified 6 patients with recurrence of CRBSI after ETL was temporarily withheld due to an ethanol shortage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112448400">11</xref></sup> When the patients were placed back on ETL after the ethanol shortage resolved, no CRBSIs were noted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112448400">11</xref></sup> There is a strong need for the FDA to regulate PN pharmaceutical products to prevent problems such as this.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0148607112448400" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We conclude that the SNF PN patient population has potential to benefit from ETL, and future research should investigate if LOS, number of hospital admissions for CRBSI, or the causative bacteria differ after ETL is initiated in SNF patients receiving ETL. Although we did not see a difference in LOS between home patients who had ETL and those who did not, we are continuing to support the use of ETL as 81% of patients did not have a future admission for CRBSI after post-ETL initiation. A large prospective trial initiating all newly discharged PN patients with ETL is warranted to evaluate readmissions and incidence of CRBSI.</p>
<p>Of further interest, the causative CRBSI organisms were different between the home and SNF populations, as the SNF patients had double the LOS for CRBSI admissions, which could be due to underlying complexity of their medical conditions. In our population, more complex wounds/fistulas required significant care that would have been difficult to provide in the home setting. The true readmissions for CRBSI in SNF PN patients may be underreported due to limitations of this study.</p>
<p>More studies are warranted in this area to define many unanswered questions regarding lock therapies: optimal ethanol concentration, optimal catheter dwell time, efficacy of other emerging lock therapies, and studies for cost-savings analysis and if quality of life is positively affected (decreased morbidity and hospital admission for CRBSI) for patients receiving PN.</p>
<p>Future research with ETL may consider ETL in the SNF population and observing the effect on LOS, CRBSI readmission rates, and causative CRBSI organisms. ETL shows promise, as 81% of home PN patients on ETL did not have future CRBSI admissions. Future studies with ETL in the SNF population are needed to evaluate for a decrease in CRBSI admissions or LOS as seen in home patients.</p>
