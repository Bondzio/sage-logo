<abstract>
<p>The aim of this article is to analyze ethical issues related to the problem of legitimation. The article discusses the tensions of legitimation in light of three ethical topics: decent citizenship, trust, and justice and equality. Citizens’ assessments of ethics and tensions of legitimation are described and discussed in the context of Finnish society. Special attention is paid to the question of whether generational gaps matter. Are the perceptions of the three different generations (age-groups) distinctive and can these perceptions be explained by the gap between generations? The results of this study show that there are ethical considerations where the generation seems to make a difference. The youth, in particular, differ very significantly in their attitudes and opinions from the other two age-groups. Thus explanations based on the generational factor have proven relatively strong. The differences between the generations were evident in many ethical statements which are presented in more detail in the article. The empirical evidence of the study is based on two large batches of empirical data. Both are surveys implemented in Finland in 2008 and 2009. The first one is a citizen survey of 5000 Finnish citizens. The second survey is a youth survey of 1130 Finnish school students.</p>
<sec id="sec18-0020852312444854"><title>Points for practitioners</title>
<p>The article will be of interest to practitioners in describing Finnish citizens’ current perceptions about such ethical issues as decent citizenship, justice and equality as well as trust. The study reveals the differences in ethical valuations between the three age-groups. The article also provides a theoretical framework which can help in understanding tensions of legitimation through chosen ethical values.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec2-0020852312444854"><title>Ethics and legitimation</title>
<p>What do ethics and legitimation have in common? Quite a lot, we suppose. Every political system has its own ideology of legitimacy which supports the principles of public power. The state is legitimate when it has an adequate rationale, and when it pursues proper ends as well as observes due limits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0020852312444854">Thomas, 2000</xref>: 77).</p>
<p>As a Nordic welfare nation, Finland is considered to be a stable and open society. However, among the crucial questions in the Finnish politico-administrative system are how to improve citizen participation channels in government, and how to become more aware of citizens’ views on morality and values in society. The latter question is the focus of this article. According to Jansson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020852312444854">1993</xref>: 121–122), a legitimate society is a society which citizens consider to be justified. The legitimacy of society means the ability to create and maintain an understanding that the existing institutions are the most suitable ones for the society. Legitimacy underlines citizens’ attitudes towards public authority. The establishment and maintenance of legitimacy is closely related to the justification of the politico-administrative system’s existence. Politico-administrative systems need legitimacy in order to be able to attract the support of citizens (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020852312444854">Erkama, 2010</xref>: 23).</p>
<p>Legitimation is a multidimensional sociological concept. For Weber, legitimation is the belief in legitimacy. If something is regarded as legitimate, it is legitimate. Weber also sees legitimation as one part of the subjective legitimate order in society. Among the well-known Weberian types of rationality, value rationality consists of ideal motives and ultimate values of an ethical, aesthetic or any other type. In the administrative context, legitimate power belongs to legitimation which may vary from country to country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0020852312444854">Weber, 1978</xref>: 33–38, 213).</p>
<p>Those who live in countries whose political legitimacy is secure are likely to take it for granted. But what a society’s laws endorse and prohibit may not agree at all closely with what its members take for granted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020852312444854">Beetham, 1991</xref>: 117; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020852312444854">Hannan, 1992</xref>: 34). One requirement for social structure is integration, which means that the system has to maintain close relations between its different parts and prevent the emergence of abnormal circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020852312444854">Parsons and Smelser, 1964</xref>: 46–54). This aspect is seen in the analysis contained in this article in the context of the views of different age-groups. The other important aspect is the requirement of continuity of values and the maintenance of the system. This means that the system must maintain its own form and prevent the formation of tension situations. Here, legitimation is seen as a scale of tension and continuity.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0020852312444854"><title>Research problem</title>
<p>Connected to the public sector ethics debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020852312444854">Comte-Sponville, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020852312444854">Hart, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020852312444854">Lawton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020852312444854">Rawls, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020852312444854">Six and Huberts, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020852312444854">Solomon and Murphy, 1990</xref>), the ethical issues described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0020852312444854">Figure 1</xref> are interrelated and we also assume that these ethical aspects are connected to the idea of a legitimate society. If citizens feel: (1) that the central virtues are important to them; (2) that the society is just and equal; and (3) that they can trust (in) societal institutions, then it is assumed that they consider politics and administration to be basically legitimate.

<p>Three ethical issues as elements of legitimation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0020852312444854-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Ethics is related to legitimation. According to Denhardt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020852312444854">1989</xref>: 192), in a political environment, ethics enables administrators to act in an ethical and legitimate manner. Public administration must always exist in the context of public institutions, which means that public administrators must learn to behave in the context of governmental institutions. The enhancement of integrity depends on sustaining and improving public institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020852312444854">Lynch and Lynch, 2006</xref>: 70).</p>
<p>The goal of this article is to analyze the ethical issues that are related to the question of legitimation. We try to explore the tensions of legitimation both through the selected ethical issues and the analysis of generations. The three issues focused on are the virtues of decent citizenship, justice and equality in society, and trust in institutions. The general research setting is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0020852312444854">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the perceptions of citizens are further specified by asking whether the generation matters. Are the perceptions of the different generations distinctive and can these perceptions be explained by the gap between generations?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0020852312444854"><title>Three ethical concepts influencing legitimation</title>
<p>As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0020852312444854">Figure 1</xref>, decent citizenship is described as membership in a society, the creation of rights and duties, and active participation. As a status, citizenship refers to civil, political and social rights guaranteed by the state. As a role, decent citizenship takes into account the identities that each individual possesses. The concept of a decent citizen includes features of morality. Through the ages, ethics has pursued an answer to the questions of what kind of life is considered to be good and right; and what virtues, habits and rules should one have and follow. History, national characteristics, culture and other socioeconomic factors define the character of a decent citizen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020852312444854">Pierson, 1996</xref>: 134; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020852312444854">Garofalo et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The way citizens experience decent citizenship might tell us something about how they experience administration, or at least what the administration should be like so that it corresponds to the needs and expectations of citizens. Legitimate administration needs the support of citizens. The results of political decision making should represent the values of citizens – at least in the ideal situation.</p>
<p>By discussing the virtues of citizens, we try to understand what one should do, what one should be like, and how one should live. Through these ideals one can at least intellectually try to gauge the distance that separates the real world from those ideals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020852312444854">Hart, 2001</xref>: 146; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020852312444854">Lynch and Lynch, 2006</xref>: 72).</p>
<p>The ethics of virtue require a moral commitment to specific values. Virtue ethics has always been marked by the moral obligation to transcend one’s own self-interests. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020852312444854">Hart (2001)</xref> concluded that all individuals are born with an innate imperative to virtue. Virtue is necessary to be fully human. The cardinal virtues must be intentionally cultivated, they must emerge in intentional, voluntary moral action, and they require unending moral improvement.</p>
<p>Virtue is a force that has or that can have an effect on our way of acting as a part of society. The virtue of a thing or a being is what constitutes its value and excellence. To act well is in our power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020852312444854">Comte-Sponville, 2003</xref>: 2–3). Being a good citizen requires that one chooses the greater good when confronted with questions of self-interest versus public interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852312444854">Guy, 1990</xref>: 127).</p>
<p>According to the ideal of citizenship in the Western tradition of political philosophy, citizens should be public-minded and self-sacrificing. They should have a keen sense of obligation and of the ‘common good’. Citizens should be loyal, law-abiding, familiar with virtues, and they should value their political rights and obligations. They should take part in their community and participate in communal matters, and also be pious, moderate and of good moral character. Individual morality and intellectual sobriety are the critical standards of justice and civic obligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0020852312444854">Villa, 2001</xref>: ix, 1–2).</p>
<p>Some of the findings here indicate that citizens feel that the rules of society are justified. But how do they react to such ethical topics as justice and equality? In the analysis, justice can be seen as a boundary that defines other virtues, as a precondition of all values, and the requirement for any kind of humanity. We assume that justice has the corresponding role in a legitimate society. Justice is a fundamental principle of a democratic society and such a society is expected to provide equal opportunities for everyone. Following the ideas of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020852312444854">Rawls (1973)</xref>, equality refers to the equal and fair treatment of citizens. In public administration, the promotion of equality means that there is no discrimination between different groups or individuals. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020852312444854">Dworkin (2004)</xref>, equality and distribution of resources as ideals are based on envy-free action. In a market-driven society, everyone should have equal access to competition.</p>
<p>The equality of citizens is the principle behind any true democracy. Justice exists only to the extent that citizens begin to want it and bring it into being. There is no justice in the legal sense without laws or without culture. In a larger sense, there is no justice without society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020852312444854">Comte-Sponville, 2003</xref>: 60–62; 71, 75).</p>
<p>Various criteria for justice exist. Theories of justice have usually been theories of distributive justice like Rawls’ Theory of Justice. Rawls introduces two well-known principles. First, ‘Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all.’ And second, ‘Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both (a) to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged and (b) attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020852312444854">Rawls, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0020852312444854">Thomas, 2000</xref>: 103–105, 110–111).</p>
<p>Citizens’ attitudes towards justice and equality do not directly explain their perceptions about trust. Trust in institutions is better understood by personal experience and contacts more than anything else. Trust is studied through different dimensions: trust between individuals, trust towards the activity of professionals, trust inside and within organizations, trust between organizations, trust in politicians, or trust inside the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020852312444854">Lawton and Doig, 2006</xref>: 16–17). Public office holders are facing more and more complex ethical challenges. The failure to make ethical decisions can erode public trust and confidence in the government. The transition to an open society calls for a rededication to democratic values, respect for human rights, and a belief in the service of citizens and of the common good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020852312444854">Menzel, 2007</xref>: 178, 190–191).</p>
<p>We can make the distinction between trust in competencies and in intentions that is someone’s willingness to operate to the best of his competence, and to be cooperative rather than opportunistic. There are many objects of trust. In this article we are interested in trust in institutions and organizations producing welfare. One can have behavioral trust also in organizations, with the expectations that in our dealings with them they will not fail us. One form of this is competence trust in the organization’s structure and procedure and the collective ability of an organization to perform. We can also have intentional trust in codes and standards of ethics, honesty and trust in the truth of reporting and public statements. Trust in organizations is based on corporate image and reputation, and on one’s own dealings with them. An organization itself does not have an intention, but it has interests and can try to regulate the intentions of its workers to serve those interests. Trust in an organization can be based on trust in the people in it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020852312444854">Nooteboom, 2002</xref>: 9, 192–193).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0020852312444854"><title>Generation</title>
<p>For the purposes of this article, a generation can be defined as an identifiable group that shares birth years, age location, and significant life events at critical developmental stages. Differences between generations are confounded with changes due to aging, experience and life stage. A generational group (a cohort) includes those who share historical or social life experiences, the effects of which are relatively stable over the course of their lives. These life experiences tend to distinguish one generation from another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312444854">Jurkiewicz and Brown, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>There are different insights on the effect of age upon political participation and public opinion. The life cycle hypothesis states that variation by age in political participation or political attitudes is caused by one’s stage in the life cycle. The generational hypothesis, states that individuals are most profoundly affected by events of their formative years. The life experience hypothesis presumes that people acquire resources; information, skills, that promote participation as they grow older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852312444854">Boatright, 2001</xref>). According to Putnam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020852312444854">2000</xref>) generational differences in propensity to join civic associations or to take part in social or political activities are still affected by age (generational hypotheses).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020852312444854">MacManus (1996)</xref> argued that age-group differences are often primarily attributable to one’s place in the life cycle. The needs and priorities of the young are simply different from those of the old (especially on economic issues). But in other instances, the differences are more a product of the time in history during which each generation became socialized politically. Sometimes, the attitudes and opinions of the young and the old are quite similar; their differences are with the middle-aged cohorts.</p>
<p>Generations exist as specific collective identities. Otherwise it would be possible to replace the term ‘generation’ by ‘age-group’. The term generation often refers to cohorts or age categories. Generation in this sense encompasses individuals born in a particular year or within a particular interval. The ‘cohort’ concept is often used to replace the category of generation. In the cohort concept, units of birth year groups are investigated with regard to the features which they have in common (such as attitudes, value convictions and preferences) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312444854">Corsten, 1999</xref>: 250–252; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020852312444854">Eyerman and Turner, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Generational differences in work attitudes values and work ethic have been quite a popular research topic among the studies of generational differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020852312444854">Jurkiewicz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312444854">Jurkiewicz and Brown, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020852312444854">Meriac et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020852312444854">Smola and Sutton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020852312444854">Twenge, 2010</xref>). Putnam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020852312444854">2000</xref>: 248) asked, ‘Do people of different ages behave differently because they are momentarily at different points in a common life cycle or because they are enduringly belong to different generations?’</p>
<p>In this analysis, the concept of generation is closely related to the concept of age-group. As described below, the data are divided into three age-groups. As far as it concerns the analysis of generations, the main focus is here laid on the tensions between youth, middle-aged and older generations. While tensions are explored, the concept covers more than the mere technical division based on the year of birth. The analysis of generations is also linked to other dimensions such as experience, attitudes, needs and even life styles of age-groups. Because of the restrictions of the data available, the evidence on these factors remains relatively weak and speculative in the forthcoming analysis.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0020852312444854"><title>Method and data</title>
<p>Field-based empirical research on administrative ethics is less common than research based on normative and philosophical literature. For gathering opinions, attitudes and expectations, the survey technique is an accurate tool in administrative ethics when the purpose is to reach a wider population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020852312444854">Frederickson and Walling, 2001</xref>: 37, 40; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020852312444854">Salminen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020852312444854">Salminen and Ikola-Norrbacka, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0020852312444854">Van de Walle, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The empirical evidence contained in this article is based on two separate batches of empirical data. The first one is a national citizen survey implemented by the University of Vaasa in 2008. The second is a youth survey carried out in 2009. Both surveys belong to the research program, ‘Citizens First? Ethical Government in Terms of Citizens’, which was funded by the Academy of Finland. We are in a privileged position for this type of research method because Finnish citizens are willing to answer surveys and give their opinions and evaluations.</p>
<p>In the Citizen Survey, the original questionnaire consisted of citizens’ assessments on the ethics of public services, good administration and virtues of public authorities, and the ethics of the political system. The survey questionnaire was sent to 5000 Finnish citizens aged 25–65 in the spring of 2008. The sample was chosen to represent Finland in miniature. The high response rate raised the validity of the survey. Although no incentives were used, the response rate rose to 40.4 percent. The main research report is called ‘Are we being heard? Ethical governance and citizens’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020852312444854">Salminen and Ikola-Norrbacka, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The Youth Survey gives the young people’s perspective on a fair society. The research material was collected in six upper secondary schools in Finland in the spring of 2009. Respondents were mostly 16- to 18-year-olds. Altogether, 1130 students filled out the questionnaire during their school day. The questions gathered young citizens’ assessments of decent citizenship, the ethical challenges for society, the virtues of public authorities and politicians, and future ethical challenges. The main research report is called ‘Good Governance – Who Cares? Youth perspectives on good governance and fair society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020852312444854">Lähdesmäki, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The two surveys have similar groups of questions, which enabled us to create the research framework as compiled data. The questions of the questionnaire forms with exact percentage shares are presented in Appendices 1 and 2.</p>
<p>The original data was divided into three age-groups. The first group consisted of the youth survey data; young people aged 16–18 (<italic>n</italic> = 1130). The second group consisted of middle-aged people; aged 30–49 (<italic>n</italic> = 786), and the third group consisted of the older generation, aged 50–66 (<italic>n</italic> = 1050). The two last groups come from the citizen survey.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0020852312444854"><title>Features of decent citizenship</title>
<p>When legitimation is discussed, decent citizenship is one of the ethical cornerstones in this article. Therefore, it is relevant to know how citizens themselves conceptualize being a decent citizen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020852312444854">Stivers, 2001</xref>: 590).</p>
<p>The concept of a decent citizen estimated by the citizens themselves gives tools to the authorities to develop a more ethical government in the eyes of citizens. Beetham (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020852312444854">1991</xref>: 56) argues that social rules have normative force, whether they are conventional or legal. Social rules define our duties and obligations towards others and confer rights and entitlements we can require of others in turn.</p>
<p>Age is a predictor of virtually all forms of civic engagement. Middle-aged and older people are more active in more organizations than younger people, attend church more often, vote more regularly, are more interested in politics and volunteer more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020852312444854">Putnam, 2000</xref>: 247–248).</p>
<p>How do Finnish citizens experience the concept of a decent citizen? What do they consider to be important virtues? Some of the statements can be categorized as the traditional valuations of a decent citizen and some are newer, arising from current requirements. Those valuations are often mentioned as citizens’ qualifications: the working and fulfilling of societal duties, political participation, critical consumption and environmental consciousness, being tolerant and being a loyal member of society.</p>
<p>When a citizen answers the question ‘Who is a decent citizen?’, one perceives the ideal model of a citizen as a member of society. At the same time one might have in mind a picture of an ideal society. We believe that the question of the virtues of citizenship is connected to views on the equality of the society and on the trustworthiness of institutions. For example, if a citizen sets great store in paying taxes or following rules, then one probably considers public service organizations or legislative organizations trustworthy, at least to some extent.</p>
<p>In the following analysis, the ethical features of a decent citizen are considered as twofold. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020852312444854">Table 1</xref> describes commonly expected modes of behavior for a citizen as a member of society, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020852312444854">Table 2</xref> presents virtues with a moralistic appreciation as well as ethical expressions of opinions concerning current social ethical issues.

</p>
<p>In general description (percent shares) as far as obligations and responsibilities are concerned, the older generation sees voting in elections as being more important than the youth do. The age limit for voting in Finland is 18, so the youth do not have experience of voting and of its impact. However, middle-aged people are more cynical towards political participation than the youngsters and the elderly.</p>
<p>In the distribution of percent shares, in the statements about paying taxes and obeying the law, no remarkable differences between the age-groups were found. However, it is commonly assumed that the youth value them less than the middle-aged and the older generations.</p>
<p>The biggest difference between the generations can be found in the opinions on the black economy. The difference in opinion between the youth and the older generation was remarkable. The youth have a different attitude towards the black economy but they still shared the opinion about the importance of paying taxes with the older generation. A significant difference was also found in involvement in politics. The youth have a remarkably more positive attitude towards it.</p>
<p>And when carrying out a deeper analysis, are there any significant differences between the age-groups? The Kruskall-Wallis test<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0020852312444854">1</xref></sup> shows that there are very significant differences between the age-groups. Specifying the results with the pairwise comparisons method, in every question the most diverging group was the youth. In three questions (paying taxes, obeying the law and appreciating any honest work) the difference between middle-aged and older generations was not significant. In all other cases, also between these age-groups the differences were very significant. The exact statistical tables with tests and pairwise comparisons are to be found in Appendix 3.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020852312444854">Table 2</xref> presents virtues with a moralistic appreciation as well as ethical expressions of opinions concerning current social ethical issues. It is commonly assumed that the youngest generation is the most environmentally oriented. The reality is more complicated than that. In the empirical findings, the middle-aged and older generations valued environmental questions more than the youth did.</p>
<p>In the question regarding their feeling of responsibility for the global situation, the youth differed very significantly from the other two groups (Kruskall-Wallis variance analysis). Instead, the other two groups did not differ from each other. In the other four statements the requirements for one-way ANOVA variance analysis were fulfilled so differences between the groups are based on the Tukey’s test. In every statement the youth differed very significantly from the other two groups. In the statement concerning sorting waste for recycling the middle-aged differed less significantly from the older generation. In the other three questions there was no difference between the middle-aged and the older generations. The exact statistical tables with tests and pairwise comparisons are to be found in Appendix 3.</p>
<p>The main conclusions of this section show that paying taxes, obeying the law and voting in elections are commonly shared features of a Finnish decent citizen. In terms of legitimation, they are fundamental and maintain continuity. However, there were also tensions to be found. Citizens’ estimations concerning involvement in politics and acceptance of the black economy are the main reasons for tension.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0020852312444854"><title>Justice and equality</title>
<p>The question of social justice concerns the primary subject of justice as the basic structure of society and the way in which the major institutions distribute rights and duties, and deliver advantages. The major institutions define individuals’ rights and duties and influence through what they can expect to be and how well they can hope to do. An important aspect of equality is the equality of opportunities, and often providing equal opportunities to everyone is regarded as a responsibility of the society. Equality refers to the equal and fair treatment of citizens. One consequence of this principle is that public offices and positions are open to all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020852312444854">Rawls, 1973</xref>: 60–89; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020852312444854">2001</xref>: 73; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020852312444854">2004</xref>: 49).</p>
<p>Equality in public administration is connected to fair decisions and a just society. Administrative decisions are considered to be just when they produce just outcomes (distributive justice) and are produced by a fair process. Equality functions as a cornerstone of a just public administration. A society based on just public administration has the possibility of achieving justice, assuming that citizens have legitimated the system of public administration and public services.</p>
<p>In the Rawlsian view, the pursuit of equality requires that the distribution of resources and inequalities should not hurt those who are less-advantaged. Finnish society has a strong tradition of taking care of the less-advantaged, for example, through the comprehensive social security as well as with the free education and health care systems available to all citizens.</p>
<p>The differing opinions of citizens on the public interest can be seen as a debate over substantive democratic values and, moreover, on the equality of conditions or equity. This view instrumentalizes the public interest into a debate between those who would promote greater equality, and those who would not limit individual liberty at its expense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020852312444854">Morgan, 2001</xref>: 154).</p>
<p>If citizens regard decisions as being just and in accordance with the public interest, they can even accept the hard decisions concerning, for example, service provision and taxation. The fulfillment of the public interest is safeguarded by just decisions and the commitment to serve all citizens, not just a specific privileged group of citizens or customers. If citizens experience the public administration as an unequal system, it threatens the legitimacy of the whole society. On the contrary, if public services are perceived to be fair, it improves the legitimacy of the public administration as a whole. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0020852312444854">Table 3</xref> represents the considerations of the three Finnish generations on the questions of justice and equality.</p>
<p>When looking at the general picture (percent shares), the differences between the generations are remarkable on all questions, and especially between the youth and the two other generations. Above all, the middle-aged and older generations express their concerns about increasing inequality and class differences. Almost half of the older generation estimates that the country will become more unjust in the future. Among the youth only one-fifth shares that opinion. However, the young people might feel more insecure in their opinions on ethical questions. In fact, the percentage share of the insecure respondents is quite remarkable in this category. An even more remarkable difference concerns the estimates on increasing income disparities. In spite of this, the youth are more positive towards the future.</p>
<p>In the deeper analysis, the Kruskall-Wallis test<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0020852312444854">2</xref></sup> shows again that differences between the age-groups are very significant. When comparing the groups with the pairwise comparisons method (the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020852312444854">Siegel and Castellan, 1988</xref>), we found that again the youth were the most divergent group. Concerning the statement ‘Finnish society is becoming more unjust’, the middle-aged and the older generations did not differ from each other, and also the difference in the statements ‘Unequal treatment of citizens is increasing’ and ‘Disparities in incomes will increase’ is only almost significant. The exact statistical tables with tests and pairwise comparisons are to be found in Appendix 3.</p>
<p>Why do people think that our society is becoming more unjust or that income disparities will increase in the future? At the same time they stress that a decent citizen pays taxes. The data do not give answers to this question. However, a positive attitude towards taxpaying tells us that people estimate public services to be equally available to all citizens. The generational gap is evident when the Rawlsian principle ‘inequality shall not hurt the least-advantaged’ is observed. The older generation estimates it to be much more important than the youth.</p>
<p>The above underlines that, in particular, dimensions of justice such as the growth of disparities and the unequal treatment of citizens cause tensions in Finnish society. The biggest differences are to be found in the opinions of youth compared to the other age-groups. On the contrary, the similar estimations of the middle-aged and older generations may have a balanced factor in this.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0020852312444854"><title>Trust in institutions</title>
<p>Trust, among citizens, is a sort of general confidence in politicians and public authorities. Citizens’ beliefs and opinions in trust emerge through many processes. Some opinions are formulated in childhood through the process of socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020852312444854">Salminen and Ikola-Norrbacka, 2010</xref>). Ethical governance is based on the example given by politicians and public authorities. Those who occupy an office, whether appointed or elected, are expected to demonstrate the highest degree of integrity and to conduct themselves in an honorable way. A democratic government – one that is open and accessible to popular will and thought – can be achieved only by morally committed individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020852312444854">Menzel, 2007</xref>: 30). Complete moral development entails not only knowing what one should do but also having the motivation and strength to do what is right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020852312444854">Garofalo and Geuras, 1999</xref>).<disp-quote>
<p>Real trust is an expectation that things or people will not fail us, or the neglect or lack of awareness of the possibility of failure, even if there are perceived opportunities for such failure. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020852312444854">Nooteboom, 2002</xref>: 112)</p></disp-quote>Politicians and public authorities are expected to keep their promises. Keeping promises is one of the core values in ethical decision making. It means keeping one’s commitments as well. To be trustworthy, promises must be kept and commitments fulfilled. The basic security of the society requires public confidence in institutions. From the citizens’ perspective, trust is a sort of confidence in politicians and other public authorities. People – whether young or old – often have a negative attitude towards the government and public authorities. But still, if citizens strongly trust in one organization, they are likely to trust in other organizations as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020852312444854">Christensen and Laegreid, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852312444854">Guy, 1990</xref>: 15; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020852312444854">Nooteboom 2002</xref>). Trust is also a matter of reputation.</p>
<p>It is good to keep in mind that not all distrust is harmful. A certain amount of distrust is functional because it forces the administration to maintain a healthy level of administrative accountability. The optimal level of trust is connected to the development of the political and administrative culture. There is no single or unambiguous explanation as to why some organizations seem to be trustworthy and others not. It is a question of personal experience, of the experience of the circle of acquaintances, of images and history, and also the base of the person who trusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020852312444854">Hofstede, 1980</xref>; Van <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0020852312444854">de Walle et al., 2008</xref>: 52). Much is lost if trust in the public realm is lost. The politico-administrative system as a whole will appear different. It is evident that a high level of trust contributes to legitimacy.</p>
<p>Concerning Finnish citizens’ trust, there are two sides to the coin: trust in politics and trust in institutions. Specific figures are given in Appendices 1 and 2. Although people trust in public sector organizations and institutions, they do not trust the promises made by politicians. All three generations are critical towards political decision makers. Even the younger ones estimated that promises will not be kept by politicians although they have no experience of political participation. It is alarming that over half of the citizens feel that politicians cannot be trusted. More than 60 percent of adults and nearly half of the youngsters were critical towards politicians.</p>
<p>Another interesting finding is that the youth estimate voting as being more worthwhile than the older generation does. In total, 80 percent of the young respondents and almost 60 percent of adults believed that by voting one can influence matters concerning oneself. A positive attitude towards voting might indicate that the political system is considered legitimate. Even if citizens distrust politicians, they still have confidence in the political system for one reason or another.</p>
<p>What does measuring trust in institutions tell us? Is it so that if citizens trust in police, courts and politicians, they also trust the ability of these institutions to guarantee the social order, to protect the public interest and to assure justice in society? And vice versa, if citizens’ trust in societal institutions decreases, will it damage their belief in justice and equality in society?</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0020852312444854">Table 4</xref> depicts the respondents’ views on the trustworthiness of some Finnish institutions. So far, public organizations and institutions enjoy the confidence of ordinary citizens in Finland. Concerning the trustworthiness of Finnish institutions, the differences between the generations were minor when studying descriptive percentage shares. This result is rather surprising as the figures resemble each other so much that the findings portray a smooth and simple picture of the trustworthiness of Finnish institutions. However, the deeper statistical analyses show that there are differences between the age-groups.</p>
<p>Previous surveys from other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020852312444854">Listhaug, 1984</xref>: 114; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0020852312444854">Warren, 2006</xref>: 165) indicate that police (police officers), legal system (judges) and educational system (teachers, professors) as well as the military (military officers) are highly ranked. The World Values profile study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020852312444854">Borg et al., 2007</xref>) shows that public trust in the police and in the military has increased from 1981 to 2005. It is easy to share the opinion that as long as citizens trust in public institutions, the whole society works better.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0020852312444854">Table 4</xref> the only significant difference between the generations concerns the trustworthiness of the courts when examining the descriptive percentage shares. The youth consider them more trustworthy than the older generation. How can this be explained? Maybe the older generation is more skeptical because they have more experience, having themselves come into contact with matters handled by the courts. The more life experience they have, the less they seem to consider it trustworthy.</p>
<p>Between the generations, the older generation estimates the church to be more trustworthy than the youth do. Despite the differences concerning courts and the church, we were surprised by the results. We assumed that the differences would have been more significant, for example on the level of trust felt towards the schools of different levels, and the police and the military.</p>
<p>And what about when looking at the deeper analysis? When it came to estimations about trustworthiness of police and schools, the respondents’ answers were totally coherent comparing all the age-groups. Regarding estimations of trustworthiness of the military, the youth differed less significantly from the older generation but the middle-aged did not differ significantly from the other two groups. The Kruskall-Wallis pairwise comparisons show that in the case of the courts, all groups differed from each other very significantly. In the case of health services, church and higher education the youth differed from the other two groups. However, the other two groups did not differ from each other. The exact statistical tables with tests and pairwise comparisons are to be found in Appendix 3.</p>
<p>The main conclusion is that overall trust in Finnish institutions is high. Trustworthiness of police, schools, higher education and the military are the basic cornerstones for maintaining continuity. However, there are tensions in legitimation to be discovered in the estimations of the courts, the church and health services. The values of the youth seems to be diverging from the other two groups.</p>

<sec id="sec11-0020852312444854"><title>Main findings</title>
<p>The basic theme of the article was ethics and legitimation from the citizens’ perspective. The main focus was on the elements that are related to the question of legitimation in society. The empirical analysis was based on the evidence and the contributions of the data from two Finnish surveys.</p>
<p>In the Finnish context, the three ethical areas (origins) dealt with were decent citizenship, justice and equality, and trust. Concluding the discussion, one may finally ask what causes the tensions of legitimation and what are the emerging crucial challenges to legitimation?</p>
<p>Another question concerns the role of the generation: whether the perceptions of the different generations can be considered as distinct from each other. Two interpretations exist: either age explains less or age refers to the opposite direction from that expected. In spite of this there are ethical considerations where generation seemed to make a difference. The main empirical findings of this research are as follows.</p>
<p>The analysis evidences clearly that youth differed in their attitudes and opinions from the other two age-groups. This result was somewhat expected but maybe the gap between the youth and the other age-groups was bigger than expected. The middle-aged and the older generations quite often did not differ from each other in their attitudes and opinions.</p>
<p>There were two questions where the age-groups did not differ from each other at all. The opinions concerning the questions of trustworthiness of police and schools were totally convergent when comparing the age-groups. These two institutions are to be seen as cornerstones of Finnish legitimate administration. It is remarkable that citizens have such high trust in the police institution and in its integrity. And when it comes to schools, it is promising that the youth also find the school institution trustworthy and acceptable.</p>
<p>And then, there were questions where all the three age-groups differed from each other significantly. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0020852312444854">Table 5</xref> is a summary of the three ethical topics, the main sources of tensions and the emerging crucial questions to legitimation.

<p>Differences between the generations exist, and they are evident in the eight ethical statements as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0020852312444854">Table 5</xref>. The first four findings belong to the virtues of decent citizenship; the second three refer to a just and equal society; and the last one to trust in institutions. The specific figures are shown in the previous <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020852312444854">Tables 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0020852312444854">4</xref> and in Appendix 3.</p>

<sec id="sec12-0020852312444854"><title>Further discussion</title>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0020852312444854">Table 5</xref> the main distinctions between the generations are identified and set in a frame of potential tensions of legitimation. How can they be explained, and what kind of questions may emerge? In addition to the generational differences, it is admitted that both life cycle and life experience explain quite a lot of the varied opinions and attitudes between the generations.</p>
<p>First, political participation and voting are the cornerstones of a democratic and legitimate society. In our study, the youth replied significantly more positively than adults to the statement regarding ‘Involvement in politics’. The middle-aged are the most skeptical age-group. However, the youth believed that politicians are prone to break their promises. Still, they have a belief in the power of participation and influencing common affairs through involvement in politics. We may ask whether the youth understand the concept of involvement in politics but in this context we assume that they do so well enough. The middle-aged had the most negative attitude towards the statement. If such alienation continues, the coherence of society can be threatened. The same can be said about the meaning of voting, where the differences between the age-groups were increasing from the youth to the older generation.</p>
<p>Second, concerning acceptance of the black economy, the differences between the generations were significant. The figures between age-groups increase from the youth to the older generation. This is a confusing finding because paying taxes was considered to be at the top of the list of the attributes of a decent citizen by all generations. Voting and taxpaying are seen as the basic elements of legitimation in society. This gap between the generations is difficult to explain. Does it imply a weakening of morality? Not necessarily, but the risk of it is on the horizon.</p>
<p>Third, the figures concerning sorting waste for recycling increase from the youth to the older generation. That was a surprising result taking into account that the youth in general have a lot to say in the name of ecological values. It was assumed that the youth would have been the most ecologic age-group when it came to sorting waste. On the other hand, the older generation has lived its youth in the harder economic times where it was not possible to waste resources. This result, however, implies that the ecological mind needs to be strengthened in the name of sustainable development.</p>
<p>Fourth, it can be doubted whether any modern Western legitimate society can exist at all in the eyes of its citizens without justice and equality. According to this study, elderly people are exceptionally skeptical towards the statement about the equal treatment of citizens and the belief that inequality should not hurt the less-advantaged. The figures between age-groups increase from the youth to the older generation. Are citizens being divided into winners and losers? As this seems to be an ongoing trend, collectivity and coherence could therefore suffer.</p>
<p>Fifth, concerning the growth of disparities in income, a tension between the generations exists. The figures between age-groups increase from the youth to the older generation. When asked about increasing income disparities, Finnish youth clearly feel more confident about the future than the middle-aged and the older generations. What explains these significant differences? One explanation could be life experience or life cycle. Besides, the youth overall tend to trust in the future. This is a positive sign for the legitimation of society. The youth appreciate that public welfare services should be equally available for all. Is this in the realm of possibility if the welfare state were to be dismantled?</p>
<p>Sixth, if administrative institutions do not enjoy the trust of the people, society cannot be considered as highly legitimate. Although the institutions were considered trustworthy overall, there were major differences between the generations as far as the courts are concerned. The figures between the age-groups decrease from the youth to the older generation. It is a challenge to retain the trust felt towards politicians and institutions as young citizens receive more and more experience as members of society. Due to a general lack of confidence in such institutions as the courts, a potential risk is that the balance of society may be shaken.</p>
<p>These kinds of possible consequences are not necessarily arising in every country. In a single case study, meanings and conceptions of ethics are linked to tradition and the culture of local (nation-state) experience. It is to be admitted that instead of describing one country – as in this article – more comparative data are needed from the experiences of other countries. This would make it possible to get a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of the administrative context and culture affecting ethical assessments.</p>
