<title>Methemoglobinemia</title>
<p>Two case reports of benzocaine associated methemoglobinemia were described.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 1</italic>. A 7-month-old male with stage IV multifocal neuroblastoma developed cyanosis, anxiety, and dyspnea 5 hours after applying a topical oral gel (7.5% benzocaine, doxycycline, nystatin, glycerin) for treatment of chemotherapy-induced stomatitis. Concurrent medications included fluconazole and cefuroxime, and he received the second course of chemotherapy (etoposide, carboplatin) 7 days prior. Peripheral blood from vein was dark chocolate in color and revealed a MetHb concentration of 42%. The oral gel was discontinued immediately and oral ascorbic acid and packed red blood cell transfusion were administered as intravenous methylene blue was unavailable. Subsequently, his MetHb concentration decreased to 1.5% in 22 hours. After the event and 3 months later a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase nitro blue tetrazolium qualitative assay showed normal activity and he continued his chemotherapy treatments.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 2</italic>. A 6-year-old male with stage IV nephroblastoma developed blue cyanotic skin discoloration 5 days after administration of a topical oral gel (7.5% benzocaine, doxycycline, nystatin, glycerin). Concurrent medications included filgrastim, cefuroxime, and voriconazole, and he completed the fourth course of chemotherapy (vincristine, actinomycin, doxorubicin) 6 days prior. Venous blood was also dark chocolate in color, and a spectrophotometric measurement revealed a MetHb concentration of 35.5%. The oral gel was discontinued immediately and intravenous methylene blue (1 mg/kg) was given. The MetHb concentration dropped to 1.9% in 8 hours and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase nitro blue tetrazolium qualitative assay showed normal activity after the event and 3 months later.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that in these cases methemoglobinemia was related to the topical oral benzocaine-containing gel used for stomatitis. The pathologic mechanism for this is unknown. Patients may be at increased risk if they have postchemotherapy anemia, larger mucosal ulcerations, and heterozygosity for Cb5R deficiency. This gel has subsequently been withdrawn from that hospital’s formulary due to these events and others’ reports. The authors recommend avoiding use of topical benzocaine, especially in children on chemotherapy.</p>

<title>Myoglobin-Associated Acute Kidney Injury</title>
<p>A 63-year-old male presented with acute kidney injury 7 days after concluding treatment with oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily). Concurrent medications included prednisone (5 mg daily), cyclosporine (titrated to maintain trough level 100-150 ng/mL), azathioprine (100 mg daily), sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim, metoprolol, omeprazole, inhaled ipratropium bromide, nebulized arformoterol, itraconazole, and ezetimibe. Past medical history was significant for bilateral lung transplant, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes. During the year prior to presentation, the patient had been treated with 4 courses of ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) for <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> infection of the lung. Prior to presentation, the patient had developed generalized muscle weakness with aching noted in the shoulders, back, and legs accompanied by extreme fatigue. He later experienced severe nausea and occasional vomiting, at which time he self-discontinued ciprofloxacin 4 days before completing the prescribed 4-week course. Three months before admission, serum creatinine was 2.1 mg/dL. On presentation, blood pressure was 146/80 mm Hg and pulse was 89 beats/minute. Laboratory results included potassium 5.6 mEq/L, serum urea nitrogen 95 mg/dL, serum creatinine 6.2 mg/dL, phosphorus 6 mg/dL, creatinine kinase 36 units/L, and blood leukocyte count 6.3 × 10<sup>3</sup>/µL. Urinalysis was performed, revealing osmolality of 377 mOsm/kg, protein–osmolality ratio 1.77, and bland sediment with occasional amorphous crystals. A kidney biopsy was performed, which showed patchy areas of luminal ectasia, epithelial simplification, and enlarged nuclei with prominent nucleoli; interstitial edema and mild tubulointerstitial fibrosis was also noted. Additionally, several distal tubules contained globular casts that stained intensely for myoglobin, and there were tubular cells that contained electron-dense phagolysosomes, likely representing intracellular heme proteins. The patient was diagnosed with myoglobin-associated acute kidney injury, and antimicrobial therapy was changed to inhaled tobramycin and intravenous cefepime. Serum creatinine decreased to 2.1 mg/dL, and kidney function remained stable at 2-week follow-up.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this patient experienced biopsy-confirmed myoglobin-associated acute kidney injury after repeated exposure to ciprofloxacin. Application of the Naranjo probability algorithm produced a “definitive” association. Muscle injury by fluoroquinolones may be related to chelation of magnesium, subsequently inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway and activation of reactive oxygen species, and may also be attributed to a pathogenic role of oxidative stress. Toxicity appears to be proportional to the duration of drug exposure, and coadministration with other myotoxic medications may trigger rhabdomyolysis. The authors recommend close monitoring after drug initiation to detect this rare adverse event.</p>

<title>Liver Injury</title>
<p>Three case reports of hepatotoxicity associated with fluoroquinolone antibiotics were described.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 1</italic>. A 67-year-old male presented with progressive jaundice and abdominal pain after 1 day of treatment with ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily). Physical examination was significant for jaundiced appearance and right upper quadrant tenderness without ascites. Abnormal laboratory parameters included elevated aspartate aminotransferase (102 units/L), alanine aminotransferase (143 units/L), alkaline phosphatase (413 units/L), γ-glutamyltransferase (379 units/L), and bilirubin (total 7.8 mg/dL, direct 6.1 mg/dL). Serum creatinine was also elevated (11.5 mg/dL). Abdominal ultrasound was insignificant and other diagnoses were ruled out. Ciprofloxacin-associated cholestatic hepatitis plus renal failure was diagnosed, and the patient was treated with steroids and twice weekly hemodialysis for 3 weeks. Within 1 month, liver enzymes normalized. The Russell Uclaf Causality Assessment Method score was 6, indicating a “probable” relationship, whereas application of the Naranjo algorithm produced a score of 4, indicating a “possible” relationship.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 2</italic>. A 27-year-old male developed nausea and hyperchromic urine 5 days after initiating treatment with oral levofloxacin (500 mg daily). Abdominal ultrasound revealed hyperechoic hepatomegaly with mild splenomegaly. Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were elevated (370 units/L and 400 units/L, respectively), although bilirubin was normal. Other etiologies were ruled out, and the patient was diagnosed with levofloxacin-associated liver injury. Within 2 weeks, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase normalized, and the patient had completely recovered at 3-month follow-up. The Russell Uclaf Causality Assessment Method score was 9, indicating a “highly probable” relationship, whereas application of the Naranjo algorithm produced a score of 8, indicating a “probable” relationship.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 3</italic>. A 64-year-old male developed increased aminotransferase enzymes 2 days after initiating treatment with intravenous levofloxacin. Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were elevated (587 units/L and 1129 units/L, respectively), as was alkaline phosphatase (225 units/L) and γ-glutamyltransferase (356 units/L). Abdominal ultrasound revealed mild steatosis, and liver biopsy showed hepatocellular necrosis involving zones 3 and 2 of hepatic acini, mixed inflammatory infiltration of portal tracts by eosinophils and ceroid macrophages, ballooning degeneration, steatosis (30%), and portal fibrosis. Other etiologies of liver injury were ruled out, and levofloxacin was discontinued. Within 1 month, liver function normalized. The Russell Uclaf Causality Assessment Method score was 10, indicating a “highly probable” relationship, whereas the Naranjo algorithm produced a score of 8, indicating a “probable” relationship.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that these patients experienced liver injury following fluoroquinolone administration. Although infrequent, fluoroquinolone antibiotics have been associated with hepatotoxicity. Agents with a 1-(2,4)-difluorophenyl group may have a greater risk of severe immune-mediated toxicities, and patients who experience hepatotoxicity due to 1-fluoroquinolone should avoid other drugs from this antibiotic class. The authors encourage awareness of this potential adverse effect and prompt reporting to pharmacovigilance databases whenever possible.</p>

<title>Tenfold Errors at a Pediatric Hospital</title>
<p>A retrospective study of voluntary safety reports in a pediatric hospital was conducted to identify the drug classes and medications most frequently associated with 10-fold errors and to examine the factors that contribute to such errors. Reports from a 5-year period were identified from the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada, between July 1, 2004, and June 30, 2009. During the study period, a total of 252 tenfold errors were identified from 6643 medication-related safety reports reviewed. The mean rate was 0.062 tenfold errors per 100 patient days. Prescribing and administration were the points in the medication process most frequently identified in 10-fold medication errors (n = 109, 43.3%, and n = 87, 34.5%, respectively). Overdoses were more frequently reported than under doses (n = 179 and n = 74, respectively). Of the 10-fold errors, 123 (48.8%) were resolved prior to reaching the patient. Errors were intercepted most frequently by pharmacists (n = 53, 43%) and nurses (n = 40, 32.5%). Errors that reached the patient were most frequently related to incorrect programming of infusion pumps (n = 52, 40.3%) and use of an injectable product formulation (n = 113, 87.6%). Other significant error sources included omitted/misplaced decimal points (n = 46, 36.7%) and overriding alarms or limits (n = 56, 43.4%). Opioid analgesics were the most frequently reported drug class associated with errors (n = 45, 18%), followed by antimicrobials (n = 31, 12.3%) and heparin (n = 25, 9.9%). Among 101 reports involving these 3 medication classes, errors were most often related to dose calculation (n = 44, 43.6%) and incorrect programming of drug delivery equipment (n = 22, 21.8%). Overall, patient harm was reported in 22 (8.7%) errors.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that a variety of mechanisms contributed to the 10-fold errors observed in this study. Implementation of specific safeguards to reduce the sources of error such as standardized, fixed-dose order sets for high-risk or error-prone medication classes may help reduce the incidence of 10-fold medication errors.</p>

<title>Mitochondrial Myopathy</title>
<p>A 65-year-old female developed muscle pain and progressive weakness in limbs approximately 4 weeks after initiating arsenic trioxide (65 mg weekly) for acute promyelocytic leukemia. Four weeks prior to the onset of her symptoms, the patient was treated with all-<italic>trans</italic> retinoic acid (90 mg daily) for 1 month. After initiating arsenic trioxide, her muscle pain and weakness continued to worsen over the following 3 months. On examination, the patient could not walk without assistance and was noted to have a grade 4 out of 5 upper limb weakness score (per the Medical Research Council scale) and 2 out of 5 on the lower limb scale. Muscle biopsy done 3 months after stopping arsenic trioxide therapy showed cytoplasmic lipid droplets and decreased cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase reaction in all fibers. Six months after interrupting arsenic trioxide therapy, the patient’s muscle biopsy was much improved and she was able to now walk without assistance.</p>
<p>The authors suggested that this patient’s mitochondrial myopathy was related to arsenic trioxide and that clinicians be aware of the signs and symptoms of arsenic trioxide–induced mitochondrial myopathy.</p>

<title>Drug Interaction: Increased Concentrations of Sitagliptin</title>
<p>A randomized, open-label, single-center, 2-period crossover study was conducted with 12 healthy Indian male volunteers to determine the impact of gemfibrozil on sitagliptin pharmacokinetics. Participants were randomized to sitagliptin (100 mg tablet daily) or gemfibrozil (600 mg tablet twice daily) for 3 days plus 1 dose of sitagliptin on day 4. Each phase was separated by a 2-week washout period. The area under the curve of sitagliptin increased by 54% in the patients who received pretreatment gemfibrozil. The peak concentration of sitagliptin increased to 344 ng/mL in the group that received pretreatment gemfibrozil versus 282.9 ng/mL in the non-gemfibrozil group. The half-life of sitagliptin was also found to be increased in the pretreatment gemfibrozil group by 37%.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that gemfibrozil did increase sitagliptin area under the curve, peak concentrations, and half-life but did not result in clinically significant side effects. The theoretical mechanism for this drug–drug interaction is thought to be an effect on metabolism or excretion. Gemfibrozil is known to inhibit both CYP2C8 and hOAT3, which are both mechanisms for sitagliptin metabolism and excretion. As the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin were significantly affected with coadministration of gemfibrozil, the authors recommend that further studies with a larger number of patients need to be conducted before completely understanding the clinical significance of this interaction.</p>

<title>Gastrointestinal Bleeding</title>
<p>A prospective, observational study of 1219 inpatients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention from 2006 to 2009 was conducted to determine the rate and type of gastrointestinal bleeding that occurred in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy. Approximately 97% of the patients were on dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 75-162 mg daily plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily), and 78.7% of patients included received a proton pump inhibitor for gastroprotection. Only 3% (1.52 events per 100 patient-years) developed gastrointestinal bleeding while on antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention, with the majority of occurring in the follow-up period (27/32). All these patients required hospitalization and the majority (84.6%) were on long-term proton pump inhibitor prophylaxis at the time of the event. Lower gastrointestinal bleeds were approximately 3 times more common in this group compared with upper gastrointestinal bleed (74% vs 26%). Lower gastrointestinal bleeds were also more common compared with upper gastrointestinal bleeds (75% vs 25%). Mortality was higher in the gastrointestinal bleed group (15.6% vs 5.9%).</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the risk of gastrointestinal complications, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding, increases with dual antiplatelet therapy. Lower gastrointestinal bleeding was more common than upper gastrointestinal bleeding. They attributed the decrease in the number of upper gastrointestinal bleeding episodes due largely to the fact the majority of patients were treated with concomitant long-term proton pump inhibitors.</p>

<title>Fatal or Life-Threatening Reactions Following Adenotonsillectomy</title>
<p>Three case reports of severe opioid toxicity in children with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome following adenotonsillectomy were described.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 1</italic>. A 4-year-old male developed sedation and lethargy 1 day after adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. At the time of discharge, he was prescribed liquid codeine (8 mg up to 5 doses daily) and had received 4 doses. He was brought to the hospital on day 2 following discharge without vital signs. Postmortem morphine serum concentration was 17.6 ng/mL (therapeutic reference range = 4.5 ± 2.1 ng/mL), and the blood codeine level was in the expected range. Genotyping revealed a CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizer phenotype (<italic>CYP2D6*1/*2AxN</italic>). It was determined that the increased morphine concentrations led to bilateral acute bronchopneumonia and death.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 2</italic>. A 3-year-old female experienced decreased respirations, decreased oxygen saturation, and 1 episode of hematemesis after receiving several doses of codeine-containing products (total 60 mg codeine ingestion) following tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Blood morphine concentration was 17 ng/mL, and genotype testing revealed a CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer phenotype (<italic>CYP2D6*1/*1</italic>). She was resuscitated and treated with mechanical ventilation and naloxone (1.5 mg). She was extubated the following day and fully recovered.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 3</italic>. A 5-year-old male was found without vital signs 24 hours following bilateral myringotomy tube placement and adenotonsillectomy for recurrent tonsillitis and snoring. On discharge, he had been prescribed acetaminophen and codeine (12 mg codeine) every 4 hours. Postmortem codeine concentration was 79 ng/mL and morphine concentration 30 ng/mL. The patient’s levels were compared with expected concentrations of codeine and morphine following codeine exposure. The measured codeine concentration was at the 56th percentile of predicted pediatric codeine concentrations, whereas the measured morphine concentration was in the 99th percentile of predicted concentrations. Although genotyping was not performed in this patient, the high morphine conversion relative to codeine exposure suggests the presence of a CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizer phenotype.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that although all 3 patients were prescribed age-appropriate doses of codeine, each one experienced significant central nervous system depression. The authors suggest that codeine and other opioids metabolized by the CYP2D6 pathway should not be considered safe analgesics for children who undergo adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.</p>

<title>FDA Safety Labeling Changes: Mortality in Heart Transplantation</title>
<p>In April 2012, the FDA announced revisions in the safety labeling of everolimus. Specifically, the boxed warning was revised to include a new warning regarding increased mortality when the agent is used in heart transplantations. Increased mortality was associated with serious infections within the first 3 months posttransplant in patients receiving immunosuppression. The drug is not recommended for use in heart transplantation.</p>

<title>Respiratory Arrest</title>
<p>Two case reports of polymyxin-associated respiratory distress were described.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 1</italic>. A 48-year-old male with history of liver transplant being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia became apneic and hypotensive an hour after an infusion of polymyxin (1.6 mg/kg intravenous every 12 hours) began. Previously he received intravenous vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and tobramycin until blood cultures grew carbapenem-resistant <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, and then was started on intravenous amikacin and polymyxin. Prior to starting polymyxin, the patient was comfortable on nasal cannula and oxygen saturation of 100%. An hour later oxygen saturation decreased and became apneic requiring emergent endotracheal intubation and epinephrine infusion. Shortly after his respiratory function improved with no mention if polymyxin was continued.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 2</italic>. A 58-year-old male with a history of renal transplant and graft rejection developed apnea on the fourth day of the polymyxin infusion (loading dose of 2.9 mg/kg followed by 1.1 mg/kg intravenous every 72 hours) for a multidrug resistant infection. The patient had a history of multidrug resistant urinary tract infections and was given meropenem preoperatively and postoperatively as well as polymyxin bladder irrigation. Later during his hospitalization, he developed a perinephric abscess with multidrug resistant <italic>K.pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Enterococcus facium</italic>, and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and empirically treated with meropenem, tigecycline, and intravenous polymyxin. Four days later he became apneic and required emergency endotracheal intubation and transfer to the intensive care unit but did not require vasopressor treatment. Polymyxin was stopped and he subsequently improved 2 days later and was transferred to the floor. However, 2 weeks later he was readmitted to the intensive care unit with sepsis. It was decided to retrial the patient on polymyxin intrevenous at lower doses, but 2 hours after the infusion began, the patient required emergency intubation secondary to respiratory arrest.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that in these cases, the sudden respiratory arrests were most likely secondary to polymyxin infusions. Based on the Naranjo adverse reaction probability scale, polymyxin has a possible relationship with patient 1 and a probable relationship with patient 2. The pathologic mechanism for this is thought to be that polymyxin B has the strongest neuromuscular blocking activity and may result in paralysis of the respiratory muscles by producing a blockade at the myoneural end plate. Onset of paralysis can occur anywhere from 1 to 26 hours after the start of the dose, most commonly 1 to 3 hours. The authors recommend using caution with intravenous polymyxin, especially in patients who have acute or chronic renal disease, as this increases the risk.</p>

<title>FDA Safety Labeling Changes: Removal of Hepatotoxicity Boxed Warning</title>
<p>On March 4, 2012, the FDA announced revisions in the safety labeling of ambrisentan. Specifically, hepatotoxicity was removed from the boxed warning section of the label. Further evaluation of the clinical trial data and postmarketing safety information led the FDA to conclude that the risk of liver injury in patients treated with this drug was low.</p>

<title>Sweet’s Syndrome</title>
<p>Two case reports of Sweet’s syndrome following azacitidine administration were described.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 1</italic>. A 64-year-old male developed a severe, painful erythematous rash on the arms and legs 3 days after initiating treatment with azacitidine (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> subcutaneously daily) for myelodysplastic syndrome. Concurrent medications included hydrocodone/acetaminophen (5/500 mg every 4 hours as needed), allopurinol (300 mg daily), colchicine (0.6 mg daily), doxazosin (4 mg daily), tiotropium (18 µg daily), budesonide/formoterol (80/4.5 µg daily), and cetirizine (10 mg daily). Additional symptoms included nodular lesions on the forearms, groin, and face; fever; and facial flushing, all of which required hospitalization. Treatment included the discontinuation of azacitidine and the initiation of oral amoxicillin-clavulanate and prednisone. Skin biopsy pathology results revealed Sweet’s syndrome. At 2-week follow-up, fever was resolved and skin lesions had improved. No further complications were noted.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 2</italic>. A 67-year-old male developed a painful skin rash, chills, and fever after receiving 5 doses of azacitidine (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> subcutaneously daily) for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Concurrent medications included famotidine (20 mg twice daily) and potassium chloride (40 mEq twice daily). Nodular erythematous lesions were observed on the face and right forearm. Skin biopsy revealed findings consistent with Sweet’s syndrome. Treatment included oral prednisone, which resulted in significant improvement after several days. After discharge, rechallenge with intravenous azacitidine resulted in no further adverse effects.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that these patients experienced drug-induced Sweet’s syndrome following azacitidine administration. Application of the Naranjo algorithm indicated a “probable” adverse reaction in both patients. A specific mechanism for this reaction was not proposed.</p>

<title>Flupirtine No. 150</title>
<sec id="section28-0069477012452247">
<title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
<p>In a 12-week double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, 207 adult patients received flupirtine (400-600 mg daily), tolterodine (4 mg daily), or placebo for the treatment of overactive bladder syndrome. During a routine safety review, 8 subjects developed critically high liver enzyme values (more than 3 times the upper limit of normal). Unblinding revealed that all but 1 of these subjects was taking flupirtine, resulting in study termination. A complete data review showed that 14 (16.7%) of the flupirtine-treated subjects had alanine aminotransferase enzyme levels more than 3 times the upper limit of normal, and of these, 8 also had elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels. The incidence of elevated liver enzymes among subjects treated with flupirtine for at least 6 weeks increased to 31. Adverse events were noted to lead to study discontinuation in 13 flupirtine patients, 5 of which were reported as “liver function test abnormal.”</p>
<p>The authors concluded that unexpected frequent hepatotoxicity occurred in patients with overactive bladder who received flupirtine. A mechanism for the observed reaction was not proposed.</p>
