<p>Women’s work continues to be an important part of the national debate. We argue that although the focus in 2011 was on policy consolidation rather than new initiatives, a policy platform relating to women, work and family has been set in Australia. A shift to recognizing the implications of policy for men’s work and care roles is also discernible. The year 2011 was the 100th anniversary of the first International Women’s Day but, while celebrated around Australia, gender inequities remain. Coming onto the agenda with greater force in 2011 were the gender-related issues of an ageing workforce, growing elder care needs and sexual harassment. This article reviews selected gender statistics and then moves to the matters that were prominent in 2011: mature workers, care, pay equity, women in the defence forces, and legislative reform relating to sex discrimination, the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999 and paid parental leave.</p>

<p>Women’s work issues and women’s role in the workforce continued to be an important part of the national debate in 2011, although the focus was on policy consolidation rather than new initiatives. The year 2011 was also the 100th anniversary of the first International Women’s Day (IWD) celebration. While IWD has been a forum for generations of women to call for a range of equal rights, it has been strongly linked to securing industrial rights for female employees. In 1910, 15,000 female textile workers marched through New York in support of a range of demands, including for shorter working hours and increased pay. The plight of female workers was highlighted a year later when a fire broke out in the Triangle Shirtwaist Company’s factory in the same city, causing the death of 146 employees, most of them very young women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022185612443780">Broderick, 2011</xref>). These and other events were catalysts for an annual IWD rally in cities across the world, and following an overwhelming vote in support of the concept at the International Conference of Socialist Women in Copenhagen in 1910, the day was launched. In Australia in 2011, celebrations and meetings were held around Australia, including those hosted by the Governor General, Quentin Bryce, the Minister for the Status of Women, the Hon Kate Ellis MP, and the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Elizabeth Broderick. Major themes of the Australian events were global equality and empowerment for women, pay equity and the prevention of violence against women.</p>
<p>Some significant personnel changes in the field of work and employment also occurred during the year. An important senior female leader in industrial relations, Heather Ridout, announced her departure as chief executive of the Australian Industry Group and will take up a position on the board of the Reserve Bank in early 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022185612443780">Brindal, 2011</xref>). Susan Ryan, highly respected for her work on superannuation and as a proponent of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, was appointed to the new position of Age Discrimination Commissioner, with dismantling barriers to the employment of older people being one of her main concerns. The year ended with the Prime Minister, the Hon. Julia Gillard MP, announcing a ministry reshuffle, which saw Julie Collins announced as the new Minister for the Status of Women, replacing Kate Ellis. The panel to review the implementation of the Fair Work Act (as distinct from the review of Modern Awards) was also announced by the new Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the Hon. Bill Shorten MP, with no women on the three-person review panel, despite the need to address certain issues that affect women directly. One of the terms of reference is to assess: ‘any differential impacts across regions, industries, occupations and groups of workers including (but not limited to) women, young workers and people from non-English speaking backgrounds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022185612443780">Shorten, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Over the past three years, there has been a surge of activity in policy relating to women and work (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185612443780">Baird and Williamson, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022185612443780">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022185612443780">2011</xref>), signifying, we suggest, a reframing of the policy debates around women, work and family in Australia. Although important policy areas relating to gender, work and care still require attention, the reframing was urgently needed after years of limited policy activity and where the emphasis was on individual employer–employee negotiations.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022185612443780">Williams (2010)</xref> argues that although the family or private sphere is important, a focus on the site of the family as the ‘gender factory’ detracts from the centrality of the workplace in people’s lives, its role in influencing gender relations and the need for relevant public policy to drive change in the workplace. Working norms and workplaces, where more and more women now work, are still designed for a previous social era that preferenced men’s lives, and are thus critical sites of gender production and reproduction. Without appropriate public policies that drive change in workplaces, Williams argues, there is little chance of changing the household division of labour. Furthermore, as Williams and others have argued, men need to be directly and deliberately incorporated into the policy and the theoretical framing for genuine change to occur. Not surprisingly, Williams argues that a reframing of the political debate is required in the USA, where there is no federally mandated paid sick leave, carers’ leave or parental leave and no right to request flexibility in working hours. These policies are now part of the Australian political fabric, and while 2011 was characterized by a consolidation of activity on policy fronts and moves to resolve legislative reform in other areas, rather than the introduction of major new policies, a policy platform recognizing work and family as interrelated fields of activity has been set. Gaining more attention on the policy agenda in 2011 were the gender-related issues of an ageing workforce, growing elder care needs and paid paternity leave, all of which intersect with men’s working lives, a theme we return to briefly throughout the article.</p>
<p>In this review, we begin by summarizing some key gender statistics, then move to the matters that were prominent in 2011: mature workers; care; pay equity; women in the defence forces; and legislative reform relating to sex discrimination, the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999 and Agency (EOWA), and parental leave.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0022185612443780"><title>Selected Gender Statistics</title>
<p>The changing gender composition of the workforce continues to be of major interest. The Australian Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS’s) <italic>Gender Indicators</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022185612443780">ABS, 2011a</xref>) identifies the changes occurring and highlights the need for workplaces and workplace policy to respond to these shifts. While the increase in female participation is well known, one of the most striking changes over the past three decades has been the increase in the employment rate and hours worked of older women, especially those aged 45 and over. The <italic>Gender Indicator</italic> statistics show that in 2009–2010, the participation rate for females aged 20–74<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022185612443780">1</xref></sup> was 65% (79% for males) and the employment to population rate was 62% for females and 76% for males. For females aged 55–64 years, participation increased by 15 percentage points between 2001 and 2010. During this period, the labour force participation rate for females aged 45–54 years increased by seven percentage points and by six percentage points for females aged 65–74 years.</p>
<p>Workers employed in insecure jobs represent a growing proportion of the Australian workforce and are the focus of a campaign initiated by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) in late 2011 to improve their conditions. The ‘Secure Jobs. Better Future’ inquiry aims to draw attention to the conditions of those employed in casual, short- and fixed-term contracts, labour hire employment, and dependent and independent contracting arrangements, many of whom are women. Part-time and casual work continues to characterize the employment conditions of many women, with 43% of employed females aged 20–74 years working part time in 2009–2010 compared with 14% of employed males in the same age group. Almost one-quarter of female employees (24%), compared with 17% of male employees, received no holiday or paid sick leave entitlements. The industry with the highest proportions of male and female employees (aged 20–74 years) without paid leave entitlements was Accommodation and Food Services (47% for males and 64% for females) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185612443780">ABS, 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>The continued gender segregation of the Australian workforce and feminization of certain industries and occupations is not merely a statistical phenomenon, but reinforces gender stereotypes and continues to be a challenge for policymakers. The ABS’s (2011a) <italic>Gender Indicators</italic> shows that in 2009–2010 few women were employed in manufacturing, but of those employed in the Health Care and Social Assistance industry, 79% were females. This industry also employs the largest proportion of the female workforce (20%), a factor contributing to the significance of the Social and Community Services pay equity case reported on later. Of those people employed in the Education and Training industry, 69% were females, and 56% of those employed in Retail Trade were females. Despite 100 years of celebrating International Women’s Day and recognizing women’s contribution to society, many of the gendered patterns in work remain as before, with impacts on both the domestic and market division of labour and with consequences for the low market value placed on care work in the economy. This is why, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022185612443780">Williams’ (2010)</xref> argues, a focus on changing workplace policies to change practices relating to men’s participation in care needs to occur.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0022185612443780"><title>Care, Age and Women</title>
<p>The potential implications of the ageing population and workforce have been debated for some time, but the Australian government’s aim to increase the working-age population and increase female participation rates presents a conundrum for workers with elder care responsibilities, many of whom are also women. The pressure of an ageing population on the continued availability of workers has spurred additional government action with one of the measures being the formulation in 2010 of the Consultative Forum on Mature Age Participation. The first report of the Consultative Forum was presented in 2011. It cites recent research identifying the lack of flexible working conditions as a significant barrier to workforce participation by those with primary care duties, who are often women due to their child care, disabled care and elder care responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022185612443780">Consultative Forum on Mature Age Participation, 2011</xref>). One of the recommendations of the Advisory Panel on the Economic Potential of Senior Australians, established by the Treasurer in 2011, was also to give those aged 55 and over the right to request flexible working arrangements. Furthermore, as part of the National Carer Strategy, the government is consulting with stakeholders on expanding the right to request flexible working arrangements under the Fair Work Act 2009, to include consideration of extending the right to request flexible working arrangements to employees caring for older Australians and those caring for a person with a serious long-term illness or disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022185612443780">Australian Government, 2011a</xref>). Given that care is more likely to be provided by women, with 23% of women and 16% of men in the 45–54 year age group providing care, and more than twice as many women as men providing primary care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022185612443780">ABS, 2010</xref>: 5, 10), this is an issue of concern for women. At present, in New South Wales (NSW), for example, women use part-time work as their means of flexibility far more than men, 17% compared with 2%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022185612443780">ABS, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>How to appropriately measure and value the care provided by citizens, many of whom are women undertaking paid work as well as unpaid care for children, those with disabilities and elders, is a challenge we raised in an earlier review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022185612443780">Baird and Williamson, 2010</xref>) and one that pervades many debates in advanced economies. This issue is one that intersects with the provision of unpaid work in the home as well as that of low-paid care work in the marketplace, as the continued feminized care workforce and cases around pay equity highlight.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0022185612443780"><title>Pay Equity and the Social and Community Services Case</title>
<p>In February 2011, the gender pay gap in average weekly ordinary time earnings had widened to 17.2%, the same level as it was in 1974. The average weekly ordinary time earnings of females working full time was AU$1139.80, compared with males who earned an average of AU$1377.30. Marked variation by industry and occupation also occurs, with financial and insurance services having the highest gender pay gap (32.8%), followed by health care and social assistance (28.8%). By occupation, community and personal service workers also have one of the highest pay gaps, being 36.8% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022185612443780">EOWA, 2011</xref>). The persistence of the gender pay gap has led to numerous studies, cases and reports, including the 2008 House of Representatives inquiry into gender pay equity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022185612443780">Baird and Williamson, 2011</xref>: 337–352). This report was released in late 2009, but by the end of 2011 the Australian government was yet to respond to the inquiry’s 62 recommendations and this situation was unchanged at the time of writing this article.</p>
<p>In 2011, the Australian government, with employer associations, unions and community and women’s organizations, focused on the Social and Community Services (SACS) pay equity test case. As noted in our previous review, ‘the Fair Work Act contains broader provisions than the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to achieve pay equity, enabling Fair Work Australia (FWA) to make an order requiring equal remuneration for work of equal or comparable value’, instead of the previously more limited ‘equal remuneration for work of equal value’. Additionally, the Fair Work Act removed the previous legislative requirement of proving that sex discrimination caused gender pay inequity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022185612443780">Baird and Williamson, 2011</xref>: 346).</p>
<p>In March 2010, the Australian Services Union (ASU) and other unions lodged an application with FWA for an equal remuneration order, which would apply to employees in the SACS industry nationally. The application sought to increase wage rates in the <italic>Social, Community, Home Care and Disability Services Industry Award 2010</italic> to the comparable rates in the relevant Queensland award. The wage rates in the Queensland award had been varied as a result of the pay equity test case conducted in Queensland in 2008–2009 (ASU et al., 2010: 10, 55).</p>
<p>The applicants adopted the approach outlined in the NSW pay equity inquiry, where the NSW Industrial Relations Commission listed a series of criteria that could be used to determine whether the undervaluation of work was attributable to gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185612443780">FWAFB 2700</xref>: 33). The ASU used numerous indicators to demonstrate undervaluation due to gender, with a main indicator being that work in the SACS industry was undervalued as it was caring work predominantly performed by women, which was undervalued in regard to the skills and responsibilities involved in undertaking the work (ASU et al., 2010).</p>
<p>The ASU also submitted that the nature of the industry had contributed to undervaluation. Many SACS services are required to compete for government funding, including for short-term contracts. The ASU and others argued that short-term government grants resulted in employees being engaged casually, or on part-time contracts (ASU et al., 2010: 53–54), and a high proportion of casual employees can also be an indicator for the gender-based undervaluation of work.</p>
<p>Other arguments were put forward, including that award rates historically reflected an undervaluation of the work in the industry. When awards were varied for wage increases, this historical undervaluation was not considered or rectified. In a related manner, the applicants argued that opportunities to obtain above-minima provisions through enterprise bargaining were limited, further contributing to undervaluation (ASU et al., 2010: 55). Although not required to use a comparator, the applicants argued that comparable work – such as that performed in local and state government sectors – was more highly paid than in the SACS industry (ASU et al., 2010: 56).</p>
<p>On 16 May 2011, after numerous submissions, hearings before FWA and a number of site visits, FWA delivered its decision. FWA reinforced the Fair Work Act’s intention that a male comparator is not required and applicants do not need to show that discrimination caused undervaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185612443780">FWAFB 2700</xref>: 234). FWA noted that ‘the applicants need only to establish that remuneration in the industry results from gender-based undervaluation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185612443780">FWAFB 2700</xref>: 242). FWA concluded that:<disp-quote>
<p>for employees in the SACS industry there is not equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal or comparable value by comparison with workers in state and local government employment. We consider gender has been important in creating the gap between pay in the SACS industry and pay in comparable state and local government employment. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185612443780">FWAFB 2700</xref>: 291)</p></disp-quote>FWA considered using the indicia approach difficult for attributing pay inequity to gender, as many factors are gender-neutral and such an approach cannot be ‘prescriptive’. The FWA concluded that ‘gender has an important influence’ in contributing to the gender pay gap between the SACS industry and comparable work in state and local governments, but may not be the only factor that contributed to the pay gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185612443780">FWAFB 2700</xref>: 282). FWA cautioned that the list of indicia is ‘no more than a framework for considering whether there is undervaluation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185612443780">FWAFB 2700</xref>: 249).</p>
<p>FWA accepted that only two of the indicia used by the applicants were present. Thus, FWA found that the industry is predominantly female, and the work has a ‘female characterisation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185612443780">FWAFB 2700</xref>: 253). FWA rejected the argument that the award system had led to a devaluation of caring work in minimum rates awards and stated that ‘[w]e do not regard the prevalence of consent awards and agreements as indicative … of gender-based undervaluation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185612443780">FWAFB 2700</xref>: 255). FWA did not make a finding on whether a lack of enterprise bargaining, or the nature and extent of casual employment, resulted in lower wages in the SACS industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185612443780">FWAFB 2700</xref>: 256–257). In relation to the effect of government funding on wages, FWA attributed ‘historical inertia’ and the operation of the market to the current funding levels and wage rates in the SACS sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185612443780">FWAFB 2700</xref>: 272). FWA declined to comment on the other criteria.</p>
<p>The parties were invited to make further submissions ‘on the extent to which wages in the SACS industry are lower than they would otherwise be because of gender considerations’. FWA also requested that parties calculate what the rates in the modern award should be, although any order specifying amounts would operate independently of the award (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185612443780">FWAFB 2700</xref>: 286, 289).</p>
<p>On 8 July 2011, the Australian government lodged another submission with FWA. The government stated that it ‘would meet its responsibilities and provide fair and appropriate supplementation, in consultation with key stakeholders and taking into account the fiscal implications and opportunities for reform in the sector’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185612443780">Australian Government, 2011b</xref>). The submission further stated that ‘any FWA decision to increase wages and subsequent supplementation decisions will be an ongoing cost, and this will have to be accommodated within the constrained fiscal environment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185612443780">Australian Government, 2011b</xref>: 5). The government’s commitment to providing increased funding to pay for any wage increases arising from the test case was welcomed by the ASU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185612443780">ASU, 2011</xref>), despite the accompanying caveats.</p>
<p>In November 2011, the Prime Minister, the Hon. Julia Gillard MP, announced that the Australian government would provide AU$2b over six years to fund pay rises for SACS employees, in line with the pay rises resulting from the Queensland pay equity test case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022185612443780">Gillard, 2011</xref>). Media reports state that this decision was widely welcomed by unions and SACS employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022185612443780">Crowe and Kerr, 2011</xref>). Shortly after, the Australian government and applicant unions made a joint submission formally outlining the extent of gender-based undervaluation and recommending an appropriate remedy, which reflected the Prime Minister’s announcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185612443780">ASU and Australian Government, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The Australian government also called on state and territory governments to ‘fund their fair share of these increases for social and community service workers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022185612443780">Gillard, 2011</xref>). State governments responded in various ways, including expressing concerns that any shortfall in funding would need to be met by the state and territory governments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022185612443780">NSW Government, 2011</xref>: 2–3),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022185612443780">2</xref></sup> to ‘not objecting’ to the outcomes proposed in the joint submission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022185612443780">ACT Government, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022185612443780">Queensland Government, 2011</xref>). Employer associations expressed concerns about possible flow-on effects to other industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022185612443780">Crowe and Kerr, 2011</xref>). A final decision from FWA is expected in 2012.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022185612443780">3</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0022185612443780"><title>Sex Discrimination and Harassment: The Australian Defence Force Academy Inquiry</title>
<p>A considerable amount of activity in relation to sex discrimination occurred in 2011. As well as progressing towards consolidating the national anti-discrimination statutes and amending the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (SD Act) (see later), a high-profile inquiry was undertaken into the treatment of women at the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA).</p>
<p>In April 2011, the media reported that a young male ADFA cadet had consensual sex with a young female cadet in his room. Unbeknown to the young woman, her male companion broadcast their sexual encounter to a group of his friends, via Skype. Subsequently, military investigators were ‘tipped off by another cadet who was disturbed by photos of the incident circulating on mobile phones’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022185612443780">Snow and Oakes, 2011</xref>). The investigators informed the female cadet that they were examining the incident. According to the media, the male cadets involved were likely to face only a minor disciplinary charge, which then allegedly prompted the female cadet to go to the media with her story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022185612443780">Snow and Oakes, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This story generated a significant amount of press coverage, due to the nature of the offence committed and the possibility that the Australian Defence Force (ADF) may have been engaging in a ‘cover-up’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022185612443780">Snow and Oakes, 2011</xref>). The male-dominated culture of the defence forces and training academies, and possible accompanying sexually hostile environment for women, also generated a great deal of discussion. Debates were exacerbated since a number of inquiries had previously been conducted into the treatment of women in defence, and of sexual harassment and bullying in the defence forces and training academies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185612443780">Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC), 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>In April 2011, the Minister for Defence, the Hon Stephen Smith MP, announced that five inquiries would be conducted as a result of the Skype incident. An inquiry consisting of two parts would be conducted by Elizabeth Broderick, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner in the AHRC. University of NSW academic Andrea Durbach was appointed Deputy Sex Discrimination Commissioner to progress the Commission’s other work on sex discrimination, enabling Ms Broderick to focus on the ADFA inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022185612443780">University of New South Wales, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The first part of the inquiry would examine the treatment of women in ADFA and the second would focus on ways to improve leadership pathways for women in the ADF. Four other inquiries would examine: the Skype incident; the culture of ADFA, focusing on binge drinking and social media; the management of complaints; and an inquiry into allegations of sexual or other abuse that emerged in the aftermath of the Skype incident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022185612443780">Grattan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022185612443780">Smith, 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>In June 2011, the AHRC called for submissions into the review of the treatment of women in ADFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022185612443780">AHRC, 2011b</xref>). The submissions formed part of the resulting report, which was also based on information gained from AHRC staff holding focus groups with a quarter of the ADFA cadets as well as ADFA staff, and the results of a survey conducted into ‘unacceptable behaviour’ at ADFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185612443780">AHRC, 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>The inquiry’s first report was released in November 2011. The AHRC found that the levels of sexual harassment and other unacceptable behaviour at ADFA had declined since the last major report into sexual harassment was conducted in the late 1990s. The authors also found, however, ‘widespread low level sexual harassment, inadequate residential supervision, particularly of first year midshipmen and cadets, and cumbersome complaints processes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022185612443780">AHRC, 2011c</xref>).</p>
<p>The report makes 31 recommendations, which include: increased education about gender equity and healthy relationships (including for staff); mentoring of cadets; improved supervision and pastoral care for cadets in residential settings; establishment of an advice line for cadets; and improved data collection to measure the level of sexual harassment and sexual abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185612443780">AHRC, 2011a</xref>: xxxvii–xxxi). Twelve months after the release of this report, another independent report will be prepared on the implementation of the recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185612443780">AHRC, 2011a</xref>: xv). The second phase of the inquiry is to focus on leadership pathways for women and culture change strategies in the defence forces. This phase commenced with the AHRC calling for submissions. The review is due to conclude in 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022185612443780">Smith, 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>At the same time as announcing the reviews, Minister Smith announced that combat roles would be opened up to women, enabling women to work in any position in the defence forces. Suitability for defence roles would be based on ability, rather than gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022185612443780">Smith, 2011c</xref>). This decision was controversial. Media reports state that various senior defence personnel welcomed the decision; however, others, such as the Australian Defence Association, expressed concerns that placing women in combat positions ‘would result in high female casualties’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022185612443780">Dodd, 2011</xref>). A full implementation plan will be considered by the Australian government in early 2012, with the policy being implemented over the next five years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022185612443780">Smith, 2011c</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0022185612443780"><title>Legislative Reform: The Sex Discrimination Act, Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act and Paid Parental Leave</title>
<p>Three pieces of legislation important to determining the formal framework in which women and men participate as workers and citizens were under review or consolidated in 2011. The consolidation of federal anti-discrimination legislation was further progressed and amendments to the Paid Parental Leave Act 2010 were introduced, but progress on the review of EOWA was slow, without anticipated changes being introduced to parliament in 2011.</p>
<sec id="sec7-0022185612443780"><title>Federal Anti-discrimination Legislation</title>
<p>Two initiatives relating to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (SD Act) occurred in 2011. The Sex and Age Discrimination Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 became law in June 2011, making changes to the SD Act (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022185612443780">Baird and Williamson, 2011</xref>) and creating the post of Age Discrimination Commissioner. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee (the Committee) noted that the submissions received (30 in all) were ‘overwhelmingly supportive’ of the Bill (Senate, 2011: 40). In recognition of the large number who also considered that the legislation should have ‘gone further to implement all of the recommendations’ of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022185612443780">Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs’ (Senate 2008)</xref> <italic>Report into the Effectiveness of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 in Eliminating Discrimination and Promoting Gender Equality</italic> (hereafter the 2008 Report), the Committee recommended that the government ‘consider, as part of the consolidation project all [the 2008 Report’s] outstanding recommendations’ (Senate 2011: 42).</p>
<p>The opposition successfully opposed one significant amendment proposed in the Bill, with the support of Senator Xenophon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022185612443780"><italic>Workplace Express</italic>, 2011a</xref>). This amendment would have prohibited indirect discrimination on the grounds of family responsibilities (in addition to the existing prohibition on direct discrimination). The effect of the amendment would have enabled a father to contest a work condition, such as refusing him flexible working, where this is likely to disadvantage those with family responsibilities such as parents. Men are currently unable to do this, whereas a woman can by claiming indirect sex discrimination on the basis that such a refusal effectively disadvantages women who predominantly care for children and need such arrangements. This is a lost opportunity to signal the importance of men’s participation in care to men themselves and employers/organizations, and to contribute to some degree to promoting men’s care role. It highlights the need to increase understanding of the importance of workplaces in shaping gender relations, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022185612443780">Williams (2010)</xref> points out, and the critical importance of changes such as this.</p>
<p>In 2010, the Australian government had announced its intention to consolidate the four federal anti-discrimination laws (the Age Discrimination Act 2004 (AD Act), the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (DD Act), the SD Act and the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (RD Act)) into one piece of legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022185612443780">Baird and Williamson, 2011</xref>). After requests for a wider consultation prior to the release of draft legislation, a discussion paper was published in September 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022185612443780">Attorney-General’s Department, 2011</xref>) calling for submissions by 1 February 2012, and consultations have been conducted by the government. While not the far-reaching public inquiry recommended by the 2008 Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022185612443780">Senate, 2008</xref>: 56, 165), it has provided for some public voice in the process of reform.</p>
<p>The government states that it is committed to not reducing current protections, to ‘clarifying and enhancing protections where appropriate’, to improving complaints resolution mechanisms and to considering how to support business better in complying with discrimination laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022185612443780">Attorney-General’s Department, 2011</xref>: 6). The paper seeks views on a range of issues, including how to define the proposed new grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. Other attributes are discussed for coverage, including extending protection to victims of domestic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022185612443780">Attorney-General’s Department, 2011</xref>: 24), supported by the AHRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022185612443780">AHRC, 2011d</xref>: 24). Existing religious exemptions included in the SD Act (and to a lesser extent in the AD Act), but not the RD Act or the DD Act, will not be removed and may be extended to the two new grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022185612443780">Attorney-General’s Department, 2011</xref>: 40). Among the numerous issues covered, the paper does not address the 2008 Report’s view that there should be increased legal aid and similar funding for discrimination cases in view of the ‘almost insuperable difficulties’ faced by individual claimants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022185612443780">Senate, 2008</xref>: 155–157).</p>
<p>Also of significance for women, given the preponderance of women among part-time employees (70% are women; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185612443780">ABS, 2011b</xref>), is that Australia ratified the International labour Organisation (ILO) Convention 175 in July 2011. This requires part-time employees to receive the same protection as comparable full-time workers, including in relation to discrimination, wages, maternity and employment protection, as well as paid annual, public and sick leaves. As the government considers that it already complies with the Convention obligations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185612443780">Australian Treaty National Interest Analysis (ATNIA), 2010</xref>), it seems to propose no action on the less favourable treatment that part-time workers face in some industrial instruments.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0022185612443780"><title>Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act</title>
<p>In March 2011, the Hon. Kate Ellis MP (then Minster for the Status of Women) announced the new Director of the EOWA agency as Ms Helen Conway. Ms Conway has considerable experience in leadership positions in the private sector and was a Senior Judicial Member of the New South Wales Equal Opportunity Tribunal. Coinciding with the announcement, Minister Ellis outlined a funding increase for the Agency and changes to EOWA in order to deliver greater gender equality at work for men and women and to improve female workforce participation: ‘EOWA is a key part of the Government’s plans to improve choices for women and men and better utilising the significant untapped productivity potential in women’s workforce participation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022185612443780">Ellis, 2011a</xref>). As part of the changes, the Agency will be renamed the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. The objects of the Act will be amended to acknowledge the caring responsibilities of both women and men – an important recognition of men’s caring role and its impact in the workplace. A new reporting framework will also be developed with an emphasis on outcomes. Businesses will now be required to report on the gender composition of their organizations and their boards, and on the use of flexible work practices and other policies by both men and women. Employers will be required to report on pay equity, and stronger compliance measures are to be introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022185612443780">Ellis, 2011b</xref>). Changes to the legislation were due to be introduced to Parliament in 2011, but are now expected before Parliament in early 2012.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-0022185612443780"><title>Paid Parental Leave and ‘Dad and Partner Pay’</title>
<p>After a year of operation, the Government reported over ‘126,000 expectant and new parents have applied for the [parental leave] payment …. [and] more than 65,000 have already finished receiving [it] … Half of the mothers who have received payments earned less than $43,000 in the year before their baby was born or adopted … … [and] more than 22,000 employers have registered to provide Government-funded parental leave pay to their eligible employees’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022185612443780">Macklin, 2012</xref>)</p>
<p>It was this payroll function that threatened to derail the government’s intention that the payment should be made through an employee’s normal pay cycle (subject to certain employer rights to opt out in the case of short-term employees) and be linked to their workplace. Employer opposition to this arrangement led the government to adjust the start date for their new role to 1 July 2011, although employers could assume it voluntarily before then. Until that date, the payment was made to employees through the Family Assistance Office. The Hon. Bruce Billson MP, the Shadow Minister for Small Business, Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, had introduced a private members’ bill to make this situation permanent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022185612443780">Baird and Williamson, 2011</xref>). This was defeated by one vote in February 2011. It is expected that the opposition will try again to remove this arrangement during debate on the Paid Parental Leave and Other Legislation Amendment (Consolidation) Bill 2011 (PPL Amendment Bill) introduced into Parliament in November (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022185612443780"><italic>Workplace Express</italic>, 2011b</xref>) and due for debate in early 2012.</p>
<p>The PPL Amendment Bill makes largely technical amendments to the Paid Parental Leave Act 2010 (PPL Act) and also amends the Fair Work Act 2009. For employees, the most important changes relate to the keeping in touch (KIT) days, when an employee can perform up to 10 days’ paid work to keep in touch with her employment and ease her eventual return to work but not lose her parental leave pay entitlement. The PPL Amendment Bill proposes changes to prohibit a KIT day within 42 rather than 14 days (as now) of the birth unless it is suggested by the employee and is not within 14 days of the birth. This is to ‘allow sufficient time after the birth of a child for the mother to recover physically and will enable an uninterrupted six-week period for the caring parent to bond with the child’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022185612443780">Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, 2011</xref>: 5).</p>
<p>The proposed Fair Work Act changes will confirm that KIT days may be worked during unpaid parental leave and will not break its continuity (or extend unpaid leave). The definition of a KIT day is similar to that in the PPL Act. Until these changes are enacted, taking advantage of the KIT days may contravene the requirements in the Fair Work Act that unpaid parental leave be taken in a single continuous period (s. 71(2) and s. 72(2) of the Fair Work Act). As McCarthy et al. (2011: 207) note, working a KIT day could technically deprive an employee of her right to the rest of her unpaid leave. A further 10 KIT days will be available during any further unpaid parental leave granted under the right to request provisions (s. 76 of the Fair Work Act). Other changes include enabling a pregnant employee (with her employer’s consent) to begin her unpaid parental leave prior to the current six weeks before the expected birth, adjusting return to work arrangements in the case of a stillbirth or infant death, and providing information rights to a temporary maternity leave cover employee.</p>
<p>The opposition leader, Tony Abbott, confirmed in May that the opposition remains committed to its 2010 election promise of 26 weeks’ paid parental leave at full income replacement subject to an earnings cap of AU$75,000 during the six months prior to the birth or adoption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022185612443780"><italic>Workplace Express</italic>, 2011c</xref>). This cap is the same as for the existing scheme. It will remain at this level longer than originally planned, as the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2011 amended the PPL Act 2010 to postpone the date when indexing the income limit beyond which an employee cannot receive PPL (currently AU$150,000 per annum) begins, from 30 June 2012 to 30 June 2014.</p>
<p>The two weeks of ‘Dad and Partner Pay’ originally promised for July 2012 will now be available for a child born from 1 January 2013, to fathers and partners (including adoptive parents and same-sex partners) who share care of the child. The government policy document (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022185612443780">Australian Government, 2011c</xref>) issued in September 2011 outlined the scheme and sought comments. The payment’s eligibility criteria and payment level (the minimum wage, worth AU$1178.80 before tax) will be the same as for paid parental leave and is independent of the mother’s employment status. Unlike the latter, it cannot be taken when the employee is taking other paid leave, including any employer partner pay. This is to encourage more partner leave to be taken. Unfortunately, the policy does not propose a concurrent right to two weeks’ unpaid leave for those ineligible for unpaid parental leave under the Fair Work Act (i.e. where an employee has less than 12 months’ service with their employer prior to the birth) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185612443780">Baird and Stewart, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The payment will not be transferable to the primary carer, and the government intends this ‘use it or lose it’ provision to encourage fathers to take time off and ‘signals to employers that a father’s role in caring for a new baby is important’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185612443780">Australian Government, 2011b</xref>: 1). It may be taken (in one block) at any time during the first 12 months after the birth or adoption. As with paid parental leave, employers need not pay superannuation contributions, nor will workers’ compensation premia be payable and no additional leave entitlements will accrue. The government has decided that employers will not be required to take on the pay administrator role for transmitting the payment to eligible employees (unlike for paid parental leave). However, it seeks comments about a possible voluntary role for employers in relation to the payment’s delivery. Although a modest payment, the government hopes it will help fathers and partners ‘support new mothers in their caring role’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185612443780">Australian Government, 2011b</xref>: 1) and promote bonding with their children, which will increase their involvement in later years. It is also intended to send a message to employers of the importance of fathers’ care responsibilities at this time.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec10-0022185612443780" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Over the last four years, there has been considerable change in policy affecting women’s working conditions and a new policy platform is now operating in Australia. This last year has also seen a slight shift in policy emphasis away from a focus on women only, to addressing men’s time at work and gender relations more fully. These changes are necessary if gendered working and caring norms are to change. The attention to the impact of organizational policies on men <italic>and</italic> women proposed in the Workplace Gender Equality Act, the introduction of designated paid paternity leave and the growing recognition that elder care responsibilities fall on both male and female employees and that both require more flexible work arrangements, are all indicative of a shift, albeit slight, in approach. Such policy developments are useful and indeed essential if organizations are to be propelled to shift the masculinist model of work that continues to pervade most workplaces. Policy areas that remain to be addressed more directly are flexible working arrangements, women and leadership, sex discrimination and harassment, and precarious and insecure work.</p></sec>
