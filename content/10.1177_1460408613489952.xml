<abstract>
<p>Blunt splenic injuries are a common management problem facing general surgeons. It has been suggested that management of blunt splenic injuries should take into account the presence of active bleeding and the Organ Injury Scale (OIS grade); where active bleeding is more significant with OIS grade IV and V injuries. This paper aims to review our management of blunt splenic injuries with active bleeding in the haemodynamically stable patient. The trauma databases of two tertiary referral centres in Queensland were reviewed for patients admitted with blunt abdominal injuries since 2006. The management of patients with splenic injury and active bleeding was reviewed. A total of 173 patients were admitted after 2006. Twenty-six of these patients had active bleeding and nine were treated conservatively. Four patients failed conservative management and required further intervention. Three patients with OIS grades IV or V were managed conservatively and failed this management requiring further intervention. Our results indicate that conservative management is not possible for OIS grades IV and V injuries. Furthermore, splenic artery embolisation augments the success of conservative management and reduces the need for splenectomy. These findings are consistent with the current literature suggesting that management of blunt splenic injury must take into consideration factors other than the Organ Injury Scale.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1460408613489952" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Blunt splenic injury is a common problem faced by the trauma or general surgeon. In patients presenting to emergency departments with blunt abdominal injuries and organ injury; one-third will have a splenic injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408613489952">Davis et al., 1975</xref>). The current process in trauma centres around the world is to differentiate operative and non-operative management on the basis of the patient's haemodynamical stability. In the modern era, ‘Non-operative management of blunt adult… splenic injuries is the treatment modality of choice in haemodynamically stable patients…’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408613489952">Alonso et al., 2003</xref>). A meta-analysis aimed at determining outcomes of non-operative management in adult patients with blunt splenic injury showed that 68.4% of patients are managed non-operatively, while 31.6% of patients with blunt splenic injury are managed operatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408613489952">Requarth et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Non-operative management of blunt splenic injury has been optimised with the use of splenic artery embolisation. In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408613489952">Wei et al. (2008)</xref> angioembolisation was used when, on computer tomography (CT), there was evidence of ongoing bleeding characterised by contrast extravasation and/or the presence of a pseudoaneurysm, or for high-grade injuries with a large haemoperitoneum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408613489952">Wei et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408613489952">Wei et al. (2008)</xref> went on to conclude that there was an overall 16% reduction in the need for operative management for blunt splenic injury as a direct consequence of introducing angioembolisation into their management protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408613489952">Wei et al., 2008</xref>). These findings were confirmed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408613489952">Sabe et al. (2009)</xref>, who noted a significant decrease in the initial operation rates and a significant improvement in the success of non-operative management for patients who received splenic artery embolisation augmenting their non-operative management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408613489952">Sabe et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Many tertiary trauma centres throughout the world have welcomed the use of splenic artery embolisation for blunt splenic trauma. Indeed some trauma centres have implemented management algorithms that specifically include the use of splenic artery embolisation for patients with CT proven contrast extravasation in an attempt to reduce the need for splenectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408613489952">Boscak and Shanmuganathan, 2012</xref>). However, the indications for splenic artery embolisation vary in these major centres. The indication for splenic artery embolisation is influenced by the haemodynamic status of the patient, the presence of contrast extravasation or pseudoaneurysm on CT scan, the severity of the splenic injury, the size of the haemoperitoneum and the patient's age. The complexities in the initial assessment of these patients have led some to comment of the apparent under-utilisation of splenic artery embolisation in some centres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408613489952">Mikocka-Walus et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>While few would argue that in the patient with life threatening hypotension and a positive FAST scan, urgent laparotomy with possible splenectomy may be indicated without a preoperative CT scan. In the trauma patient who is haemodynamically stable enough to have a CT scan, the question then arises, ‘what is the most appropriate way of managing blunt splenic trauma when there is contrast extravasation or the presence of a pseudoaneurysm in the spleen on CT scan’? Attempts to define the indications for various management options have been presented in the literature, with authors going to great lengths to explain the rationale for having different management options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408613489952">Madoff et al., 2005</xref>). That being said, some authors may argue that the available data do not allow us to deal comprehensively with the issue of contrast extravasation freely into the peritoneum, or the presence of pseudoaneurysm on CT and its relationship to the need for and role of angiography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408613489952">Requarth et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the management of patients with blunt splenic trauma at the Princess Alexandra Hospital and Royal Brisbane Hospital, and in particular to examine the outcomes of blunt splenic injury with CT evident contrast extravasation or pseudoaneurysm formation. In doing so, we will attempt to clarify how patients with blunt splenic trauma and contrast extravasation or pseudoaneurysm on CT scan should best be managed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1460408613489952" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<p>Data were collected from the trauma database of the Princess Alexandra Hospital from the commencement of the trauma database in July 2008, until 31 December 2011 and the Royal Brisbane Hospital trauma database from June 2006, until 2 June 2012. Patients were selected on the basis of a splenic injury being present during the episode of admission. For the purposes of data collection and analysis there were no exclusion criteria in the patients selected.</p>
<p>Data analysed included the patient's age, gender and Organ Injury Scale (OIS: Spleen). Patients were then selected on the basis of whether they were haemodynamically stable enough to have a CT scan as part of their initial investigations. CT scans of all patients were done from the emergency department as part of the trauma assessment. All CT scans were done with intravenous contrast with arterial phase at the level of the spleen if possible. All CT reports and films were reviewed to determine whether there was any evidence of contrast extravasation indicating active bleeding, or pseudoaneurysm formation. The outcome of these patients was then reviewed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1460408613489952" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>The trauma database demonstrated that 209 patients were admitted under the trauma service with a blunt splenic injury between 12 June 2006 and 2 June 2012. Blunt splenic injury was defined as any splenic injury sustained from trauma to the person that did not include breaching the abdominal compartment. Patient demographic data are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1460408613489952">Table 1</xref>.

<p>Of the 209 patients admitted with blunt splenic injuries, 36 were excluded from this review on the basis that they did not receive a CT scan prior to the implementation of management. These patients were either taken to theatre without prior imaging or admitted and the blunt splenic injury was identified sometime after 24 h. The remaining 173 patients had a CT scan and management was initiated within 24 h based, in part, on the CT findings. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1460408613489952">Table 2</xref> demonstrates the findings on CT based on OIS grade. Admission CT scans did not demonstrate contrast extravasation in two patients who later had CT scans indicating ongoing bleeding. These patients were excluded from the analysis but are mentioned below.

<p>Contrast extravasation was noted in 26 of the 173 CT reports (15%). The initial management of these 26 patients was analysed. It was noted that nine (35%) were initially managed conservatively and admitted to a monitored high-dependency ward for observation, three (12%) underwent splenic artery embolisation within the first 24 h of admission, and 14 (54%) underwent laparotomy with splenectomy within the first 24 h of admission.</p>
<p>Of the nine patients with contrast extravasation on CT scan who were initially managed conservatively, four failed conservative management and required intervention with either splenic artery embolisation or splenectomy. Of these four patients, one required splenic artery embolisation while three more required splenectomy. This represents a 44% failure rate in conservative management of splenic injuries with proven contrast extravasation.</p>
<p>When examining the data in respect to OIS grading it was noted that of the nine patients who had contrast extravasation and were treated conservatively, there were six who had an OIS of I to III and three who had an OIS of IV or V. For those with an OIS of I to III there was only one patient who failed conservative management and required intervention, while all three patients who had an OIS of IV or V failed conservative management and required intervention. This represents a failure rate of 17% in OIS I to III while an absolute failure (100%) in OIS IV or V injuries at our centres.</p>
<p>In our series of 173 patients with blunt splenic injury, only five patients (19%) out of 26 with contrast extravasation on initial CT scan were successfully treated conservatively while 21 (81%) required intervention; four (15%) required splenic artery embolisation and 17 (65%) required splenectomy.</p>
<p>Of interest is the fact that our series identified two patients whose initial CT report did not clearly report contrast extravasation but who went on to have further CT scans after 24 h where contrast extravasation was seen. Both of these patients went on to have splenic artery embolisation and were successfully managed non-operatively.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1460408613489952" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>It has been established in the literature that splenic artery embolisation has improved the success of non-operative management of splenic injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408613489952">Sabe et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408613489952">Requarth et al. (2011)</xref> demonstrated in their meta-analysis that failure rates in non-operative management can be significantly reduced if there is appropriate use of splenic embolisation for those with OIS IV or V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408613489952">Requarth et al., 2011</xref>). Failure rates in OIS I to III were not significantly different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408613489952">Requarth et al., 2011</xref>). The results in our patient population would seem to support these findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408613489952">Requarth et al. (2011)</xref>. In our review, of the 26 patients who demonstrated contrast extravasation on initial CT scan, nine were managed conservatively. Six had an OIS of I to III, and three had an OIS of IV to V. Of the six patients with contrast extravasation on initial CT scan with OIS of I to III who were managed conservatively, only one patient failed management and went on to require required splenectomy. In contrast, only three patients were treated conservatively with OIS IV to V and all three of these patients failed management with one requiring splenic artery embolisation and two requiring splenectomy. It would seem from these few patients that conservative management of a patient with contrast extravasation on initial CT scan is more likely to fail if their OIS is IV to V.</p>
<p>An interesting retrospective study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408613489952">Cohen et al. (2009)</xref> indicated that the presence of contrast extravasation (of &gt;1 cm) was an independent predictor of requiring intervention, either embolisation or surgery, with a specificity of 0.92 (±0.07). Unfortunately, the authors did not independently examine the specificity of the haemodynamically stable patient with contrast extravasation and then whether, in the haemodynamically stable patient, embolisation can be utilised to avoid surgery. This study remains of interest as it would suggest that the decision to intervene in patients with splenic injury can be made on the basis of active bleeding in isolation of the OIS score. The data presented in this review would suggest that intervening in patients with contrast extravasation on CT regardless of OIS score would subject many patients to unnecessary interventions. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408613489952">Cohen et al. (2009)</xref> indicate, the importance of contrast extravasation should not be under-estimated and must be taken into consideration when planning patient management.</p>
<p>The review of our experience has also demonstrated that the use of splenic artery embolisation, when done appropriately, can reduce the risk of non-operative management failure and prevent the need for splenectomy. All of our patients who had splenic artery embolisation, whether within the first 24 h after failure of observational management, or in the two cases where contrast extravasation began some days after admission, no patient required further intervention or splenectomy. This supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408613489952">Wei et al.'s (2008)</xref> conclusion that splenic artery embolisation increases the success of non-operative management and reduces the need for operation in splenic injuries.</p>
<p>In reviewing the management of blunt splenic injury at our centres, it was noted that splenic artery embolisation was rarely utilised in the acute management of our patients. While the use of endovascular arterial embolisation has become more common at both centres over the course of the study period, in the setting of acute splenic injury it is still a modality of treatment that is not utilised as much as might be desired. While non-operative management of blunt splenic injury is a growing trend, and the use of splenic artery embolisation is commonplace in the literature, the under-utilisation of embolisation has been noted in other Australian tertiary trauma centres. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408613489952">Mikocka-Walus et al. (2010)</xref> concluded that embolisation was under-utilised in Victorian trauma hospitals where only 17 of 300 patients presenting with blunt splenic injury received embolisation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408613489952">Mikocka-Walus et al. (2010)</xref> suggested that a reason for the under-utilisation of embolisation may be that patients with low-grade injuries are managed conservatively while patients with high-grade injuries and/or multiple abdominal injuries proceed to the operating theatre and were more likely to have a splenectomy.</p>
<p>The purpose of this review of our database was to revisit how we manage splenic injuries when there is evidence of ongoing bleeding in the form of contrast extravasation on CT. Research into this area has evolved significantly, with new modalities contributing to the improvement in patient care; however, there is no established consensus as to how we should manage active bleeding in blunt splenic injury. It has been our experience that when there is contrast extravasation and an OIS of IV or V, then intervention is required. Observational management in these patients did not succeed and resulted in the need for intervention in all patients with OIS IV and V injuries. In the setting of an OIS of I to III the outcome is less clear; however, we know that overall 15% of these patients required intervention.</p>
<p>A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408613489952">Boscak and Shanmuganathan (2012)</xref> has attempted to provide structured algorithms in the management of blunt splenic injury. These algorithms indicate that in the case of blunt abdominal trauma, a stable patient should proceed to CT scan and that management should be determined on the basis of both Splenic OIS grade and the presence or absence of active bleeding as indicated by contrast extravasation. On this basis, embolisation is the preferred management choice when active bleeding is identified and observational management preferred in the absence of active bleeding. Similar to these algorithms, and in consideration to the current literature, it may be beneficial to our population group to establish management protocols and to utilise the current management modalities. It could be suggested that stable patients with OIS Grade I to III injuries with contrast extravasation proven on CT scan could be managed conservatively and be admitted to a high-dependence unit for observation. Our review would further suggest that stable patients with an OIS Grade IV or V injury are more likely to fail observational management and early intervention would likely improve patient outcome. Splenic artery embolisation is an effective treatment modality in this patient group and, as demonstrated, is an under-utilised treatment option. Furthermore, as splenectomy subjects the patient to a lifelong risk of serious medical complications, splenic artery embolisation would be the intervention of choice and may improve the overall morbidity of patients with blunt splenic injury.</p>
