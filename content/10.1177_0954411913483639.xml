<abstract>
<p>The occurrence of pseudotumours (soft tissue masses relating to the hip joint) following metal-on-metal hip resurfacing arthroplasty has been associated with higher than normal bearing wear and high serum metal ion levels although both these findings do not necessarily coexist. The purpose of this study was to examine patient activity patterns and their influence on acetabular component edge loading in a group of subjects with known serum metal ion levels. Fifteen subjects with metal-on-metal hip resurfacing arthroplasty (eight males and seven females) were recruited for motion analysis followed by computed tomography scans. They were divided into three groups based on their serum metal ion levels and the orientation of their acetabular component: well-positioned acetabular component with low metal ions, mal-positioned acetabular component with low metal ions and mal-positioned acetabular component with high ions. A combination of motion analysis, subject-specific modelling (AnyBody Modeling System, Aalborg, Denmark) and computed tomography measurements was used to calculate <italic>dynamically</italic> the contact patch-to-rim distance for each subject during gait and sit-to-stand. The contact-pitch-to-rim distance for the high ion group was significantly lower (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) than for the two low ion groups (well-positioned and mal-positioned) during the stance phase of gait (0%–60%) and loading phase of sit-to-stand (20%–80%). The results of this study, in particular, the significant difference between the two mal-positioned groups, suggest that wear of metal-on-metal hip resurfacing arthroplasty is not only affected by acetabular cup orientation but also influenced by individual patient activity patterns.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The current generation of devices for metal-on-metal hip resurfacing arthroplasty (MoMHRA) was reintroduced because it was hoped that the lower wear rates associated with these devices would reduce the risk of long-term wear-induced osteolysis that can cause the failure of metal-on-plastic (MoP) bearings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411913483639">1</xref></sup> Well-functioning metal-on-metal (MoM) hip implants show annual linear wear rates of less than 5 µm for the whole articulation per year;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411913483639">2</xref></sup> however, when lubrication is not optimal, the wear rate can dramatically increase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411913483639">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411913483639">4</xref></sup> (linear wear above 24 µm for the whole bearing per year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411913483639">5</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>The effects of long-term exposure to metal debris from MoM wear are largely unknown. There is concern over soft tissue reactions observed in some patients with MoMHRA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411913483639">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411913483639">7</xref></sup> These reactions have been referred to by a number of terms such as adverse reaction to metal debris (ARMD),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411913483639">8</xref></sup> aseptic lymphocytic vasculitis-associated lesions (ALVAL),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411913483639">9</xref></sup> adverse local tissue reaction (ALTR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411913483639">10</xref></sup> and pseudotumour.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411913483639">7</xref></sup> In this study, the term pseudotumour will be used. Pseudotumours can be extremely destructive, causing one or a number of symptoms such as pain, spontaneous dislocation, pathological fracture and nerve palsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411913483639">7</xref></sup> The outcome of revision of MoMHRA due to pseudotumour can be poor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411913483639">11</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Pseudotumours in patients with MoMHRA have been shown to be associated with high serum and hip aspirate levels of cobalt (Co) and chromium (Cr), the principal elements of the metal alloy used to manufacture MoMHRA implants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411913483639">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411913483639">13</xref></sup> There is evidence that systemic blood metal ion levels are a surrogate measure of wear for MoM implants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411913483639">14</xref></sup> This indicates that pseudotumours are associated with increased levels of wear. Retrieval studies have confirmed that implants revised for pseudotumour have higher wear than implants revised for other reasons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411913483639">15</xref></sup> Retrieval studies have also shown that implants revised for pseudotumour are more likely to have experienced edge loading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411913483639">16</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Primary edge loading, sometimes called rim loading, can occur when the contact between the femoral and acetabular components occurs close to the edge of the acetabular component. It is thought that edge loading may be a cause of increased wear that leads to high levels of serum Co and Cr ions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411913483639">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411913483639">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411913483639">17</xref>

–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411913483639">20</xref></sup> Low MoM wear rates associated with normal loading conditions have been attributed to the lubrication regime<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411913483639">4</xref></sup> and the formation and interaction of tribochemical reaction layers on the bearing surfaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411913483639">21</xref></sup> Edge loading is thought to disrupt the lubrication regime between components, leading to a marked increase in localized wear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411913483639">4</xref></sup> Under optimal conditions, the diametric mismatch between the femoral and acetabular components forms a ‘wedge’ that allows lubrication entrainment. Contact closer to the edge of the acetabular component prevents the formation of an effective entrainment wedge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411913483639">22</xref></sup> Steeply inclined acetabular components are thought to be at greater risk of primary edge loading. Patients with acetabular cups inclined at angles greater than 55° have been shown to have higher serum levels of Co and Cr ions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411913483639">18</xref></sup> In addition to cup orientation, contact stresses near the cup edge demonstrate a relationship with edge radius.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954411913483639">23</xref></sup> During revision of steeply inclined acetabular cups, large amounts of metallosis have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411913483639">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411913483639">18</xref></sup> Studies using hip simulators have also demonstrated that wear is increased with increased inclination angle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411913483639">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411913483639">25</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The risk of pseudotumour is reduced for a cup orientation of 45° (±10°) inclination and 20° (±10°) anteversion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954411913483639">26</xref></sup> However, this does not represent a true acetabular placement safe zone, as a small number of subjects with ‘well-placed’ components have developed pseudotumours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954411913483639">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954411913483639"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954411913483639"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954411913483639">29</xref></sup> This suggests that there are additional factors involved such as metal hypersensitivity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954411913483639">30</xref></sup> impingement and the individual’s activity patterns. Recently, subject-specific activity patterns were shown to have the capacity to reduce edge loading of steeply inclined acetabular components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0954411913483639">31</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Patients with total hip arthroplasty (THA) have been shown to spend the majority of time sitting (44.3%), followed by standing (24.5%) and walking (10.2%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954411913483639">32</xref></sup> These data indicate that a considerable number of sit-to-stand (STS) transitions occur daily. It has been estimated that healthy subjects perform STS around 60 times per day.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0954411913483639">33</xref></sup> Hip simulator studies have also shown that under simulated start-up and stopping conditions, the wear of MoM implants is increased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0954411913483639">34</xref></sup> Moreover, Wimmer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0954411913483639">35</xref></sup> showed that resting periods increase static friction causing shear force to peak during motion initiation. However, this increase in friction was thought to have no effect on wear as it was attributed to the interaction of carbon layers on the bearing surfaces formed as a result of tribochemical reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411913483639">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0954411913483639">35</xref></sup> These layers may come into contact because of a gradual loss of the lubrication layer between MoM components under static loads associated with resting (sitting or lying down).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0954411913483639">36</xref></sup> The time taken to develop adequate lubrication after a prolonged period of rest is unknown.</p>
<p>Wear of articulating orthopaedic implants is a function of the material properties of the bearing surfaces, the contact stress, the type of lubrication regime and the kinematics of the joint. Motion analysis has been used previously to examine the kinematics of the hip joint during gait in order to obtain information on the wear path in THA patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0954411913483639">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0954411913483639"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0954411913483639">39</xref></sup> The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between dynamic patterns of hip loading during functional activity and systemic metal ion levels.</p>

<title>Overview</title>
<p>Langton et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411913483639">13</xref></sup> introduced the measurement variable of contact-patch-to-rim (CPR) distance, based upon the concept of coverage arc developed by De Haan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411913483639">18</xref></sup> The measurement of CPR made by Langton et al. uses an average hip joint reaction force vector and the three–dimensional (3D) measurement of acetabular orientation from Ein-Bild-Roentgen-Analyse (EBRA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0954411913483639">40</xref></sup> measurements made on static anteroposterior (AP) pelvic radiographs. The average hip joint reaction force vector used by Langton et al. was obtained by averaging measurements taken from four patients in the standing position from the study by Bergmann et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0954411913483639">41</xref></sup> Thus, the CPR measurements made by Langton et al. are essentially static estimates of the CPR distance based on generic joint reaction force directions. The CPR value is the distance from the rim to a point at the centre of a contact patch between the femoral and acetabular components. The size and shape of this patch are dependent on a number of factors such as component size, force magnitude and lubrication.</p>
<p>This study used a combination of motion analysis, subject-specific modelling and computed tomography (CT) measurements to calculate dynamically the CPR distance for each subject during functional activities of daily living (ADL). This study then compared the dynamic subject-specific CPR values between patients with well-placed and mal-positioned components and with low and high metal ion levels.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>A total of 158 MoMHRA patients (201 hips) had their serum metal ion levels measured in an ongoing study approved by the local ethics committee. Blood samples were collected in accordance with a previously described protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0954411913483639">42</xref></sup> Serum levels of cobalt and chromium were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ELAN DRC II; PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Shelton, CT, USA) at the Laboratory of Clinical Biology, University Hospital Ghent, Belgium. Fifteen subjects from this cohort participated in this study (eight females and seven males). These subjects had either a unilateral Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) (Smith and Nephew, Birmingham, UK) (n = 8) or a Conserve Plus (Wright Medical Technology, Memphis, TN, USA) (n = 7).</p>
<p>The subjects were divided into three groups, namely, well-positioned low ions, n = 6 (WellPosLow); mal-positioned low ions, n = 5 (MalPosLow) and mal-positioned high ions, n = 4 (MalPosHigh)) based on the orientation of the acetabular component and their serum metal ion levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411913483639">Table 1</xref>). Serum metal ion levels were considered high if they exceeded 4.4 µg/L for chromium or 4 µg/L for cobalt.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0954411913483639">43</xref></sup> Components were considered mal-positioned if they were outside 45° (±10°) inclination or 20° (±10°) anteversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954411913483639">26</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411913483639">Figure 1</xref>).

<title>Motion analysis</title>
<p>Three-dimensional lower limb motion analysis was conducted using a motion analysis laboratory equipped with a 12-camera Vicon Nexus MX system (Oxford Metrics Ltd., Oxford, UK) and three force platforms (2× OR6 AMTI R6-6-1000, 1× OR6 AMTI R6-7-1000; Advanced Medical Technology Inc., MA, USA). Twenty-five 10-mm-diameter spherical retroreflective markers were attached to anatomical landmarks in an established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0954411913483639">44</xref></sup> marker configuration, with extra markers on the medial femoral condyles of the implanted limb, on the tibial tuberosities, on the medial malleoli, on the distal fifth and first metatarsals and without any greater trochanter markers.</p>
<p>Kinematic data were collected with a sampling rate of 100 Hz, and force plate data were collected at 1000 Hz. The subjects’ motion was measured during level walking and STS activities. All subjects walked at self-selected normal pace. For the STS activity, the subjects were seated on a bench of height 550 mm with each foot on a force platform. Subjects were then asked to stand with their arms folded across their chests in order to obtain repeatable motions between subjects. All subjects carried out each activity at least six times.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0954411913483639">
<title>CT scans</title>
<p>Directly following the motion analysis, CT scans (Siemens Somatom, Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., NY, USA) of each subject’s pelvis and lower limbs were obtained. In order to ensure registration of internal implant positions to the skin-based motion analysis markers, the retroreflective motion analysis markers were replaced with radio-opaque markers. These multi-modality markers (MM3002; Intermark Medical Innovations, Ltd., Bromley, Kent, UK) consisted of a hydrogel component with a medical grade adhesive.</p>
<p>SliceOmatic (Version 4.2 Rev-9b, TomoVision; Virtual Magic Inc., Montreal, QC, Canada) was used to determine the 3D coordinates of multi-modality markers, the anatomical pelvic landmarks, the MoMHRA prosthesis components and the centre of the hip joint within the CT coordinate system.</p>

<sec id="section7-0954411913483639">
<title>Musculoskeletal modelling</title>
<p>Each subject was modelled performing gait and STS activities in the AnyBody Modeling System (v.5.0) (AnyBody Technology, A/S, Denmark). The model-incorporated subject-specific hip joint centres (HJC) calculated for the implanted side by selecting six points from the CT scan on the edge of the acetabular component and fitting a plane to the open face of the component. The average centre of three circles fitted through the six points was projected out from the acetabular component to a distance determined by each patient’s component size and component coverage angle. This point represented the centre of the congruent spheres that represent both the outer surface of the femoral component and the inner surface of the acetabular component. All calculations were, therefore, carried out under the assumption that no further separation, other than clearance, occurred between the components during activity. All Conserve Plus implants were modelled with an acetabular component with a coverage angle of 170° and a diametrical clearance of 173 µm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411913483639">17</xref></sup> The coverage angle for BHR acetabular components was dependent on the size of the implant and varied from 159.1° to 166.2° (Board &amp; Walter, BHS 2009).

<p>On the unimplanted side, the HJC was taken as the centre of a sphere fitted to the femoral head. Subject-specific hip joint contact forces were calculated for each frame of motion captured data. The musculoskeletal model used a three-stage procedure. First, the patient-specific joint kinematics were estimated based on a stick-figure model constructed from the standing reference frame and the estimated HJCs. Second, the Twente lower extremity model (TLEM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0954411913483639">46</xref></sup> implemented in the AnyBody Managed Model Repository v.1.2 was non-linearly morphed using radial basis functions (RBF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0954411913483639">46</xref></sup> to match the segment lengths and joint parameters of the stick-figure model.

<p>An acetabular coordinate system (ACS) was determined for each subject using points defined on the edge of their acetabular component from the CT images. The HJC, offset from the face of the component as a result of the coverage angle, was used as the origin for this coordinate system. The AnyBody hip joint contact forces were then transformed into this coordinate system.</p>
<p>The location of the intersection of the hip contact force with the inner surface of the acetabular component was then calculated by scaling it by the inner acetabular component radius. This point was assumed to be the centre of the contact patch between the two components. A vector in-plane with the hip contact force vector that intersected with the edge of the acetabular component was then found. The angle in radians between these vectors was found by calculating the inverse cosine of the dot product of their unit vectors. The distance from the intersection of the hip contact force vector with the acetabular component and the component’s edge was determined by multiplying this angle by the inner radius of the component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411913483639">Figure 3</xref>).

However, the calculated forces for gait were most comparable to the Bergmann measured forces at the beginning of the stance phase.

Towards the end of the stance phase, the average force magnitude calculated by AnyBody peaked at 429% BW.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Metal ion levels are now accepted as surrogate measures of in vivo wear of MoM hip arthroplasties. High metal ion levels are associated with mal-positioning and elevated wear rates caused by edge loading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411913483639">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411913483639">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411913483639">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411913483639">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0954411913483639">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0954411913483639">48</xref></sup> However, some patients with mal-positioned components inadvertently avoid high metal ion levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954411913483639">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954411913483639">27</xref></sup> The reasons for this are unclear. Lubrication is essential for the proper functioning of MoMHRA, and MoMHRA implants exhibit increased wear when the fluid film lubrication is disturbed, which typically occurs under edge-loading conditions. Contact closer to the edge of the acetabular component reduces the potential for lubrication entrainment or the formation of an effective entrainment wedge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411913483639">22</xref></sup> It is thought that the disruption of lubrication caused by edge loading prevents the formation of protective tribo-layers at the bearing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411913483639">19</xref></sup> Edge loading occurs either when the acetabular component is implanted with a steep orientation (&gt;55°) (primary edge loading) or when impingement at the neck–cup junction leads to contrecoup edge loading on weight bearing (secondary edge loading).</p>
<p>In this study, we examined a group of 15 MoMHRA subjects, 5 of whom had mal-positioned acetabular cups but low serum metal ion levels. The risk of edge loading during gait and STS was assessed by computing the dynamic CPR distance. There were statistically significant differences (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) in CPR distance between the MalPosLow and MalPosHigh groups for the lowest 10% of values during gait and STS. These results suggest that the subjects in the MalPosLow group have motion patterns that insulate their acetabular component from elevated wear rates caused by edge loading. Interpreting the results of this study in this way could also explain why some patients with well-positioned cups demonstrate high serum metal ion levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954411913483639">27</xref></sup> The motion patterns that potentially exert this influence over component wear are a result of anatomy and subject-specific kinematics.</p>
<p>The findings in this study agree with Langton et al. who found a significant inverse correlation between (static standing) CPR and serum metal ion levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411913483639">13</xref></sup> Langton et al. observed reduced serum cobalt or chromium when the contact patch was more than 10 mm from the rim.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411913483639">13</xref></sup> Similarly, in this study, the mean CPR for the MalPosHigh group during the stance phase of gait was 10.3 mm.</p>
<p>Although it has not been proven conclusively, it has been suggested that the incidence of complications associated with MoMHRA are greater for women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411913483639">22</xref></sup> However, there is no evidence to suggest that females are more likely to have a mal-positioned acetabular component, that is, a man is as likely to receive a mal-positioned cup as a woman. This indicates that mal-positioning cannot be the only factor that contributes to high wear. During the loading phase of STS, it was found that the edge-loading risk was increased for females (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002). It is possible that higher failures observed in women may be, in part, due to kinematic differences between men and women. For example, it has been shown that females exhibited greater external hip adduction and internal rotation along with hip extension moments compared to males after normalizing for body size for all self-selected walking speeds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0954411913483639">49</xref></sup> In this study, it was also found that during the loading phase of STS, the edge-loading risk was increased for subjects with a femoral component equal to or smaller than 48 mm in diameter (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). Females in this study had a median femoral component diameter of 46 mm, whereas males had a median femoral component diameter of 50 mm. Therefore, the tendency of females to receive smaller components could also put them at risk of edge loading.</p>
<p>The thresholds for levels of serum cobalt and chromium used in this study (4.4 µg/L for chromium or 4 µg/L for cobalt) to delineate ‘high’ or ‘low’ were based on previous works.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0954411913483639">44</xref></sup> The most recent (June 2012) medical device alert issued by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom suggested that patients with whole blood ion levels of greater than 7 µg/L of chromium or cobalt require close surveillance; however, it is likely that patients with levels &gt;4 µg/L for either Cr or Co are at increased risk of prosthesis failure secondary to increased wear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411913483639">22</xref></sup> The MHRA states that cross-sectional imaging should carry more weight in decision-making processes than blood metal ion levels alone. This increases the difficulty in relating wear and serum metal ion levels of cobalt and chromium, chiefly because the ways the human body deals with metal wear particulate are not fully understood. To date, only one member of the MalPosHigh group, and none of the MalPosLow or WellPosLow group, has been revised due to pseudotumour.</p>
<p>The results in this study did not show evidence of the hip contact force passing through the ‘edge’ of the acetabular component for any of the subjects analysed, that is, 0 mm CPR. However, the calculations carried out were based on the assumption that the hip contact force vector passed through a point, which represented the centre of a contact patch between the femoral and acetabular components. The size and shape of this patch are determined by the force magnitude, the size/geometry/material properties of the components, the clearance between the components and the lubrication (or lack thereof). This represents an extremely complex contact condition that was beyond the scope of this study to model. Furthermore, the point that we defined as the ‘edge’ does not exist as a distinct locus due to presence of a fillet at the inner surface of the acetabular cup. The radius of this fillet varies between component sizes and between manufacturers, and information on the radius of this feature is difficult to obtain. However, despite these limitations, using dynamic CPR analysis and serum metal ion levels as a surrogate measure for wear, it could be hypothesized that during the stance phase of gait, a contact patch on the inner surface of the acetabular component, caused by forces within 8–10 mm from the ‘edge’, is of sufficient size to induce edge loading.</p>
<p>There are a number of other limitations to this study that must be taken into account. For example, the mal-positioned with high ions group had only four subjects, three of whom were females. This group also had the smallest component sizes. This gender bias did not appear to affect the CPR calculations during gait, but during STS they may have had an influence. The numbers of subjects with well-positioned components that have developed pseudotumours are small.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954411913483639">26</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954411913483639"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954411913483639">29</xref></sup> We were unable to recruit a well-positioned with high metal ion levels group to further test the hypotheses that edge loading is in part mediated by patient-specific motion patterns. Another limitation was the lack of specific information on coverage angle for different sizes of Conserve Plus acetabular components. The value of 170° was taken from information provided by Wright, the manufacturer of the Conserve Plus. However, Griffin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0954411913483639">51</xref></sup> suggest that the coverage angle for the Conserve Plus is in the range of 162°–165°. This means that CPR may have been overestimated for subjects with a Conserve Plus. Finally, the methodology presented here cannot account for impingement at the neck–cup junction that leads to contrecoup edge loading (secondary edge loading)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411913483639">22</xref></sup> or the influence of micro-separation;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0954411913483639">52</xref></sup> both phenomena alter the magnitude and direction of the hip contact force vector and elevate wear rates.</p>
<p>The risk of edge loading is an issue for not only MoMHRA but also other ‘hard-on-hard’ bearing combinations such as ceramic-on-ceramic. Edge loading with ceramic-on-ceramic devices is associated with ‘stripe-wear’ and ‘squeaking’.<sup>53</sup> Currently, recommended values for acetabular component position are applied broadly across patient cohorts and implant designs. The results of this study suggest that, in addition to component position, an individual’s motion patterns play an important role in wear mechanisms. The extent to which motion patterns, specific to an individual, influence wear is unclear. However, there is some suggestion that it is tied to gender. The relative path of the load vector produced as a result of activities such as walking and standing from a chair is variable and dependent upon kinematics. Edge loading not only depends on component position but also on a patient’s activity pattern. This variability may explain how a relatively steeply inclined acetabular component remains unaffected by edge loading, and some patients with mal-positioned cups do not develop a pseudotumour.</p>
