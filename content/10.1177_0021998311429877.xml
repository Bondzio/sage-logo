<abstract>
<p>This study presents the development of fabrication techniques and experimental measurements of out-of-plane fiber waviness in a continuous fiber-reinforced polymer composite. Literature on characterization and fabrication techniques was briefly reviewed. Three fabrication methods were developed: the transverse-strip method, ply-drop method, and constant-thickness ply-drop method. Experimental characterization demonstrated that specimens with a range of waviness parameters can be easily manufactured. The most important features of the techniques are ease of fabrication and simplicity of experimental setup. An industrial part was characterized optically to validate the techniques, showing a maximum misalignment angle of 5.3°.</p>

<p>Industrial composite components may involve a number of stress concentrators within the material structure, such as manufacturing induced defects including fiber waviness (FW) and resin-rich areas. The presence of such defects is detrimental to the service life of the components as it can lead to a very significant reduction in mechanical performance, such as compressive strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311429877">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311429877"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311429877"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311429877"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311429877">5</xref></sup> Knock-down factors are usually used to account for such detrimental effects during composites design. However, these are highly empirical and difficult to determine accurately, which hinders wider applications and results in conservative design with a heightened level of uncertainty and risk, especially for large structures, such as aircraft and wind turbine blades. This article focuses on fiber waviness at a mesoscale (ply level), as waviness parameters at this level are easier to control during manufacturing than waviness within plies.</p>
<p>Experimental techniques for generating representative artificial fiber waviness in a laboratory specimen were developed to facilitate understanding and investigation of its effects. The literature on experimental simulation and characterization techniques was reviewed. The artificial fiber waviness generated by the techniques was characterized experimentally. Experimental characterization on industrial composite components was carried out to validate the developed techniques. Finally, conclusions are drawn and further work is suggested.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0021998311429877"><title>Definition of fiber waviness</title>
<p>The out-of-plane waviness of a whole ply in a flat laminate is defined by waviness length <italic>λ</italic> (the maximum span of wavy fibers referenced to the nominal fiber direction, i.e., the length of the wavy region), amplitude <italic>δ</italic> (the maximum height of wavy fibers to the nominal fiber direction) and misalignment angle <italic>θ</italic> (the angle of wavy fibers inclined to the nominal fiber direction), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311429877">Figure 1</xref>. Wave severity (%) is expressed by <italic>δ/λ</italic>. As suggested by theoretical models for effects of fiber waviness on composite strength, the maximum misalignment angle <italic>θ<sub>max</sub></italic> is critical.

</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0021998311429877"><title>Review on characterization techniques</title>
<p>The simplest measuring technique is direct measurement using a protractor on micrographs or using an angular reticule in a microscope.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311429877">7</xref></sup> Among the techniques available in the literature, the Yurgartis sectioning technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311429877">8</xref></sup> has been widely used, but the Clarke CLSM (Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope) technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311429877">9</xref></sup> may be the most accurate method at the three-dimensional level of individual fibers although the opacity of carbon fibers hinders the application. Digital image analysis developed by Creighton et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311429877">10</xref></sup> (a multiple field image analysis method) and Kratmann et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311429877">11</xref></sup> (a Fourier transform misalignment analysis method) are able to significantly save characterization time by analyzing digital micrographs with low magnification.</p>
<p>There have been a number of studies on characterizing fiber waviness using non-destructive testing techniques, such as ultrasonic testing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311429877">12</xref></sup> radiographic testing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311429877">13</xref></sup> electromagnetic testing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311429877">14</xref></sup> and shearography,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311429877">15</xref></sup> but all with limitations. Among these, the ultrasonic technique developed by Smith et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311429877">12</xref></sup> was the most successful in obtaining a high-resolution waviness profile.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0021998311429877"><title>Review on fabrication techniques</title>
<p>The basic criteria for a fabrication technique to generate waviness are flatness of the laminate, ease of fabrication, controllable waviness parameters, ease of varying the maximum misalignment angle and its location, controllable volume of fiber waviness (fraction of wavy fibers relative to straight ones), uniformity of laminate thickness, and symmetry, which are challenging for all the methods reviewed.</p>
<p>Caiazzo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311429877">16</xref></sup> developed a manufacturing procedure for inducing fiber waviness within a flat laminate, which is similar to a thermoforming process. Mrse and Piggott<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311429877">17</xref></sup> used a crimping jig as a tool. Chun et al. used several sets of two half molds with curved surfaces to produce thick composites with controlled fiber waviness with various wave severities, which was similar in principle to Kuo’s method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311429877">18</xref></sup> where a sinusoidal matching mold was used. Wisnom and Atkinson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311429877">19</xref></sup> manufactured a unidirectional composite panel with a transverse out-of-plane wave using a unidirectional prepreg strip as a kink former. Khan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311429877">20</xref></sup> fabricated laminates with transverse out-of-plane waves using similar ideas to the kink former,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311429877">19</xref></sup> matching mold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311429877">18</xref></sup> and Chun et al. methods. Hsiao and Daniel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311429877">21</xref></sup> fabricated a unidirectional laminate with uniform waviness using a tape-winding method. The plies were in a sine-wave shape with relatively uniform amplitude through the thickness. They also fabricated a unidirectional laminate with graded waviness using a three-step curing method. The partially cured wavy and flat layers were sandwiched between uncured prepreg, which were then co-cured to produce a flat laminate. However, the interface between the partially cured and uncured layers may be weakened. Dayal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311429877">22</xref></sup> also developed a method with a similar principle to Hsiao and Daniel’s three-step method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311429877">21</xref></sup> To assure shear strength at the interface, double cantilever Mode I fracture tests were performed to obtain the optimal temperature for the partially cured stage.</p>
<p>Adams and Hyer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311429877">23</xref></sup> developed a three-step fabrication method of making a flat laminate with one 0° wavy layer in the mid-plane, using a thermoplastic prepreg. Based on this, Adams and Bell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998311429877">24</xref></sup> developed a single-step method for manufacturing both single-layer and multiple-layer out-of-plane waviness. It was found that it was difficult to generate a high wave severity (greater amplitude and shorter wavelength) as the applied consolidation pressure tended to flatten the wave.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0021998311429877"><title>Development of fabrication techniques</title>
<p>This section describes experimental techniques for creating fiber waviness with similar or equivalent patterns to those observed in industrial components and with relatively accurately controlled waviness parameters. The techniques are aimed at ease of fabrication and simplicity of manufacturing procedure without any sophisticated equipment, so that any researcher with a basic knowledge of manufacturing can make a laminate with fiber waviness with reasonable reproducibility.</p>
<sec id="sec6-0021998311429877" sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title>
<p>Carbon fiber reinforced prepregs (AS4/8552) from Hexcel Composites were used for this work. Nominal cured ply thickness and calculated fiber volume fraction are respectively 0.13 mm and 57.42%. The type of material was thought to be noncritical as the techniques developed aim to be generic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0021998311429877"><title>Transverse-strip method</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311429877">Figure 2</xref> shows a schematic of the transverse-strip (TS) method, which was applied to a flat 300 × 300 mm<sup>2</sup> laminate. The 0° fibers are along the <italic>x</italic>-axis. A 2-ply prepreg strip of the same material was made, 5 mm wide and 300 mm long. The strip was carefully incorporated during the layup on top of 8-plies prepreg transversely, i.e., at 90°. A further eight 0° plies were added on top and vacuum debulking was applied for every ply to reduce the gaps between the later plies (which might induce air voids within this waviness region). The laminate was then ready for vacuum bagging and autoclave curing according to the manufacturer’s recommended cure cycle. A caul plate was used on top.
<fig id="fig2-0021998311429877" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Schematic of the transverse strip method.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311429877-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The simplicity of this method and ease of applying strips with different width and thickness (to obtain various <italic>λ</italic>, <italic>δ</italic>, and <italic>θ<sub>max</sub></italic>) are advantageous. Voids and resin-rich zones may be introduced within the waviness region but this is reduced by the debulking. Another disadvantage is warpage of the laminate. This was due to residual stress caused by the asymmetry introduced by the transverse strip (induced mainly during the cool down from cure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998311429877">25</xref></sup>). As one of the criteria of this experimental technique is to create fiber waviness without altering general component dimensions, the laminates were made [90<sub>2</sub>; 0<sub>12</sub>; 90<sub>2</sub>] in an attempt to reduce warpage by increasing the transverse bending stiffness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0021998311429877"><title>Ply-drop method</title>
<p>As its name implies, ply drops of one or more transverse plies within the laminate are used to generate fiber waviness. The experimental procedure is similar to the TS method except for the width of the transverse prepreg strip, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311429877">Figure 3</xref>. A 150-mm-wide (half of the laminate length) prepreg strip was used.
<fig id="fig3-0021998311429877" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Schematic of the ply-drop method.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311429877-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The method is referred to as the transverse ply-drop method when the fiber direction of the discontinuous plies is transverse to that of the laminate, and the longitudinal ply-drop method when the discontinuous plies have the same fiber direction. The method has advantages of simplicity and ease of experimental manufacturing. However, the method produces asymmetric specimens in thickness and structure, which is suitable for 4-point or cantilever bending tests but introduces bending in axial loading tests.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0021998311429877"><title>Constant-thickness ply-drop method</title>
<p>A constant-thickness ply-drop (CPD) method was originally designed to make the specimen a constant thickness and reduce the bending under axial compression of the ply-drop method in the previous section. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311429877">Figure 4</xref> shows a schematic of the generation of fiber waviness using two discontinuous layers which are rotationally symmetric with respect to the central waviness point (where the maximum misalignment angle is). Geometrical parameters, <italic>N</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>N</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>T</italic><sub>3</sub>, <italic>λ</italic> and <italic>g</italic>, can be easily varied. A 2-ply 150 × 75 mm<sup>2</sup> 0° strip of prepreg for the constant-thickness longitudinal ply-drop (CLPD) method in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311429877">Figure 4</xref>(a) (or 90° plies for the constant-thickness transverse ply-drop (CTPD) method in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311429877">Figure 4</xref>(b)) was aligned and laid on a 6-ply 300 × 300 mm<sup>2</sup> laminate at one end. Two 150 × 150 mm<sup>2</sup> 0° plies were added and vacuum debulking was applied for every ply to reduce air trapped within the wavy region. Further 150 × 75 mm<sup>2</sup> 0° sheets were aligned at the other end of the laminate. This gives <italic>g</italic> = 0 mm. Six more 0° 150 × 150 mm<sup>2</sup> plies were added and vacuum debulking was applied after every ply. The laminate was then ready for vacuum bagging and autoclave curing. A caul plate was used on top.
<fig id="fig4-0021998311429877" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Cross-sectional views along the nominal fiber direction (<italic>x</italic>-axis) of the laminates. The discontinuous layers used to generate waviness are (a) along the nominal fiber direction; (b) transverse to the nominal fiber direction. <italic>N</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>N</italic><sub>2</sub> are the numbers of plies of wavy and discontinuous layers. <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub>, and <italic>T</italic><sub>3</sub> are respectively the thickness of the wavy layers, discontinuous layers, and base layers. <italic>g</italic> is the gap between the two discontinuous layers. <italic>λ</italic> is the length of the wavy region.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311429877-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The method produces approximately uniform thickness along the fiber direction, for axial compression or fatigue tests to reduce global bending. The position of the waviness can be easily located anywhere within the gage section, either close to the outer layers or at the mid-plane of the laminate. It also has the advantages of simplicity and ease of manufacturing, and generation of a regular waviness shape (easy characterization). There are some other advantages, such as ease of varying the volume of fiber waviness within the laminate by changing the number of wavy layers <italic>N</italic><sub>1</sub> (a relationship correlating with compression strength reduction was observed from experimental data by Adams and Bell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998311429877">24</xref></sup>), ease of making various misalignment angles by changing the number of discontinuous layers <italic>N</italic><sub>2</sub> and possibility of varying the waviness length <italic>λ</italic> by changing the gap <italic>g</italic>.</p>
<p>Importantly, the method is advantageous over the transverse-strip and ply-drop methods if the method is used to make specimens in compression or fatigue tests, as the location of the maximum misalignment angle can be always in the middle of the gage section, independent of other waviness parameters, such as the waviness length and amplitude. For simulating waviness associated with ply-drops in industrial components, the CLPD method produces a more similar structure of ply-drops to that observed than the CTPD method does, as the effective volume of resin-rich zone is smaller. However, for simulating cases without ply-drops, the CTPD method produces more representative resin-rich zones as a result of the transverse discontinuous layers. The CLPD method can produce flat laminates, whereas the CTPD method may produce severely warped laminates. However, bending effects due to nonsymmetry under compressive loading would be greater with the CLPD specimens.</p>

<sec id="sec11-0021998311429877"><title>Experimental procedure for characterizing fiber waviness</title>
<p>To characterize the fiber waviness generated experimentally, sections of the laminates manufactured in the preceding section were made into 30 mm diameter 15-mm-thick discs suitable for taking micrographs using Gurit Prime<sup>TM</sup> 20LV as a casting resin. The procedure can be found in the literature, such as Crookston.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311429877">26</xref></sup> As the fiber waviness is visible to the naked eye, polishing time can be significantly reduced.

<p>The strips were cut by hand using a pen marker and a Stanley retractable blade knife, which gave a tolerance of approximately 0.5 mm. If a 6 mm length of waviness is required, strips with a width smaller than 5 mm have to be cut using a ply cutter with a higher precision. Therefore, the TS method would then require a high precision cutter, to overcome this limitation.</p>

<p>The characterization procedure in the previous section was applied to measure the fiber waviness produced by the transverse PD method. Measured parameters are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311429877">Table 2</xref>. For the same thickness of the transverse strip, ideally the waviness parameters for the TS and PD methods should be similar. It was observed that both <italic>λ</italic> and <italic>θ<sub>max</sub></italic> are very different from those for the same thickness 0.26 mm of the strip in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311429877">Table 1</xref>, while <italic>δ</italic> is similar. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311429877">Figure 5</xref>(a), there is a nearly flat region at the peak of the waviness profile, which explains why the measured waviness length of the TS method is more than double of that of the PD method. In spite of the disadvantage of nonuniform thickness along the fiber direction, the measured data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311429877">Table 2</xref> demonstrates the viability of the PD technique for easily generating waviness with various waviness parameters.

<p>Laminates 2 and 3 were manufactured by the CLPD method with the gap <italic>g</italic> = 0 mm and 1 mm respectively. A higher <italic>θ<sub>max</sub></italic> was generated by a smaller<italic>g</italic>. Together with observations that the measured values of <italic>λ</italic> and <italic>δ</italic> are reasonably close between Laminates 3 and 6 (although <italic>λ</italic> is slightly higher for <italic>g</italic> = 2 mm as expected, and the values of <italic>δ</italic> are close to the nominal value 0.26 mm), it was inferred that for the CLPD method <italic>θ<sub>max</sub></italic> may not be altered by changing the manufacturing parameter <italic>g</italic> when it is greater than 1 mm.</p>
<p>The second manufacturing parameter, the number of the discontinuous plies <italic>N</italic><sub>2</sub> can be easily used to obtain various values of <italic>θ<sub>max</sub></italic>. Ten plies were used to generate a higher <italic>θ<sub>max</sub></italic> for Laminates 8 and 9, compared with 2 plies for Laminates 3 and 4. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998311429877">Table 3</xref> shows that for a 16-ply laminate the waviness length could be less than 6 mm, which is important when the methods are used to make compression or fatigue specimens with a recommended gauge length of 6 mm, as the waviness should be away from stress concentrations at the ends.</p>
<p>Laminates 6 and 7 were made to demonstrate that the volume of wavy fibers <italic>V<sub>FW</sub></italic> can be increased by the number of the wavy plies <italic>N</italic><sub>1</sub>. Compared with Laminates 3 and 4, Laminates 6 and 7 have similar measured waviness parameters of <italic>λ</italic>, <italic>δ</italic>, wave severity and <italic>θ<sub>max</sub></italic>.</p>
<p>One serious problem was that cavities were formed in the wavy regions on Laminates 6 and 7 due to lack of resin flow into the gap between the base and wavy layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311429877">Figure 7</xref>). The cavities found in Laminate 6 are through the width, whereas those in Laminate 7 are small and may be more appropriate to be called voids. These cavities may explain why the measured <italic>θ<sub>max</sub></italic> is slightly higher than that of Laminate 3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998311429877">Table 3</xref>), as the number of the discontinuous plies <italic>N</italic><sub>2</sub> is higher if less resin flows out of the discontinuous layers during autoclave consolidation.

<p>Another problem was that warpage was observed on laminates (4, 9, and 7) made by the CTPD method, such as Laminate 7 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311429877">Figure 8</xref>, compared with relatively flat laminates (2, 3, 6, and 8) by the CLPD method. Such warpage was thought to be due to residual stress developed during cool down. The less symmetric the fiber orientation in the lay-up sequence is, the less flat the laminate is, as shown by comparison between Laminate 7 [0<sub>2</sub>; FW<sub>10</sub>; 90<sub>2</sub>; 0<sub>2</sub>] and Laminate 4 [0<sub>6</sub>; FW<sub>2</sub>; 90<sub>2</sub>; 0<sub>6</sub>]. Residual stresses that cause such warpage can lead to fracture of the laminate when it is cut, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311429877">Figure 8</xref>(b). Warpage would cause some difficulties in preparing specimens for compression or fatigue tests (end tabbing), and also yield non-uniform stress distribution and bending under compression loading (although reduction in specimen width can mitigate such effects, see broken pieces of Laminate 7 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311429877">Figure 8</xref>(b)). Embedded layers of ±45° may be used to replace transverse layers to reduce the asymmetry in bending stiffness.

<sec id="sec16-0021998311429877"><title>Experimental characterization of fiber waviness in industrial components</title>
<p>An industrial component made of carbon/glass fiber reinforced epoxy composites was sectioned in pieces along the fiber direction to investigate the level of fiber waviness. The primary stage of characterization focuses on fiber waviness visible to the naked eye. In practice it is at the tow level (mesoscale). The characterization procedure is the same as that demonstrated in the previous section. The upper and lower curves as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311429877">Figure 9</xref> indicate that the fiber waviness is not periodic (localized waviness) and each part should be fitted separately. Each curve has two wavy segments to be fitted.

<p>Measurements expressed as waviness parameters are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0021998311429877">Table 4</xref>. Curves of Curve_2_upper and Curve_2_lower are parallel and have a longer span than the other two. The curve of Curve_1_lower has the smallest span but highest wave severity and maximum misalignment angle. No other correlation for the waviness measurements from these three inter-tow lines could be observed, even though they are in the same area. However, the cosine function can be used to fit both the curves measured from industrial components and the curves of fiber waviness generated using the techniques shown in the preceding section. This indicates that the experimental technique is able to well simulate actual waviness observed in industrial composites.

<sec id="sec17-0021998311429877"><title>Conclusions and future work</title>
<p>Three methods were developed to fabricate fiber waviness at a mesoscale. Characterization results demonstrated that various waviness parameters can be easily achieved. The maximum misalignment angle ranges from 2.3° to 30.3°. The length of the wavy region can be less than 6 mm. An industrial composite component was sectioned and observed under an optical microscope, showing a maximum misalignment angle of 5.3°. Curves of fiber waviness generated by the developed fabrication techniques followed the same cosine function used to characterize the industrial component, which implies that the techniques can reasonably well simulate actual waviness in industrial composites.</p>
<p>Ease of fabrication with basic manufacturing knowledge and simplicity of experimental setup with no delicate or sophisticated equipment are the notable advantages. The CPD method can produce relatively uniform laminate thickness, compared with the TS and PD methods, which is particularly useful for making compression specimens. One important feature of the CPD method is that the maximum misalignment angle can be always located in the centre of the gage region of the specimen, independent of all other waviness parameters and specimen dimensions. Nevertheless, the PD method can produce a similar structure as that of the ply-dropped laminated components for which mechanical performance is to be investigated, while the TS method gives a symmetric waviness curve and simulates the structure in the crimped, woven or wrinkled components.</p>
<p>Elimination of voids for some cases of the CPD method and mitigation of warpage for the CTPD method require further efforts. Other materials, such as dry fabrics, could be used to check the universality of the developed fabrication methods. The methods can be used to make specimens for further studies, such as investigation of the effects of waviness on mechanical performance of composites and validation of theoretical models. A data base linking waviness with mechanical properties could be established for virtual composites design. The initiation mechanisms of static/dynamic compressive failure will be studied using the developed fabrication techniques.</p>
