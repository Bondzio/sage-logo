<p>It is a well-rehearsed argument that parties are losing members, often at an escalating rate. While not actually threatening modern democracy, this may at the very least lead to a much less meaningful and interactive version of democratic practice. As membership organizations shrink, parties are having to rely ever more on donations from rich individuals, corporations and other large organizations, or on state funding. In addition, the declining membership organizations are making it increasingly difficult for parties to field a local presence beyond their most important target seats – even during election campaigns. Hence, the decline of the mass party is said to have led to a widening gap between politicians and voters.</p>
<p>In that context, a book investigating the motives of the remaining members, their reasons for joining a political party and their experience of membership is particularly welcome. Such research has been carried out before and has covered the UK, Denmark, Norway and Canada among others. However, what makes this particular book unique is its focus on young members and its impressive comparative scope. Previous studies of party members have tended to be single country case studies, often with great differences in the questions asked, making later comparative study difficult. The book covers 15 parties in the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Norway and Hungary. In addition, previous research has relied exclusively on quantitative questionnaire surveys. The research presented is based on a large (2,919 respondents) questionnaire survey and also face-to-face interviews of 519 party members, i.e. giving a uniquely wide and deep data set for the authors to exploit. While it could be argued that the focus on young members limits the scope of the book to some extent, the authors argue convincingly that this is justified. Not only are young people less likely to be engaged in traditional party politics than older generations, making those that are engaged particular interesting, they argue that if parties are to have a future it is to be found among their young members. Hence, understanding this group is particularly important.</p>
<p>The book draws on the existing literature on incentives for membership and activism, but argues that when looking exclusively at young members a model geared specifically at understanding their particular situation is needed. The book presents a trichotomous model for young party membership and activism. The three main ‘types’ of young members are:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Moral-minded members: those who have joined primarily for ideological reasons.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The social-minded members: those who have joined primarily to meet like-minded people and to socialize.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The professional-minded members: those who have joined primarily because they see party membership as a route to a job, either by getting elected to a public assembly (i.e. becoming a politician) or by getting a job with the party’s bureaucracy.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The authors argue that there will be significant differences in young members’ attitudes to the party, democracy and their own involvement depending on which of the three types they belong to.</p>
<p>Chapters 1 and 2 set out the background of the study and the nature of the data gathered. Chapter 3 looks at how young people became members, while Chapters 4 and 5 are studies of how membership has affected the daily lives of the subjects. Chapters 6 and 7 examine the views of young members on their party and democracy, respectively. Chapter 8 focuses on how young members see their future in their party and Chapter 9 summarizes the book’s findings.</p>
<p>In the context of a seemingly unstoppable decline in membership numbers and election turnout, one might perhaps be excused for thinking that a positive conclusion is not very likely and, indeed, the book does not exactly end on a light note. The authors conclude that while many young members are certainly enthusiastic about their own work and activities in their parties, they do not have a particularly rosy view of the possibility of greater popular engagement in traditional politics. The book ends by stating that ‘while, over the past 30 years, political parties have sometimes had to learn to live without members, it seems that many of our future leaders expect politics to soon have to learn how to live without citizens’ (p. 239) – not exactly a cheery note to end on!</p>
<p>The book has much to recommend it. It is a unique project, not only in its focus on young party members but also in the width and depth of its data, encompassing as it does both questionnaire surveys and a large body of interviews across several countries. However, there are also two areas that this reviewer would have liked to see more on. The first is in how the interview data were analysed. The authors hint at some form of discourse analysis having been employed, but are never very clear exactly how this vast data set was analysed. Considering that we are looking at 519 interviews of an average length of 1 hour and 10 minutes, i.e. more than 600 hours, it would have been interesting to have been told how the authors coped with such a huge amount of data. In addition, considering the size of the interview data set, quantitative content analysis might usefully have been employed to look for patterns across parties and countries. Another small niggle is that in order to truly understand young members, it might have been worth gathering data that would allow for comparison between young members and ‘other’ members, to understand in what ways young members are different.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite these minor issues, this is a very important contribution to the literature on political parties. The data employed are impressive and the book should be recommended reading for both researchers and students of political parties.</p>
