<p>If inner speech is first of all <italic>speech</italic>, then a critical departure point is to study its discursive nature. The aim of this paper is to deepen the notion of inner speech from a discursive and dialogical perspective. Drawing on the works of Vygotsky, Bakhtin, and Vološinov, we discuss the idea that consciousness is structured by language, exploring the concept of internalization, and making an analogy between acts of thinking and uttering. Inner discourse is understood as a dialogical movement of interchange between different ideological positions. Furthermore, we propose a distinction between inner discourse and self-talk: inner discourse is a basal dialogical process that may give form to syntactically well-organized self-talk, but also to processes that are on the border of language because of a weak or very instable syntactic organization. Consequently, inner discourse should be conceived of not as a homogeneous and unitary process but as a heterogeneous class of discursive practices.</p>

<p>Inner speech is an extremely familiar phenomenon to each and every one of us, readers. When reading in silence a piece of written text we “listen” to the changing flow of meaning along with our more or less effortful attention toward printed words. In addition, we also may “listen” with varying strength to another flow of meaning emerging from our attentive work of interpretation of the given, sometimes in the form of comments, questions, conjectures, or personal notes at the margins, so to speak, of the text. The intermingling of these two or more sources of meaning characterizes our experience of consciousness, at the same time involved in relating to the others around us and in relating to our own responses to them. The inseparability of these two sides of conscious experience while reading a piece of text illustrates the pervasive phenomenon of inner speech—whose psychological importance has been widely recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354311423864">Augustine, 398/1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354311423864">Bakhtin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959354311423864">Mead, 1934</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959354311423864">Vygotsky, 1934/1999</xref>). In spite of this, the concept of inner speech remains theoretically underdeveloped. The explanation of its inner nature and its relation to language are still a matter of debate. The contribution of the present paper is situated within this debate.</p>
<p>Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959354311423864">Piaget’s (1926/1962)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959354311423864">Vygotsky’s (1934/1999)</xref> works on egocentric speech, there have been many empirical studies on private speech and self-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354311423864">Fernyhough &amp; Fradley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959354311423864">Fernyhough &amp; Russell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959354311423864">Goudena, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959354311423864">Luria, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959354311423864">Rommetveit &amp; Blakar, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354311423864">Wertsch &amp; Stone, 1985</xref>), neurological correlates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959354311423864">Ehrich, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959354311423864">Morin, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959354311423864">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959354311423864">Morin &amp; Everett, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959354311423864">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959354311423864">Steels, 2003</xref>), inner speech impairments and verbal hallucinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959354311423864">Fernyhough, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959354311423864">Jones &amp; Fernyhough, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959354311423864">Jones &amp; Fernyhough, 2009</xref>), inner speech impairments and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959354311423864">Arnott et al., 2010</xref>), among other emphases. As a common background for these different lines of research, inner speech is vaguely understood as the speech that is directed to ourselves either silently or aloud. As such, it is a specific type of language practice that departs from the typical interaction between locutors because there is only one locutor playing the role of speaker and listener at the same time. Indeed, those scholars endorsing a sociocultural approach of cognition and communication would agree that inner speech is the speech process whose audience is not a real interlocutor but a virtual one. We may feel relatively comfortable with these definitions because they seem to be unproblematic. However, they do not clarify anything about the structure and dynamic of inner speech.</p>
<p>Some difficulties in understanding this phenomenon start with its unfortunate name: <italic>inner</italic> speech. Although this notion has for us an unavoidable Vygotskian resonance, it is usually still associated with the pre-Vygotskian idea of an inside (the soul), as opposed to an outside (the world). Thus, by saying <italic>inner</italic> speech, we are more likely to think of this phenomenon in contrast to <italic>outer</italic> speech, from which we develop our very idea of language. How to talk, then, about language processes inside the soul? Is there something like a “private language” with which we think? How did the internal and external sides come to be differentiated and, if possible, connected to each other? These are some of the misleading questions traditionally attached to this notion, at least from the times of Descartes. Vygotsky’s approach to inner speech is interesting precisely because, within a systematic psychological theory of mind, he describes important details of its structure and dynamics as underlying a crucial aspect of human consciousness, namely, that the latter is structured by relatedness and otherness. Instead of accounting for the unity of a unitary consciousness, he claimed that consciousness only comes in the form of the difference and borders with others, as foreign consciousness. But, at the same time, his concept of inner speech offers several tensions and opens up many problems. For example, while in some passages of <italic>Thinking and Speech</italic> (1934/1999) he describes inner speech as characterized by a peculiar syntax (abbreviation, predication, etc.), in other passages he describes it as a pure meaningful conversation, which may be regarded as disconnected or even contradictory with his contention about its peculiar syntactic structure. Although we will try to give a coherent interpretation of these considerations below, the immediate problem is that in trying to theoretically develop our understanding of this phenomenon, one may stay trapped or confused even by Vygotsky’s descriptions.</p>
<p>Moreover, the notion of inner speech suggests a duality between <italic>two</italic> speech processes that are closely intertwined. It is usually claimed that inner speech is secondary because in the first place there is (outer) speech, independently of the former. In fact, both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959354311423864">Vygotsky (1934/1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959354311423864">Vološinov (1929/1986)</xref> affirm a similar idea, but it has to be carefully interpreted. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959354311423864">Vygotsky (1934/1999)</xref>, for example, understands signs as inner tools that modify and transform consciousness in a fundamental way. Therefore, to conceive of outer signs and inner signs as separate phenomena is a mistake; not only do inner signs depend on signs but they also transform sign systems and the way outer signs are used. Vygotsky suggests a complex relationship between cognition and communication. On the one hand, inner signs ontogenetically derive from signs used in communication with the others surrounding us out in the world. The latter are an “internalization” of the former, so that sign-meanings become intrapsychological means that each of us uses to regulate cognition. On the other hand, once internalized, inner signs microgenetically mediate overt speech so that communication is not just coordination between people but a social work of understanding among them. Thus, the way in which outer signs operate cannot be explained without assuming that interlocutors are able to make an effort to—rephrasing Vygotsky—say what they think and think what they say. Later we will focus on the inner side of speech activity, as well as the discursive side of consciousness, but this consideration about the complex relationship with outer speech should be enough to suggest the problematic nature of inner speech.</p>
<p>The aim of this paper is thus to deepen the notion of inner speech, specifically offering a set of conceptual distinctions drawing on Vygotsky, Bakhtin, and Vološinov in a complementary way. In this effort we closely follow Shotter’s contribution to the topic (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959354311423864">1993a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959354311423864">1993b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354311423864">2006</xref>). Our thesis is that, taken together, these works offer a powerful framework that allows us to understand inner speech as a discursive phenomenon with its specific features, extending current theory and opening new questions and challenges. The basic assumption is that inner speech is a key component of human processes. As far as our inner lives are mediated by language, the study of communication, consciousness, thought, memory, and self may profit from a better understanding of inner speech. Furthermore, if inner speech is first of all <italic>speech</italic>, then a critical departure point is to study its discursive nature. This will be the central focus of the present paper. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959354311423864">Wiley (2006)</xref> supports this idea, stressing the need to discuss what inner speech is, and proposes to study its linguistic features. However, there is a radical difference between Wiley’s proposal and what we develop here, namely, the theoretical perspective regarding language. Whereas Wiley assumes a Saussurean notion of language, we take Bakhtin’s and Vološinov’s theory of discourse and dialogism as the frame for conceptualizing language and inner speech.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0959354311423864">1</xref></sup> The discussion begins by exploring the relationship between inner speech and consciousness and ends by pointing out some consequences for the conceptualization of cognitive and affective processes.</p>

<title>Inner speech and consciousness</title>
<p>Let us return to a basic definition of inner speech, even if we are to surmount it very soon. Inner speech refers to all sorts of discursive activity directed to oneself. Following this idea, one could say that each speaker’s utterance or idea that is directed to her- or himself is inner speech, independently of the presence or absence of interlocutors, and if it is delivered aloud or in silence. Note that, according to this notion, inner speech acts can take place only in front of someone who could eventually hear and even understand the utterance. In order to explain and refine this notion, we will start by asking about the inner character of inner speech, because this issue arises at the outset. Thus, what makes an inner speech act <italic>inner</italic> if it may be public: that is, aloud and in front of other speaking subjects? At a second stage, we will address the question about the discursive nature of inner speech: In what sense is it speech, as much as outer speech, and what does speech mean?</p>
<sec id="section2-0959354311423864">
<title>Inner speech as inner</title>
<p>The distinction between inner and outer (social) speech derives from the Vygotskian discussion about Piaget’s concept of “egocentric language.” It refers to verbal behavior observed mainly in children, particularly ranging from 3 to 5 years old, typically while they are playing alone. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959354311423864">Piaget (1926/1962)</xref> describes this verbal behavior as incomprehensible to others, abbreviated in its linguistic form (incomplete words, for instance), and syntactically fragmented (i.e., not well-formed sentences). The image is of that of the disintegration of language—more precisely, of a stage of disintegration well advanced so that comprehensibility is lost, but not completely disintegrated, so that there still are recognizable and hearable, although jerky, language forms. Piaget thought this behavior could be helping children to self-regulate their activity, orienting their cognitive operations, considering the child’s inability to take the point of view of others while communicating. The developmental fate of egocentric language, according to him, is to disappear soon and to give way to other means of self-regulation (thinking, planning). In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959354311423864">Vygotsky (1934/1999)</xref> observed that during the period of egocentric language, the abbreviation of words and the omission of the subject of the sentence increases with time, and that the functional aspect of self-regulation is correlatively enforced by this alleged disintegration of language. He reasoned that this seemingly unstructured verbal behavior would not disappear at the time it loses its phasic aspect (to be hearable) but would continue developing into an even more “internalized” verbal behavior, namely, inner speech. In this sense, he interpreted that egocentric language is not an ending point but a mid-stage in the process of internalization of regulative functions.</p>
<p>For Vygotsky, then, the relevance of egocentric language rests on the lessons we can learn for the understanding of psychological development as a process of <italic>internalization of collaborative activity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959354311423864">Vygotsky, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959354311423864">1934/1999</xref>). In this sense, inner speech implies not the emergence of a new (internal) linguistic dimension but the appropriation of thinking processes that are first available for the child in the discursive interactions that she or he undergoes with others, mainly adults. Internalization, as the main path of development of a human being, progressively allows children to gain psychological autonomy. A function becomes internalized when it can be fulfilled without immediate collaboration of others. Exactly this is what characterizes inner speech as structurally different from outer (social) speech.</p>
<p>In other words, inner speech is <italic>inner</italic> in the sense that the speaker can regulate her or his own activity through language. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959354311423864">Vygotsky (1934/1999)</xref>, speech mediates the speaker’s activity (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959354311423864">Wertsch, 1985</xref>). In inner speech, signs serve to guide not the behavior of others, as is the case in outer speech, but one’s own psychological processes. As such, inner speech does not need to be silent or private, although its structural features make it inappropriate for regulating collaborative activity, for communication. The hallmark of inner life is not to be hidden, but to be self-regulated, self-aware, self-responsible. Put differently, inner speech is the semiotic mediation of psychological (cognitive, affective, and volitional) processes, enabling conscious activity. These postulates are close to the Vygotskian view of consciousness that has been championed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354311423864">Shotter (2006)</xref>. According to the notion of <italic>con-scientia</italic> and Bakhtin’s notion of <italic>contestability</italic>, Shotter suggests that consciousness means that one is responsible for one’s own behavior: that is, able to respond for one’s behaviour, both available to be questioned by others and answered by oneself from within, from an awareness of one’s own motives, thoughts, and circumstances. Because our psychological processes become mediated by discourse, we become capable of turning round upon them and giving an account of them to oneself and to others. As such, consciousness seems not so private and logical but ethical and rhetorical: “[I]t is through the words, the utterances of others that we can come to act in a voluntary, conscious manner, in a way in which we ourselves are responsible, or ‘answerable,’ for our own conduct” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354311423864">Shotter, 2006</xref>, p.16; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959354311423864">1993b</xref>). From such an extended Vygotskian point of view, the essence of conscious life is the activity of word meaning (rather than word forms): that is, “speech, the act of voicing one’s words … not language as a formal system” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354311423864">Shotter, 2006</xref>, p. 14). The present paper owes its theoretical background to these authors and aims at specifically contributing to deepen the conceptual elaboration of the discursive and dialogical nature of our inner life.</p>

<title>Inner speech as speech</title>
<p>If inner speech involves losing the phasic and syntactic aspects of outer speech, what aspects of speech do remain? To approach this issue, which will be developed throughout the whole paper, we draw on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959354311423864">Vološinov’s (1927/1976b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959354311423864">1929/1986</xref>) account of semiotic mediation of consciousness. According to him, the relationship between consciousness and semiosis is immanent: “[C]onsciousness itself can arise and become a viable fact only in the material embodiment of signs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959354311423864">Vološinov, 1929/1986</xref>, p. 11). To understand why and how, we will give here only a brief summary of the main ideas as a reminder, with the hope that the reader is acquainted with the basics of Bakhtin and Vološinov, and is patient to wait until further sections of this paper.</p>
<p>The sign is a bearer of ideologies; it is the guide to social activity in which the individual consciousness arises. This is not merely a product of an evolutionary biological process, but rather a social product. In this context, the individual consciousness is not social only because it is mediated by language, but rather because these signs <italic>reproduce</italic> social life in the individual realm, with its conflicts and assessments. The individual consciousness is social by virtue of the virtual or supposed audience that populates it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959354311423864">Holborow, 2006</xref>): that is, the addressees who, as a background of consciousness, represent diverse evaluative perspectives that we encounter in our social milieu, that we receive from our predecessors, and that configure the ideological atmosphere of our historical time. If consciousness as an ideological realm originates itself and takes place in semiosis, does it necessarily mean that this realm works through language? What role would inner speech play in cognitive, affective, and volitional processes?</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[T]his has determined the role of the word as <italic>the semiotic material of inner life—of consciousness</italic> (inner speech). … The word is available as the sign for, so to speak, inner employment: it can function as a sign in a state short of outward expression. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959354311423864">Vološinov, 1929/1986</xref>, p. 14)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this quote Vološinov suggests that inner speech is the semiotic mediation of consciousness and that its specific semiotic material are potential words: that is, signs not yet expressed, to be expressed, or just not expressed outwardly. Words, in this case, are not in their finished form, as typically we found in outer speech, but in their process of becoming. Next, he states that these potential words mediate all conscious activity:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is owing to this exclusive role of <italic>the word as the medium of consciousness that the word functions as an essential ingredient accompanying all ideological creativity whatsoever</italic>. The process of understanding any ideological phenomenon at all (be it a picture, a piece of music, a ritual, or an act of human conduct) cannot operate without the participation of inner speech. All manifestation of ideological creativity—all other nonverbal signs—are bathed by, suspended in, and cannot be entirely segregated or divorced from the element of speech. … [I]t becomes part of the <italic>unity of the verbally constituted consciousness</italic>. … Word is present in each and every act of interpretation. (p. 15)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Vološinov states that consciousness is structured verbally and that inner speech plays a fundamental and exclusive role in its functioning. It is the privileged medium through which consciousness works. This has two important implications. In the first place, in saying that no act of interpretation and understanding can operate without the participation of inner speech, Vološinov confirms that all psychological processes are mediated by inner speech. This carries important consequences for the conceptualization of the relation between discourse and cognition, something that we will examine later on.</p>
<p>Moreover, Vološinov suggests that even though there are other semiotic devices through which humans interpret and understand the world, all of them are mediated by verbal discourse. Hence, the quote supports the exclusive role played by the word. At this point we are not focusing on the notion of the verbal, but it is important to at least warn the reader that the idea that inner speech has a propositional structure is alien to Vološinov’s and Bakhtin’s theory of discourse. To argue that all acts of consciousness are linguistic acts in the sense of well-formed propositional statements is a reductionism because images, gestures, and other semiotic devices also have an important role in cognition and mind in general. For Vološinov and Bakhtin, the word is neither the finished form that we can recognize as past, for example in a written piece, nor the lexeme of a given language system; both are dead words, in contrast to the living word that these authors talk about (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354311423864">Bakhtin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959354311423864">Vološinov, 1929/1986</xref>). As live signs, words are word-meanings: expressions of surprise, of anger, of a certain interest, reactions to a given previous word—in sum, responsive expressions of a position toward the ongoing activity and situation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959354311423864">Shotter, 1993a</xref>, for the interpretation of Vygotsky’s idea of the word-meaning, in this precise sense, as the unit of consciousness). What does it mean, in these terms, for consciousness to be verbally constituted? What Vološinov is pointing out is that even though there are other semiotic devices involved in mind, all of them have been transformed by the word: they have become semiotic means for responsive expression within a given ideological realm—that is, they have become <italic>discursive</italic>. However, what does this imply? Would it mean that all semiotic material becomes linguistically or verbally structured? What Vološinov is trying to emphasize, we think, is not this, but the idea that all semiotic codes and processes taking place in consciousness play the game of inner speech. But then what does it mean to “become discursive”? After all, what is the relation between language and inner speech? In order to answer these questions, we now elaborate a conceptual distinction, concerning inner life, between discourse and language.</p>

<title>Inner discourse and language</title>
<p>At first glance, one could establish immediate relationships between what has been previously outlined, quoting Vološinov, and what Vygotsky proposes about inner speech. Both authors consider inner speech as the meditational means of human consciousness. Even if the latter author gives great importance to inner speech, what he most develops is the function of signs in the mediation of thought in terms of how word-meanings regulate the activity of consciousness. What remains implicit in Vygotsky’s work is precisely the role of discourse (as distinct from sign systems) in the functioning of consciousness, because although he argues that internalization is the process through which the child appropriates collaborative activity (inter-psychological functions), he states that inner speech is a sort of monologue. He does not state explicitly the dialogical nature of mind.</p>
<sec id="section5-0959354311423864">
<title>Approaching dialogicality</title>
<p>In contradistinction, both Vološinov and Bakhtin characterize inner speech as a dialogical process of becoming. Like all discursive processes, inner speech is realized in the ongoing ideological encounter between the foreign consciousness and one’s own. Unlike outer speech, discursive acts in the individual consciousness involve the encounter of words (or word-meanings, or voices) that represent different positions and positioning efforts within a field of understanding. Note that, again, a word is not meant here as either a finished expression or a formal item of the vocabulary of a language system, but an <italic>effort after meaning</italic>—to use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354311423864">Bartlett’s (1932/1964)</xref> notion concerning acts of mind. Words come into contact, mutually redefining their borders (their degrees of foreignness and distance) in a dialogical manner. As such, inner discourse is understood as a dialogue that consists of a constant negotiation and redefinition of ideological territories. In our interpretation of these authors: if discourse in general works dialogically by creating new ideological positions toward the ongoing activity and situation, as an evaluative response to previous or anticipated positions, and expressing them in semiotically articulated utterances, then the <italic>inner</italic> forms of discourse, according to our discussion above, would entail also the semiotic (propositional, perceptual, emotional, judgmental, or impulsive) articulation of an evaluative position-taking tendency in relation to assumed, remembered, perceived, or merely imagined evaluative positions. The latter represent in the individual consciousness either the evaluative inclination of the alien consciousness, or alternative positions to be taken by oneself. According to our view, the internalization of discourse—from dialogical collaborative practices mediated by semiotic articulation—implies that the alien consciousness is far from absent but symbolically (semiotically) embedded in one’s own responsive and answerable chain of yet-to-be-expressed reactions. Thus, internalization of discourse implies the ability to perform dialogical encounters and confrontations among evaluative perspectives in a self-regulated way: that is, independently of the immediate collaboration of the others.</p>
<p>Compared to outer speech in the form of a dialogue among interlocutors, the notion of <italic>inner</italic> discourse, the becoming <italic>inner</italic> of discourse, implies two things. Firstly, it implies a detachment from the immediate co-participant, so that we can loosely describe the speaker as addressing her or his thought to her/himself—because the perspective of a virtual interlocutor or generalized other is enclosed in the speaker’s perspective in one way or another, and with more or less evaluative distance. Secondly, it implies that word-forms are left aside to articulate a dialogical interaction between word-meanings only. Of course, this <italic>conversation of “pure meanings”</italic>—to join Bakhtinian and Vygotskian themes in one expression—must not be understood as a dialogue in its typical sense: that is, as a syntactically organized, dialogal interchange between two or more individual participants. Rather, the technical or metaphorical sense of conversation or dialogue employed here stresses the dialogical movement that characterizes consciousness: every act of discursive comprehension involves an interaction between positions, is a response to previous positions, and is addressed to someone as an expression of a new position. This resembles the notion of condensed inner speech proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959354311423864">Fernyhough (2004)</xref> as the contact between multiple perspectives or thought in pure Vygotskian meaning. Moreover, every act of understanding not only is due to the signs and word-meanings involved and their interaction, but is realized in the movement of <italic>appropriation</italic> of such signs.</p>
<p>At this point <italic>it is important to stress the distinction between “dialogical” and “dialogal”</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354311423864">Grossen &amp; Salazar-Orvig, 2006</xref>). The latter refers to the turn-taking structure of conversations, either face-to-face or through electronic media such as chat sessions, as well as written, represented dialogues. Our interest here is in the former. What is “dialogical” or “dialogicality” in Bakhtin’s theory? Without attempting to give a good general answer, the following quote affirms the centrality of this notion of appropriation to the concept at issue:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>As a living, socio-ideological concrete thing, as heteroglot opinion, language, for the individual consciousness, lies on the borderline between oneself and the other. The word in language is half someone else’s. It becomes “one’s own” only when the speaker populates it with his own intention, his own accent, when he appropriates the word, adapting it to his own semantic and expressive intention. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354311423864">Bakhtin, 1981</xref>, p. 293)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Appropriation, therefore, is the transformational movement that speech undergoes in the very moment of ideological creation, involving the taking of a position toward the other and this positioning movement being a dialogical response to previous or anticipated position-taking movements. In each instance of living discourse, a speaking subject—as an addressee—receives the foreign word not just listening to it but actively transforming it—as an author—and, so to speak, sending it back in the form of a new positioning. Creative appropriation involved in inner speech processes, then, implies that the <italic>same</italic> discursive subject <italic>is changed</italic>. This means that every act of consciousness involves a dialogue, and as such also involves tension and difference—between the retrospective and the prospective, or the given and the created, where the movement of mind is at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959354311423864">Shotter, 1993b</xref>). This dialogue is not by necessity syntactically dialogal, but rather implies the responsive and expressive re-creation of a point of view or attitude: the adoption of a position from which social life—the ongoing configuration of given and possible positions—is interpreted and thus re-created. The movement of appropriation that characterizes dialogical phenomena is a process of creation and re-creation, a transformation of the given word, position, or version of the world, into a new word, position, or version.</p>

<title>Dialogical consciousness</title>
<p>Following our discussion above, inner speech ought to be regarded as a dialogical movement that consists in a negotiation and redefinition of ideological territories, in particular a dialogical movement that involves and constitutes consciousness and all psychological processes, as far as they have been transformed or mediated by the participation in discursive practices. That is to say, psychological processes are dialogical and take place, following the model of the utterance in outer speech (see quote below), within the inner semiotic articulation of evaluative positioning movements as responses to other positions. Thus, from this point of view it is possible to argue that each act of comprehension—remembering, thinking, attending, talking, perceiving, and being conscious of ourselves—is a movement of position taking, of re-creation of a foreign voice. Therefore, when saying that consciousness becomes discursively mediated, we are not stressing primarily its linguistic character, but stating that consciousness occurs as a dialogical movement of position taking that is contextualized in a social world where strangeness, difference, or otherness is the rule. As a matter of fact, a dialogical approach to language means, first of all, that every unit of language is to be taken as a difference, as a border, as an encounter with the alien (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354311423864">Bakhtin, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354311423864">1986a</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354311423864">Haye &amp; Larrain, 2009</xref>, for more elaboration of this point). Not least, it also means that relations between these units of discursive processes are dialogic: that is, they express a social and creative response of alliance, ironic distance, agonistic opposition, or other reactions that cannot be understood as either a causal effect, a logical implication, a semantic association, or a grammatical connection. The next two quotes illustrate this, first for discourse in general and, second, for inner speech in particular.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>On the problem of dialogical relations. These relations are profoundly unique and cannot be reduced to logical, linguistic, psychological, mechanical, or any other natural relations. They constitute a special type of semantics relations, whose members can be only <italic>complete utterances</italic> (either regarded as complete or potentially complete), behind which stand (and in which are expressed) real or potentially real speech subjects, authors of the given utterances. … And dialogic relations are always present, even among profoundly monologic speech works. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354311423864">Bakhtin, 1986b</xref>, pp. 124–125)</p>
<p>Closer analysis would show that the units of which inner speech is constituted are certain <italic>whole entities</italic> somewhat resembling a passage of monologic speech or whole utterance. But most of all, they resemble the <italic>alternating lines of a dialogue</italic>. … These whole entities of inner speech are not resolvable into grammatical elements (or are resolvable only with considerable qualifications) and have in force between them, just as in the case of alternating lines of dialogue, not grammatical connections but connections of a different kind. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959354311423864">Vološinov, 1929/1986</xref>, p. 38)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As discursive in nature, consciousness is not linguistic but ideological. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959354311423864">Vološinov (1927/1976b)</xref> points out: “The content of the human psyche—a content consisting of thoughts, feelings, desires—is given in a formulation made by consciousness and, consequently, in the formulation of human verbal discourse” (p. 83). He continues in another text: “The fact of the matter is that no conscious act of any degree of distinctness can do without inner speech, without words and intonations—without evaluations, and, consequently, every conscious act is already a social act, an act of communication” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959354311423864">Vološinov, 1976a</xref>, p. 114). This is not to say that conscious acts have no syntactic organization; but the fact that these acts have some level of organization that makes them recognizable and thus gives them a certain “level of clarity” is not enough to account for the discursive nature of consciousness. Our point is that inner speech underlies consciousness, making psychological processes dialogical and allowing conscious speakers to answer for themselves and to themselves as much as to others. In this sense, inner speech gives psychic life an ideological, thus historical, ethical, and rhetorical character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354311423864">Billig, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959354311423864">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959354311423864">Shotter, 1993a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354311423864">2006</xref>). Immediately continuing with the above quote:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>These units of inner speech, <italic>these total impressions of utterances</italic>, are joined with one another and alternate with one another not according to the laws of grammar or logic but according to the laws of <italic>evaluative</italic> (emotive) correspondence, dialogical deployment, etc., in close dependence on the historical conditions of the social situation and the whole pragmatic run of life. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959354311423864">Vološinov, 1929/1986</xref>, p. 38)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even emotion, something that traditionally has been understood as opposed to language and cognition, occurs discursively, as the quote suggests. To take a position is to evaluate, it is to be <italic>embodied toward</italic>, to stand organically positioned toward a previous or anticipated position within a field of social evaluations. In this sense, inner discourse is not a cognitive process, at least not as opposed to emotional processes. Discourse is neither cognitive nor emotional. On the contrary, the very notions of cognition and emotion are abstractions of what discourse is: a dynamic interchange of point of views that are evaluations, or articulations of affective stands.</p>
<p>The above quote also points out something that is extremely important: the dialogical nature of inner discourse is not due to its structure (e.g., an interchange between two characters). The dialogical nature has to do with the interchange of ideological perspectives or positioning stands that are evaluations, not with grammatical structure. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959354311423864">Shotter (2003)</xref> argues “that the meaningfulness of our language does not initially depend on its systematicity, but on our spontaneous, living, bodily responsiveness to the others and othernesses around us” (p. 435). This allows us to claim that the concept of inner speech is independent of any particular syntax—a point that will be extended further on but that, at this stage, creates the importance of proposing a terminological distinction between “inner speech” and “inner discourse.” We will reserve “inner speech” to refer to the phenomenon described by Vygotsky, who attributed it at least a minimum of syntactic organization (abbreviation and predication). With “inner discourse” we would like to refer to the dialogic–discursive dynamic essentially involved in inner speech, without involving in the concept any assumption about syntactic organization of any concrete act of consciousness. Although it is fairly reasonable to assume that most conscious acts, made possible by the internalization of language practices, would come with some type and degree of syntactic organization, our point is to distinguish that which makes consciousness a dialogical process from other features related with language, in order to learn the consequences of theorizing and asking about the discursive nature of inner speech.</p>
<p>In these terms, it is possible to argue that inner discourse is a basal dialogical process that may give form to syntactically well-organized inner speech, but also to processes that are on the border of language because of a weak or very unstable syntactic organization. Syntactic gradation has been typically conceptualized as a range from the most to the least condensed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959354311423864">Fernyhough, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959354311423864">Vygotsky, 1934/1999</xref>). This does not imply that they occur without any kind of semiotic mediation, but it does imply that they can occur in semiotic devices that are not quite as systematic as historical languages or common codes but that, owing to the ontogenetic development and the mediation of language, <italic>become discursive</italic>: that is to say, they occur as a dialogical movement of ideological interchange, as all language practices are, according to Bakhtin. From this point of view, inner discourse is a wide and heterogeneous process that involves both linguistic aspects (of different degrees of syntactic organization) and non-linguistic aspects (ideological accents and possible positions). Throughout ontogenetic development the linguistic aspects help the speaker to think and feel in a stable and recognizable way along with others, but in the micro-genesis of an adult’s consciousness it is not the linguistic structure of speech but the dialogical dynamics internalized from social activity that characterize thinking and feeling.</p>
<p>We started this inquiry about the nature of inner discourse in order to disclose its dialogical condition. More specifically, in this section of the paper we have tried to clarify the following main idea: that consciousness arises along with the internalization of language, because this makes psychological processes become discursive, but not because they become linguistically structured. We may summarize our view by pointing out some key outcomes:</p>
<list id="list1-0959354311423864" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>“Discursive” implies dialogical movement: that is, ideological engagement, otherness or relatedness, creative responsivity, and contestability. “Language,” on the other hand, suggests syntactic organization and semiotic processes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dialogicality of a discursive process is not the same as having a dialogal structure.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Consciousness emerges from the internalization of discourse. Discursive practices with stable syntax are particularly useful to learn how to master one’s own activity. The consequence of such internalization, though, is that psychological processes (cognitive, affective, and volitional) acquire a dialogical character as far as they are mediated by inner discourse.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Although discourse takes place through sign processes, semiotic articulation is not always structured as a formal system. Not even historical languages are absolutely stable, but they are stable enough for us to recognize repeatable semiotic processes. Some semiotic processes are less stable, and some others are particularly unstable, such that one hardly can recognize any syntactic organization.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Inner discourse allows both strongly and weakly organized semiotic processes, as well as different types of semiotic resources. In this sense, inner discourse is the basal processes of consciousness, not a specific language or semiotic code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354311423864">Haye &amp; Larrain, 2009</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Silent conversation with oneself in natural language is not the same as inner discourse, but just one of its possible forms. It is not only an inner dialogue among voices mimicking a conversation between speakers that we experience permanently in our private experience. Also the surprise, shame, or interest concerning what we have just thought, for instance, is a dialogical experience.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>New questions emerge: How can we conceptualize inner discourse heterogeneity? What is the relationship between inner discourse as a whole and the syntactic forms it can adopt? What variety of relationships can be described between inner discourse and psychological processes? In order to approach these questions, we will explore the properties of the type of inner discourse that can be described as having a relatively stable, thus repeatable and recognizable, syntactic organization. We will give this particular type of inner discourse a special name: “self-talk.” In focusing on clearly organized forms of inner discourse, we expect to discover something about the essential aspects and ranges of variation pertaining to the latter.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0959354311423864">
<title>Self-talk and inner discourse</title>
<p>Self-talk is a type of configuration that inner discourse may take at some point in time, and that is typically described as talking to oneself, either in silence or aloud, but with a clear and stable compositional structure. We are able to sustain more than one self-talk at the same time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959354311423864">Linell, 2009</xref>), and we can think in such a manner that there is no recognizable organization at the same time we are involved in self-talk. Moreover, self-talk is not the only manifestation of inner discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959354311423864">Morin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959354311423864">Steels, 2003</xref>), but rather a set of possible forms of inner utterance. Finally, we have been conceptualizing inner discourse as a condition shared by several discursive processes (remembering, thinking, speaking, writing, etc.). The key question is: What kind of utterance is self-talk?</p>
<p>The question asks for a description of the typical form and style of self-talk: that is, of its genre or the different genres included. The relevance of this question lies in the theoretical replacement of the notion of language system by that of speech genres in dialogical approaches to the problem of stability of semiotic processes in verbal communication. Thus the very question also comes with a bias, since Bakhtin’s notion of the utterance refers not to syntax but to discourse (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959354311423864">Shotter, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354311423864">Bakhtin (1986a)</xref> understands the utterance as the concrete unit of discursive communication. In this sense, the utterance does not resist the division into phrases and sentences, because rather than being just a language unit, it is a unit of discursive communication and of human ideological exchange. Bakhtin makes a distinction between simple or primary and complex or secondary speech genres, the latter embedding in different ways representations of other utterances. In general, the utterances of oral communication correspond to primary genres, and the utterances of written communication correspond to secondary speech genres. Nevertheless, Bakhtin does not fully develop this distinction. If we assume that every sphere of language usage elaborates its own speech genres, and that the limits of the utterances depend on these genres, one may be tempted to investigate to which speech genre self-talk belongs. However, the goal of our key question about the type or form of the utterance in self-talk is not to answer this properly—because this would need much more investigation—but to show how productive and powerful the discourse approach to consciousness is. In particular, we would try to point out some new research questions about psychological functioning that can be opened up by the present conceptualization.</p>
<p>On the surface at least, one would tend to consider that self-talk belongs to primary genres since it is much closer to an oral dialogue than a written one. Nevertheless, in the case of self-talk there is only one real speaker: the one who speaks and responds. Should every position in self-talk be understood as belonging to different speaking subjects? In this sense, perhaps this type of discourse is closer to secondary speech genres. In fact, it is possible to think that this type of discourse belongs to secondary genres owing to its complexity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354311423864">Bakhtin (1986a)</xref> suggests that secondary genres are more complex cultural forms since utterances of this type reproduce primary genres within themselves. Secondary genres “also use various forms such as this to introduce primary speech genres and relations among them into the construction of the utterance (and here they are altered to a greater or lesser degree, for the speaking subject does not really change)” (p. 73). This is clear in the case of self-talk, since it consists of the re-elaboration of a type of utterance that is primary par excellence (oral communication). The novel is a perfect analogy. However, if we understand self-directed discourse as belonging to secondary genres, a self-talk process should be understood as a single utterance, as an expression of one discursive will. This is because secondary genres have representations of other utterances enclosed within them.</p>
<p>The type of finishing of secondary genres is not necessarily present in self-talk. Finishing, as a criterion of border demarcation between utterances, is characterized by three aspects: the completion of sense; the creative will or intention of the speaker; and certain grammatical forms that define the finalization. With respect to the completion of sense, self-talk is an ongoing process that many times ends abruptly—can we say that each voice is sense-completed? In addition, the type of finishing expressed in grammatical forms is very different from written utterances—for instance, an emotional climax, or an emotional fall. In self-talk the finalization does not necessarily show explicit characteristics. In fact, a self-talk probably does not close in an explicit manner but rather remains unresolved. Finally, the expression of creative will or intentionality of the speaker also seems to question the pertinence of this type of utterance to secondary genres: Is self-talk a product of a unitary will or intention? At least sometimes it seems to have the form of various intentions and wills that take place and make it impossible to conceive of them as a unitary process.</p>
<p>In the case of the secondary genres, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354311423864">Bakhtin (1986a)</xref> suggests that the utterance is the product of a creative will that expresses its intention, exhausting the meaning of the utterance. Even though different voices are present in the utterance, there is only one will that is expressed. Here the speaking subject is understood as that empirical subject that sustains a position that can be answered. This clearly is not the case of the utterances of the primary type. In self-talk, at least in modern times, there is a situation more similar to the polyphonic novel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354311423864">Bakhtin, 1984</xref>), where there are multiple voices that do not subject themselves to a superordinate, integrative author. This touches on Bakhtin’s theme of historicity of discourse.</p>
<p>In the case of self-talk, one may think that the speaking subject should be understood neither as a unique individuality nor as an empirical subject, because the author engaged in self-talk typically does not include (represent) different positions, but <italic>takes</italic> them. This touches on another of Bakhtin’s themes: openess of life (see 1990 and 1993). Therefore, the speaking subject who characterizes self-talk does not correspond to the speaker of primary or secondary genres. In fact, “every utterance, even a standard greeting, has a specific form of an author (and addressee)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959354311423864">Bakhtin, 1986c</xref>, p. 146).</p>
<p>If we understand that self-talk has specific forms of speaking subject, we should understand that the form of the utterance is different too. If the discursive subject is understood not as unitary but rather as a multiple, every distinct idea expressed in self-talk is an utterance. In addition, every position is uttered in the present moment and is, therefore, a unique and non-repetitive moment of ideological creation. The author, in this case, cannot return and undo what was uttered, as a writer is able to do. He can return to what was said but only in order to dialogue with it. This is equivalent to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959354311423864">Mead’s (1934)</xref> idea of the dialogical differentiation between I and Me that constitutes the dynamics of the self. Every utterance in self-talk, therefore, has a dialogical relationship with the position to which it responds, since every position represents a distinct speaker:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Finally, dialogic relationships are also possible toward one’s own utterance as a whole, towards its separate parts and toward an individual word within it, if we somehow detach ourselves from them, speak with an inner reservation, if we observe a certain distance from them, as if limiting our own authorship or dividing it in two. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354311423864">Bakhtin, 1984</xref>, p. 184)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The special configuration of self-talk is emphasized when we consider that a constitutive characteristic of an utterance is its type of destination.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Both the composition and, in particular, the style of the utterance depend on those to whom the utterance is addressed, how the speaker (or writer) senses and imagines his addressees, and the force of their effect on the utterance. Each speech genre in each area of speech communication has its own typical conception of the addressee, and this defines it as a genre. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354311423864">Bakhtin, 1986a</xref>, p. 95)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although self-talk does not have concrete, immediate listeners, they are addressed to, and they suppose, an audience. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959354311423864">Vološinov (1976a)</xref>, every act of consciousness entails the orientation toward a possible audience. This permanent co-participant of all our conscious acts determines not only the content of consciousness, but also the very selection of the content. The audience that is present in every interior act not only accompanies it but determines it. The addressee becomes a central aspect in the construction of every inner utterance. This has a very relevant consequence, namely, that inner speech has a rhetorical context that influences its constitution. The type of social activity where the utterance takes place configures its own addressee. In this way, the audience and the type of utterance show a co-constitutive relationship.</p>
<p>We should consider the possibility that inner discourse and self-talk belong to a type of their own speech genre. But if we understand speech genres as types of utterances that are given to the speaker in the process of discursive communication and, in this sense, serve the process of social communication, can one think of self-talk as belonging to various genres, according to particular situations? We suggest that self-talk, as a group of diverse forms of inner discourse, belongs to various genres according to the extra-verbal context in which the speaker is situated. The intimate relationship between extra-verbal context and inner discourse is insistently stressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959354311423864">Vološinov (1927/1976b)</xref>: “[W]e pointed out that every concrete verbal utterance always reflects the <italic>immediate</italic> small social event … out of which it directly arouse” (p. 86).</p>
<p>The need to consider and study multiple genres of inner discourse is intensified if one pays attention to the diversity of communicative goals that can be accomplished by it, and the diversity of discursive types (narrative, argumentative) that constitute self-talks. Many times different positions put forth in self-talk have a prototypical conversational form, and in this sense there are alternating speaking subjects (or alternations between locutor and listener, in Vološinov’s terms), but many other times the forms of self-talk do not approach this paradigm.</p>
<p>In synthesis, self-talk could be dialogal or monologal, or any mixture of them; could be narrative or argumentative, among others; could be fragmented into several authorships or integrated in one encompassing author, or any mid-point between these two extremes. Self-talk, even if it is a kind of inner discourse with a clearly recognizable degree of syntactic organization, is not a type of utterance. Rather, inner utterances are of different types according to the activity within which they are performed.</p>

<title>Conclusions: Discourse and cognition</title>
<p>Overall, we hope it is clear by now that the notion of inner speech as that speech that is either private or directed to oneself is a reductionism. On the one hand, we have argued that inner discourse, despite its possible syntactic peculiarities, is not different in nature to “public” language. Following Bakhtin and Shotter, we have conceptualized inner discourse as that facet of our daily discursive activities that allows us to respond in regard to the positioning movements we unfold in the “public” side of life, giving testimony to the argumentative, evaluative, emotional, narrative, conversational, and thematic aspects of the position-taking movement initiated as intra-psychological processes. This <italic>initiation</italic> is conceived of by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959354311423864">Vološinov (1929/1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354311423864">Bakhtin (1986a)</xref> as a preparation for expression (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959354311423864">Shotter, 2003</xref>). In other words, inner speech is not one psychological process among others, but the <italic>inner</italic> side of discursive life. In this closing section of the paper we will emphasize that inner discourse is the structuring of psychological processes (themselves developed within social activity) by language practices. As such, then, inner speech is more a public condition organizing our psychic life than a private thing hidden from social activity: “[I]f Wittgenstein is correct, rather than being merely expressive of our inner lives, our expressive talk is constitutive of them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959354311423864">Shotter, 2003</xref>, p. 436).</p>
<p>On the other hand, we started this study with Vygotsky’s suggestion about the complex relationship between cognition and communication in terms of the inner/outer speech distinction. From a sociocultural point of view, enough has been said in order to state that inner speech processes occur also at the time we speak to a real interlocutor. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959354311423864">Marková (2006)</xref> points out that “[i]t has been well recognized in psychology and in studies of dialogue—and even more so in literature—that humans, when speaking to others in what we can call an <italic>external dialogue</italic>, may also hold an <italic>internal</italic> (<italic>or inner</italic>) <italic>dialogue</italic> within themselves” (p. 135). Therefore, from this framework it is difficult to understand <italic>outer</italic> utterances in isolation without taking into account the inner speech processes involved. Following this important idea, although at the risk of adding nothing to Bakhtin, one could even argue that the real unit of discursive communication is the complex configuration of outer utterances and inner utterances.</p>
<p>As a central thesis, it was argued above that inner discourse determines higher psychological processes not only as semiotic but also as dialogical. This implies that psychological processes, as far as they are transformed by discursive practices, occur as phases of a response movement within an interchange of positions. Concerning this general idea, let us stress some outcomes from the last section.</p>
<list id="list2-0959354311423864" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>We understand this movement of interchange, which gives mind its discursive nature, as dialogic intercourse. Therefore, it is not only language as a semiotic system that mediates thought, but fundamentally the kind of movement or dynamic that is internalized from situated language practices; this is the sense that the expression “structures by language” can reasonably have. This first point resumes the role of the rhetorical context in shaping inner discourse.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Because there are many ways in which interchange of positions can take place, inner discourse is conceived of as a heterogeneous class of discursive practices. Well-formed inner conversation would be just one type of inner discourse, in particular that kind of self-talk with a dialogal structure. Other types of self-talk may not have a dialogal structure, as in monologal self-narrative. This second point captures our previous discussion concerning the heterogeneity of inner discourse.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Such heterogeneity is closely related to the rhetorical and extra-verbal characteristics of the situation (i.e., goals and audience), so that there are as many types of inner discourse and self-talk as the combination of purposes, audience, and other situational conditions. We may thus conceive, describe, and study different inner discourse genres.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Additionally, within a single stream of inner discourse, there may be several different discursive processes concurring in time. This heterogeneity allows us to distinguish inner discourse, as the basal movement of mediated thought, from self-talk, as the syntactically articulated speech process that structures some acts of thought. Inner discourse may also give rise to discursive processes with a lack of syntactic organization but still involving a dialogic interchange of perspectives, as, for instance, in the iconic and emotional play of points of view in some acts of reminiscence.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>What are the implications of these ideas? Following Vološinov, it was suggested that inner discourse determines all acts of consciousness, even those that occur through semiotic resources different from verbal language. Of course, this is true for a developed consciousness: that is, for higher psychological functions, but not for elementary ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959354311423864">Vygotsky, 1978</xref>). Internalization of discourse is the fundamental condition for psychological processes to become dialogical. Internalization of discourse means internalization of forms of behavior organized by dialogic relations. The consequence of this is that thinking, remembering, imagining, and other acts of consciousness should be studied as characterized by contestability, diversity of subjective positions, ideological evaluation, responsiveness to positioning movements (meaning), and so on. We may add here that, in contrast to the “higher” psychological functions characterizing human consciousness, “elementary” processes are not part of conscious experience if not mediated by language; in themselves, these elementary processes are not even inner. In other words, they are no more inner than blood circulation and neural activation.</p>
<p>By questioning the nature of self-talk and its relationship with inner discourse, this study opens new theoretical and empirical questions about inner discourse. Although inner discourse would be at the base of every act of consciousness, not every psychological process takes place through self-talk. Self-talk does not accompany some memories or thoughts; it constitutes some but not all of them. The relationship established between inner discourse and cognition, and between self-talk and cognition, forces one to study in depth the conceptualization of thought and its consequences for the traditional concept of thought that current cognitive science supports. In this paper, thought is understood as a dialogical discourse process. Cognitive scientists have been concerned with the relation between inner speech and psychological functions. Those that adhere to a socio-cultural approach are more likely to accept our Vygotskian–Bakhtinian thesis, but those that adhere to an information-processing approach deny this idea; deny both that thinking could have a dialogal structure and that evaluative appropriation or creative positioning is a good description for the unit of consciousness. For them, thinking occurs in some representational format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354311423864">Carruthers, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354311423864">Fodor, 1983</xref>), this format being a mental code different from both inner speech and private conversation in a natural language code. In opposition, our study reveals that higher mental processes occur through inner discourse, which should depend on the verbal and extra-verbal context in which they take place. This is a bold but very relevant idea because it has consequences not only for inner discourse and self-talk but also for cognitive processes. If we accept that the basic movement of cognition is inner discourse, then we must consider that thinking will follow a different path depending on the rhetorical and situational context in which different social or mental activities take place. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959354311423864">Vološinov (1976a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354311423864">Bakhtin (1986a)</xref> emphasize that this group of situational factors do not stay in the exterior, but rather the situation enters into the utterance itself, becoming a constituent part of it. Internalization is also the “inner dialogization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354311423864">Bakhtin, 1981</xref>) of mind, enabling the context to come not from the outside but from within.</p>
<p>Hence, our exploration into the discursive nature of inner speech has important consequences for investigation into psychological topics such as self, thought, memory, and emotion, as well as communication. In particular, we would like to point out that these consequences are congenial with the already established works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959354311423864">Hermans (2001)</xref> on self and personality, of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354311423864">Billig (1987)</xref> on reasoning and argumentation, of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959354311423864">Middleton and Edwards (1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354311423864">Edwards, 1997</xref>) on remembering and other cognitive activities, and of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959354311423864">Shotter (2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354311423864">2006</xref>) on meaning and consciousness.</p>

<p>There is debate about the authorship of texts that have been attributed to Vološinov (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959354311423864">Holborow, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354311423864">Clark and Holquist (1984)</xref> believe that it was really Bakhtin who wrote <italic>Marxism and the Philosophy of Language</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959354311423864">Vološinov, 1929/1986</xref>) and “Freudianism: A Marxist Critique” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959354311423864">Vološinov, 1976b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959354311423864">Wertsch (1991)</xref>, on the other hand, suggests that in the context of Bakhtin’s emphasis on the dialogic and polyvocal nature of utterances, the real authorship passes to a second plane since both authors worked together on these ideas in the 1930s. We will attribute authorship based on those used in the respective editions referred to. Irrespective of the personal identity of the authors, their several pieces of intellectual work are considered here as different but consistent enough sources of a broad theoretical framework, offering us both a coherent insight into the nature of discourse and a number of conceptual gaps to be taken as challenges for current development.</p>
