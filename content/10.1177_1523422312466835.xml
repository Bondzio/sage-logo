<title>The Problem</title>
<p>New ways of thinking about leadership as emergent, relational, and collective are becoming evident in leadership theory and practice. This is causing orientations to leadership development to shift from approaches that are predominantly concerned with building skills to those that are concerned with questions of mindset. That is, leadership development is less directly concerned with developing a set of discrete skills and is increasingly concerned with participants’ underlying assumptions and how these shape possibilities for the future. Historically, evaluation of leadership development has tended to focus on technologies and methodologies that assess the former. This article seeks to explore evaluative practices that would be attuned to mindset in leadership development.</p>

<sec id="section2-1523422312466835">
<title>The Solution</title>
<p>To do so we first outline the difference between skillset and mindset as orientations to leadership development. Relational and complexity theories are drawn on to construct our understanding of an approach to leadership development that is oriented to questions of mindset. We then turn to evaluation theory to address three primary perspectives on evaluation: evaluation for accountability, for development, and for knowledge. We argue that skillset acquisition has been predominantly associated with an evaluation for accountability perspective. In this article we foreground evaluation for development and evaluation for knowledge arguing that these perspectives offer important alternatives for leadership development that is oriented to issues of mindset. We propose that working dynamically with the three perspectives offers new directions in evaluation that are suitable for mindset orientated interventions.</p>

<title>The Stakeholders</title>
<p>This article will inform those researching and writing in the leadership development domain, those sponsoring or seeking more mindset orientated leadership development interventions, leadership development managers, champions, designers, facilitators, and associated professionals. Finally it will be of interest to practitioners looking for evaluative practices that address the multidimensional nature of change and development work in organizations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This inquiry follows the growing calls for leadership and leadership mindsets that respond to the complexities of contemporary circumstances seen as requiring a particular adeptness with uncertainty, ambiguity, and collaboration. We propose that such calls increasingly refocus leadership development from skillset acquisition to mindset development. Given that we are seeing the first wave of leadership development programs informed by such thinking we ask how understandings and practices associated with the evaluation of leadership development could be redefined, reframed, and reviewed in line with this shift. We have defined evaluation following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422312466835">Chelimsky (1997)</xref>, who describes it as “knowledge-seeking that may also serve to build capacity and/ or establish worth” (p. 100). Therefore this article is concerned with the question of building capacity and/or establishing worth in emerging approaches to leadership development. In distinguishing between leadership development that is concerned with mindset rather than skillset we identify leadership development as being concerned with three interconnected dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1523422312466835">R. Ladkin, 2005</xref>)—the personal, relational, and contextual. Focusing particularly on the relational we consider “both the need to lead recognizing plurality of interests and that leadership acts are essentially relational, <italic>indeed conversational</italic> [Italics added]” (p. 27).</p>
<p>In this discussion we first offer a characterization and comparison of both skillset and mindset work. We describe key dimensions of the shift from skillset to mindset in the broader organizational development terrain and then specifically with respect to leadership development. We then theorize mindset more fully by drawing on relational and complexity theories and their implications for leadership. Next we consider three logics for evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422312466835">Chelimsky, 1997</xref>), the logic of accountability, development, and knowledge and we discuss each logic with an example from the literature. Accountability logic is considered with respect to an evaluation of a leadership development program focused on transformational leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1523422312466835">Avolio &amp; Bass, 1998</xref>). The logic of development is then considered with respect to an international change program in European tertiary institutions that was tracked closely by professor of evaluation Murray Saunders and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1523422312466835">Saunders, Charlier, &amp; Bonamy, 2005</xref>). Finally we consider the logic of evaluation for knowledge drawing on a recent discursively oriented study of an in-house leadership development program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422312466835">Carroll &amp; Simpson, 2012</xref>). We conclude that evaluation of mindset orientated leadership development requires a distinctively new mindset, language, conceptual terrain, and relationality between participants, providers, and organizations.</p>

<title>From Skillset to Mindset</title>
<p>The way we know leadership—or any other phenomena—“ . . . provides clues about where we might usefully look for it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1523422312466835">D. Ladkin, 2010</xref>, p. 16). Conceptualizations of leadership are shifting and this in turn influences where we look for it. The move from skillset to mindset is associated with a different way of knowing leadership. On a historical basis, leadership has largely been known through the stories of individual leaders. This leads the distinction between leaders and leadership to be collapsed causing leadership to become associated with “ . . . those individuals who grab our attention” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1523422312466835">D. Ladkin, 2010</xref>, p. 11). In line with this way of knowing leadership, leadership research has involved studying successful leaders and their organizations to know what these individuals actually do (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1523422312466835">Collins, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1523422312466835">Tichy &amp; Devanna, 1986</xref>). It is no surprise then that the prevalent approach to leadership development and the approach with the deepest roots focuses on individual skillset development and is based on what is known about successful leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1523422312466835">Conger, 2010</xref>). Leadership development based on this way of knowing leadership exemplifies a skill set approach to development. The more effective programs of this nature are “typically built around a set of tangible leadership behaviors or competencies” (p. 716). This way of knowing leadership invites technically orientated approaches to evaluation. For example, beginning in the 1980s 360 feedback became increasingly popular, as individual leaders performance was evaluated according to an organizationally specific matrix of competencies and related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1523422312466835">Boyatzis, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1523422312466835">Conger &amp; Kanungo, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>However over the past 30 years, confidence that we can know leadership through studying successful leaders and therefore develop a matched set of competencies and behaviors and evaluate the outcomes by scientific means has been challenged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1523422312466835">Bolden &amp; Gosling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1523422312466835">Grint, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1523422312466835">2005</xref>). Moving away from the primacy of the individual and a focus on developing competencies and associated behaviors has involved engaging with leadership as a phenomenon that is not within individuals or enacted by individuals, but that exists between people. Leadership development that is influenced by the assumptions of relational and complexity theories must be shaped quite differently because now leadership is understood as an emergent outcome of fluid, uncertain, and complex relational situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1523422312466835">Hosking &amp; Bouwen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1523422312466835">Pfeffer, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1523422312466835">Stacey, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1523422312466835">Uhl-Bien, 2006</xref>). This is the leadership development that we describe as mindset work because underlying assumptions about the nature of the social world—particularly the work of leadership—are surfaced and potentially questioned. Leadership development from this perspective is characterized by unsettling and questioning established patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1523422312466835">Plowman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1523422312466835">Weick, 2007</xref>), testing assumptions and thought processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1523422312466835">Kegan &amp; Lahey, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1523422312466835">Petriglieri, 2012</xref>), and developing leadership practices that are attuned to a complex, indeterminate, and relational world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1523422312466835">Carroll, Levy, &amp; Richmond, 2008</xref>). This is the approach to leadership development that we would associate with mindset work.</p>

<title>Framing Mindset</title>
<p>We have followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1523422312466835">Rhinesmith (1992)</xref> who defines mindset as “A predisposition to see the world in a particular way . . . a filter through which we look at the world . . . a predisposition to perceive and reason in certain ways . . . a means of simplifying the environment and bringing to each new experience or event a preestablished frame of reference for understanding it” (p. 63). The language of mindset seems to have entered the field of leadership and organizational development as a way of characterizing changing assumptions and patterns of thinking associated with contemporary societal shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1523422312466835">Anderson &amp; Anderson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422312466835">Marshak &amp; Grant, 2008</xref>). For leadership this shift has included challenging the image of leadership as taming the dynamics of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1523422312466835">Smith &amp; Saint-Onge, 1996</xref>), and questioning rationalist assumptions, including the assumption that good leadership can be linked to stable, universal competencies, and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1523422312466835">Conger, 2010</xref>). Instead, leadership has been understood as engaging <italic>with</italic> change dynamics particularly, as complexity theorists argue, through “making sense of patterns in small changes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1523422312466835">Plowman &amp; Duchon, 2008</xref>, p. 144). One of the critical implications of these changes for leadership is that leadership work becomes inherently relational and situational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1523422312466835">D. Ladkin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1523422312466835">Uhl-Bien, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The difference between skillset and mindset can be situated within a landscape of shifting trends in social theory and philosophy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422312466835">Marshak and Grant (2008)</xref> outline these shifts with reference to the field of organizational development. They point to fundamental changes in thinking that have occurred since approximately 1980 and that are very relevant to leadership development. Marshak and Grant observe that the past 30 years has seen a significant departure from some of the founding principles of organizational development that they associate with the period 1950-1980 and describe as the <italic>classic</italic> period. They associate the classic period with the view that truth can be discovered and a view of change as something that can be planned and managed and that occurs in specific episodes that are quite distinct from periods of no change. The classic period is also associated with a behavioral view of change. These authors use the term <italic>new</italic> to distinguish the period from the 1980s onwards. They associate this period with the new sciences, with a view of truth as immanent and realities as socially constructed, a focus on mindsets rather than behavior, and a view of change that is continuous and ongoing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422312466835">Marshak &amp; Grant, 2008</xref>, p. S8). Finally, in Marshak and Grant’s schema the classic period is associated with “collecting and applying valid data,” which, by its compelling nature, is held as a critical enabler of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422312466835">Marshak &amp; Grant, 2008</xref>, p. S8). By contrast, in the ‘new’ organizational development, change is seen as arising out of new mindsets or social agreements. Thus although objective diagnostic material may still have a place, this is a partial place that needs to be mediated by beliefs, world views, and alternative data such as the data of contested meaning, hunches, and sense-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1523422312466835">Grint, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1523422312466835">Ladkin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1523422312466835">Weick, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1523422312466835">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1523422312466835">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the above comparison of classic and new eras helps to denote the evolution and shift of ideas over time it is important to recognize that ways of thinking do not stop short and start clean, nor do they usually exist as distinct, unified approaches. Nevertheless for the sake of clarity we continue to use the terms ‘classic’ and ‘new’ in discussing these historical shifts and their significance to leadership development. We would argue that skillset approaches to leadership development are oriented to principals that Marshak and Grant associate with the classic period, whereas a mindset orientation is associated with more recent ideas about the social world.</p>
<p>Assumptions from the classic period such as the view that the future can be known and that change can be planned and managed have been challenged by complexity theories arising from the new sciences and postmodern thought. A central principle of complexity approaches is that “people and groups interact and the results of those interactions produce perpetual novelty” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1523422312466835">Plowman et al., 2007</xref>, p. 342). Complexity theorists argue that “Leaders cannot control the future because in complex systems such as organizations, unpredictable and sometimes unexplainable internal dynamics will determine future conditions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1523422312466835">Marion &amp; Uhl-Bien, 2001</xref>, p. 391). These insights recommend a significant departure from traditional approaches to leadership development. When the world is held as stable and knowable then a finite set of skills, competencies, and related behaviors might be ascertained for leadership, learned in the development setting, and then applied to problems and challenges. Evaluative processes might then assess the extent to which this has been accomplished. Although an emphasis on leadership skills and competencies or socialization toward a vision presume that change of others can—and must—be managed, complexity perspectives argue that change is ongoing and self-generating. With that, the work of leadership also shifts. It is no longer concerned with managing change according to a known process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1523422312466835">Kotter, 1996</xref>), but with actually disrupting existing patterns to <italic>enable</italic> emergent futures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1523422312466835">Plowman &amp; Duchon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1523422312466835">D. Ladkin, 2010</xref>, p. 127).</p>
<p>This alternative understanding of change also suggests that “we must move from seeing leadership development as an event to an ongoing process without an actual end” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1523422312466835">Conger, 2010</xref>, p. 737). However changing orientations to change and a more dynamic, multiple view of the social world understand leadership as being “imbued with a notion of movement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1523422312466835">Pye, 2005</xref>, p. 35). This calls for leadership development that understands leadership as responsive to emerging situations, calling for more dynamic, contextualized approaches to evaluation. Indeed, when change is held as continuous, self-generating, and emergent rather than episodic and catalyzed from outside ordinary circumstances, quite different approaches to evaluation are called for.</p>

<title>Approaching Evaluation</title>
<p>The relationship between leadership development and evaluation exists at the intersections of a number of tensions and uncertainties. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1523422312466835">Conger (2010)</xref> warns that much leadership development “has never had the impact that their champions, designers, and sponsors aspire to have” (p. 709) and therefore has to contend with “strong pressure to show more immediate and tangible paybacks” (p. 712). However the business of evaluation also is “a frustrating business” with both “potential ineffectuality” and “stubborn invisibility” to contend with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1523422312466835">Saunders, 2006</xref>, p. 197). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422312466835">Ling (2012)</xref> asserts that the exercise of evaluation “is consistently becoming one of expensive failure” that “seem to start with optimism and end with modest or immeasurable outcomes” (p. 80). Together, leadership development and evaluation point to growing expectations (most often from sponsoring organizations) for more precision and certitude in terms of quantified value and impact, alongside an increasingly contested set of debates in the field of evaluation, particularly in relation to honoring “the messiness of human predicament” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1523422312466835">Schwandt, 1997</xref>, p. 78) and the “chronic uncertainty” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1523422312466835">Saunders, 2006</xref>, p. 208) that comprise organizational climates. Indeed complex and uncertain circumstances are demanding whole new directions in evaluation (notwithstanding leadership) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1523422312466835">Rogers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1523422312466835">Sanderson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1523422312466835">Stirling, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>As we have noted earlier we have followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422312466835">Chelimsky (1997)</xref> to frame evaluation as “knowledge-seeking that may also serve to build capacity and/ or establish worth” (p. 100). We note the “may,” “also” and “and/ or,” qualifiers and hesitations, themselves unusual in definitional statements, that suggest underlying definitional tensions when it comes to evaluation. In a widely quoted typology, Chelimsky outlines three kinds of evaluation logics: evaluation for accountability, development, and knowledge. These three perspectives are analytically useful, helping to break the tendency to treat evaluation as if it is a “monolithic” (Chelimsky, p. 104) by pointing toward three rather different systems of thought or filters for the evaluative enterprise. We therefore now turn to each of these to work at a mindset level with evaluation itself. We provide an example of each evaluative logic and consider their respective implicit theories of change.</p>
<sec id="section8-1523422312466835">
<title>Accountability Logic</title>
<p>Accountability logic seems strongest in the calls from organizations and researchers to be rigorous and clear about leadership development’s value proposition. This perspective “targets results” or “methods able to link findings to interventions as closely and conclusively as possible” and relies on “cause and effect” thinking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422312466835">Chelimsky (1997</xref>, p. 101). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1523422312466835">Schwandt (1997)</xref> has noted it is easy to believe that accountability is in fact the only logic for evaluation. Accountability is a beguiling logic suggesting that we can “just find out what works on the basis of the evidence and adopt that approach” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1523422312466835">Saunders, 2006</xref>, p. 206).</p>
<p>We would relate accountability logic with a skillset orientation to leadership development because of its reliance on “a knowing-how” which “involves a concatenation of ideas about bias, control, authority and expertise, individual calculation, effective technique, and instrumentalism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1523422312466835">Schwandt, 1997</xref>, p. 74). Indeed, traditionally models for evaluation (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422312466835">Kearns, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1523422312466835">Kirkpatrick, 1998</xref>) have used the language of training as opposed to development, thereby invoking a skillset approach to leadership development and its evaluation. Behaviorally oriented models of leadership and related approaches to leadership development have been particularly amenable to this logic because from a behavioral perspective “the purpose of leadership and management development is to ensure the development of the most appropriate style of leadership and achieving a universal level of best practice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1523422312466835">Bolden, 2005</xref>, p. 5).</p>
<p>This logic is consistent with the classic period outlined earlier, being consistent with “the modernist paradigm of reason” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1523422312466835">Schwandt, 1997</xref>, p. 71), beliefs in “discoverable . . . objective reality and rational, analytic processes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422312466835">Marshak &amp; Grant, 2008</xref>, p. S8) and involving an implicit theory of change wherein the social world is held as stable and change is produced by acting upon that world in knowing ways. Indeed, evaluation for accountability has been associated with a set of instrumental tools designed for “incredible certitude” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422312466835">Ling, 2012</xref>, p. 89) and that are consistent with a truth that is “transcendent and discoverable” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422312466835">Marshak &amp; Grant, 2008</xref>, p. S8). Although we recognize the contribution of this logic we also want to problematize it. Indeed this logic is particularly important because it directs attention to what happens beyond the learning environment and asks us to grapple with vital questions related to outcomes and return on investment. We have problematized this perspective to bring visibility to the “virtually transparent assumptions that drive this perspective most of the time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1523422312466835">Schwandt, 1997</xref>, p. 70). However we see this logic as a vital dimension of evaluation in leadership development particularly when brought into conversation with the other perspectives.</p>
<p>An example of this logic is provided by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1523422312466835">Avolio &amp; Bass, 1998</xref>) in their preliminary evaluation of a leadership development program. The title of this article “You can drag a horse to water but you can’t make it drink unless it’s thirsty” immediately suggests that leadership is centered around individual characteristics, and that the development of leadership is concerned with attitude and behavioral change. The image of a horse being “dragged” or otherwise being motivated by thirst also suggests that the work of a leadership development program includes managing behavioral change and the conditions for such change. Therefore we briefly consider each of these points to illustrate characteristics of an accountability logic and assumptions that are associated with the classic period in Marshak and Grant’s terms.</p>
<p>Avolio and Bass examine the “impact of a leadership development on pre and post ratings of the multi factor leadership questionnaire” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1523422312466835">1998</xref>, p. 4) in a program informed by principals of transformational leadership. Participants rated themselves and were also rated by their “followers back home” on four components of transformational leadership along with a full range of leadership styles including those that are described as (p. 8) “lower end.” Those at the lower end include transactional and “laissez-faire leadership” and extend to “the absence or avoidance of leadership.” The questionnaire was completed by 66 participants and was readministered 6 months after the program had ended.</p>
<p>Inherent in this approach to evaluation is a view of leadership being related to known individual characteristics and related behaviors. This way of knowing leadership has direct implications for how development is understood, practiced, and evaluated. Indeed, once the characteristics of leadership are known and when less effective ways of enacting leadership practice are also identified, it follows that evaluation should be concerned with discovering the extent to which participants demonstrate the desired characteristics and how their performance might be improved. Thus Bass and Avolio state “the objective of the training was to increase the frequency of the use of transformational leadership . . . ” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1523422312466835">1998</xref>, p. 8). This way of thinking offers a clarity that may be particularly appealing for sponsors of leadership development.</p>
<p>The second point we consider in relationship to this way of knowing leadership that is entailed in Bass and Avolio’s study is the implication for how leadership is developed. An important issue that we return to in relationship to the third logic (evaluation for knowledge) concerns distinct differences in the language of leadership development and what this means for practice. In Bass and Avolio’s study, leadership development is consistently referred to in the language of “training.” Their core program is described in terms of “education as well as skills based training” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1523422312466835">1998</xref>, p. 9). Framing leadership development work as training reinforces an assumption that development is concerned with a behavioral repertoire rather than underlying beliefs and how these shape practice. Thus this seems to call for facilitator capabilities that we would associate more with teaching and coaching than with facilitating conversation and group intervention.</p>
<p>Consistent with this behavioral focus is a view of change that can “be created, planned, and managed” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422312466835">Marshak &amp; Grant, 2008</xref>, p. S8). Accordingly, Bass and Avolio describe interventions aimed at “getting the horse to drink.” They emphasize the role of “intentions to implement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1523422312466835">1998</xref>, p. 5) among participants and the importance of building those intentions. They propose a number of interventions that help with this; most particularly individual leadership development plans that are held as living documents and that include measurable, actionable goals. Entailed in this argument is a rationalist view of change whereby change is managed on the strength of plans and intentions. This is quite different than the view of change that we associate with mindset-oriented programs where “change is continuous and self-organizing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422312466835">Marshak &amp; Grant, 2008</xref>, p. S8) and that is far less amenable to taming “the unruly social world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1523422312466835">Schwandt, 2000</xref>, p. 215). The development perspective, that we consider next is more comfortable with the “contingency, situational specificity, inherent openness, and ambiguity of evaluation as a human activity” (p. 218).</p>

<title>The Development Perspective</title>
<p>The development perspective in Chelimsky’s typology reflects a shift from “attribution to contribution” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422312466835">Ling, 2012</xref>, p. 87) where the evaluator moves to being “a partner . . . rather than independent assessor of value” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422312466835">Chelimsky, 1997</xref>, p. 102). In this vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1523422312466835">Saunders (2006</xref>, p. 207) understands evaluation as “part of social capital building” where evaluation is understood as taking “place within a set of social practices” or “cultural orientation” with the purpose of supporting learning. Schwandt characterizes this social capital building as akin to developing a critical intelligence between the intervention or program and the site: “The evaluator works more as a partner: generating supplementary perspectives, enabling conversations, introducing new ideas about evaluation logic, and facilitating examination and critique” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1523422312466835">Schwandt, 1997</xref>, p.79). Such a perspective highlights the relationship of evaluation to reflective practice and adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422312466835">Ling, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1523422312466835">Saunders, 2006</xref>). When evaluation is seen as an exploration of what is useful and what works, then such “processes of judgment are profoundly evaluative” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1523422312466835">Saunders, 2006</xref>, p. 207). Thus the development perspective understands a social as well as technical dimension, or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1523422312466835">Schwandt (1997</xref>, p. 77), quoting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1523422312466835">Shotter (1993</xref>, p. 19), refers to as “a knowing-from” or “the kind of knowledge one has from within a situation, a group a social institution or a society.” Evaluation for development is characterized by real time (evaluation that is concurrent with the intervention), formative, contingent, experimental, incremental, and inherently reflexive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422312466835">Ling, 2012</xref>) dimensions. Chelimsky points to a certain “incomprehension” that accompanies “this internal collaboration aspect” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422312466835">1997</xref>, p. 102) from some sections of the evaluation community where such a mindset offers a truly radical challenge akin to “suspending belief in a way of thinking about what it means to be rational and reasonable in evaluation practice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1523422312466835">Schwandt, 1997</xref>, p. 70).</p>
<p>Saunders and his colleagues have used evaluation for knowledge in ways that have brought facilitative and evaluative dimensions to major organizational change processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1523422312466835">Saunders, et al., 2005</xref>). Consequently their practices of evaluation also exemplifies the logic of development. It is the developmental perspective contained in their evaluation of change projects that we draw on here as an example of this logic. These authors describe using evaluative practices to help understand the role of evaluation itself when new information and communication technology was introduced to 10 relatively different tertiary education institutions across Europe. In evaluating major change initiatives the evaluators asked key change agents in the project deceptively simple questions related to “what they were doing and on what basis” (p. 40). By asking these questions the evaluators could track the varied and shifting sense-making that was at work in processes of change while the conversation helped change agents to reflect on their experience. Saunders and his colleagues argue that evaluation under circumstances such as these functions as a bridging tool (p. 40) between established and new, just-forming modes of practice. These authors contend that bridging tools are particularly important for negotiating change in complex, fast changing environments. Interestingly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422312466835">Ling (2012)</xref> makes a similar argument about the usefulness of surfacing theories of change through what he describes as participants “contribution stories” (p. 87). These are evaluative conversations “that aim to surface and outline how those involved in the intervention understand the causal pathways connecting the intervention to intended outcomes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422312466835">Ling, 2012</xref>, p. 87). Carol Weiss has also argued that evaluation of social programs should be grounded in the program’s implicit theories of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1523422312466835">Weiss, 1995</xref>, p. 66).</p>
<p>In the projects reported by Saunders, Charlier, and Botany, students experienced the bridging of worlds as they moved from one set of practices to another with all the attendant shifts and disruptions to everyday life and meaning-making in the context of their organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1523422312466835">Saunders, et al., 2005</xref>). The process of evaluation served to capture the “rehearsals, examples, metaphors, typologies, vignettes, cases, accounts, platforms, ways of working, principles of procedures, routines, that is, depictions and can both evoke and enable the experience of boundary crossing, provides <italic>provisional stability</italic> for change: that is to say, it acts as a bridge” (Saunders, et al., p. 42). In other words, the evaluation process created a transitional site where dimensions of the development experience could be considered and potentially consolidated. The construct of provisional stability invites quite a different orientation to evaluation than that of an accountability logic. Provisional stability draws attention to what is on the move and this is held as provisional rather than accomplished. This sense of movement suggests that new practices will wobble. They might grow stronger, weaken, or be abandoned and these situations can also change. The development perspective itself holds a dynamic view of change where new practices are considered with respect to ongoing processes of adaption, loss, and transformation within contexts of established practice.</p>
<p>Exploring implicit theories of change or contribution stories is an approach to evaluation that is congruent with a mindset approach to leadership development and that could be particularly helpful in evaluations with a developmental purpose. Pursuing implicit theories of change would enable different assumptions about leadership development—such as those that presume development practices are for the purpose of building human capital and those that hold leadership development in terms of building a collective leadership capacity to become apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422312466835">Day, 2001</xref>). Enquiries such as these would potentially bring much greater criticality and reflexivity to processes of selecting and designing leadership development initiatives, enabling key people (organizational sponsors, facilitators, participants) to recognize and address critical tensions with respect to what is envisaged and expected. Thus practitioners could “see themselves as students and researchers of their own evaluative practices” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1523422312466835">Schwandt, 2000</xref>, p. 218). Evaluation for development is closely linked with developing wisdom in everyday practice. The third perspective to which we now turn, evaluation for knowledge is quite different because in the first instance, it is not concerned with questions of use or applicability.</p>

<sec id="section10-1523422312466835">
<title>Evaluation for Knowledge</title>
<p>Evaluation for knowledge brings evaluation together with the purposes and processes of research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422312466835">Chelimsky (1997</xref>, p. 103) depicts this kind of evaluation as closely allied to not only researcher interests and agendas but analytic and scientific processes of “substantive and methodological expertise.” For Chelimsky the overall purpose of evaluation for knowledge is to generate understanding although in her discussion what constitutes understanding seems a purely analytic construct. However <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1523422312466835">Schwandt (1997</xref>, p. 77) draws on a hermeneutic tradition to view understanding as “an adventure” because it is associated with “a dilemma or mystery that requires interpretation and self-understanding.” Thus evaluation for knowledge is reframed as “dialogical encounters” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1523422312466835">1997</xref>, p. 76) demanding continuous interpretation. Saunders usefully extends this reframe by asking us to think about evaluation for knowledge as “a boundary-object” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1523422312466835">2006</xref>, p. 213) that creates a space for different actors to sense-make and learn from each other. Consequently an evaluation might provide an ongoing research trajectory for a researcher, might open a series of conversations on the impact of the program for participants or serve as a resource for reflection and planning for the greater organization. Saunders sees this perspective as one “that expansively marshals ‘knowledge’” rather than merely capturing it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1523422312466835">Saunders, 2006</xref>, p. 213). It is this call to “marshal knowledge” that has the potential to radically shift our evaluative gaze and practices.</p>
<p>We draw from research of an 18-month in-house leadership development program reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422312466835">Carroll and Simpson (2012)</xref> as an example of evaluation for knowledge. This program clearly focuses on leadership development as distinct from leader development, considering leadership as an “emergent relational practice within the specific context of online development conversations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422312466835">Carroll &amp; Simpson, 2012</xref>, p. 1284). These authors adopt a relational epistemological perspective and a processual ontology, holding relationships as always “in the making” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1523422312466835">Uhl-Bien, 2006</xref>, p. 661, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422312466835">Carroll &amp; Simpson, 2012</xref>, p. 1287). This approach contributes to an evaluative stance that is curious and involved and that by virtue of its assumptions, rules out the possibility of rational, analytic outsider approaches to evaluation.</p>
<p>Carroll and Simpson track postings as participants converse with one another in an online forum that was specifically designated for their leadership development, and supported by program facilitators. They follow processes of framing as participants move from one frame to another, working actively within and between frames in an effort to bring leadership to life in the context of their organization. In the first phase of the research, this tracking occurs in conversation between the principal researcher, who was also a facilitator, and other facilitators, program participants, and with participants’ permission, their senior team. These conversations enabled insights from evaluative work to shape participants’ and facilitators’ sense-making in real time, thereby contributing to participants leadership practice and to face to face conversations including those occurring in workshops. In the second phase of the research framing work is captured as movement as participants’ kindle new frames, stretch their existing frames, and span across frames, enabling shared meanings to emerge and shift. Thus, we would see this inquiry as aligned with one of key purposes of evaluative practice that is “understanding organizations and how they learn” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422312466835">Chelimsky, 1997</xref>, p. 99)</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1523422312466835">Chelimsky (2008)</xref> notes when the purpose of evaluation for knowledge is to produce new information, its pragmatic use is not the point. This is important because when evaluators are not constrained by criteria related to future use they have more freedom to raise questions that touch on “popular beliefs and powerful, entrenched interests” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422312466835">Chelimsky, 1997</xref>, p. 105). We see questions of this nature arising from Carroll and Simpson’s research. For example this research could be used to question the assumptions about the nature of facilitation in leadership development. Most obviously, their research would support the argument that it is no longer tenable to miss or gloss over distinctions between the work of facilitation and that of training. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422312466835">Carroll and Simpson (2012)</xref> describe the studied program in terms of mindset work because it invites participants to work at the level of assumptions “rather than the behaviors that arise from them” (p. 1302). Indeed, they move well beyond skillset and behavioral approaches to leadership development to deal with assumptions that “ . . . cut right through rational, logical, and detached selves to reveal and inflame what is felt” (p. 1302). The authors point out that “on line learning sites cannot be approached primarily as sites of content transmission and acquisition” (p. 1305), that are associated with training and skill development.</p>
<p>The logic of evaluation for knowledge may also “serve to build capacity for better performance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422312466835">Chelimsky, 1997</xref>, p. 100). In other words, it is possible that evaluation for knowledge can contribute to other evaluative logics. For example, developing knowledge about the complexities of shared sense-making and the processes that enable shifts in meaning between people in conversation can bring more clarity to the nature of facilitation practices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422312466835">Carroll and Simpson’s (2012)</xref> study potentially brings some visibility to the differences between facilitator practices that are focused on skill development and building individual leadership competencies and those that are related more to issues of relationality and mindset.</p>

<sec id="section11-1523422312466835">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>Given evaluation use is a major source of debate in evaluation theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422312466835">Chelimsky, 1997</xref>) then the opportunity for evaluation to shape practice is the place we would like to close this discussion. The approach to evaluation we consider here not only brings new or unfamiliar roles and new conceptual territory into the evaluative enterprise but also invites different language such as provisional stabilities into the development setting and sees leadership development as a system interdependent with other systems potentially asking providers, sponsors, and participants to know themselves differently in relationship to one another (partners, drivers of future change, innovation collaborators).</p>
<p>Therefore we first suggest that an evaluative mindset (lens/ filter/ predisposition) be brought both more expansively and intentionally to the range of activities, conversations, and events that already comprise leadership development. The process of research and writing for this review has shown us that activities belonging to development (reflecting on conversation, identifying assumptions, and implicit theories of change) and research (the study of frames and movement within and between frames) both contribute to evaluative dimensions along with activities associated with an accountability logic that we have typically associated with evaluation. Although we have not pursued a strong accountability agenda, we have defaulted to many of its premises in the way that we have approached questions of building capacity and establishing worth in our programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422312466835">Chelimsky, 1997</xref>, p. 100). Until now, we have not teased out the assumptions entailed in popular evaluative rhetoric such as “What matters is what works” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1523422312466835">Sanderson, 2003</xref>, p. 331). Indeed, although the literature points toward the potential in all three evaluative logics, in our experience many formative evaluative practices become mini or interim versions of accountability logics and methodologies. The logics of development and knowledge thus have the capacity to reframe and redirect our gaze to a host of real-time and ongoing moments which bring participants and organizations into conversation about leadership work and its implications. So the first implication of this inquiry is that there are all sorts of spaces and opportunities for evaluative work. We hope this inquiry helps the relevant stakeholders to begin seeing and reframing those opportunities.</p>
<p>Second we propose an active and mutual dynamic between accountability, development, and research evaluative logics, suggesting that all three can play their part in leadership development. In this discussion we have seen that an accountability logic heralds strong assumptions associated with instrumental rationality and the classic era. Recognizing the strength and pervasiveness of these assumptions reveals the importance of not only being able to converse in the language of accountability but also become clear and articulate about other logics and what they can contribute. We would argue that data from an accountability perspective can be used not only for assessment but to stimulate reflective and sense-making processes, which in turn can shift this data into the development frame. Indeed, the process of writing this article has fuelled our own understanding of the epistemological differences between ways of understanding leadership, development practice, and evaluation. Research activity, often undertaken external or subsequent to development interventions, holds a similar capacity especially in terms of revealing assumptions or judgments that lurk underneath discussions and activities, often requiring specialized methodologies to make them accessible. If we think of accountability, development, and research evaluative practices as being able to be brought together in dialogue then we will bring different kinds of evaluative data into conversation with each other.</p>
<p>Third, each of these logics points to the necessity for the development program/intervention itself and the broader organization to be brought into conversation with each other. Consequently we would see that bridging new mindsets and practices into the organization is a critical area for future evaluative practice. Indeed much of the work for providers and organizational sponsors/champions lies at the interface or boundary of program and organization. The concept of creating a provisional stability between established and emerging practices that we associated with the evaluation for development, directs our attention to this work. All too often we propose, our interventions create distinctive and appealing spaces for organizational members or groups to think, relate and act differently together but that are hard to realize beyond the boundaries of the intervention. The concept of provisional stability helps to draw attention to how new ideas and practices move as they are rewoven—and unraveled—in the course of day-to-day organizational life. Our understanding of evaluation for development and for knowledge helps us to recognize that a range of small and often anecdotal genres are nevertheless evaluative. Such data can help “create a new organizational framework for action” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1523422312466835">Saunders, et al., 2005</xref>, p. 50), and can be seen as “embodiments of the change process” (Saunders, et al., p. 50) which scaffold individuals, groups, and organizations through an inevitable transition terrain where they lose “the taken-for-granted certainty of acknowledged rules which shape daily lives” (Saunders, et al., p. 47) to take “small onward steps” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1523422312466835">Saunders, 2006</xref>, p. 213) to a changed future.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have suggested that mindset work is required not only of participants in development programs but in terms of the taken for granted perspectives and practices that shape program evaluation. Our inquiry has gone back to the theoretical assumptions inherent in evaluation as a discipline so that evaluative choices and practices can be approached with greater clarity, dynamism, and purpose for those integral to leadership development. Above all we would like leadership development to take up the call to marshal, not just capture, the knowledge gained from evaluation technologies and processes. Our reading of contemporary trends and shifts in both the fields of evaluation and leadership suggests that evaluation is central to the change that development interventions are seeking to make, and that all too often we boundary off our resources and roles so that important knowledge is excluded from the conversation. Complexity theories reminds us that there is no way to be outside the systems one hopes to effect, yet leadership development evaluation often speaks as if from outside and to the exclusion of other logics. As a team of authors, facilitators, and researchers we have limited and bounded our roles in this way. Our intent with this inquiry is to set out a theoretical and practice platform for others and ourselves to align theories of change with all aspects of development practice.</p>
