<sec id="section1-0363546513482567">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Numerous variations of ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) reconstruction have been described since the original technique by Jobe et al.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513482567">
<title>Purpose/Hypothesis:</title>
<p>To biomechanically compare the new TightRope technique and the traditional ulnar bone tunnels as used in the docking technique. The hypothesis was that the TightRope technique would exhibit improved kinematics and comparable failure properties.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513482567">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Controlled laboratory study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513482567">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Seven matched pairs of cadaveric arms (mean age, 44.71 years) were tested in both the native state and reconstructed state. Kinematics were assessed at 15° to 90° of flexion by applying a 1.5-N·m valgus torque and measuring the resultant angular displacement. Failure testing was performed by loading to failure at 4.5 deg/s in 70° of flexion. Sides of a matched pair were randomized to the TightRope (TR) and docking (DO) techniques after testing the native state.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513482567">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>There was no significant difference in kinematic results between the native state and reconstructed state in either the TR or DO group at 15° to 75° of flexion. At 90°, the TR group had significantly higher angular displacement (2.23° ± 1.0°) compared with the native state (1.31° ± 0.7°) (<italic>P</italic> = .020). The TR-reconstructed specimens had significantly lower initial stiffness (49.34 ± 19.3 N·m/rad vs 82.47 ± 36.0 N·m/rad, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .007) and total stiffness (53.81 ± 27.8 N·m/rad vs 101.06 ± 34.4 N·m/rad, respectively; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) than did the paired native specimens. In addition, the TR-reconstructed specimens had significantly lower torsional torque at 5° of valgus rotation (mean, 4.61 ± 2.2 N·m vs 7.62 ± 3.7 N·m, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .010), at 15° of valgus rotation (12.24 ± 4.4 N·m vs 20.65 ± 6.8 N·m, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .002), and at ultimate failure (19.18 ± 7.5 N·m vs 25.42 ± 7.1 N·m, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .025) than did the paired native specimens. There was no significant difference in torsional torque between the TR and DO groups at 5° of valgus rotation (4.61 ± 2.2 N·m vs 4.09 ± 1.7 N·m, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .644), at 15° of valgus rotation (12.24 ± 4.4 N·m vs 17.94 ± 7.23 N·m, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .178), or at failure (19.18 ± 7.5 N·m vs 23.19 ± 10.6 N·m, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .444). The DO group exhibited significantly higher angular displacement at failure than did the native state (28.12° ± 8.5° vs 18.04° ± 4.8°, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .009), but there was no difference at 3 N·m of loading. There was no significant difference in angular displacement either at 3 N·m or at failure between the native state and reconstructed state in the TR group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546513482567">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Both the TR and DO techniques restored native joint kinematics from 15° to 75° of flexion under low loading conditions. While the TR technique exhibited inferior failure torque compared with the native state, the DO technique did not differ from the native state. No differences were found between the TR and DO groups when compared directly. The DO technique restored valgus stability under high loading to a greater extent than did the TR technique but also failed at higher angular displacement.</p>

<sec id="section7-0363546513482567">
<title>Clinical Relevance:</title>
<p>Strong postoperative UCL reconstruction fixation is important to restore ulnotrochlear joint stability. Our study demonstrates that the new TR technique has comparable kinematic and failure properties to the traditional DO technique.</p>

<p>The anterior bundle of the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) provides the elbow with stability against valgus stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513482567">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513482567">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513482567">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513482567">23</xref></sup> In overhead-throwing athletes, the UCL is critical in withstanding the large stresses placed on the medial aspect of the elbow,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513482567">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513482567">37</xref></sup> and injuries to this structure are specifically devastating and well described in pitchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513482567">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513482567">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Insufficiency of the UCL in the throwing athlete has been treated nonoperatively in the past<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513482567">27</xref></sup> but has been associated with a low rate of return to play, as Rettig and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513482567">27</xref></sup> have shown in their cohort of nonoperatively treated UCL injuries. Only 42% of throwers were back to the previous level of play after an average of 24 weeks of rest and rehabilitation. Higher rates of return to play have been documented with UCL reconstructions, starting with Jobe et al’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513482567">17</xref></sup> original UCL reconstruction demonstrating a 62.5% rate of return (10/16 patients). A 92% rate of return (33/36) was observed using the docking technique by Altchek and colleagues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513482567">28</xref></sup> Studies by Conway et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513482567">8</xref></sup> Azar et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513482567">3</xref></sup> and Thompson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513482567">35</xref></sup> report a rate of return to the previous level of competition or higher of 68% (38/56), 81% (48/59), and 82% (27/33), respectively.</p>
<p>While the aforementioned studies demonstrate good clinical results, UCL reconstruction continues to evolve. Surgical procedures are progressing to more anatomic, less invasive techniques. A plethora of techniques have been tested following Jobe et al’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513482567">17</xref></sup> original description. These newer techniques vary in their use of interference screws, single- and double-stranded grafts, cortical buttons, and various bone tunnel placements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513482567">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513482567">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513482567">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513482567">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513482567">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546513482567">32</xref></sup> Clinically, outcomes such as return to sport, the low incidence of complications such as ulnar neuropathy and joint stiffness, and various functional outcomes scores have demonstrated the success of UCL reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513482567">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513482567">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513482567">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513482567">36</xref></sup> Laboratory biomechanics can give valuable insight into the immediate postoperative strength, stiffness, and laxity of a given technique, and numerous studies have assessed the biomechanics of UCL reconstructions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513482567">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513482567">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513482567">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513482567">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513482567">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513482567">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546513482567">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Placement of the ulnar fixation completely within the native UCL footprint is desirable, as it aims to re-create native mechanics while limiting soft tissue dissection and requiring only 1 reamed socket as opposed to drilling 2 cortical defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513482567">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513482567">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513482567">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513482567"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513482567">20</xref></sup> However, previous techniques that used the native UCL footprint as an insertion site have often incorporated the use of an interference screw,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513482567">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513482567">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513482567">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513482567">20</xref></sup> which can cause graft shredding,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513482567">2</xref></sup> limit soft tissue healing by reducing the contact area between the graft and bone, and displace the graft to one side of the tunnel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513482567">33</xref></sup> A new technique with the ACL TightRope (Arthrex, Naples, Florida) utilizes a cortical button with tensioning sutures in a single–ulnar tunnel construct. The sutures are self-reinforcing, whereby the fixation suture loop shortens and tightens when alternating tension is applied to the tensioning suture limbs of the construct. Furthermore, cortical suspension places the graft directly against the ulnar bone without an interference screw occupying the region of healing.</p>
<p>This study aimed to biomechanically assess the biomechanics and failure properties of the new TightRope technique in comparison with traditional bone tunnels used in the docking technique. We hypothesized that the TightRope technique would yield improved kinematics and fixation strength while allowing fixation to be within the anatomic footprint of the native UCL.</p>

<title>Sample Information</title>
<p>Seven matched pairs of fresh-frozen human cadaveric arms (2 male, 5 female; mean age, 44.71 ± 15.8 years; range, 16-60 years) with no known history of any kind of musculoskeletal disorder were utilized in this study. All specimens were stored at −20°C until testing and underwent only 1 freeze-thaw cycle. The humerus and ulna/radius were exposed and embedded in a cylindrical potting compound (polyester resin, Evercoat, Cincinnati, Ohio). Each matched pair was first tested in its native state to assess native biomechanics, and each extremity was then randomized to either the docking (DO) or the TightRope (TR) reconstruction group. Fresh-frozen bovine extensor tendons were utilized as reconstruction grafts to standardize graft strength. Tendons were trimmed using a sharp No. 15 blade scalpel to a diameter of 4.0 mm, which was sized and verified using a graft sizing guide (Arthrex). All dissections and surgical procedures were performed by 2 fellowship-trained orthopaedic sports medicine specialists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0363546513482567">
<title>Humeral Side of the UCL Reconstruction</title>
<p>The reconstruction technique of the humeral side of both experimental groups was kept consistent. The overlying medial soft tissue was dissected. The anterior, lateral, and posterior soft tissue was left intact, while the flexor pronator mass was stripped for visualization of the entire anterior band of the UCL. Next, an incision was created in the capsule along the anterior border of the UCL to remove any biomechanical reinforcement that the capsule may add to the anterior bundle of the UCL. Once testing of the native UCL was completed, all specimens were inspected to rule out fractures or deformations, and the elbows were randomized. A 5-mm socket was drilled to a depth of 15 mm from distal to proximal at the humeral footprint of the anterior bundle of the UCL. Then, a C-Ring guide (Arthrex) was used to direct 2 converging 2-mm drill holes in a proximal to distal direction. Both of these drill holes were anterior to the intermuscular septum. Two loops of suture were then passed using a Hewson suture passer and secured at the humeral footprint for later graft passage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513482567">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Ulnar Side of the DO UCL Reconstruction</title>
<p>A UCL guide (Arthrex) was placed on the sublime tubercle 6 mm distal to the joint line. The ulna was drilled using a guide, creating 4-mm bone tunnels separated by 7 mm on the cortex. The graft ends were whipstitched using No. 2 FiberWire (Arthrex). A wire loop was used to pass the tendon through the bone tunnels. Next, 1 whipstitched end of the graft was pulled into the humeral socket by 1 suture loop. Graft length was estimated in 30° of flexion with a varus force. The proposed length was marked, and the tendon was cut 1 cm proximal to this demarcation and whipstitched. The graft was then passed into the humeral socket with the remaining suture loop. Consistent with the surgical description of the DO technique,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513482567">28</xref></sup> the elbow was placed in 30° of flexion with a varus force, and the 4 suture limbs were tied with 4 square knots and then an additional 3 square knots with a single suture from each limb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513482567">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section12-0363546513482567">
<title>TR UCL Reconstruction</title>
<p>A 3.5-mm spade-tipped guide pin (Arthrex) was placed on the sublime tubercle 6 mm distal to the joint line at the location of the native UCL footprint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513482567">10</xref></sup> The guide pin was initially directed perpendicular to the sublime tubercle, and a 5-mm cannulated reamer (Arthrex) was then used over the spade-tipped guide wire to create the ulnar socket. It was then directed at 30° in both the sagittal and coronal planes, as described by Lee et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513482567">19</xref></sup> to create a hole in the lateral ulnar cortex. Injury to the proximal radioulnar joint and damage to the guide pin was avoided by passing carefully through the opposite cortex. The tendon graft was threaded through the Arthrex button after the end was whipstitched with No. 2 FiberWire suture, and the TightRope was advanced to the opposite cortex using the guide pin with an eyelet. The button was flipped on the opposite cortex, and this was confirmed using dissection. The whipstitched end of the graft was then passed into the humeral socket. This end of the graft was held in place. Next, the TightRope at the ulnar side was tensioned to position the graft into the socket. The elbow was placed in 30° of flexion with an applied varus force, and the 4 suture limbs were tied with 4 square knots and then an additional 3 square knots on each single suture from each limb. Final tensioning was performed by alternating tension on the TightRope sutures to fully seat the graft in the socket while the varus force remained on the elbow. The TightRope sutures were then tied with 4 square knots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513482567">Figure 1, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513482567">C</xref>).</p>

<title>Kinematic Testing</title>
<p>Specimens were mounted rigidly in neutral forearm rotation in a mechanical testing apparatus that was able to apply a given torque or angular displacement to the humerus to induce valgus displacement and a resulting valgus stress to the elbow. Testing was performed on a biaxial servohydraulic materials testing machine (Mini Bionix II, MTS, Eden Prairie, Minnesota). The testing apparatus enables both the humeral and ulnar/radial resin pots to be rigidly clamped while enabling elbow flexion of 15° to 90° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513482567">Figure 2</xref>). Biomechanical testing of UCL reconstructions using torsion about the humerus has been previously published and demonstrated to be representative of anatomic loading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513482567">29</xref></sup> To assess the kinematics of the native UCL and the 2 reconstruction techniques, each specimen underwent a kinematic testing protocol. Specimens underwent a preload of 0.2 N·m, preconditioning with 10 loading-unloading cycles of 5° of valgus rotation (ie, humeral internal rotation) at a rate of 4.5 deg/s, 1 loading-unloading cycle of 7.5° of valgus rotation at a rate of 4.5 deg/s to assess hysteresis, and a 60-second preload of 0.2 N·m followed by a 1.5-N·m valgus torque applied at a rate of 0.5 N·m/s to assess angular displacement. This torque was held for 5 seconds, and the angular displacement was recorded at that time. This protocol was performed at 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75°, and 90° of flexion. Flexion angles were confirmed using a goniometer. The native ligament or reconstructions were kept moist during the entire testing period by spraying them with normal saline solution. All testing was performed at room temperature.</p>

<title>Failure Testing</title>
<p>After the specimens were tested to assess kinematics, failure testing was performed by preloading each specimen to 0.2 N·m for 10 seconds and applying a valgus rotation to failure at 4.5 deg/s in 70° of elbow flexion. Failure was characterized by a drastic drop in torsional torque recorded by the load cell, at which point the test was terminated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0363546513482567">
<title>Data and Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data were sampled at 100 Hz during each test. Kinematic testing data sets were utilized to obtain the torque at the peak of the 10th conditioning cycle at each elbow flexion angle, the hysteresis, defined as the energy dissipated by the ligament or graft during a loading-unloading cycle, and the angular displacement due to an applied 1.5-N·m valgus torque. Hysteresis was calculated by subtracting the area under the curve of the unloading curve from the area under the curve of the loading curve on a torsional torque versus radian plot. Failure testing data sets were utilized to obtain stiffness, torque, and angular displacement variables during failure testing. Stiffness can be calculated by deriving the slope of the linear region of a load/torque displacement graph. Initial stiffness is defined as the stiffness between 1 to 3 N·m and corresponds to the toe region of the torque displacement graphs. Total stiffness was calculated in the linear elongation region, which was generally found between approximately 5 N·m and immediately before the yield point. Torsional torque was analyzed at both 5° and 15° of valgus rotation as well as at ultimate failure. Five degrees of rotation was chosen to analyze torque at a low displacement point. Fifteen degrees of rotation was chosen because this was the highest point at which all but 1 torque displacement graph remained linear and corresponds to high prefailure displacement. Failure torsional torque was defined as the highest point before a rapid decrease in torque. Angular displacement was analyzed as a measure of joint laxity at 3 N·m, to analyze low loading laxity, and at ultimate failure.</p>
<p>Differences in each assessed variable between the native state and reconstructed state were determined using repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA).

<title>Failure Modes</title>
<p>Failure mode analysis revealed that the predominant mode of failure of both the TR and DO groups was at the tendon-suture interface at the humeral side. The whipstitched suture pulled/cut through the tendon graft, allowing for elongation of the reconstruction and ultimate failure. This occurred in 6 TR specimens and 5 DO specimens. One specimen in the TR group exhibited a knot slippage at the proximal aspect of the construct. One specimen in the DO group exhibited a bony bridge fracture of the ulna. Notably, this fracture occurred where the graft pulled through the bony bridge created by intersecting bone tunnels on the sublime tubercle. As previously mentioned, 1 specimen in the DO group exhibited a distal humerus fracture during native failure testing and was therefore excluded from further tests.</p>

<p>Several studies have tested the biomechanics of UCL reconstruction. Varying testing protocols make direct comparisons of absolute results difficult.

Ciccotti et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513482567">7</xref></sup> demonstrated failures of the native UCL at 14.9 N·m, a value much lower than the 24.4 ± 9.1 N·m found in our study.

Additionally, there was a large difference in the mean specimen age (79.2 years compared with our 44.7 years). Lee et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513482567">19</xref></sup> demonstrated failures of the native UCL at 24.6 ± 10.6 N·m, a value comparable with our data.

Stiffness of the native specimens found in our study (99.4 ± 32.1 N·m/rad) can also be compared with those of previous studies. Lee and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513482567">19</xref></sup> demonstrated a stiffness of native specimens of 137.5 ± 51.5 N·m/rad (2.4 ± 0.9 N·m/deg), and Ruland et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513482567">29</xref></sup> reported approximately 114.59 N·m/rad (~2 N·m/deg).

Lee et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513482567">19</xref></sup> reported the ultimate torque and stiffness of a reconstruction utilizing a suspension button fixation technique to be 10.3 ± 5.7 N·m and 63.02 ± 22.9 N·m/rad, respectively. Ruland et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513482567">29</xref></sup> tested 2 variations on the DO technique and a reconstruction employing a semitendinosus graft passing through bicortical ulnar bone tunnels.

<p>The ulnar bone tunnels, as used in the DO technique, have been a popular comparison group in studies assessing UCL reconstruction. Our results show that both the DO and TR techniques exhibit a pattern of increasing valgus torque with increasing flexion, corresponding to the behavior of native valgus stability, a finding consistent with previous literature on UCL biomechanics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513482567">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513482567">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513482567">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546513482567">38</xref></sup> We did not demonstrate a difference in elbow laxity during kinematic testing between the native state and the DO and TR groups, except at a single flexion angle in the TR group. These data support the conclusion that both reconstruction techniques adequately restore ulnotrochlear joint stability under low loading conditions as performed in our study. Although the TR group had significantly lower stiffness and torsional torque than its matched native group, there was no significant difference in these variables when comparing the TR and DO groups directly. These results are difficult to interpret but imply that the DO technique restores joint stability in those loading conditions to a greater extent than does the TR technique. While it is difficult to definitely conclude the reason for the lower stiffness and torsional torque of the TR group compared with its matched native state, the single-strand graft of the TR technique may not provide the stiffness characteristics of the double-strand graft of the DO technique. The DO group exhibited significantly higher angular displacement at failure compared with its native state, but there was no difference in angular displacement at failure when comparing the DO and TR groups directly. These results are also difficult to interpret but may mean that the DO technique exhibits greater laxity at high torques or that its failure predominates at high angular displacement. The failure modes of the 2 groups were nearly identical. The majority of failures occurred at the suture-tendon interface, where the whipstitched suture cut through the graft, causing extensive elongation and a drastic drop in stiffness and torsional torque. This failure mode has been shown in several other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513482567">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513482567">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513482567">29</xref></sup> The majority of failures occurred at the humeral interface, leading us to conclude that the current reconstruction technique employed on the humeral side is the weak link of both of these reconstructions. Future research assessing stronger humeral fixation techniques is merited.</p>

Failure testing was performed at 70° of flexion, consistent with other biomechanical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513482567">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513482567">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513482567">22</xref></sup> and studies demonstrating that the anterior bundle of the UCL contributes maximally to valgus stability at 70° of flexion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513482567">6</xref></sup> While other studies have used the 30°/70° combination,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513482567">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513482567">18</xref></sup> the current literature does not provide an absolute consensus on the optimal tightening/testing flexion angle combination for assessing true UCL reconstruction biomechanics, and it is difficult to discern from our data how tying at a higher flexion angle such as 70° of flexion would affect our investigation. As elbow stability (ie, resultant valgus torque) is lower at lower flexion angles, tightening the graft at a high flexion angle could drastically reduce valgus stability at lower flexion angles—an undesired effect. Conversely, tightening the grafts at 30° provides increased stability at higher flexion angles because graft strain and valgus stress will be increased to a greater degree than if the grafts were tightened at 70°. Tightening should be performed with caution, as overtightening can lead to early graft failure at high flexion angles because of excessive graft strain. Future studies are necessary to evaluate the effect of elbow position during graft tightening on total joint kinematics.</p>
<p>Inherent limitations of cadaveric research related to bone mineral density, age, medical/surgical history, and postmortem storage time were all present in our study. We made an effort to limit variability by procuring cadaveric specimens of a similar age and with no documented history of musculoskeletal disorders or diseases. In addition, repeated-measures statistical analysis, the use of matched pairs, and randomization are able to account for cadaveric variability. As the palmaris longus can be absent in as many as 20% of the population,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513482567">31</xref></sup> and its size, quality, and resulting biomechanical properties in cadaveric specimens are highly variable, we utilized fresh bovine extensor tendons to standardize the biomechanical properties of the tendon grafts. However, we did not assess the modulus, failure strength, or suture pull-out strength of these grafts in comparison with palmaris longus grafts. To account for viscoelastic effects, we employed preloading and preconditioning regimens. While this decreases interspecimen variability, the cyclic loading during preconditioning could cause small decreases in ultimate failure properties because of fatigue loading. Moreover, we utilized only a single loading rate, although the UCL experiences many different loading environments during activities of daily living and high-performance exercise. In addition, our kinematic data were derived from semidynamic testing at incremental flexion angles between 15° and 90° of flexion. The TR group exhibited a significant difference in angular displacement at 90° of flexion during elbow kinematic testing, and while it is impossible to conclude whether this observation would continue at larger flexion angles, the use of a testing apparatus with a larger flexion angle range or a dynamic elbow simulator capable of a large flexion angle range would provide more accurate kinematic data. Lastly, ulnotrochlear joint gapping is an important variable used clinically to assess valgus laxity of the elbow, but quantifying joint gapping was not in this study’s scope. Future studies quantifying joint gapping with the reconstruction types studied in this investigation are merited.</p>
<p>This study demonstrated the immediate postoperative kinematics and failure properties of 2 UCL reconstruction techniques. We conclude that both the DO and TR techniques restore native joint kinematics under low loading conditions. The DO technique restored valgus stability under high loading to a greater extent than did the TR technique but also failed at higher angular displacement. Future clinical and laboratory studies are necessary to investigate the potential benefit of the more anatomic, single-tunnel ulnar-sided reconstruction employed in the TR technique.</p>
