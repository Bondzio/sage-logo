<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to examine the landscape features of densely used boulevards in Aydin, Turkey. Adnan Menderes and Atatürk boulevards were the main focus of this study, where the convenience and landscape values of pedestrian – boulevard interaction were analysed. The features and their usages were assessed. Refuges and sidewalks were analyzed according to living and non-living aspects and their visual contribution. Convenience for disabled usage and the intervention of the other usages were examined and to what extent the boulevards supported the pedestrian usage was assessed. The assessment has illustrated that the landscape features of Atatürk Boulevard were less convenient and should be improved. The average scores established by the questionnaire study have supported this finding. The living elements of Adnan Menderes Boulevard were scored 2.96 for central refuges, sidewalks 2.90; while Atatürk Boulevard was scored 2.00 and 2.13, respectively. On the other hand, the scores for the non-living elements of the boulevard features were 2.78 and 2.47 in Adnan Menderes while in Atatürk Boulevard the scores were 2.57 and 2.18. As a result, changing of the non-living features with ones that reflect the identity of the city could add value to the city environment. Insufficient features must be remedied and the boulevards should be improved with respect to the standards.</p></abstract>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X12448074"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In healthy cities, the facilities that enable comfortable movement of the pedestrians are very important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X12448074">1</xref>]. The right of access to open spaces like streets that are designed with people in mind is at least as important for the population as meeting their basic vital needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X12448074">2</xref>]. However, regulations on pedestrians and pedestrian movement which are the basis for the organic growth of the cities have not been adequately addressed satisfactorily enough [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X12448074">3</xref>]. The day space organization in many cities are mainly driven by the need to facilitate accommodating motor vehicle traffics which has resulted in a city structure where the pedestrians are finding increasing difficulties to take part [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X12448074">4</xref>]. On the other hand, pedestrian movement does not mean only overcoming the distance but also overcoming the surrounding environment both spiritually and emotionally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X12448074">5</xref>] and this activity should be encouraged to enable healthy, safe, social-interaction and convenience of the urban citizens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X12448074">6</xref>]. Thus, to achieve sustainability in street spacing, a user-centred approach is needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X12448074">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Streets should be regarded as the most fundamental unit among the public spaces in cities and should be seen as a reflection of public opinions, lifestyles and aesthetic values of the societies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X12448074">8</xref>]. To design liveable, user-centred streets, it is necessary to meet the expectations of the users to accommodate the social needs of the citizen including consideration of communication, safety and freedom of action. There is a need to make these arrangements holistically in the planning of any city. As it is known, the physical environment consists of physical features produced and modified by people in an attempt to adapt their environment to serve better their needs and convenience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X12448074">9</xref>]. Especially the sidewalks with regard to the convenience to the standards (convenience to the disabled users and sufficiency of the infrastructure) and in terms of living and non-living landscape features that are the supplementary elements of any street supporting the usage of pedestrians. The appropriate provision of the landscape features would facilitate communication and could affect the users’ comfort positively and thus enhance the life quality of the pedestrians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X12448074">10</xref>].</p>
<p>In this context, the aim of the study was to examine the provision of landscape features with respect to pedestrian-boulevard interaction of two main boulevards: Adnan Menderes Boulevard and Atatürk Boulevard, which are in the heart of Aydin city and where the pedestrians are not only passersby but they also communicate, do shopping and meet each other. The evaluation was based on the originally created analyzing forms to assess to what extent both of the boulevards have supported the pedestrian use in terms of landscape features and various other usages. As a result of this study, remediation suggestions are proposed to contribute to the improvement of the existing boulevards.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1420326X12448074"><title>Study Area</title>
<p>The study areas including Adnan Menderes Boulevard and Atatürk Boulevard are located in Aydin City, Turkey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X12448074">Figure 1</xref>). Aydin, which covers an area of 8007 km<sup>2</sup>, is surrounded by the Aegean Sea in the west, Denizli in the east, Izmir and Manisa in the north and Mugla in the south [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X12448074">11</xref>]. Izmir–Aydin–Denizli main road, which continues in East–West direction, divides Aydin City into two parts and Adnan Menderes Boulevard lying in the North–South direction intersects with the main road. It is the most important urban road, which was built as a result of urbanization of Aydin city. The winding and dead end street which were the urban texture of the old city became ruined after the Independence War. The city was re-organized by building new roads as a grid-planned network system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X12448074">12</xref>]. Adnan Menderes Boulevard was completed in 1966 and has become the most important street since then. Apartment flats were built along the boulevard, which were accepted as a result of modernization. On the boulevard, there are shops on the ground floors of the apartments and these add value to the commercial identity of the area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X12448074">13</xref>].

</p>
<p>Atatürk Boulevard was re-shaped after 1980s and lies in the North–South direction till it intersects with Izmir–Aydin–Denizli main road then it continues in the Southwest direction. Along the boulevard, there are multi-storey dwellings where mainly food and beverage stores and restaurants are found on the ground floors. The Boulevard is also in the area where the primary and high schools are densely located.</p></sec>

</p>
<sec id="sec4-1420326X12448074"><title>Definition of the Subject</title>
<p>In this stage, the objectives of the research were defined and the two boulevards in Aydin City (Adnan Menderes Boulevard and Atatürk Boulevard) were chosen as the research areas. The research topics include the following aspects for improvement: densely access, being well-known, mostly preferred by the citizens and contribution to the identity of the city. These were effectively rated by the users in choosing these two boulevards.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1420326X12448074"><title>Data Collection and Field Survey</title>
<p>As a first step, literature research and surveys were carried out. Following this, research method was composed, the evaluation criteria that were used in this method and the forms that were used in analyzing the data were developed and the boundaries of the research area were clarified.</p>
<p>The whole Adnan Menderes Boulevard and the densely settled parts of Atatürk Boulevard (where intersects Izmir-Aydin- Denizli main road and Batı Gazi Boulevard) were accepted as the boundaries of the study areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X12448074">Figure 3</xref>). Within the scope of the analysis, general information about the boulevards was given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X12448074">Table 1</xref>.

<p>Features and the visual contributions of central refuges and sidewalks were included in a questionnaire survey. The responses were graded 1 to 3 in order to have numeric information about the space. The positive features were graded 3; partially positive features were graded 2 and negative features 1. In addition, the total and average scores were used to compare the living and non-living features of the two boulevards. When the living and non-living features do not exist then the (−) symbol was used. When a relation was not found between the features then the (Ø) symbol was used. Standards for street planting such as proper tree species, tree sizes, tree pit sizes, planting distances and minimum spacing requirements were effective for scoring the features of the living materials. References [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X12448074">5</xref>]; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X12448074">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1420326X12448074">18</xref>] were used to determine the standards.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1420326X12448074"><title>Evaluation of Results</title>
<p>In this stage, literature studies, observations made during the field survey and analyzing forms were evaluated in an integrated approach and the outputs were revealed.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1420326X12448074"><title>Discussion and Proposals</title>
<p>In this stage, the outputs were discussed to reveal to what extent the boulevards support the pedestrian usage in terms of feature elements and other usages and recommendations were made to enhance the boulevards.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1420326X12448074"><title>Results</title>
<p>The study area was evaluated under the heading of “<italic>General information</italic>” about the two boulevards and “<italic>Features and the visual contribution of central refuges and sidewalks in terms of living and non-living elements</italic>”.</p>
<sec id="sec9-1420326X12448074"><title>General Information About the Boulevards</title>
<p>When the general information about the research area was evaluated, it was seen that both of the boulevards are double lane but have not any bicycle lanes. In Adnan Menderes Boulevard, the sidewalks were separated from the traffic way with a separate planting zone. The width of the sidewalks is widening from 3.5 m to 4.5 m in Adnan Menderes Boulevard; while in Atatürk Boulevard, the widening is from 2.5 m to 4 m.</p>
<p>The vehicle and pedestrian activities are dense in Adnan Menderes Boulevard throughout the day when compared with Atatürk Boulevard. However, especially along and close to the Atatürk Boulevard, several primary and secondary schools are found and at the time the students finish schools, the Boulevard becomes strikingly crowded.</p>
<p>Although along both of the boulevards, the usages are diverse. Shops are found on the ground floors of most apartment dwellings. There is a private parking lot on Atatürk Boulevard and along both of the boulevards there are short-term parallel parking spaces. There are also two public hospitals (one of them is children and maternity hospital) on Atatürk Boulevard (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X12448074">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-1420326X12448074"><title>Features and the Visual Contribution of Central Refuges and Sidewalks</title>
<p>When the living elements on the central refuges were examined, it was seen that the features of living elements (sufficiency, species suitability, density, planting distance, site selection, quality/maintenance) in Adnan Menderes Boulevard are conveniently placed in general and the boulevard users gave an average score of 3 for the living elements.</p>
<p>In both of the boulevards, climbing plants were not used on central refuges while in Atatürk Boulevard seasonal plants were also not used in planting design. In Adnan Menderes Boulevard mainly <italic>Gravillea robusta</italic> and in Atatürk Boulevard <italic>Magnolia grandiflora</italic> trees were planted. The site selection of the trees in Atatürk Boulevard is not convenient. The central refuge is too narrow for root development of the trees.</p>
<p>In most of the central refuge, bushes are also not sufficient and dense enough. The quality and maintenance of the covering plants are insufficient. Majority of these are rarefaction and partially drying. All of these features scored 1 respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X12448074">Table 2</xref>).

<p>In Atatürk Boulevard, at the places where the width of the refuge is less than 1 m, only bushes were planted. When the central refuges of the two boulevards were compared based on the living element features, it was seen that the average score given for the Adnan Menderes Boulevard (Scored 2.96) was higher than Atatürk Boulevard (Scored 2.00).</p>
<p>When the research area was evaluated based on the living elements on the sidewalks; it was observed that climbing and seasonal plants were not used in Atatürk Boulevard on the contrary to Adnan Menderes Boulevard. Similar to central refuges, the planting convenience of sidewalks was found much better in Adnan Menderes Boulevard than Atatürk Boulevard (Scored 2.90 and 2.13, respectively). In Adnan Menderes Boulevard plants are in a separating planting zone. Palm trees were used and climbing plants were creeping up their trunks. In Atatürk Boulevard trees were planted in pits. Tree pits are so narrow in Atatürk Boulevard (the width of most of them is less than 50 × 50 cm) that they do not have sufficient soil space on the ground for healthy root growth.</p>
<p>In Atatürk Boulevard, mainly Citrus trees were planted but these are not convenient for street planting. Similar to the central refuge of Atatürk Boulevard, bushes are not dense, partially sufficient for their growth and there is not sufficient planting distance between them. The quality and maintenance of the covering plants are also insufficient on sidewalks (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X12448074">Table 2</xref>). From the site observations, it was determined that the distances between the trees varies from 4 m to 16 m and some of the trees on the sidewalks could touch the buildings’ facades on Atatürk Boulevard.</p>
<p>Beside the separating planting zone and street afforestation, there are also plant pots features in Adnan Menderes Boulevard and street lamps with hanging baskets in Atatürk Boulevard (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X12448074">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>When the existing non-living element features on central refuges were analyzed, it was seen that except the advertising boards in Adnan Menderes Boulevard, the same landscape elements on both of the refuges of the boulevards exist. Some of the advertising boards on the refuge could distract the attention of drivers and therefore the site selection was not properly considered (Scored 2). Existing non-living elements are sufficient in number in both of the boulevards. The orientation boards are unkempt and rusted in Atatürk Boulevard (Scored 1). The orientation boards in Adnan Menderes Boulevard and the street lamps and separating elements in Atatürk Boulevard need to undergo maintenance in general (Scored 2) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1420326X12448074">Table 3</xref>).

<p>When the central refuges of the two boulevards were compared based on the non-living elements, it was seen that the average score of the Adnan Menderes Boulevard (Scored 2.78) was higher than the Atatürk Boulevard (Scored 2.57).</p>
<p>When the sidewalks were analyzed, it is striking that there are not any street lamps on the sidewalks of both of the boulevards. Tree protectors are insufficient in numbers on Atatürk Boulevard that some of the smaller trees would need to be protected to ensure these are not broken. Maintenance of manholes on both of the boulevards and orientation boards on Atatürk Boulevard are insufficient (Scored 1) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1420326X12448074">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>There are a few seating units on Adnan Menderes Boulevard and people sit on the raised kerb-stones of the separating planting zone. When the sidewalks of the two boulevards were compared based on the non-living elements, it was seen that the average score of the Adnan Menderes Boulevard was higher than the Atatürk Boulevard (Scored 2.47 and 2.18, respectively).</p>
<p>Floor covering, height and slope of the sidewalks of the boulevards were found convenient according to the design criteria for disabled usage (Scored 3).</p>
<p>However interventions of other usages that are obstructing the passage of pedestrians such as shop keepers exposing their goods, signboards of the shop, cars or motorcycles parked on the sidewalks are seen on both of the boulevards (Scored 2) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1420326X12448074">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>When the plants were analyzed on Adnan Menderes Boulevard, it was seen that the visual contribution of the plants are very positive (Scored 3). However, the visual contribution of the plants on Atatürk Boulevard depending on their habitants is less than expected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1420326X12448074">Table 4</xref>).

<p>The highest positive contribution is provided by the street lamps on the central refuge of Adnan Menderes Boulevard. The advertising boards, orientation boards and separating elements also have a contribution at medium level on the boulevard (Scored 2). On the other hand, the visual contribution of the non-living elements on Atatürk Boulevard was found insufficient in general (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1420326X12448074">Table 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1420326X12448074"><title>Discussion and Proposals</title>
<p>Boulevards are the hearts of the cities and these can be viewed as the arteries of urban life where movements of traffic and pedestrian flow and the city would breathe with the trees grown on both sides of the road. Boulevards provide multi-lane access to commercial and mixed-use buildings and carry regional traffics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1420326X12448074">19</xref>]. In this context, these spaces are the most functional places of a city life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X12448074">5</xref>] and their living and non-living features must support the life that flows on the boulevard.</p>
<p>Especially, Adnan Menderes Boulevard can be viewed as the boulevard that is identified with Aydin and the city life. People in Aydin do shopping, meet each other, walk, communicate and do various activities on the boulevard. On Atatürk Boulevard there are restaurants which serve food and beverages for the residents and travellers. These two boulevards are used throughout the day and every day.</p>
<sec id="sec12-1420326X12448074"><title>Discussion and Proposals for Improving the Living Elements</title>
<p>On Adnan Menderes Boulevard, particularly tall trees provide support for the space perception and enable people to wander along the boulevard under the shadows of the trees which is important for Aydin where the weather temperature can vary from 40 to 45℃ in summer times. The sidewalks are convenient for people to walk comfortably and the separating planting zone can provide safe ways for people from vehicle traffics. These also add visual contribution to the street by hiding the scene of the traffic chaos. Although the palm trees have a thick trunk, they do not obstruct walking and narrow down the sidewalk wherefore they were planted in the separating planting zone. The climbing plants creeping up the trunks add visual contribution to the scene of the boulevard. <italic>Gravillea robusta</italic> trees on the refuge also have tall trunks that do not constrict the drivers’ vantage point, instead add visual value to the street. The distances between the trees were found within the standards given for Adnan Menderes Boulevard. However, some non-standard small trees (obstruct people walking) were planted on Atatürk Boulevard instead of trees with at least 1.80 m trunk height for the first plantation. The citrus trees planted in Atatürk Boulevard do not branch out overhead, their trunks are short and the fruits of the trees fall down onto the street that make the street dirty and obstruct comfortable walking. When the trees are small, people also vandalize the trees. In this context, public authority should plant trees within standards.</p>
<p>On the other hand, tree pits are so narrow in Atatürk Boulevard that the trees cannot grow healthily. In this context, it is proposed to widen the pits and to use tree bottom gratings in order not to narrow down the sidewalks, which are narrow when compared with Adnan Menderes Boulevard where it is hard to walk under the trees. <italic>Magnolia grandiflora</italic> trees do not suit the central refuge whereas the width of the refuge is not convenient for healthy root grow. It is proposed to change them to other plants that do not have adventitious roots in the course of time. There are also empty pits on Atatürk Boulevard in which the trees are dried and uprooted in the past which look unkempt and are defacing the street scene. Therefore, it is proposed to replant.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec13-1420326X12448074"><title>Discussion and Proposals on Non-Living Elements</title>
<p>In general, maintenance is obligatory for non-living elements of the boulevards. They are unkempt and rusted especially in Atatürk Boulevard. The seating units are limited in number especially in Adnan Menderes Boulevard. As was mentioned before, people are sitting on the raised kerb-stones. It is proposed to design new lay-byes along the street and the seating units that pose an obstacle for walking must be removed.</p>
<p>Selection of floor covering material of both of the boulevards (concrete slab was used) should be convenient for people walking and promote the space quality. There is not any important obstacle for the disabled people in terms of slope and the height of the sidewalks. However, the absence of street lamps on the sidewalks has decreased the visual attractiveness of the boulevards and the environments are dimly perceived some time later at nights. It is proposed to establish street lamps in order to increase the visual quality and create a warm and welcoming environment.</p>
<p>As a result
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>In general, living and non-living elements of Adnan Menderes Boulevard were found to be more convenient for local residents when compared to Atatürk Boulevard. Total and average scores obtained from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X12448074">Tables 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1420326X12448074">4</xref> support this finding.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The living and non-living elements of both the boulevards should be improved. The elements that have been broken or demolished must be replaced.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Especially plants, which are out of standards in Atatürk Boulevard, should be re-planted with the ones that are suitable for street planting.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There are not any non-living elements that can identify the boulevards. All of them are un-original. Municipality, with different, interesting designs, should change the impression of the boulevards by reflecting the identity of the city.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec>
