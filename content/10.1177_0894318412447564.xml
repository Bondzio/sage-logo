   <body>
      <p>Transparency is a significant issue within the healthcare industry influencing direct care for patients and families and payment for care. Nursing theories and nursing science in general would seem to promote a level of honesty that may be difficult to operationalize in today’s healthcare environment. The concept of transparency for leaders in nursing and healthcare has ethical implications and is closely tied to integrity in practice and education. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894318412447564">Milton’s (2009)</xref> analysis of the concept of transparency and truth telling is tied to a willingness to <italic>risk</italic> for the sake of consumers who want to be heard and to be active partners in their healthcare. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894318412447564">Karnick (2012)</xref> referred to seeing the “forest through the trees” as a metaphor for sorting through theories and becoming clear about the use of nursing theory. Her discussion connected to transparency in terms of being clear about connecting a coherent, transparent practice solidly placed within the discipline.</p>
      <p>The contributors for this column have addressed the issue of transparency in relation to nursing science and the current practice environment in healthcare. Susan Lacey and Karen Cox examine the big picture of nursing and the complexity of administration of nursing services. Dr. Susan Lacey is the Director of the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses’ Clinical Scene Investigator (CSI) Academy and the Director of Strategic Collaborations at Children’s Mercy Hospitals and Clinics in Kansas City, Missouri.</p>
      <p>Dr. Karen Cox brings over 25 years of nursing experience. She currently serves as Executive Vice President/Co-Chief Operating Officer (COO) for Children’s Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, a 314 bed academic pediatric medical center in Kansas City, Missouri.</p>
      <speech>
         <speaker>Pamela N. Clarke (PC):</speaker>
         <p>Dr. Cox, as a COO, can you speak to the big picture in general, and Dr. Lacey, as a leader in systems research and quality, can you discuss how the issues related to transparency directly influence nursing systems and the scientific underpinnings of the discipline?</p>
      </speech>
      <speech>
         <speaker>Karen Cox (KC):</speaker>
         <p>That is a critical question at a pivotal time in nurses’ history. Transparency and promotion of nursing theories and science are inextricably intertwined. To be honest, if you try to partition any of these from one another, you negate the legacy of nursing’s professional practice. How we convey our outcomes both internally and externally to the community at large, consumers, and regulatory bodies, as well as our own colleagues in nursing and other professions, must be grounded in theoretically-based scientific research. If the discipline does not base reported outcomes on empirical facts, then the stewardship of the structure, processes, and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447564">Donabedian,1966</xref>) of practice has the potential to be dismissed as cultural and historical norms of nursing without the benefits of theory-driven science. This leads to the potential for being dismissed by both the scientific community, as well as colleagues within the discipline. Don Berwick provided comments on December 7, 2011 at the annual Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) conference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447564">Berwick, 2011</xref>). His comments should strike at the heart of all healthcare workers and executives, but especially the most trusted profession, nursing. To paraphrase, <italic>it is our moral imperative that we care for those who are least able to care for themselves, and therefore, we must always remember the patient</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447564">Berwick, 2011</xref>). Nursing can best achieve that outcome by defining its role and ensuring efficacy of practice through scientific methods clearly linked to theory and communicated to practicing nurses at the point of care. Frankly, this is the only way to elevate nursing science and accompanying findings to translational interventions that support optimal patient outcomes and influence the fiscal health of organizations.</p>
      </speech>
      <speech>
         <speaker>Susan Lacey (SL):</speaker>
         <p>I fully agree with that assessment. In addition, the transparency movement for nursing has great synergy with the <italic>Future of Nursing</italic> report recommendations by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447564">IOM, 2010</xref>), which firmly articulates nursing’s role in lifelong learning and leading teams for improvements, particularly in light of the fact that $19.5 billion a year of healthcare expenditures are linked to waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894318412447564">MassDevice, 2010</xref>). Nurses who must <italic>hunt and gather</italic> or create <italic>work-arounds</italic> with perceived inefficient processes or technology waste time and may contribute to less than optimal patient outcomes, which may contribute to less transparency rather than more. Such practices must be mitigated by focusing on the right thing, at the right time, with the right tools in hand, with the right patient.</p>
      </speech>
      <p>There are exemplars of nurses owning their practice in programs like Transforming Care at the Bedside (TCAB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447564">IHI, 2011</xref>), the Integrated Nurse Leadership Program (INLP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318412447564">Center for Health Professions, 2009</xref>), and within the Clinical Scene Investigator (CSI) Academy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894318412447564">Lacey, Olney, &amp; Cox, 2012</xref>). These programs have empowered nurses to improve transparency, process, and outcomes at the point of care. Recently the CSI Academy was completed as part of a Northwest and RWJ Foundations’ Partners Investing in Nursing’s Future (PIN) grant. The CSI Academy brought together 23 staff nurses from 7 regional hospitals in the Midwest and taught them new skills in owning their own practice, identifying a clinical or organization problem, and transforming the processes for targeted improvements. The 7 hospitals estimated savings of $2.6 million in 16 months. Most importantly, the hospitals have scaled and sustained their improvement projects from unit-based to hospital-wide approaches 18 months after the funding period ended. In essence, the innovations are still going on because the program of teaching staff nurses to be empowered and equipped to conduct these projects worked. The program continues to improve patient and organizational outcomes, and the practices were fully embraced by the hospital leadership and other professional colleagues. This change in practice could not have happened if the underpinnings of the Academy were not based on theoretically-based nursing science. Nursing can no longer afford the comforts of doing things the same way moving forward. Radical changes must be employed to transform each nurse and the collective, as not simply the most trusted profession. There must be a significant movement to advocate for nurses to view themselves as <italic>“quality agents who ensure safe passage through complex healthcare settings”</italic> (Susan Lacey, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447564">American Association of Critical Care Nurses [AACN], 2012</xref>, cover page). This means that nurses and patients are partners in their care during this journey, and nurses serve not only as primary providers, but as guides through the myriad of situations all patients encounter.</p>
      <speech>
         <speaker>PC:</speaker>
         <p>If nurses are sharing responsibility for transparency as you stated, how does that change nursing education across academic programs, and most importantly, how do we change the lens of practicing staff nurses who have been at the bedside for 20 years practicing under a different paradigm?</p>
      </speech>
      <speech>
         <speaker>KC and SL:</speaker>
         <p>Historically nurses have looked at <italic>quality and safety</italic>, which are now critical to transparency, as something someone else imposes on them or in times past were associated with isolated activities, such as peer chart review, which had little relevance to changing practice. This is changing, particularly in light of the Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894318412447564">QSEN, 2012</xref>). However, to date it has been focused on building quality and safety knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) in curricula at schools of nursing across the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894318412447564">QSEN, 2012</xref>). Although the QSEN investigators, led by Linda Cronenwett, RN, PhD, FAAN, are working with other entities to extend this work to nurses who already are in practice, this work has just begun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894318412447564">Warren, 2011</xref>). The only way to bridge the gap is to have service and academic partnerships working together on the quality and safety agenda. We must have both new graduates and seasoned nurses practice the art and science of nursing through the same lens; centered around the patient and in particular how best to provide safe- and quality-based care. This takes a unified front. Unless nurse leaders harness the power of approximately 3.3 million nurses to take on leadership in the quality and safety agenda as well as transparency, nurses will continue to be viewed as <italic>outsiders</italic> who function as task masters doing medical procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894318412447564">U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010</xref>). Finally, if nursing insists on positing sub-specialty messages and agendas as <italic>the most important</italic> messages, rather than garnering support for a common message focusing on patient outcomes through transparency, the profession will have little, if any, impact on the industry as a whole. Academic and service leaders must understand this, and even if they cannot agree completely with how each enterprise is managed, nurse leaders should be able to agree on four key points: (a) nurses owning their practice, (b) nurses conducting their practice based on theory-driven scientific investigation that results in evidence-based nursing care, (c) nurses teaching innovation and empowerment through key academic partnerships, and (e) nurses, even those in undergraduate programs, being taught how to articulate their added value in <italic>real dollars</italic> to all stakeholders. Failure to do so keeps the discipline further behind the curve in leading real and unique change that makes measurable differences in the lives of patients and the organization’s bottom line. Nursing must move from traditional practices of <italic>see one, do one, teach one</italic> to using transformational practice modalities in every position within the organization. Skills must be taught and encouraged both in schools of nursing and in practice settings. The inability or even unwillingness to do so will continue to place nurses squarely in the mix that contributes to a 20-30% waste in the healthcare industry, which is an untenable approach to sustainability for systems of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894318412447564">Pear, 2011</xref>).</p>
      </speech>
      <speech>
         <speaker>PC:</speaker>
         <p>What does the intersection of nursing science, nursing practice, and informatics look like in terms of transparency, and where can the potential synergy take nursing in the future?</p>
      </speech>
      <speech>
         <speaker>KC and SL:</speaker>
         <p>First and foremost, nurses need to be at the table when key decisions are made that can influence the practice of nursing. This is especially true for obtaining health information technology for medication administration and being able to obtain information immediately when time is of the essence. Here is the problem. Never events, or hospital-acquired conditions (HACs), are certain preventable adverse events that are not reimbursed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447564">CMS, 2011</xref>). Left unchecked, these events cost service settings billions in reimbursements each year, and that will continue to grow as commercial insurers adopt this practice. Many HACs (for example: pressure ulcers, patient falls, or catheter associated urinary tract infections) are extremely nurse sensitive. However, typically it is difficult to capture what nurses do unless we have special reports produced by analysts to which staff nurses have little access or influence. Most, if not all, of these data must be gathered by chart audits manually to drive practice. It is no longer acceptable for staff and managers to not have critical data in real-time or at least in near real-time. In addition, nurses need discreet codes for nursing interventions and therapies built into the health information technology. Billing codes directly document procedures and therapies that are approved by CMS and insurance companies for reimbursement. Physicians and hospitals have used these codes for many years, and yet, nursing interventions are not collected or even recorded in any systematic way; therefore, it is impossible to ascertain which nursing intervention or collective interventions are most efficacious. The literature is replete with examples of aggregate outcomes, but what is needed is a more direct line to the individual actions of a nurse, followed by nurses on a shift, unit, and so forth to demonstrate the value of specific interventions and therapies provided by nurses. It is nearly impossible to imagine charging for these codes given the current industry payment structures. However, having discreet data elements that can convert nursing interventions and therapies into real-time outcomes cannot be more important. Reporting the findings at the level of specific patient outcomes will send a clear and accurate message to the industry and consumers that best nursing practices and therapies are based on evidence. The evidence will thrust nursing care into the transparency movement in a way not yet seen in the history of nursing. In other words, wouldn’t it be better to have nurses performing the 20 most efficacious interventions and therapies, given a patient diagnosis, history or particular set of characteristics than 50 interventions and therapies, half of which are unknown to actually impact the quality of the patient’s outcome?</p>
      </speech>
      <p>As nurse administrators, we contend that without specificity in tracking each nursing action, nurses will continue to intervene in ways that may or may not matter as they relate to patient outcomes. The potential for bundling science, theory, transparency, and informatics in creative ways means that nurses could be doing what is most efficacious each and every time for patients. We realize patients are unique and not homogeneous, and nursing is an art as well as a science; however, good information systems would take into account the heterogeneity of the patient and nursing interventions on the back end of the health information technology (HIT), and nurses would be less likely to rely on traditional practices not grounded in science. The synergy is here and is obtainable if nurse leaders demand that these electronic systems track nursing care in a way that is understandable across the continuum from executives to consumers. These are hard, yet critical questions and ones we have addressed with the CEO, Dr. Rand O’Donnell, in a <italic>Modern Healthcare</italic> opinion piece, “Flying the Murky Skies” when the ‘never events’ were implemented by CMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894318412447564">Lacey, Cox, &amp; O’Donnell, 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>There is work being conducted nationally around baseline product design for HIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894318412447564">The Tiger Initiative, 2012</xref>), but these are recommendations, not design mandates. However, nurse administrators believe the recommendations must transform the HIT industry to achieve greater accountability, particularly if organizations are relying on these systems to determine reporting what CMS does and does not reimburse. This accountability could come from the consumers of these goods and products – healthcare organizations, or they could come in the form of policy mandates as further cuts to reimbursement continue to emerge.</p>
      <p>The second thing that needs to happen is that academic as well as service leaders need to collaborate to achieve a unified perspective for the ultimate stakeholders; patients. It may be disheartening for an academic leader to try and discuss an academic accreditation mandate with a Chief Nursing Officer who is not apprised of what that might mean in terms of the new nurses they will graduate. Likewise, it is just as disheartening to speak to tenured and new faculty issues concerning new mandates in the service sector. Specifically, when service leaders try to discuss issues such as staffing ratios, never events, and root cause analysis only to be met with the need to explain these terms or what the impact means for the healthcare industry puts both academia and service personnel in conflict with what could be common goals to change both leaders’ perspectives and nursing’s collective power. If nursing graduates continue to be prepared by those who are disconnected to what their graduates will face in practice, both in terms of patients and systems, the profession will continue to be at odds with the system in a way that can never fully serve patients and families. Leaders in service and academic settings need incentives aligned with, (a) preparing and supporting new nurses who can practice in today’s complex healthcare environments, and (b) most importantly, creating a patient centric experience.</p>
      <speech>
         <speaker>PC:</speaker>
         <p>To what extent are industry leaders preparing for the wave of nurse retirements, coupled with the numbers of citizens who will need costly complex care? How does nursing science provide a unique perspective to the interprofessional dialogue?</p>
      </speech>
      <speech>
         <speaker>KC and SL:</speaker>
         <p>We have conducted and published research that describes how different cohorts view their nursing careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447564">Cox &amp; Santos, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894318412447564">Santos &amp; Cox, 2000</xref>). For example, when nurse administrators hired Baby Boomers or mature nurses, the general expectation was a long-term commitment. Whether we like it or not, the latest data in the career literature conveyed convincingly that younger graduates of colleges (including nurses) plan to have multiple jobs and entirely different careers other than nursing over their lifetime. Likewise, nurse administrators have to have more flexibility with newer nurses who may indicate that they want to leave a particular unit, but could be satisfied changing jobs within the system. This is a new paradigm for more seasoned managers and executives, but we have little time to debate the issue. This movement has started and will continue.</p>
      </speech>
      <p>In addition, the traditional Human Resources (HR) sector has not been as flexible with innovative ways to retain the aging nurses as they could be. HR administrators should consider innovations in keeping older nurses at the bedside (where a tremendous need for knowledge resides). One place to look is how schools of nursing keep their best minds working who could retire, but are given alternatives such as phased retirement, job shares, and sabbaticals to help them stay in the workforce, yet provide them with more personal time to prepare for and enjoy the next phase of their lives. It is a win-win proposition. Losing the brain trust by outdated employment practices will not serve the industry well and can even cripple the supply once Baby Boomers start to accelerate their retirement plans. Nursing leaders must realize this is imperative – when we lose older nurses to permanent retirement, who are going to be the experienced nurses taking care of older complex patients? The demographics include:</p>

         </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>Leaders must be firm in resisting the temptation for the short-term fix, which typically relates to the nurses as a commodity, and bring about sustained change in how we manage and lead our succession plans–not just at the senior executive level, but the staff nurse unit level as well. Although we do not doubt the methods used in a recent <italic>Health Affairs</italic> article that indicated the nursing shortages seems to be abating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318412447564">Auerbach, Beurhaus, &amp; Staiger, 2011</xref>), when executives and HR staff read this, it fuels complacency around the looming shortage that will come.</p>
      <p>Nursing science has contributed to this dialogue in many ways already. There are great voices from both academic and service settings that have helped shape the way people think about issues. It is time to turn the findings into actionable items that can be used by everyone. One issue worth noting is that the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) does not have quality and safety as a key part of their portfolio, unless as a part or sub-set of data in the design of a more <italic>nurse oriented</italic> research design. Without an interdisciplinary (health economists, nurses, epidemiologists, and others) dialogue, and better yet–conducting translational research, there will be little drive to study <italic>the experience of patients with certain diagnoses</italic> because our seasoned and previously funded nurse scientists will be retired, with too few skilled scientists with an interdisciplinary background, particularly related to quality and safety, to step into fill this pending gap. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) funds some of this work, but this should be a key priority for NINR’s portfolio as well.</p>

         <p>We need to look outside the profession and industry for creative solutions. There have been some attempts to incorporate principles of high reliability organizations – such as checklists from the aviation industry. It is important to read journals such as <italic>Harvard Business Review</italic> and <italic>Fast Company</italic>. These journals do not represent the issues in the healthcare industry except occasionally, but almost all of the articles can be translated in some way to find solutions to both the service and academic enterprises. Business journals advocate having good peripheral vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447564">Day &amp; Schoemaker, 2003</xref>) to see what is on the horizon and to create strategies to be delivered when the time is right. By and large nurses, physicians, and executives read healthcare literature exclusively – in other words, health professionals continue to frame each problem using reconstructive solutions based on what has been done in the past. However, the healthcare industry is a business. The power bill must be paid for the lights to stay on, and infrastructures are in constant need of improvement, just like our municipalities must continue to ensure that roads are safe. Therefore, nursing as a profession has to change. Change for the better may come from seeds of innovation within the industry, but it may also be the latest thing in cars, <italic>hybrid</italic> ideas that stem from both healthcare insiders and other industry leaders. Nursing science must be on the forefront of innovation to foster creative practice for the future rapidly changing complex healthcare environment. Therefore, the imperative is to begin to think of our work as much more organic and amenable to rapid change, which is aligned to changing the funding priorities if nursing science is to be relevant in today’s ever-evolving healthcare industry. Without this ability to rapidly evolve, there is little hope that nursing science can be authentically engaged in the transparency movement, which is so desperately needed in all clinical settings. Transparency will remain an illusion, and nursing will have missing a tremendous opportunity to be part of this national agenda. This is all serious business for our practice and our future. When Apollo 13 was teetering on destruction, NASA’s Gene Kranz put the best minds to work, and told his ground crew unequivocally, <italic>failure is not an option</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318412447564">Kranz, 2001</xref>). Just like those astronauts, patients, and indeed the entire healthcare enterprise from the halls of academia and throughout the service continuum, deserve the same intensity in getting this right. As is commonly noted, “If not us, then who? If not now, then when?”</p>
