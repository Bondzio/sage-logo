<title>Introduction</title>
<p>After Japan lost the Second World War, a postwar Constitution was established, strongly influenced by Western ideas of liberal democracy, which among other things legally emphasized individuals rather than family orientation in their choice of marriage partner.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363199011434684">1</xref>
</sup> Based on the constitution, marriage became a union of equals where more people found their spouses on their own at school or work than being arranged by their relatives. As a consequence, the number of “love matches” began outnumbering arranged marriages. Among young people married since 1980s, the number of “love matches” has increased<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0363199011434684">2</xref>
</sup> and today this percentage nearly reached 90 percent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0363199011434684">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Today, it is no longer considered socially deviant for women to prioritize education and career over marriage, and continuing their careers after marriage and having a child. However, in practice, strongly influenced by the previous Meiji Civil Code that shaped people’s perceptions about the traditional Japanese family, postwar Japanese society has not fully guaranteed gender equality, and whether to legally allow the dual-surname system is one of the major legal and political debates in Japanese society. Currently, Japanese law requires couples to choose either one of the couple’s surnames upon marriage, and mostly men’s surnames are chosen upon marriage. This legal regulation creates inconvenience for women who wish to marry and keep their surname for their career and/or identity. To understand the tension between the traditional Japanese family emphasized in the previous Meiji Civil Code and gender equality emphasized in the current Japanese law, this study explored the surname system in Japan by reviewing historical trends, recent surveys, political debates, and comparing with other nations. In particular, this study critically examined the symbolic significance of the surname that changed through the course of Japanese history.</p>

<title>Historical Transformation of the Surname System in Japan</title>
<p>What Japanese people considered the traditional family was legally framed in the Meiji Civil Code. Many Japanese people follow the tradition today and consider changing the surname upon marriage a normal transition and a happy event for women. In the past, however, Japanese couples used dual-surnames. In Japan, there are several words (<italic>uji, kabane, sei, myoji</italic>) translated as “surname” since the word has changed as the symbolic meaning and the social function of the surname changed.</p>
<p>In ancient times, <italic>uji</italic> was created based on their region or occupation to identify the group of privileged people serving for the emperor, and <italic>kabane</italic> functioned to identify their political and social position in the hierarchical relationship.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0363199011434684">4</xref>
</sup>
<italic>Uji</italic> and <italic>kabane</italic> were people’s surnames to identify the group and the status within the group. The masses serving the public such as religious and festive events also had their surnames for the purpose of identification of their jobs in public.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0363199011434684">5</xref>
</sup> For both the privileged and the masses, the surname was not closely tied to today’s use of identifying family membership and lineage, but to identify one’s status and occupation in public. Such function of the surnames (<italic>uji and kabane</italic>) gradually faded as a constitutional form of government modeled after that of China was introduced in the Nara Period (AD 710-794). By the Heian Period (AD 794-1192), people no longer differentiated <italic>kabane</italic> and <italic>uji</italic> and started to use the word, <italic>sei,</italic> to identify people serving the emperor and the public. In the Heian Period and the Kamakura Period (AD 1185–1333), married couples generally kept each other’s <italic>sei</italic> after marriage since the surname was mainly a way to identify their public status. In other words, the surname was not yet attached to the family lineage and membership as today; as for the notion of “family” itself, it was not rare among the privileged people during the Heian Period that men visited and spent a night at women’s houses and those women’s families raised their children.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0363199011434684">7</xref>

</p>
<p>Takemitsu<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0363199011434684">8</xref>
</sup> claims that (1) emerging power of the samurai, the warriors who controlled their local villages and benefited from improved agricultural productivity and (2) the formation of the <italic>ie</italic>, were two factors in the emergence of the current use of surnames (<italic>myoji</italic>) that functions as a symbol of family lineage and membership. The <italic>ie</italic> (pronounced as ee-eh) is a term that is widely defined as the Japanese “stem family” in current literatures; however, the original term, <italic>ie</italic>, connoted a “household” based on coresidence that can go beyond blood, marriage, or adoption. The heart of the <italic>ie</italic> was to continue the <italic>ie</italic> over generations, and to continue the <italic>ie</italic>’s economy, adopted men of proved competence could inherit the <italic>ie</italic> in the absence of male heir in the family or occasionally to replace the direct biological heir who lacked ability to run the <italic>ie</italic> economy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0363199011434684">9</xref>
</sup> Thus, the <italic>ie</italic> is also different from the Chinese <italic>jia</italic>, which is purely patrilineal.</p>
<p>In the Kamakura period, it was difficult for the samurai to pass on and accumulate the fortune of their <italic>ie</italic> economy due to the division of succession. After the Kamakura period, the mode of succession gradually transformed from the division of succession to the eldest son inheriting all the <italic>ie</italic> economy from his father through primogeniture. Especially among those who have political and economic power in society such as the samurai, the use of surnames (<italic>myoji</italic>) developed as a symbol of succession of the <italic>ie</italic> economy from father to the eldest son, which increased the social necessity of the surname to identify people belonging to which <italic>ie</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0363199011434684">10</xref>
</sup> As the power of the samurai peaked in the Edo period (AD 1603–1867), to distinguish the samurai from the masses, the masses were not allowed to use their surnames (<italic>myoji</italic>) in public. The use of the surnames (<italic>myoji</italic>) in public was the privilege for the samurai alone.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0363199011434684">11</xref>
</sup> However, the masses used their surnames in their daily lives since it was inconvenient to identify people belonging to the <italic>ie</italic> without them. They possibly removed them from the public records.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0363199011434684">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>It was during the Meiji period (AD 1868–1912) that people were allowed to publically use their surnames in public. The purpose of the Meiji Civil Code was to recognize the <italic>ie</italic> system as a basis for the Meiji government to more effectively control people. The Meiji Civil Code also took women for granted since it was built based on the virtue that men should work outside the home while women should stay home to care for family members.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0363199011434684">13</xref>
</sup> In the legalized <italic>ie</italic> system, when a woman married a man, it meant that she did not marry to an individual, but married into his family to support his <italic>ie</italic> economy. This <italic>ie</italic> system formed the ideological ground for the Meiji government that placed the emperor as its head of the state and the state as a single family.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0363199011434684">14</xref>
</sup> The legalization of the <italic>ie</italic> system made the relationship between parents and children, and husband and wife, to be like the relationship between superior and subordinate, suppressing individuality in order to preserve the harmony of the family. Despite the fact that the Meiji Civil Code was abolished after the Second World War, gender inequality and the legalization of the <italic>ie</italic> system in the Meiji Civil Code continues to influence what Japanese people consider the traditional Japanese family today. Under the current Civil Law, clause 750, couples must choose either husbands' or wife’s surname upon marriage. Although the law does not prevent women from choosing their surname, by mutual agreement, over 90 percent of Japanese couples choose their husband’s surname.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0363199011434684">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>At the same time, postwar social transformation through equal education and employment opportunities liberated women from traditional gender norms and a growing number of women postponed marriage and continued to work after marriage.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0363199011434684">16</xref>
</sup> Reflected in Japan’s very low fertility rates, today’s trend in Japanese marriages is characterized as late marriage.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0363199011434684">17</xref>
</sup> Average age for the first marriage increased from 27.2 to 30.1 years old for Japanese men, and 24.4 to 28.3 years old for Japanese women from 1960 to 2007. That is, increasing numbers of single women who graduated from college use their original surname at work and the duration has extended compared with the past when women married their spouse shortly after they completed their elementary or high school education. In postwar Japanese society where equality of men and women is guaranteed in the new constitution, the tradition of choosing spouse’s surname upon marriage became inconvenient for a growing number of women who benefited from the equal educational and employment opportunities emphasized in the postwar law.</p>

<sec id="section3-0363199011434684">
<title>Current Debates on the Dual-Surname System</title>
<p>Current dual-surname debates bring the institution of marriage and family into the public, discovering diversities in how individuals think of the ideal family. For Japanese couples who would like to marry and keep each other’s surname, it is impossible for a child to have legally married parents with different surnames. Such current legal system becomes especially inconvenient for Japanese women who wish to legally retain their surname and plan to have a child. On the family register, children born out of wedlock used to be described as “man” or “women” in the section where “legitimate” children (children born from legally married parents) are classified by their birth order (e.g., the first son, the first daughter, the second son), which resulted in discrimination against “illegitimate” children upon education, marriage, and employment. After the revision of the family registration law in 2004, children born outside of legal marriage are also described by their birth order according to their mother. However, even today, there is a place to declare on the birth certificate whether the child is legitimate or illegitimate. In terms of inheritance, the current Civil Law, clause 904-4 states that illegitimate children can receive half of what legitimate children can receive. Such discrimination was created in the Meiji Civil Code to reward the ideal traditional Japanese family. Today, divorce rate in Japan is increasing, and it is possible for a man to have a legitimate child from the first marriage and an illegitimate child from the second marriage if the wife from the second marriage wishes to legally keep her surname. These children can be treated unequally according to the current Civil Law.</p>
<p>Among those who wish to legally keep each other’s surname and to have their child recognized as a legitimate child, one possibility is to get married when a woman is pregnant and get a divorce while she is pregnant or after she gave a birth to prove that they were legally married at some point after the child was conceived. Couples can continue to remain single and a child can stay with one of the parents' surname while the other one legally recognizes their child in his or her birth registration (<italic>ninchi</italic>). However, these children will be recognized as illegitimate, and although the cohabitation became more popular in Japan, cohabiting couples tend to be childless, and with persistent stigmatization of out-of-wedlock childbearing, marriage is a highly attractive choice for cohabiting women who became pregnant.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0363199011434684">18</xref>
</sup> In most cases under the current situation, women legally change their surname upon marriage but continue to use their original surname at the workplace in order to avoid making adjustments in work-related and personal relationships they accumulated before marriage.</p>
<p>Whether to adopt the dual-surname system in Japan is a major political debate in Japanese society. Some politicians object to the change claiming that society and the family will become dysfunctional. They claim that introducing the dual-surname system could destroy Japanese culture and tradition.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0363199011434684">19</xref>
</sup> The potential for the revision of the current law became strong after the centre-left Democratic Party (DJP) took power in September 2009. However, the plan suddenly withered due to the DPJ’s coalition partner, the People’s New Party (PNP)’s strong opposition to the move.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0363199011434684">20</xref>
</sup> PNP’s leader, Shizuka Kamei, claimed that he does not understand why some people want to use different surnames in one family since sharing the same surname in the family is part of Japanese life and culture.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0363199011434684">21</xref>
</sup> Despite a United Nations recommendation to abolish the male-dominated surname system to progress in gender equality, Japan continues to follow what the current civil code regulates how marriage should be.</p>
<p>Politicians like Mizuho Fukushima claim the necessity of dual surname system. The revision of the code reflects the idea that people should accept the dual surname system as a choice, and those who find the significance in the current system can continue to change their surname upon marriage while they can respect those who find the significance in keeping their surname as their important identity. The revision is not to criticize one another but to respectfully recognize different forms of marriages and families. Fukushima<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0363199011434684">22</xref>
</sup> criticizes the public argument of pitying children whose parents support the dual surname system as well as children of those whose mothers are divorced. She claims that such argument itself creates unfortunate children based on the assumption that these children will be different from those who grew up with married parents with the same surname.<sup>

<title>International Marriages and Limitations in the Current System</title>
<p>When Japanese legal system meets international marriages, reflecting the degree of social acceptance toward diversities in families, incompatibility of each other’s legal system can create social inequality. In the case of international marriages, it is possible for Japanese women to legally marry a spouse and retain their surname since their foreign spouse does not have his or her own official family registry in Japan. In Japan, international marriages have increased dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363199011434684">Figure 1</xref>), especially for men influenced by the “marriage squeeze.” In Japan, there is a persistent tendency for men to marry younger women, although the gap has narrowed over the decades. With the dramatic postwar fertility decline, the marriage squeeze has caused a shortfall in the potential number of brides.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0363199011434684">24</xref>
</sup> In developing nations, such shortfall in the number of prospective brides can be resolved by men continuing to look for younger brides, which is not a possible case in Japan since broadened educational opportunities for women lowered their likelihood of getting married in their twenties.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0363199011434684">25</xref>
</sup> According to Iwao,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0363199011434684">26</xref>
</sup> there are about 2.5 million more single men than single women twenty to twenty-nine years old. In addition, more Japanese people, especially younger generations, move beyond the national border for leisure, education, and business, and more foreigners move to Japan for leisure, education, and employment. As international marriages continue to increase in Japan, it brings unfairness since some Japanese children born through international marriages can have legally married parents with different surnames, while other Japanese children cannot.</p>

</fig>
<p>Looking at the issue of dual surnames comparatively, Western countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada legally allow the dual surnames based upon the freedom in choosing their name.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0363199011434684">27</xref>
</sup> Western countries such as the Netherlands, Greece, and the Northern European nations legally accept the dual surname based upon the equality of gender.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0363199011434684">28</xref>
</sup> Both men and women keep their surname upon marriage in countries such as South Korea, China, and Quebec City in Canada, Italy, and Spain, which is the normal tradition in these countries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0363199011434684">29</xref>
</sup> In South Korea and China, women retain their surname upon marriage and their children mostly choose their fathers' surname not originally based on the equality ground but based on the tradition that reflects gendered norms and values derived from Confucianism that women are outsiders to their spouse’s ancestral line.</p>
<p>In 1986, France abolished the discriminatory word “illegitimate child,” and Germany also abolished differentiating illegitimate and legitimate children. The United States also abolished such discriminatory concepts in 1872.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0363199011434684">30</xref>
</sup> Kanazuka<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0363199011434684">31</xref>
</sup> claims that Japan and Philippines are two of the few countries that differentiate the amount of inheritance between legitimate and illegitimate children. In other words, Japan stands out internationally for discriminating illegitimate children throughout their life course because the current Civil Code does not reflect diversifying Japanese marriages and families.</p>

<title>Japanese People’s Responses on Dual Surnames from Various Surveys</title>
<p>Recent surveys on dual surnames suggest that it is questionable whether increasing people will immediately take the dual surname system on the Japanese cultural ground. Great proportions of people accept couples with different surnames as one of many styles family can take while majority of people continue to follow the custom as virtue.</p>
<sec id="section6-0363199011434684">
<title>Newspaper Polls</title>
<p>Asahi Shinbun public opinion poll conducted in December 2010 reported that about 50 percent of respondents supported the dual surname system, whereas 43 percent were against it. Nearly 70 percent of women in their thirtees and fourties supported the system, and many of whom were working and raising children.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0363199011434684">32</xref>
</sup> According to the opinion poll about family law systems in Japan (<italic>kazoku no housei ni kansuru yoron chousa</italic>) conducted in 2001, 46.3 percent of people found some inconvenience in changing the surname upon marriage, which increased from 41.1 percent in 1996. However, the proportion of those who feel happiness by changing surname upon marriage as a start of new life increased from 43.4 percent to 47.1 percent. Despite the postwar social change, ideational change does not necessarily follow the social change since changing the surname upon marriage continues to have a symbolic meaning for many Japanese couples that they are officially starting a new life with their spouse.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0363199011434684">
<title>Government Survey</title>
<p>Based on the Cabinet Office survey conducted on 5,000 adults nationwide, 42.1 percent supported a revision to Civil Code prohibiting married couples from using separate surnames.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0363199011434684">33</xref>
</sup> This survey also showed that younger generations were more likely to support the dual surname system and that about 80 percent of men and women in twenties and thirtees supported the system. In particular, women in their thirties were the most enthusiastic supporters of the dual surname system, 86.6 percent supporting the system.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0363199011434684">34</xref>
</sup> However overall, 52 percent responded negatively that the dual surname system would disrupt family unity, and 66 percent replied that the dual surname system could impose an unfavorable influence.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0363199011434684">35</xref>
</sup> While younger generations tend to accept the dual surname system as a new form of marriage, a majority of Japanese people continues to believe that the system can negatively influence family unity and childrearing.</p>

<sec id="section8-0363199011434684">
<title>Japanese General Social Surveys (JGSS)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0363199011434684">36</xref>
</sup>
</title>
<p>In JGSS conducted in 2006 (JGSS-2006), respondents were asked, “What do you think a couple should do with their surname when they get married?” Based on 2097 valid responses, 26 percent strongly supported taking the husband’s surname, 31 percent supported taking the husband’s surname under the current condition in Japanese society, 30 percent considered that it was up to the couple to decide, 12 percent supported dual surname system. That is, 61 percent of respondents neither strongly supported nor disapproved the dual surname system. Reflecting increased diversity in families, increasing Japanese people no longer insist on what the family should be based on the legal regulations, but they are more acceptable to what the family can be.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0363199011434684">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Today, increasing numbers of men and women postponing marriage resulted in an increased proportion of lifetime celibacy rate in today’s Japanese society. The lifetime celibacy rate, calculated as the average of the proportions never-married at ages forty-five to forty-nine and fifty to fifty-four, increased from 1.45 percent to 15.96 percent for men, and 1.35 percent to 7.25 percent for women from 1950 to 2005 (National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, 2008). Since only a small proportion of people marry after the age of forty-five (less than 2 percent in 2007) and the proportion of remarriage is also small (less than 3 percent in 2007),<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0363199011434684">37</xref>
</sup> a notably high proportion of singles at ages forty-five to fifty-five suggests unavoidable diversity in Japanese families. Laws defining marriage and family should be revised to allow citizens to have choices and not take away their individual identity. Behind gradual ideational change, marriage and family have steadily diversified in Japanese society, and such diversity will lead more people to accept what family can be, not restricted to the argument about what the family should be based on traditional norms and values. In the future, Japanese surnames can symbolize both family lineage and individual identity to both men and women.</p>
<p>At the same time, even if the dual surname system became a legal option for couples, as in the United States, children may continue to take father’s surname. In the United States, despite the overall rise in women’s continuous use of surname upon marriage since the 1970s, greater than 95 percent of children take the father’s surname.<sup>

</sup> There are assumptions that husband is expected to continue his surname assuring the male privilege of identity and capital.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0363199011434684">39</xref>
</sup> As international marriages increase in the United States as well as in Japan, patrilineal surnaming may become less appealing for interethnic couples since children’s surname signifies their ethnic identity. In fact, studies showed that immigrants to the United States and women of color have higher rates of children keeping both surnames to connect children to both ethnicities.<sup>

<p>Today, Japanese women who want to marry, raise children, and keep each other’s last name encounter greater difficulty in going through Japanese legal system. Osawa <sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0363199011434684">41</xref>
</sup> claims that some child care facilities require parents to have the same surname and the children are asked to use the surname of their father. Some women were asked to explain the reason at the hospitals and clinics for having two surnames, and they were cautioned to change the surname for the sake of children.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0363199011434684">42</xref>
</sup> Some children took more time in the procedure to get necessary immunization because their mother does not have the same surname with them and they were told to provide documents proving their relationship.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0363199011434684">43</xref>
</sup> Recently, four Japanese women went to court to challenge the law. One of these women, who was seventy years old, claimed that being forced to change and use her husband’s surname caused her psychological trauma because she believes that her name is a reflection of her identity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0363199011434684">44</xref>
</sup> She claims that she hopes to die with her maiden name since she was born with it. They argue that the civil law violates the constitution guaranteeing equal rights for both men and women.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0363199011434684">45</xref>
</sup> Another women claimed that local authorities declined her marriage document when the couples asked to list to two surnames; she questioned the legal regulation oppressing individual rights in deciding whether to keep the surname.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0363199011434684">46</xref>
</sup> Since these women do not follow custom, they can easily become a target of criticism for destroying the family unity in some media. Often their relatives criticized these parents for being antisocial, immoral, and selfish.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0363199011434684">47</xref>
</sup> In today’s Japanese society, women who find happiness in adding a new identity by changing the surname upon marriage are considered normal, and women who consider their original surname as part of their important identity are considered socially deviant.</p>
<p>The symbolic significance of the surname in Japan has changed through the course of history. Today, increasingly Japanese people postpone marriage, and social function of the surname has not only limited to identify family lineage but also recognized as part of individual identity and achievement for both men and women. Discussion of the dual surname system in Japan should provide opportunity not only to achieve gender equality but also to understand the symbolic significance of the surname to men, women, and children in the historical and dramatically changing social context.</p>
