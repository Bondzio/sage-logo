<abstract>
<p>Whereas the nature of healing reaction in skeletal muscle following implantation of biomaterial has been extensively studied, the extent of variation in cell phenotypes is poorly known. Here, we studied the phenotypic alteration of cell types following injury in skeletal muscle of rabbits implanted with a commonly used biomaterial, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fabric. Following implantation, histomorphological features were studied after 1, 4, and 12 weeks. Routine objective histomorphological evaluation was supplemented with histochemistry for collagen and immunohistochemistry for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), CD34, vimentin, and alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). The extent of reaction was quantified. The foreign body giant cells were found to comprise subpopulations, based on the variation in vimentin detectability or the presence of differentially capable proliferating nuclei (PCNA positive). Many rhabdomyocytes adjacent to the implant were PCNA-positive and some of them showed CD34 positivity. Often, the rhabdomyocytes very near to implanted PET fabric assumed a myofibroblast phenotype as evidenced by vimentin and/or α-SMA positivity at immunohistochemistry. Overall, the results suggested a phenotypic alteration of native cell types following implantation of PET fabric in rabbit skeletal muscle. Quantification of such cell types at the tissue–material interphase in relation to the deposition of collagen may be desirable during safety evaluation of biomaterials by histomorphology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The nature of tissue reaction induced by biomaterials implanted at various sites of the body of laboratory animals assessed by defined procedures is a screening test for identifying potential biomaterials for device fabrication. Widely accepted standard protocols and procedures, which provide insights into the safety and probable biomedical use of these biomaterials, are available (Schuh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192623312460922">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192623312460922">Turner, Lawrence, and Autian 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192623312460922">Helmus, Gibbons, and Cebon 2008</xref>). These standards/procedures largely evaluate the overall tissue reaction pattern of the extracellular matrix around the implant site, as assessed by the extent and nature of fibrosis, and the abundance of various kinds of cells participating in the healing response. The development of these standards is centered on the classical definition of biomaterials that it is the ability of a material to perform with an appropriate host response in a specific situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192623312460922">Williams 1987</xref>). However, the definition of “biocompatibility” has been revisited repeatedly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192623312460922">Williams 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192623312460922">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0192623312460922">2008</xref>) and necessitates an assessment based on a more mechanistic view of the healing response incorporating the current understanding of cellular and molecular pathology and clinical implications. Therefore, it is desirable to identify and include additional parameters in the safety assessment protocols, which have a bearing on cellular and molecular pathology and the expected clinical outcome (Helmus, Gibbons, and Cebon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192623312460922">2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Skeletal muscle continues to be the preferred test site for evaluating biocompatibility and an injury caused by an implanted biomaterial initiates and perpetuates a healing response (ISO 10993, Part-6). The sequence of events occurring in a healing reaction in muscle is predominated by repair mechanisms orchestrated by granulation tissue formation, angiogenesis, and fibrosis and substantially lacking a regenerative response as in epithelial tissue. Detailed investigations for identifying different cell types in reaction zones around the implant sites have indicated the presence of differentially altered cell types including stem-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192623312460922">Swathy and Anilkumar 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0192623312460922">Thevenot et al. 2010</xref>). Moreover, biomaterials are increasingly used for fabricating engineered tissue constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192623312460922">Jayo et al. 2008</xref>). Together with the biological molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192623312460922">Anilkumar et al. 2011</xref>) and the cells in the construct, the biomaterials are likely to stimulate cell types (e.g., stem cells and giant cells) that are not prominent in the tissue during physiological states. Hence, there is an increased quest for understanding the nature of cellular and molecular modulations occurring at the implant niche.</p>
<p>Various kinds of polymeric materials are used in the fabrication of biomedical devices and histopathology is used as a tool for assessing their biocompatibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192623312460922">Velayudhan et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192623312460922">Anilkumar et al. 2007</xref>). Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a widely used biocompatible polymeric material that has been tested on a number of occasions and found suitable for a variety of biomedical applications like vascular prostheses, hernia repair meshes, suture material, and patches for tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192623312460922">Cenni et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192623312460922">Ratner et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192623312460922">Seitz et al. 1998</xref>). When implanted <italic>in vivo,</italic> it causes chronic granulomatous inflammatory reaction in sites like muscle and subcutaneous tissues of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192623312460922">Hagerty et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192623312460922">Tang and Eaton 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192623312460922">Van Bilsen et al. 2004</xref>). However, the nature of various cell types participating in the tissue reaction induced by implanted polymers has not been investigated in detail. In the present study, using PET as a model material we studied the nature of healing reaction caused by implanted polymeric biomaterial in rabbit muscle with special reference to the density, distribution, and function of mesenchymal cell types and giant cells occurring in the reaction zone.</p>
<p>In this article, we support the hypothesis that the traditional battery of histopathology test parameters listed in standard procedures designed for biocompatibility testing may have to be expanded by adding those parameters which might reflect the nature of cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating biocompatibility. Utilizing the advances in computer-assisted histomorphology-imaging techniques, efforts were taken to appreciate these additional parameters during biocompatibility evaluation.</p>

<title>Preparation of the Polymer Samples</title>
<p>PET fabric used for this study were cut from vascular graft samples provided by M/s. TTK Healthcare Ltd, Trivandrum. Vascular graft samples were prepared by weaving doubled 76 denier 34 filament texturized yarn. Weaving is carried out using modified conventional loom and the weaving parameters are adjusted to achieve a mean water porosity of 200 ml/min/cm<sup>2</sup>. The weaving generates a tubular structure without seams. These tubular fabrics are further crimped to ensure that the grafts do not kink during use. The crimped grafts are cleaned in a multiple stage cleaning/extraction process including ultrasonic cleaning, methanol extraction, and water extraction to remove all chemicals and oils that might have accumulated on the fibers during the fabrication process. For implantation, strips of size 10 mm × 6 mm were cut using clean scissors, washed with distilled water thrice and finally with acetone, and dried. Samples were sterilized with ethylene oxide prior to implantation.</p>

<sec id="section4-0192623312460922">
<title>Animal Implantation</title>
<p>The animal experiments were done with the approval and as per the requirements of the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee. Nine healthy adult rabbits weighing not less than 2.0 kg and whose paravertebral muscles are sufficiently large in size were used for the experiment. Prior to the experiment, fur on either side of spine was clipped off. Implantation procedure was carried out under clean and asceptic conditions. Rabbits were anesthetized using Ketamin hydrochloride (80 mg/kg) and Xylazin (5 mg/kg body weight). The skin of the anesthetized rabbits were lightly swabbed using 70% alcohol and air dried. The PET was inserted intramuscularly into paravertebral muscle through skin incision wound. Two implants were inserted, one each on either side of the vertebral column. The incision was then closed using sterile sutures. At the end of each experimental period (7 days, 14 days, and 12 weeks), the rabbits (3 rabbits per period) were euthanized by an overdose of the anesthetic agent. The implant material along with the surrounding tissue was collected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, as per the standard, so as to fix tissue specimens for subsequent studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0192623312460922">
<title>Histotechnology</title>
<p>Formalin-fixed tissue samples were dehydrated through ascending grades of alcohol and impregnated with paraffin wax. Tissue sections (4 µm thick) were made from paraffinized tissue blocks using Leica RM2255 Microtome. Tissue sections were deparaffinized in three changes of xylene and brought to water through descending grades of alcohol. The sections were then stained with Harris's haematoxylin and eosin (HE). Additional histochemistry for evaluating the pattern of collagen, tissue sections were stained with picrosirius red and Masson’s trichrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192623312460922">Bancroft and Gambling 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Mouse monoclonal antibodies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192623312460922">Table 1</xref>) were used for detecting various cell types by immunohistochemistry . Essentially, deparaffinized tissue sections were first washed in water, treated in antigen retrieval buffer (citrate buffer, pH 6.8) at 92°C for 20 min and allowed to reach room temperature in about 30 min. Then, the endogenous peroxidase activity was prevented by treating the slides with 10% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 15 min and the nonspecific binding of secondary antibody was blocked using 10% goat serum. Later, the sections were washed with trisodium citrate solution and treated with primary antibody (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192623312460922">Table 1</xref>) for 1 hr at room temperature. The sections were then washed and treated with goat antimouse Fab’2-Biotin conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc.) for 30 min. Subsequently, sections were washed and treated with Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min. The sections were then washed thoroughly and treated with the 3,3′-diaminobenzedine-enhanced liquid substrate system (Sigma) for 5 min and the reaction was stopped by immersing the slides in excess distilled water. Finally, the sections were counterstained lightly with Harris’s hematoxylin, dehydrated in ascending grades of alcohol, cleared in xylene, and mounted in DPX.</p>

<title>Confocal Microscopy</title>
<p>Tissue sections stained with Alexa flour conjugated anti-CD34 mouse monoclonal antibody (ICO115, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) were imaged under a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 META Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope equipped with differential interference contrast optics. For visualization, the stained sections were excited with 633 nm laser light, and emission wavelength was filtered by 650 nm long pass filter.</p>

<title>Histomorphology</title>
<p>Histomorphology of the tissue was evaluated routinely for studying the nature of tissue reaction as recommended in ISO 10993 for assessing biocompatibility. The parameters studied were the following. The number and distribution of neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, macrophages, and foreign body giant cells (FBGCs) around implant material were semiquantitatively graded and other parameters such as extent of fibrous capsule formation, inflammation, severity of degeneration, necrosis, fatty infiltration, granuloma formation, presence of material debris, and tissue in-growth were evaluated by a veterinary pathologist.</p>

<sec id="section9-0192623312460922">
<title>Histomorphometry</title>
<p>Images of histology slides were captured using an Olympus 51 BX microscope fitted with a DP71 camera using Image-Pro 3DS (version 6.1) software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). For all parameters, at least six histology slides were available. The parameters of interest were the following.</p>
<list list-type="order">

<title>Histomorphology</title>
<p>The implanted PET was obvious as a large material embedded in the muscle and the constituent fibers appeared as refractive bodies of 12 to 20 µm diameter fibers of varying size and shape. Tissue reaction was mainly constituted by the various types of inflammatory cells and fibroblasts around the implanted material with some extracellular matrix reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0192623312460922">Figure 1</xref>). At the first week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0192623312460922">Figure 1A</xref> and B) of implantation, the predominant cell types were polymorphonuclear leukocytes along with a few macrophages, plasma cells, and lymphocytes. FBGC reaction was minimal at that stage. Moderate degree of degeneration and necrosis of various cells were observed. At 4th week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0192623312460922">Figure 1C</xref> and D) of implantation, macrophage infiltration predominated the infiltrate along with lymphocytes indicating a granulomatous type of tissue reaction. In addition, FBGCs (5–6 per HPF) were seen suggesting a foreign body granuloma. Necrosis and degeneration of cells were less compared to that of first week. At 12th week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0192623312460922">Figure 1E</xref> and F) of implantation, the tissue response was characterized by chronic granulomatous reaction with a well-formed fibrous capsule limiting the reaction zone around the implant.</p>

<p>Photomicrographs of the progressive healing responses generated in the rabbit muscle initiated by the implanted biomaterial (polyethylene terephthalate [PET]), after 1 week (A and B), 4 weeks (C and D), and 12 weeks (E and F). At low magnification (A, C, and E), the material appeared as a mass of foreign body embedded in muscle surrounded by a narrow reaction zone but individual polymeric fibers were discernable as refractile bodies at higher magnification (a few examples are marked with thick black arrow). Extensive muscle injury and acute inflammatory response were evident with moderate degeneration and necrosis of rhabdomyocytes and proliferation of fibroblasts at the tissue material interface (B). Damaged muscle cells were seen even after 4 weeks, but chronic inflammation with foreign body giant cell (FBGC; thin black arrow) reaction and most of them were of conventional type with innumerable nuclei and without any obvious features of muscle-derived multinucleated cell (D). By the 12th week, moderate lipocytein filtration, formation of fibrous tissue capsule, and foreign-body granuloma were prominent (F).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In order to study the occurrence of novel cell types in biomaterial-induced healing response, we implanted a model polymeric material PET fabric intramuscularly into rabbits as stipulated in standard procedure (ISO 10993, Part-6) and histomorphologically evaluated the cellular reaction as recommended (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0192623312460922">Table 2</xref>). Although comparison with a biocompatible reference material was not performed, the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0192623312460922">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0192623312460922">Table 2</xref>, and previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192623312460922">Anilkumar et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192623312460922">Cenni et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192623312460922">Ratner et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192623312460922">Seitz et al. 1998</xref>) largely indicated that the biomaterial in consideration induced tissue reaction acceptable for a biocompatible material. We further studied the distribution and nature of various cell types generated at the reaction site. Emphasis was placed on quantification of the reaction and the histogenesis of the emerging cell types and phenotypically altered cell types in the reaction zone.</p>
<p>The number of proliferating cells at different time points of the study gave an indication of the severity of reaction around the implant. The cells undergoing proliferation around the implant site were classified as native cells in the skeletal muscle (fibroblasts in the supporting connective tissue, smooth muscle cells, or endothelium of the blood vessels) and those recruited from the general circulation as part of the inflammation. We studied the distribution of two populations of cells, one each from the above groups containing PCNA-positive nuclei: satellite cells and the giant cells.</p>
<p>Since rhabdomyocytes are terminally differentiated cells incapable of proliferation, the pool of proliferating cells is expected to contain endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and cells of the reticuloendothelial system (lymphocytes and macrophages) rather than the former. The types and number of proliferating cells in the tissue reaction around the implant are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0192623312460922">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0192623312460922">7</xref>. At the 7th day, some of the nuclei of the skeletal muscles adjacent to the reaction zone were found to be PCNA positive. The location and morphology of these cells suggested that they were satellite cells that have been activated upon injury associated with PET implantation. Mitotic activity and immature (blast-like) features, with scanty cytoplasm, large nuclei, and prominent nucleoli, of some of the cells in the reaction zone supports this claim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0192623312460922">Figure 6A</xref>). Indeed, satellite cells are known to have stem cell properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0192623312460922">Zammit, Partridge, and Zipora Yablonka-Reuveni 2006</xref>) and activation of stem cells following tissue injury in muscles is possible in injured muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192623312460922">Zammit and Beauchamp 2001</xref>). Hence, the possibility of stem cell activation during biocompatibility evaluation cannot be ignored. Also, a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192623312460922">Swathy and Anilkumar 2007</xref>) indicated the possibility of the occurrence of stem-like cells in the reaction zone following biomaterial implantation in muscle. With these in background, attempts were made to identify stem cells by phenotyping CD34 antigen using monoclonal antibodies from two different sources. One of these antibodies (clone, QBEnd/10) identified the conventional satellite cells. On the other hand, occasionally the skeletal muscle cells with muscle striations were positive when stained with Alexa Fluor–conjugated anti-CD34 monoclonlal antibodies (clone ICO115) and imaged by confocal microscopy coupled with differential interference contrast microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0192623312460922">Figure 8</xref>). The CD34-positivity of the striated muscle in the present study cannot be considered as a convincing proof for the reversion of rhabdomyocytes to stem cells. Nevertheless, it may be viewed as an attempt by well-differentiated phenotypes to revert back to more immature phenotype. Moreover, rhabdomyocytes, in this study, were found to assume myofibroblast phenotype (discussed later in this article) by revealing the presence of α-SMA intermediate filament proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0192623312460922">Figure 11</xref>). These observations support the plasticity of skeletal muscle during muscle injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192623312460922">Li and Huard 2002</xref>) and more specifically as a consequence to biomaterial implantation. Therefore, on a biological point of view, the occurrence of progressively differentiating stem cells (satellite cells) and dedifferentiating rhabdomyocytes in the healing response elaborated by PET-induced muscle injury cannot be ignored. However, more convincing data are needed for delineating their role in modulating the nature of biocompatibility reaction.</p>
<p>In this study, many cells of inflammation were found PCNA-positive especially the macrophages, but there was considerable variation in the density and distribution of PCNA immunopositivity around the implant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0192623312460922">Figure 6</xref>). The PCNA positivity of nuclei in giant cells was monitored against the current concepts of FBGC histogenesis. The current belief about FBGC formation is that monocyte-derived macrophages in the implant tissue undergo frustrated type of phagocytosis and these macrophages experience phenotypic change to become fusogenic. Several such fusogenic macrophages combine together to form large FBGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192623312460922">Brodbeck and Anderson 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192623312460922">Anderson and McNally 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192623312460922">Hagerty et al. (2000</xref>) have shown that macrophages very near to the biomaterial implants are proliferatively active. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0192623312460922">Figure 6B</xref> and C, interestingly, when proliferating, all nuclei in a FBGC did not seem to have potential for proliferation at a given point of time. This observation indicates that the nuclei within a FBGC are composed of differential population: either some nuclei have lost the proliferative potential vis-à-vis some have gained/retained proliferative efficiency or that differential population represents nuclei from different macrophages. All these nuclei with variable proliferative efficiency could not have originated from a single monocyte/macrophage, and thus this observation is consistent with the current belief that FBGCs are formed by the fusion of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192623312460922">Anderson and McNally 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The nature of immunoreactivity of FBGCs to vimentin, which is a marker for cells of mesenchymal origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0192623312460922">Figure 9C</xref>), and α-SMA, which is a marker for contractile phenotype-like smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0192623312460922">Figure 11C</xref>), clearly indicated that there are different subpopulations of FBGS which could be phenotypically defined by the presence of conventional intermediate filament protein markers. The relationship and the functional significance of various subpopulations (including the differentially PCNA-positive cells described above, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0192623312460922">Figure 6B</xref> and C) in modulating the biocompatibility reactions need more clarification.</p>
<p>Detailed study of the vimentin and α-SMA identified differentially altered skeletal muscle cells with these intermediate filament proteins. First, a subpopulation of the skeletal muscles near to implants was found to be expressing vimentin especially at the 1st week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0192623312460922">Figure 9</xref>). Though skeletal muscle is of mesenchymal origin, the differentiated mature skeletal muscle normally does not express vimentin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192623312460922">Duquette et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192623312460922">Leader et al. 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192623312460922">Tokuyasu, Maher, and Singer 1984</xref>), vimentin-positive skeletal muscles have been reported in some conditions of skeletal muscle regeneration and muscle damage following neuromuscular disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192623312460922">Bornemann and Schmalbruch 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192623312460922">Gallanti et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192623312460922">Misra, Menon, and Mishra 1992</xref>). Second, α-SMA were also detected in the tissue reaction zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0192623312460922">Figure 12</xref>). α-SMA is the most widely used marker for myofibroblasts, a cell type that can originate from different cell types and very high significance in wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192623312460922">Hinz et al. 2007</xref>). Cells other than smooth muscle cells expressing α-SMA are also considered to be the myofibroblast precursor cells and such cells are shown to be involved in the development of fibrosis with variable pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192623312460922">Desmouliere, Darby, and Gabbiani 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192623312460922">Hao et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192623312460922">Thannickal et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192623312460922">Zalewski, Shi, and Johnson 2002</xref>). Li and Huard (2002) reported that the myogenic precursor cells (skeletal myoblasts) can differentiate into myofibroblasts upon skeletal muscle injury and consequently contribute to the development of fibrosis and to the possibility of triggering differentiated skeletal muscle cells in to fibrotic lineage. They attributed these cells as the cause of desmoplastic reaction in skeletal muscle fibrosis following injury. We also found skeletal muscle cells expressing α-SMA immediately around the biomaterial implant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0192623312460922">Figure 11</xref>) even though we could not detect any α-SMA immunopositive fibroblasts in the reaction zone. This indicates that skeletal muscle injury caused by the biomaterial implantation possibly induced transdifferentiation of skeletal muscle cells to myofibroblasts.</p>
<p>Myofibroblasts are also responsible for modulating wound contraction and synthesis of extracellular matrix components like collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192623312460922">Hinz 2007</xref>). Therefore, we quantified the extent of collagen deposition against the number of myofibroblasts. Fibrosis, as indicated by collagen deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0192623312460922">Figure 5</xref>), increased with progressive healing. However, the skeletal muscle–derived myofibroblasts, though abundant at early time point of the healing process, decreased substantially during the progression of the healing reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0192623312460922">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0192623312460922">12</xref>). The data suggested the activation of myofibroblasts as a consequence of the implant-induced reaction. The lack of persistence of myofibroblast in the PET-induced reaction suggested a favorable healing reaction with minimal contracture.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, we present evidence based on immunohistochemistry for CD34, vimentin, and α-SMA that rhabdomyocytes are phenotypically altered during the healing response elicited by implanted PET in skeletal muscle. In view of the current knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in regulating the healing response and the revised definition of biocompatibility, it is desirable to identify novel molecular markers for evaluating biocompatibility reaction. Although a wide range of markers are possible, the data presented here point out a significant role for stem cells, differentially altered native cell types, FBGCs with varied proliferation ability in determining biocompatibility. Quantification of these cell types in relation to the extent of deposition of extracellular matrix components (e.g., collagen) implicates these cells as potential parameters for evaluating biocompatibility of a candidate biomaterial.</p>
