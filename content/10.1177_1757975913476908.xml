<abstract>
<p>Medical students typically learn about the role of physicians as health advocates through a component of the health professionalism curriculum. Recently, there has been a call for increased exposure to health advocacy in undergraduate medical education so that students can develop the interest, knowledge, skills, and attitudes that they will utilize throughout their careers as physician-advocates. We developed a four-session <italic>Advocacy and Activism</italic> training module that consisted of formal didactic teaching, training in basic skills, debate and discussion, and the development and presentation of advocacy projects. There were several uniquely innovative aspects of this module, including its structure, content, and inter-professional approach that included students of medicine, nursing, and public health. However, this approach also resulted in some important and unexpected limitations. We were encouraged by the quality of student participation during the module, as well as specific feedback regarding the format and content. The module was a low-cost, easy-to-implement, and academically rigorous model that can be implemented by interested students and faculty at other schools. We plan to continue to develop this program in the future, and we believe that other medical institutions should consider a similar model for introducing students to their future role as health advocates.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The health status of patients and the medical outcomes of patient care are critically influenced by social and economic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757975913476908">1</xref>). Physicians are in a unique position to advocate on behalf of their patients in the public realm, beyond the confines of medical practice. It has been argued that physicians have an obligation to pursue health equity by serving as advocates for both individual patients and patient populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757975913476908">2</xref>). This opinion has been echoed in the medical education literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757975913476908">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757975913476908"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757975913476908">5</xref>) and by the bodies that govern American medical education. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757975913476908">6</xref>) asserts that residency programs must teach trainees to ‘advocate for quality patient care and optimal patient care systems’, and the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) has similar guidelines for undergraduate medical education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757975913476908">7</xref>). While medical school curricula often address the role of the physician in society as an element of medical professionalism, few programs provide the opportunity for students to acquire expertise and engage with health advocacy on a formal level. The limited number of publications related to specific programs for medical advocacy education has shown student enthusiasm and positive short-term effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757975913476908">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757975913476908"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757975913476908">10</xref>). In an era of persistent inequality in healthcare access and outcomes, it is especially important that medical institutions provide students with the exposure and resources they need to develop their skills as physician-advocates.</p>
<p>Issues regarding the social determinants of health and the role of physicians as advocates were frequently discussed in the context of a global health elective seminar at our institution. Prior surveys and comments from focus groups composed of participants in the elective made it clear that students recognized the importance of health advocacy as a component of medical practice, but that there were few practical lessons in the formal and elective medical curriculum to prepare students for their crucial role as advocates. Many students identified the value of these skills in their current work with underserved populations in our local community and in past experiences abroad, but felt that they were often developed ‘on the ground’ in the course of this type of work without any formal background based in the curriculum. This issue can be generalized across many academic institutions. Such institutions frequently serve marginalized populations in developed countries and provide resources for students and faculty to work with underserved populations abroad, but may not provide adequate exposure to and training in the skills of health advocacy as a component of their curricula.</p>
<p>Upon recognizing the need for addressing the knowledge and skills of health advocacy, a number of solutions were possible. We elected not to approach the issue from within the formal medical school curriculum, which is constrained by a focus on basic science education and limited time allocated to courses covering material of this nature. We also decided not to develop a full elective course on this topic, as we felt it was necessary to demonstrate student interest and gain experience in developing an educational framework through a shorter academic program. However, we believed that a single lecture or ‘advocacy day’ event, while potentially very popular, would neither provide structured, longitudinal exposure for students nor valuable experience in organizing an advocacy curriculum for the developers. We therefore decided that addressing this issue over several sessions would grant students an opportunity to study longitudinally and would also provide us with experience and evidence as we worked to further develop such opportunities within our institution.</p>

<title>Description of the module</title>
<p>We developed a four-week module on ‘Advocacy and Activism in Global Health’ open to all students from the schools of Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, and the Physician Associate Program. Planning began at the end of the preceding academic year and involved a collaboration between the global health program coordinator (B.S.) and several faculty at the School of Public Health, medical (M.J.P.) and nursing student representatives from the Global Health Working Group and its faculty adviser from the Department of Medicine (G.F.), and the module faculty leader, an HIV/AIDS activist affiliated with the institution (G.G.). Curriculum planning meetings were held bi-weekly over a period of four months and involved both student and faculty input.</p>
<p>We began by formulating learning objectives for the module as a whole and for the individual module sessions. The objectives of the module were to provide students with the knowledge to discuss the successes and failures of health activism in the United States and abroad and the skills to develop their own advocacy projects on an important issue facing underserved populations. A key guiding principle of the module was its foundation in inter-professional education. Although healthcare teams are multidisciplinary in nature, there are few interfaces between students of different disciplines during their academic training. It was an important priority to draw students from different healthcare disciplines and allow them to express both their personal and discipline-specific perspectives throughout the course of the module.</p>
<p>The module had four sessions: an introduction to the history of health activism; a faculty-moderated debate on ‘current controversies in health and development’ focused on funding for AIDS programs; a panel that allowed students and activists to discuss the successes and failures of health advocacy; and student presentations of their advocacy projects. These projects required students to identify an issue of interest, engage in advocacy using skills developed during the module, and present their topic and progress to a group of students and faculty.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1757975913476908" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Outcomes and discussion</title>
<p>Thirty students from the schools of Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Physician Associate program, and one medical resident, participated in the module. Nineteen students submitted the end-of-module feedback survey.</p>
<p>The module was successful at introducing students to their role as advocates. 80% of participants stated that they planned for advocacy to be an important component of their future work, suggesting that the experience had fostered an awareness of and enthusiasm for this aspect of physician practice. Students completed advocacy projects in the following areas: hepatitis B, maternal health in the Peruvian highlands, a local disease prevention day, sexual violence and post-exposure prophylaxis access, tuberculosis and the mining industry in South Africa, and access to essential medicines. Some participants continued to pursue their projects after completion of the module. For example, one student developed his project into a ten-week research experience and has since directed a documentary film on the issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757975913476908">11</xref>). Several participants became involved with advocacy groups at our institution.</p>
<p>The new module format itself was also a success. Students felt that there was a high level of discussion and participation in the module setting, and that they had excellent access to the module faculty. They were likely to engage with the material outside of class and felt that the program was a valuable supplement to the formal curriculum. We intend to repeat the module during the next academic year, and have since collaborated with others at our institution to develop additional modules regarding topics that are often perceived as neglected in the formal medical curriculum, including Health and Violent Conflict, Global Mental Health, and Child and Maternal Health. In this way, the module format has been formalized and continues to serve as a valuable platform for educational innovation at our institution.</p>
<p>Our module for the training of physician-advocates was unique in several ways. The inclusion of physician associate, public health, and nursing students broadened the discussion and emphasized the collaborative, inter-professional nature of health advocacy. While individuals from these disciplines will work together on healthcare teams throughout their careers, the module represented a unique opportunity to collaborate as students. Utilizing a faculty leader with a long history in health activism but without medical training allowed students to develop a richer perspective on the internal and external views of their roles in this field. The module used a low-cost, easy-to-implement format that may be organized by interested students and faculty at any institution. It achieved a reasonable balance in terms of time allocation, as it represented a compromise between a full course and a single event with the aim of providing participants with an extended educational experience without burdening students already participating in the medical curriculum.</p>
<p>Our program also had important limitations. The module occupied a single time slot early in a long training curriculum, without further opportunities to develop advocacy skills and expertise as students advanced in their training. Its short length and limited number of students prevented the formal discussion of many important issues. To compensate, we developed a thorough optional reading list but without further guidance many students found this daunting. With more time, it would be possible to have more didactic sessions, skills-based training, and longitudinal projects lasting a semester or longer.</p>
<p>While students rated positively the introductory, advocate panel, and student presentation sessions, the structured debate received poorer reviews. This was likely due to the fact that students were assigned to positions in the debate rather than encouraged to express their own personal opinions. The intention was to have students study and understand positions that they might one day advocate against but the participants did not see this format as a success.</p>
<p>An unexpected result of the inter-professional module was a surprising tension during discussions between the students of clinical medicine and public health. This included conflict regarding both the justifications behind individual and population approaches to health and disagreements regarding the contributions of clinical and public health practitioners to the problems and solutions being discussed. It demonstrated the challenges individuals with different viewpoints and priorities face in working together to solve a common problem, and suggested that each side would benefit from a better understanding of the other. Several students from both sides commented on this in their end-of-module feedback. At our institution, this particular course is one of the few areas in which these two groups of students interact. In addition to clinicians, health promoters and public health practitioners are often involved in advocacy work that is of great importance to the populations that they serve. While both sides make important contributions to health advocacy, these contributions may arise from different perspectives of practice. It is therefore crucial that practitioners of clinical medicine and public health collaborate when their agendas align, and endeavor to understand the value of alternative viewpoints and approaches to shared problems. The tension we identified between these groups of students suggests that institutions may need to do a better job of encouraging communication and cooperation between healthcare fields and that it would be valuable to do so well before students become practitioners. Programs like this provide an excellent means of doing so.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This module sought to address the issue of advocacy in a practical first step by developing general awareness and basic skills in the participants. We maximized active participation and created an environment in which students could develop, express, and defend their ideas. Based on this initial experience, we intend to further develop and expand the teaching and practice of health advocacy for our students. Medical schools wishing to produce the leaders of the next generation of healthcare professionals should consider the establishment of similar programs to develop the knowledge and skills required to train their students for their role as physician-advocates.</p>
