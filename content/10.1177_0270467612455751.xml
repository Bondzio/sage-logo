<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Toward the end of the 19th century, when discipline-based approaches were widely adopted, physics became the leading scientific discipline, and engineering led the way in the professions. The reasons for this will become obvious as we examine the strengths and weaknesses of discipline-based approaches. We will show that these can explain both the extraordinary successes of our civilization and its spectacular failures. Placing engineering and other professions under greater public oversight will be a first step toward addressing our systemic economic, social, and environmental crises. These kinds of measures, along with university reform, can address what I have referred to as “our war on ourselves” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0270467612455751">Vanderburg, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Technique is essentially made up of all the discipline-based approaches to knowing and doing encountered throughout modern ways of life. Consequently, these discipline-based approaches have largely displaced the role of experience and culture. In a previous analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0270467612455751">Vanderburg, 2005</xref>), I have shown that the traditional approaches to knowing and doing based on experience and culture encountered severe limitations when industrialization had reached a certain level of development in Western Europe in the late 19th century. The response was the rapid spread of discipline-based approaches, which separated knowing and doing from experience and culture. At first, this primarily influenced industry and the economy, but gradually these approaches spread throughout all areas of human life.</p>
<p>The discipline-based approaches were so successful in industry and the economy that Germany rapidly overtook England as the leading industrial power of that time. I will trace this success to the fact that the “technological and industrial world” is built up from distinct domains in which a particular instance of a single category of phenomena endlessly repeats a process to create a subfunction that is passed on to the next domain, and so on, until the desired result is achieved. The discipline-based approaches to knowing and doing were well suited to the situations where one category of phenomena dominates all others to the point that they can be neglected. Because of the extensive influence of the mechanistic world view, very few observers recognized that these approaches were ill-suited to situations characterized by many categories of phenomena intermingling in a manner where each one makes nonnegligible contributions. It turns out that these kinds of situations are typical of living entities such as individual human lives, societies, ecosystems, and the biosphere. Human groups and societies have always attempted to understand human life and the world by symbolizing experience, which may be seen as an approach for making sense of and dealing with situations where everything is related to everything else. The stage was thus set for the conflict between technique and culture. This conflict produced the desymbolization of human experience and culture, which until now had made us human, while putting nothing in their place. This article, which develops the above thesis, is largely drawn from the introduction to <italic>Our War on Ourselves</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0270467612455751">Vanderburg, 2011</xref>) and is reproduced with permission from the University of Toronto Press, which holds the copyright.</p>

<title>Science as Biased Knowing</title>
<p>Western civilization gradually developed a unique approach to knowing ourselves and our world. It did away with any attempts to tackle these complexities, with their numerous aspects and relationships. The task of knowing was greatly simplified by parceling it out to various disciplines. Physical phenomena were the business of physicists, chemical phenomena of chemists, biological phenomena of biologists, social phenomena of sociologists, political phenomena of political scientists, and so on. Western science holds that everything can be known by examining one category of phenomena at a time. When difficulties arose, this discipline-based approach was refined to create hybrid disciplines such as physical chemistry, biochemistry, social psychology, and sociobiology.</p>
<p>Imagine for a moment if we attempted to understand our daily lives in this way. How many of our daily-life activities can be better known by consulting a single discipline? How many others appear to be constituted by the intermingling of several categories of phenomena, thus requiring the consultation of a number of disciplines and the integration of their findings? In the absence of a “science of the sciences” capable of <italic>scientifically</italic> integrating the findings, how are we to proceed in these cases?</p>
<p>The difficulties that confront us when we attempt to understand our daily lives better through science do not end here. Many of these activities directly or indirectly involve technologies of one kind or another and their products. These technological phenomena in our lives are excluded from the “one category of phenomena at a time” approach of the social sciences. A mirror-image exclusion occurs in the professions, whose disciplines examine categories of phenomena other than those dealt with by the social sciences. All of this becomes evident when we consult the index of an introductory textbook to any discipline for entries on categories of phenomena other than the one constituting its focus.</p>
<p>The above kind of exercise immediately reveals the limitations of the discipline-based approach to knowing. It works extremely well for situations in which the influence of one category of phenomena dwarfs the influences of all others, so that these can be neglected. It does not work very well for those situations in which several categories of phenomena make important contributions, so that these cannot be understood one category of phenomena at a time. The reason that physics became the model discipline and that many other disciplines failed to replicate its success also becomes apparent. Physics happens to study situations in which physical phenomena dwarf all others, as is the case for the “big bang” and the subatomic “world.” It shares this characteristic with some other disciplines, including chemistry and molecular biology.</p>
<p>The social sciences were not so fortunate. Their founding thinkers took the intermingling of many categories of phenomena in human life and society as an indication that whatever category they focused on had to be studied against the background of all the others. Such is clearly the case in the works of Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Max Weber, and many others. It is also implicit in historical works such as those of Arnold Toynbee, which examine the ways in which many categories of phenomena help constitute a society or civilization and how it grows, declines, and eventually collapses.</p>
<p>The success of physics is directly linked to its limitations. When we began to study physics in high school, we were told that initially certain aspects such as friction, air resistance, and inertia had to be neglected, reducing complex situations to simple ones to which Newton’s laws of motion could be applied in an elementary fashion. It was understood that as we advanced we would gradually learn to include these and other aspects, with the result that these situations would approximate the real world ever more closely. This is true in one respect, and entirely false in another, because the intellectual domain of physics excludes all but physical phenomena. Physicists know this very well and would not dream of attempting to solve the appropriate differential equations to help them ride their bikes or play squash. Doing this is impossible because physical phenomena are intermingled with many others, which determine the boundary conditions required to solve the equations. This is also why high school physics does not build on our prior experiences of physical phenomena implied in our ability to make sense of and skillfully carry out a range of activities that are dependent on physical phenomena as well as others, from crawling to walking to tree climbing to manipulating toys to much more skilful activities. There are good reasons that our high school physics teachers did not build on this experience but instead started us off in a mathematical domain populated exclusively by very simple physical phenomena.</p>
<p>The same kinds of issues emerge when discipline-based knowledge is applied to the creation of all manner of devices. For example, designing and building a nuclear bomb is predominantly a matter of exploiting physical phenomena; however, the moment it is exploded, the after effects soon mingle with every other imaginable category of phenomena. Although the consequences of most devices are much less powerful, they nevertheless transform everything they touch.</p>
<p>It would appear that discipline-based science is biased in favor of situations in which one category of phenomena dwarfs all others, and consequently is biased against those situations that cannot be understood in this way. The symbolization of experience by means of a culture does not have this bias, as it seeks to understand everything in relation to everything else.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0270467612455751">
<title>Technology as Biased Doing</title>
<p>During the closing decades of the 19th century, the discipline-based approach to knowing became the model for organized doing, especially in technology and industry. Until then, technological knowing and doing had been embedded in experience because they were learned by apprentices under the watchful eye of someone with a great deal of experience. This dependence on symbolizing experience first ran into difficulties in the chemical and electrical industries. What little can be observed of chemical processes does not correlate very well with what is actually happening, and nothing at all can be observed regarding electrical circuits when they function normally. The discipline-based approach to knowing was ideally suited to these industries because they arranged their artifacts and processes to take advantage of a single category of phenomena. A chemical plant is organized in terms of reactor vessels into which different chemical compounds are introduced. The product that is created from this reaction is piped to the next reactor vessel, where the next chemical reaction takes place. This continues until the final product emerges. Similarly, electrical circuits exclude all but electrical phenomena, which are intellectually modeled in mathematical domains and experimentally verified in laboratories. Germany, the first nation to develop this discipline-based approach to doing in industry, rapidly became the leading industrial power and for decades dominated the patents in these industries.</p>
<p>Simply put, technological artifacts, processes, and systems are built up from separate but interacting domains in which one category of phenomena is endlessly repeated to contribute one subfunction to the larger entity. An electronic device is based on a circuit in which various components use a particular kind of electrical phenomenon to produce a subfunction. These are connected by the circuit to create the overall desired effect. An internal combustion engine is based on a sequence of four different processes (intake of air, injection of fuel and combustion, expansion of combustion gases, and exhaust of this mixture) in the space between the engine block and the piston head. Any pressure on the piston head is translated into mechanical forces. These are transmitted through a linkage that rotates the crankshaft. In this way, distinct and separate domains produce the necessary subfunctions by exploiting a single category of phenomena or by a sequence of distinct phenomena. Almost without exception, every technological artifact, process, or system is designed to operate in this manner. Gilbert Simondon has argued that a more advanced approach ought to make use of multiple categories of phenomena at the same time, but his ideas have not been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0270467612455751">Simondon, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>As a result, discipline-based knowing and doing are ideally suited to technology and industry built up in this way. They are also well suited to anything reorganized in the image of a classical or information machine. For example, no mechanization could occur until work was reorganized in such a way that a machine could perform the same functions, by what is called the technical division of labor. Once this was accomplished, any production step could be assigned either to a machine or to a human being, but the latter had to work as if he or she were a machine.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0270467612455751">
<title>Opposing Biases</title>
<p>Our previous discussion suggests that it is essential to reflect on the differences between living entities and machines. Because of the way the latter are organized they thrive on repetition, while living organisms are destroyed by it. A machine is built up from separate domains in which the repetition of a particular instance of one category of phenomena contributes a subfunction to another domain, and this is continued until the final result is achieved. Consequently, each domain can do nothing but endlessly repeat the production of its subfunction.</p>
<p>If we attempted to organize daily-life activities in this way, we would encounter insurmountable obstacles. For example, the ones related to ordering a meal in a restaurant may be impinged on in many different ways. We may glimpse a friend whom we have been attempting to contact all day pass in front of the restaurant. While apologizing to the waitress, we get up and wave to attract his attention. Alternatively, the waitress may notice someone trying to leave without paying, causing her to dash off. Other kinds of interruptions may result from patrons asking the waitress a question, someone having a heart attack, a burning smell coming from the kitchen, people singing “Happy Birthday” at another table, or the fire alarm going off. The possibilities are almost endless, with the result that it is impossible to treat the activities related to the ordering of the meal in a restaurant as a kind of domain characterized by a script. The intervening activities may cause the activities of ordering a meal to evolve in very different ways. Each situation enfolds something of a way of life. When a great many different categories of phenomena intermingle, each one adapts and adjusts to the others, with the result that when the diversity is significant, it is highly unlikely that any situation will be repeated in quite the same way. There is no possibility of coping with such situations on the basis of repetition. Everything needs to be designed to adapt to, and evolve in, surroundings in which nothing repeats itself.</p>
<p>In other words, in a “world” designed and built in the image of the machine there is nothing but performance measured in terms of output-input ratios such as efficiency, productivity, and profitability. It is by these outputs and inputs that the different domains are connected together. Increases in performance of the machine thus depend on the performance of its constituent domains and the design for their integration. Everything is accomplished by exploiting one instance of one category of phenomena at a time.</p>
<p>However, in situations in which many different categories of phenomena mingle, with the result that each and every one contributes to what is happening, there is no possibility of anything recurring in quite the same way. There are simply too many reciprocal adaptations to too many other categories of phenomena, which means that the probability of anything ever occurring in exactly the same way is so small as to be negligible. There is order and disorder, predictability and chaos, and all this is rooted in the indivisible character of life in the world, where everything evolves in relation to everything else. Nothing is ever entirely separable from everything else without some impairment and loss of understanding. It is the very design, construction, and operation of machines that is fundamentally at odds with anything that depends on the positive and negative synergies of a great many phenomena, all making their unique contributions, with the result that repetition is out of the question. On some level we all know this, but our civilization has organized everything in such a way that this has become practically invisible. It is possible to improve the performance of any living entity by repeating one or more aspects, but this comes at a great cost to its integrality and its ability to adapt and evolve within a living world.</p>
<p>All this is deeply rooted in the way living beings come into existence. We are not assembled out of separate parts in our mother’s womb. If this were the case, we could not adapt and evolve to everything around us. Instead, embryos develop by progressive cell differentiation. The biological whole is represented by the DNA in each and every stem cell, with the result that within the embryo each one of these cells can specialize to become a unique expression of that whole, which permits it to see, to hear, to clean the blood, and to perform all the other functions that are required to sustain the whole. There are no “parts” in the sense of a machine. Each cell is both whole and part. It is both internally and externally connected to all the others and, via them, to the whole, which allows for ways of participation that are impossible in a machine. Moreover, all the cells in our bodies are constantly being repaired and replaced, with the exception of our brain cells, which are only repaired. All the others have a lifespan ranging from days to about 7 years, with the result that, except for our brains, our bodies “turn over” many times during our lives, and yet they remain our own. As an expression of the whole, each cell sustains, and is in turn sustained by, this whole.</p>
<p>Much the same development occurs on the sociocultural level. Following birth, human communities act as a social womb in which we become people of our time, place, and culture. The limited organizations of the brain-minds, with which people are born, progressively differentiate as a result of the symbolization of their experiences by means of neural and synaptic changes to these organizations. This development of our brain-minds by progressive differentiation implies that we internalize the cultural design of our community for making sense of, and living in, the world. The organizations of our brain-minds symbolically map this cultural design through the experiences of learning to participate in it. Once again, there is no question of our becoming “parts” of a social mechanism. Growing up makes us into individually unique manifestations of a cultural whole, analogous to the relationship between ourselves and our bodies. The organizations of our brain-minds are the equivalent of the DNA of the sociocultural level. All aspects of our being a person of our time, place, and culture evolve in relation to all others, with the result that all of them sustain, and are sustained by, the community.</p>
<p>As we adapt to our social and physical surroundings, these surroundings are, in large measure, the result of other people also living their lives. This includes their interaction with, and modification of, our physical surroundings. As others sustain our lives we sustain theirs and to the extent that we fail to do this we all suffer.</p>
<p>Much the same is true for all nonsymbolic species. As unique manifestations of the biosphere, their lives are sustained by the whole represented as the DNA. The niches in a local ecosystem are the result of all other species doing the same. In the biosphere, with its enormous diversity of situations created by the mingling of numerous phenomena, nothing ever repeats itself in quite the same way. There is a reciprocal adaptation and evolution of all species to all others, and it is this reciprocity that sustains all life. It accounts for the incredible resilience of all organisms and living entities. Each and every life form is constantly sustaining all the others by adjusting to them, as they do to it. No engineered system can come anywhere close to having this kind of resilience; such a system is in the business of repetition, which is the exact opposite of adaptation and evolution.</p>
<p>We are now beginning to discover that our civilization has taken all this too much for granted during the last two centuries. The situation is somewhat analogous to people losing their short-term memories, which interferes with each experience being symbolized by neural and synaptic changes to the organizations of their brain-minds. Each experience can no longer be symbolically related to all the others and thus become a moment of their lives. Their lives can no longer symbolically evolve, because the organizations of their brain-minds cannot adapt. Consequently, these people can no longer participate in a conversation, because they cannot remember what was said before. Nor are they able to make sense of a story they read or a movie they watch. Their lives are disconnected in space and time as well. When these people are taken into a building, they will not remember how they got there, with the result that unless they knew the building from before the onset of the disease they will be totally lost. In the same vein, they have no idea of the time when they last ate, or did anything else, for that matter. With the onset of short-term memory loss, the limited ability of these people’s lives working in the background becomes painfully obvious.</p>
<p>Much the same argument can be made for our interference in the processes of the biosphere. We experience the results as a loss in the biosphere’s capacities to sustain all life. However, we generally treat the environmental crisis as a phenomenon in its own right rather than treating it as a symptom of the malfunction of our discipline-based approach to knowing and doing. This is particularly evident in the way our universities deal with it and in the influence this has on governments and corporations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0270467612455751">
<title>Some Consequences</title>
<p>Since our civilization values the discipline-based approaches to knowing and doing over all alternatives, its successes and failures can readily be explained. Much of individual and collective human life is made up of situations to which many different categories of phenomena make nonnegligible contributions. When any discipline-based approach is applied to these kinds of situations, it will abstract those phenomena that belong to the category in which it specializes in order to place them in a domain exclusively populated by this one category of phenomena. It thereby gains the advantages of comparative approaches at the expense of getting a grip on how these phenomena contribute to the adaptation and evolution of the situations in which they participate. As a result, the application of any discipline-based knowledge will necessarily multiply the tensions in any living world (natural or cultural), thereby revealing its antilife bias. Discipline-based approaches will not produce these problems wherever individual and collective human life has been reorganized in the image of classical or information machines. In other words, discipline-based approaches can improve what a particular phenomenon does in comparison with all other phenomena of the same kind without being able to evaluate how this affects the context to which this particular phenomenon contributes. Without intending to do so, our civilization has ended up with approaches that deliver performance by tearing the fabric of relations integral to all life.</p>
<p>From the outset, our civilization was unaware of the antilife bias of its discipline-based approaches, and this largely remains the case. Science was not perceived to have any limitations in the domain of knowing nor technology in the domain of doing. Culture-based designs for making sense of and living in the world were replaced by countless decisions supported by discipline-based knowing and doing. Customs and traditions all but disappeared. The consequences have been devastating. For example, when economists study the economic phenomena within human life and society, they necessarily behave as if these phenomena dominated all of life, which implies that, in essence, life is economic. All the other phenomena can be neglected, or understood in terms of economic phenomena. They will inevitably be biased against situations in which economic phenomena contribute very little or where other phenomena are much more important. The pinnacle of this bias has been reached by the Chicago School of Economics. It has essentially decreed that markets, rates of unemployment, and <italic>homo economicus</italic> are “natural” and thus beyond our responsibility.</p>
<p>In the same vein, we are endlessly told that technology is neutral and that its influence on human life, society, and the biosphere is the result of its use, as opposed to its structure and its intermingling with other phenomena. From the above brief exploration, it would appear that such a position is untenable. Science, technology, and the economic growth achieved with them are hardly neutral and certainly not objective. Our ways of life have introduced a bias in favor of everything technological. We succeed brilliantly in improving the performance of everything that has been reorganized in the image of the machine and fail equally spectacularly in ensuring that it is adapted to, and able to evolve with, everything else. All this has become very destructive of all life.</p>
<p>The discipline-based technical approach has all but replaced the symbolic cultural approach in almost every sphere of human life. It proceeds by treating everything we wish to improve as a domain constituted of a limited number of variables and by neglecting all the others. However, doing so is scientifically acceptable only when everything else remains the same (in which case it does not evolve and is therefore assumed to be dead), when everything else repeats itself (in which case it is assumed to be a dead machine or a technical system), or when everything else may be neglected (in which case it is devalued to the point that it might as well not exist). Its widespread use is unscientific in most cases, with the result that these assumptions reveal the antilife bias of our modern ways of life and the nihilistic orientation of our civilization. Max Weber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0270467612455751">Gerth &amp; Mills, 1963</xref>) examined the embryonic beginnings of this process, which he called <italic>rationality</italic>. Decades later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0270467612455751">Jacques Ellul (1964</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0270467612455751">1980)</xref> examined it as the phenomenon and system of technique. These developments are characterized by the drive for efficiency based on reorganizing everything in mechanistic or informational terms by using a discipline-based approach. The technical approach builds a technical order separated from the cultural order that has evolved on the basis of experience and culture.</p>
<p>This technical order of non-sense is destructive of life in four important ways. First, discipline-based expertise is separated from human life and the world through a triple abstraction. As an example, consider what happens in our hospitals. Since many different phenomena are involved in their operations, there is no discipline that corresponds to hospitals. To bring discipline-based knowing and doing to bear on their operations, hospitals must be abstracted from the world, which is replaced with the “inputs” of sick or injured people received and the “outputs” of discharged patients returned to it. Before anyone can participate in the healing process that transforms these inputs into outputs, they must further abstract from it those aspects commensurate with their disciplines or specialties. Doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, nutritionists, psychiatrists, social workers, information systems specialists, administrators, accountants, maintenance engineers, public relations specialists, and security consultants all know different aspects according to their disciplines. Since these disciplines exclude how the running of a hospital interacts with everything else, specialists cannot decide between alternative courses of action in response to an issue on the basis of what is best for human life, society, and the biosphere. They cannot use the values of their culture from which they have abstracted all they could—namely, only the part of the healing process related to their discipline and whatever interventions they return to this process—and this can be measured only in terms of output-input ratios abstracted from human values. As a result, the discipline-based division of labor in hospitals carries on as if these hospitals were organized in terms of separate and distinct domains in which one category of phenomena, corresponding to a single discipline or specialty, contributes a subfunction first to the healing process and then, via it, to the functioning of hospitals. Everything these discipline-based specialists do is thus separated from human life and society via a triple abstraction, and their collective efforts build a technical order that evolves without making any reference to sense.</p>
<p>A second important consequence of discipline-based approaches results from the fact that specialists suspended in this triple abstraction cannot intellectually “see,” let alone deal with, most of the negative consequences of their decisions because these fall beyond their domains of expertise. They cannot symbolize their professional experiences in relation to everything else, with the result that they are unable to see out of their disciplines (justly referred to as <italic>silos</italic>) in order to adjust their decision making to achieve their goals and at the same time prevent or greatly minimize undesired and harmful effects. The daily-life equivalent would be to train people to drive their cars by having them concentrate on their performance as indicated by the gauges on the dashboard and only occasionally glance out of their windows when they hear a loud noise. Consequently, the many undesired and harmful consequences of discipline-based decision making must be dealt with in an end-of-pipe fashion. Additional goods and services must be created to compensate or mitigate these effects, and this has become so expensive that we have all but given up on effective regulation. It has also transformed wealth creation into wealth extraction.</p>
<p>The third consequence makes matters even worse, because all that the discipline-based approach to knowing and doing can do is improve the performance of everything. When genuine solutions require prevention by better adaptation and evolution, this approach to knowing and doing is structurally incapable of providing them. For example, the gridlock in many cities will not be resolved by endlessly optimizing the carrying capacities of our transportation systems. In addition to “supply-side” approaches that increase carrying capacities, “demand-side” approaches are essential to reduce our need for mobility. These transcend the usual disciplines. In the meantime, most discipline-based solutions lead to further deterioration in the compatibility between people, their transportation needs, urban forms, and the biosphere.</p>
<p>Finally, individual specialists and their collective efforts through the current intellectual and professional division of labor behave as if human life and the world were organized in the image of conventional or information machines, meaning that they are built up from distinct and separate domains, in which one category of phenomena contributes a subfunction. If we ever needed evidence that human life and the world are not organized in this way, it is surely furnished by the mushrooming human, social, and environmental crises of our time—provided we understand that they are the result of the common bias in discipline-based knowing and doing.</p>

<title>Symbolization and Desymbolization</title>
<p>Our civilization is undermining what until now, in the human story, has made us what we are: a symbolic species. Simply put, to symbolize human experiences by means of a culture is to dialectically organize the ways in which everything is related to everything else in the world, and desymbolization is the undermining of these abilities. On the level of the individual, symbolization transforms each experience by symbolically relating it to all others, thereby turning it into a moment of a person’s life. It establishes the meaning and value of every experience for that life. On the collective level, symbolization creates cultures by which groups and societies are able to make sense of and live in an ultimately unknowable universe by providing, by means of myths, a direction and orientation points that exclude any alternatives. Desymbolization occurs when symbolization is impaired, especially through discipline-based approaches to knowing and doing and the consequences of these approaches for human life and the world. Resymbolization uses the process of symbolization to transform the discipline-based approaches to knowing and doing so that, once again, human life in the world makes sense. Resymbolization reunifies daily-life knowing and doing with scientific and technical knowing and doing.</p>
<p>Human journeys guided by cultures with low levels of desymbolization result in everything they create being highly compatible with everything else, just as we observed in the evolution of the biosphere. In contrast, human journeys that are guided by highly desymbolized cultures result in everything being much less compatible with everything else, the symptoms of which are inappropriate technologies and unsustainable ways of life. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0270467612455751">Table 1</xref> compares societies and civilizations that have traditional cultures to those with highly symbolized cultures. When we acknowledge that our cultures are highly desymbolized, it will be difficult to continue to behave as if phenomena such as global warming, peak oil, pollution, and resource depletion are disturbing and possibly life threatening but solvable. Jointly they are the symptoms of a path of development that has been permeated with an antilife bias. We continue to proceed as if these issues can be solved one at a time by more science and technology. As a result, there continues to be a proliferation of “-isms” that further manifest the high levels of desymbolization of our cultures. We are simply unable to connect the dots and treat these issues as inseparable symptoms of our antilife bias. It produces the ultimate technical bluff: that what our contemporary ways of life have to offer us is worth giving up what has made us cultural beings.</p>

<p>With hindsight, it is apparent that desymbolization and its effects on human life have had precursors that resulted in warnings being issued by a number of scholars. Some of these have turned out to be prophetic. Adam Smith warned that the technical division of labor would produce a new wealth of nations but that it would also make human beings as stupid as they could possibly become (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0270467612455751">Smith, 1902</xref>). Karl Marx showed that the capitalist system enslaved the rich and the poor alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0270467612455751">Ellul, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0270467612455751">2003</xref>). Max Weber warned that humanity was shutting itself into an iron cage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0270467612455751">Brubaker, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0270467612455751">Gerth &amp; Mills, 1963</xref>). John Kenneth Galbraith deplored the fact that we were serving the system we created to serve us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0270467612455751">Galbraith, 1985</xref>). Jacques Ellul warned us against the autonomy of what he called the system of technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0270467612455751">Ellul, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0270467612455751">Vanderburg, 2005</xref>); by this he meant that the influence of this system on people and communities had begun to outweigh the influence of people and communities on it.</p>
<p>These warnings can readily be understood provided we recognize that being a symbolic species transforms our relations with our surroundings (both physical and social). These relations become reciprocal because each and every experience of these surroundings modifies the organizations of our brain-minds, as it is symbolically placed within our lives. Hence, as we affect our surroundings, they simultaneously affect us. We are thus internally and externally connected to these surroundings as a consequence of being a symbolic species. However, although we directly experience how we affect our surroundings, we do not directly experience how these in turn influence us. Paying critical attention to this latter interaction will fundamentally change our perception of the former interaction.</p>
<p>The concerns of the above authors are shared by the present study. Human slavery (the equivalent of sin in the Jewish and Christian traditions and of alienation in the social sciences) is an unacceptable form of human life. Our freedom is threatened when the influence we have on our surroundings is dwarfed by the influence these surroundings have on us. There can be no pretence of objectivity in this matter. The tensions between freedom and alienation are at the heart of our analysis of our being a symbolic species and of our desymbolizing activities.</p>

<title>Rebuilding Cities</title>
<p>By way of illustration, consider how we build and evolve cities. The phenomenon of urbanization, as we know it today around the globe, had its roots in industrialization when the population became concentrated in centers of manufacture and trade. This concentration of the population went hand-in-hand with the mechanization and subsequent industrialization of agriculture, which displaced farm workers and, increasingly, the family farm.</p>
<p>The first industrial centers were, for the most part, little more than slums. Conditions were so bad that many social movements were preoccupied with this problem and its consequences. As far as the urban forms were concerned, two ideas were proposed for creating a more livable urban habitat. One was the Garden City and the other Le Corbusier’s Towers in the Park. It should be noted that both these concepts were entirely abstract and theoretical in the sense that there was no input from experience. It is easy to understand why they drew a great deal of attention, and even an enthusiastic reception. However, it should be noted that the Garden City essentially implied the application of the technical division of labor to daily life by separating the functions of working, shopping, living, and enjoying free time. In the same vein, Towers in the Park is as close as we can come to mass production in construction, in the sense that in every tower, floor after floor repeats itself with minor variations.</p>
<p>In the past, city building was based on tradition as the accumulated experience of past generations. The process of industrialization has overwhelmed all traditions (including that of city building), creating new situations for which there was no prior experience. As the discipline-based approaches gained strength, city building was dealt with through disciplines including architecture, civil engineering, urban planning, urban sociology, and urban geography.</p>
<p>These disciplines could not cope with the daily lives of people on the streets, in parks, or any public place for that matter. There were too many phenomena that were all intermingled, with the result that many of them could not, after all, be neglected. However, city building soon became the application of many disciplines (one at a time) toward refining the above models for Western urban planning: the combination of the Towers in the Park with Garden City-like urban and suburban developments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0270467612455751">Jacobs, 1961</xref>).</p>
<p>As is evident from the earlier analysis of discipline-based knowing and doing, the new urban forms were not nearly as livable, and certainly not as sustainable, as they had been in the past when they had evolved on the basis of traditions.</p>
<p>Jane Jacobs has had an enormous influence on city building through her approach of going back to the experiences people and herself had of life on city streets and in neighborhoods. Consequently, she was able to develop extensive metaconscious knowledge, which is critical in the formation of human expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0270467612455751">Vanderburg, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0270467612455751">2011</xref>). On the basis of this expertise, she could group streets in terms of whether they “worked” for people or not. Once classified in this manner, it became possible to analyze what streets that “worked” for people had in common, what streets that did not “work” shared, and so on. In this way, Jane Jacobs was able to develop her influential four principles for livable urban forms: mixed functions, short blocks, a mix of buildings, and a sufficient density of dwellings per net acre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0270467612455751">Jacobs, 1961</xref>). These design principles inspired many of the most progressive urban design movements such as the New Urbanism movement, urban village design, transit-oriented development, pedestrian pockets, and “smart growth.” It is my contention that Jane Jacobs had, in effect, found the closest substitute for the traditions of city building that had been destroyed by industrialization. By building up her experience of life in cities, she was able to make the kind of overall assessments of how well things worked for people that no discipline or group of disciplines can make. Her four design principles describe what I have referred to as design exemplars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0270467612455751">Vanderburg, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0270467612455751">2011</xref>), which are distinguished from analytical exemplars developed by discipline-based knowing and doing.</p>
<p>The above kind of diagnosis also explains why the teaching of design in engineering, for example, has generally been a failure. No design textbook, as far as I am aware, makes a clear distinction between design exemplars and analytical exemplars and, hence, between the role of experience and culture and that of discipline-based knowing and doing separated from experience and culture. The former makes the greatest possible use of context by symbolizing everything in relation to everything else, while the latter desymbolizes everything to retain a single category of phenomena. This is the basis for suggesting that university reform is urgently required to overcome the limitations of discipline-based knowing and doing. I have made suggestions for economics, the other social sciences, engineering, management science, medicine, and law, in order to illustrate ways in which the limitations of discipline-based knowing and doing might be overcome by what I have referred to as resymbolization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0270467612455751">Vanderburg, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>However, such university reforms are highly unlikely. As I have explained elsewhere: as people change technology and technique, these human creations simultaneously change people. This is because we internalize our experiences of them and symbolize them through neurosynaptic changes to the organizations of our brain-minds. In this way, we can become “possessed” by our own creations, thus leading to what Jacques Ellul has referred to as the autonomy of technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0270467612455751">Ellul, 1964</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0270467612455751">1980</xref>). Furthermore, it has led to new cultural unities based on secular myth, which make it next to impossible for us to treat our creations realistically. The system of technique is characterized by a lack of negative feedback, as I noted earlier.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is no question that if one day we begin to recognize the urgent need for resymbolization; if we want to create ways of life that incorporate discipline-based approaches to knowing and doing, but which are not dominated by them, resymbolization becomes possible. It may well take a century or more to undertake the restructuring of the “system.” In the meantime our economic, social, and environmental crises are deepening, and we keep on making them worse by our end-of-pipe approaches to our problems. For example, some civil engineering departments can see no further than life cycle analysis (for which the only real preventive alternative is design for environment), industrial ecology (now essentially an end-of-pipe discipline), sustainable engineering practices (essentially the conventional approaches enriched with ideology, but certainly not based on a proper diagnosis of what has gone wrong), and input-output analysis (methodologically flawed and a very blunt instrument that is good only for generating numbers for lobbyists and certainly not for preventive engineering). Very few engineering departments are willing to ask the fundamental questions as to why so much progress in discipline-based approaches does not appear to be translating into more livable and sustainable urban forms; and much the same can be said for every department in our engineering faculties.</p>

<title>Rebuilding the Economy</title>
<p>In an analysis of modern economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0270467612455751">Vanderburg, 2011</xref>), I have shown that technique has turned them into anti-economies, or debt economies, because the costs incurred in the production of wealth have outstripped gross wealth production. It is the direct consequence of the fact that economic growth depends on discipline-based approaches. These problems are greatly exacerbated by financial engineering, which, in relation to money and capital, functions in the same way as other traditional engineering approaches. Sophisticated computer models seek to maximize the financial gains derived from certain inputs by completely ignoring how these relations are an integral part of the way everything is related to everything else in human life, society, and the biosphere. The level of abstraction has become so great that we appear to be incapable of recognizing that it is impossible to create money from money. What we are producing is an ever-larger claim against the goods and services we produce, resulting in economies of debt. The situation is so bad that less than 4% of daily financial transactions around the globe corresponds to anything real instead of speculation. Moreover, it is dividing humanity ever more sharply into the haves and the have-nots, with a small percentage of the world population absorbing an ever-larger share of these claims against the national and global economies. It is fortunate that most people do not understand how much technique has transformed economies and capital as the prime factor of production now structuring them. Had this understanding been widespread in 2008, Wall Street would have produced a global meltdown that would have dwarfed the devastating consequences of the Great Depression. Undoubtedly, there will be other such events to follow, since anti-economies are almost entirely speculative.</p>

<title>Medical Successes and Failures</title>
<p>The strengths and weaknesses of discipline-based approaches to knowing and doing can directly explain the successes and failures of both traditional and modern medicine. Generally speaking, contemporary medicine succeeds brilliantly when a patient is threatened in a way that, unless the problem is dealt with, very serious consequences could result. Relative to these consequences, any side-effects may be regarded as a minor matter. The phenomena associated with the crisis are thus regarded as dominating all others, with the result that the latter can (at least temporarily) be neglected. Contemporary medicine is much less successful when one category of phenomena does not dominate the situation. This may occur where a condition is of a long duration and where the interaction with other phenomena is significant in generating serious side-effects. It is also not very successful where less significant medical conditions are the result of a variety of categories of phenomena that interact in significant ways.</p>
<p>In the past, medical practice, like everything else, was based on tradition. These traditions accumulated the experiences of many generations. Industrialization weakened or destroyed almost every tradition by overwhelming it with a great many situations for which there existed no prior experience. Any tradition depends on slow and careful adaptation to a few new situations while all others remain essentially stable. In this way, tradition-based medicine could deal with situations determined by the interactions of a great many phenomena and draw more or less appropriate conclusions. Today, tradition-based medicine has become impossible. There have been far too many rapid changes in diet, work, lifestyle, recreation, and the urban habitat, all of which significantly affect people’s health. Treatments that may well have been very successful in the past now face so many new interactions between the relevant categories of phenomena that they may or may not be successful.</p>
<p>To sum up: Modern medicine excels at situations in which one category of phenomena is so critically important that there is little choice but to neglect all other categories that may be affected. In contrast, tradition-based medicine can deal with a great many categories of phenomena as long as they all evolve very slowly, with very limited adjustments having to be made to new situations.</p>
<p>The only real solution to our medical crisis, especially in relation to exponentially growing health care budgets, is to reduce the enormously high rate at which we manufacture disease as a consequence of our nonpreventive discipline-based approaches. To accomplish this will require the resymbolization of the modern university, which is described in detail in the work on which this article is based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0270467612455751">Vanderburg, 2011</xref>). Today, medicine must be resymbolized in order to reestablish a clear distinction between disease care and health care. It will also help deal with the issues that Raymond Downing has referred to as biohealth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0270467612455751">Downing, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It is urgent that we undertake university reforms designed to help us create economies that can produce the goods and services we need but with far fewer negative effects. I recommend that we begin by placing the engineering profession under greater public scrutiny. Decades ago, I showed that future engineers learn almost nothing about how technology influences human life, society, and the biosphere and even less about the use of such knowledge to adjust their design and decision making to obtain the desired results but, at the same time, prevent or greatly minimize undesired effects. The engineering profession in North America was notified, including its accreditation board, academies of engineering, and the deans of many engineering schools. A blueprint was developed for allowing the profession to comprehensively protect the public interest, as is required by law; but the research was simply ignored. Included in the strategy was a set of research instruments that would allow department heads and deans to track annual progress toward protecting the public interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0270467612455751">Vanderburg, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0270467612455751">2011</xref>). Outside of the profession, however, there was widespread interest and recognition. The Canada Foundation for Innovation recognized it as one of 25 leading Canadian innovations in 2002. The former Premier’s Council of Ontario, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council in Canada all used it to develop plans for reform. However, because of their economic monetarism and fundamentalism, Conservative governments sooner or later halted these efforts. Since the failure of monetarism is now undeniable, it is time to revisit these approaches in an attempt to address the structural roots of our economic, social, and environmental crises.</p>
