<p>Can innovation save gifted education? As a field, we are facing the dismantling of the sole federal presence in gifted education, the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Program, through budget cuts. We have seen significant sectors of the gifted education landscape appropriated by other constituencies in education. Higher order and critical thinking, for example, have long been adopted as expected outcomes by general education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0016986211431556">Marzano, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0016986211431556">Ritchert &amp; Perkins, 2005</xref>). A thriving professional development industry in differentiation exists but does not often tackle differentiating for high-performing or high-potential learners. Certainly, very few individuals here tonight would be able to state that they have the resources, either monetary or human, to serve adequately the talented youngsters in their classrooms, schools, or homes.</p>
<p>On a more upbeat note, President Obama’s <italic>Blueprint for Education</italic> released in 2010 explicitly refers to the need for gifted programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0016986211431556">U.S. Department of Education, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, the National Science Board (NSB) of the National Science Foundation (NSF) recently released a report focused on innovation titled, <italic>Preparing the Next Generation of STEM Innovators: Identifying and Developing Our Nation’s Human Capital</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0016986211431556">NSB, 2010</xref>). As the title makes clear, the NSB report connects two key concepts—innovation and human capital. Connecting innovation with gifted education is a necessity not only in the current political climate but also because we are a field with deeply held beliefs about the importance of problem solving, creativity, imagination, and invention—all critical components of innovation.</p>
<p>In these remarks, I focus on three key ideas. First, I explore the concept of innovation that has an interesting history as well as a bright future. Second, a biographical detour provided the opportunity to hang flesh on the dry bones of the abstract concept by using the lives of two inventors as illustrations of an important lesson about innovation—the lesson I believe our field needs most immediately. Third, I will explore the education of talented students in what has often been termed, the <italic>Age of Innovation</italic>. All three key ideas lead us to ask, “What should the field of gifted education focus on next?” Where does the leading edge of innovation direct us?</p>
<sec id="section1-0016986211431556">
<title>Innovation as a Concept</title>
<p>Innovation appeals. It sounds so full of action and forward movement. Play along for a moment and say the word aloud—innovation. Then, add a flourish—INNOVATION—and you can literally feel the energy. As a popularly used term, innovation has arrived; it has its own scholarly handbook, <italic>The International Handbook of Innovation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0016986211431556">Shavininia, 2003a</xref>). In the opening chapter, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0016986211431556">Shavininia (2003b)</xref> introduces the concept of innovation science as the systematic study of innovation across domains and disciplines. The existence of a handbook or a topical encyclopedia signals the widespread acceptance by a critical mass of specialists. Finally, who can deny the importance of innovation if it has acquired its own branch of media coverage known as “injo,” short for innovation journalism? From scholarly handbooks to online news, injo shapes the way we think about innovation and the increasing frequency with which we do so.</p>
<p>For a former English teacher, a fuzzy or complex conceptual definition is an open invitation to develop an extended definition essay. Multiple and nuanced definitions drive this examination of the ways that innovation might, as the title of my presidential address suggests, save gifted education. First, I looked up innovation in the dictionary, an online dictionary, of course. The definitions were spare and expected; they focused on novelty. The connection between novelty and innovation was satisfyingly creative, but I continued to root around in the dustbin of definitions. A collection of terms related to innovation—creativity, discovery, imagination, inquiry, and most important—invention—contribute to the application of innovation to gifted education. Given this rich family of concepts, I investigated further.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0016986211431556">
<title>Innovation: A Forward-Looking Concept With a History</title>
<p>In fact, innovation is an idea with quite a history. We can excavate it back to classical scholars, but 17th-century polymath, Sir Francis Bacon, trained his considerable analytic skills on it convincingly for a modern audience. Having laid the foundations of what we know as the scientific method today, Bacon is widely admired in the domains of science, history, and literary study for his acute observations. During the Renaissance, innovation became a concept that implied usefulness and improvement for the public good. Mindful perhaps of the plagues that swept Europe, Bacon viewed medicine as an innovation from a 17th-century perspective. Bacon once said, “He that will not apply new remedies must expect new evils.” Bacon’s advice continues to resonate. In our business, the talent development business, failure to be at the leading edge of innovation brings us fresh problems and persistent threats.</p>
<p>Jumping from the 17th to the 21st century, we find evidence that the concept of innovation has permeated popular thinking from a number of perspectives and across a number of disciplines that were largely unknown to Bacon and other thinkers of his era. Blogger, Hutch Carpenter, fed up trying to keep track of the seemingly endless definitions of innovation, created a spoke-like graphic to organize them into a concept map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0016986211431556">Carpenter, 2010</xref>). He investigated innovation from the perspective of creativity, from business, from personal need, from problem solving, and from applied invention.</p>
<p>In the previous centuries with the rise of professional science, the term <italic>innovation</italic> was co-opted to mean technological innovation. Business and industry found innovation was the engine that ran their concerns, gave the public what it wanted (more goods, more services), and made money. I term the more recent conceptualization of innovation, “technological innovation,” INNOVATION 2.0 because it connotes the social and participatory nature of modern innovative practices. In addition, drawing the distinction between innovation in general and technological innovation in particular helps us to understand the difference between two important, but different concepts—innovation and invention. Both imply novelty and imagination, but there are differences, and those differences are the basis for the take-away message of this address.</p>
<p>In what ways are invention and innovation the same? In what ways are invention and innovation different? Does the distinction matter? In fact, I suggest that the distinction does matter in terms of an important lesson for our field. Innovation has become such a buzzword. The politicians, the policy wonks, the talking heads of science and technology, the media, and the specialized injo repeatedly use the term innovation among various publics and across special interests. We should join the discussion. How can our field benefit from exploring the question, “Can innovation save gifted education?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0016986211431556">
<title>Lives of Invention and Innovation</title>
<p>Faced with complex concepts, I fled to my roots in literature and biography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0016986211431556">Henshon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0016986211431556">Robinson, 2010</xref>). Could I better understand these two concepts if I looked at real embodiments of them? Inspired by the hugely successful technological innovation of the commercial light bulb, I settled upon two biographical exemplars: Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison. Both individuals contributed to its history. They illustrate very powerfully the important difference between invention and innovation and why the field of gifted education must focus on the latter, innovation, now.</p>
<sec id="section4-0016986211431556">
<title>Thomas Edison</title>
<p>Thomas Alva Edison (1847-1931) is as iconic a figure as possible in gifted education. Precocious, inventive, nonconformist, plagued by early ear infections and other health problems, in trouble at school, highly productive and eminent as an adult, Edison is a poster child for the field. Capturing the mixture of cherub and miscreant, an early photographic portrait of him shows a young child with elaborate collar, vigorously brushed hair, and intent scowl. Passing judgment on Edison’s shortcomings as a person is not the intent, but rather suggesting him as a pure embodiment of innovation is. He is one of the few figures everyone can name so associated with the light bulb that most people think he invented it. He did not, but he did improve it and make it possible for us to have one in our homes and offices. As you can see from his words, he believed that inventions became innovations only when adopted by an adoring market. Edison once said, “Anything that won’t sell, I don’t want to invent. Its sale is proof of utility, and utility is success.” In other words, his pragmatism was part of his extraordinary acceptance by the public and the holders of corporate purse strings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0016986211431556">Gorman &amp; Carlson, 1990</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0016986211431556">
<title>Nikola Tesla</title>
<p>In contrast to Edison, the classic inventor-to-innovator, the other biographical exemplar was an engaging figure whose life is both illuminating and poignant, Nikolas Tesla (1856-1943). Less familiar than Edison, Tesla’s story requires more detail. Nikola Tesla was Serbian; he was born in modern-day Croatia. His father was a priest in the Serbian Orthodox Church. His mother came from a family known to invent household and agricultural tools, and Tesla credits her with his passion for invention. He was a mechanical and electrical engineer who acquired approximately 100 U.S. patents, who contributed to fields from radio technology, that is, wireless communication, to alternating current (AC) electric power systems. Some historians and scientists believe Tesla developed the first robotics concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0016986211431556">Cheney &amp; Uth, 1999</xref>). He was extraordinary, but often otherworldly. He describes his method of invention in the following words,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My method is different. I do not rush into actual work. When I get a new idea, I start at once building it up in my imagination, and make improvements and operate the device in my mind. When I have gone so far as to embody everything in my invention, every possible improvement I can think of, and when I see no fault anywhere, I put into concrete form the final product of my brain. (Retrieved from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.teslauniverse.com">www.teslauniverse.com</ext-link>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>His view of invention differs vastly from Edison’s blunt statement that “to invent, you need a good imagination and a pile of junk.” And, yet, Tesla was not unmindful of the need for an invention to become an accepted innovation. He also said,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The practical success of an idea, irrespective of its inherent merit, is dependent on the attitude of the contemporaries. If timely, it is quickly adopted, if not, it is apt to fare like a sprout lured out of the ground by warm sunshine, only to be injured and retarded in its growth by the succeeding frost. (Retrieved from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nikolateslainvetion.org/nikola-tesla-quote">www.nikolateslainvetion.org/nikola-tesla-quote</ext-link>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Certainly, we want neither our field nor the children we serve damaged by the frost of public and policy indifference.</p>
<p>Examine two telling pictures of these two inventors. Although he was not the original inventor, Edison holds the filament light bulb he innovated into success outward towards the camera and presumably the waiting market (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0016986211431556">Figure 1</xref>). Tesla appears with his one of his many improved products, the fluorescent light; his gaze as mysterious as the ghostly, glowing bulb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0016986211431556">Figure 2</xref>). To make a point about the difference between invention and innovation, I could add an image of the Tesla coil wreathed in lightning; it captures Tesla’s success at invention, but difficulties with practical innovation. Today, the Tesla coil is mainly used to amuse children in science museums, but Tesla hoped that these devices would allow energy to be transmitted successfully and commercially without wire. Thus far, wireless transmission of electrical power eludes science and industry. The primary insight drawn from the comparison of these two individuals is that to change the world, invention must be taken to the innovation level; practicality and public acceptance are crucial.</p>

<p>Public acceptance of our ideas and educational inventions is needed now in gifted education. We need society at large, and decision makers in particular, to accept our inventive designs for the education. To survive in the 21st century, we, like Edison, must move good ideas and solutions from invention to innovation. We must sell our educational inventions to the public and the decision makers at the federal, state, and local levels. When we do so, like Edison, we will have transformed our inventions into innovations.</p>

<title>Education in the Age of Innovation</title>
<p>What about innovative education for talented youth? In terms of our two exemplars, Edison was largely homeschooled; Tesla had a very good education in the European system. Today, in the Age of Innovation, in the knowledge economy, what is in store for our gifted children? Economist and commentator, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0016986211431556">Richard Florida (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0016986211431556">2005</xref>), coined his concept of the Creative Class to suggest where and how communities would attract innovative people. Although he is certainly not without critics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0016986211431556">Hoyman &amp; Faricy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0016986211431556">Peck, 2005</xref>), his conceptualization of the future knowledge neighborhood is intriguing.</p>
<p>Florida estimates that about one third of the 21st century workforce belongs to the Creative Class. Some of these individuals form the Super-creative Core who are people working at the edges and intersections of disciplines. They imagine for a living. They create. They generate problems as well as solutions. They invent. They innovate. Then, Florida describes another sector of the Creative Class, the Creative Professionals. Educators are among them. Creative Professionals are generally well-educated, knowledge-based workers who draw on complex bodies of information from a wide range of sources to solve problems in their disciplines and at their workplace. Finally, Florida identifies a smaller group of individuals within the Creative Class—Bohemians. They are creative, outside the mainstream, and probably heavily engaged in the arts and cultural activity.</p>
<sec id="section7-0016986211431556">
<title>Policy Crowbars</title>
<p>We know that today’s gifted children and adolescents are part of tomorrow’s Creative Class, but only if we can provide the right educational trajectory for them. How will we help them get to the creative communities that will nurture them for life? Can we as educators of students with gifts and talents innovate our way out of the recessionary environment in which we find ourselves? Will there be relief from the constant scrabbling for resources and perennial overwork? I have no easy answers tonight, but I do see some hopeful signs. In the President’s <italic>Blueprint for Reform</italic>—gifted education is actually mentioned. A national political figure from the Executive Branch of our government put the words “gifted and talented education programs” in print. Thus far, we see words, not action, but the recognition in the report is a start. We might be able to cobble together a national strategy from this springboard.</p>
<p>We have another recent policy crowbar. The report from the National Science Board (NSB) of the National Science Foundation (NSF), <italic>Preparing the Next Generation of STEM Innovators</italic>, lays out a research and policy agenda focused on engaging and educating talented STEM students. Innovation drives the technical fields, but it is a relevant concept in any domain—from the arts to anthropology.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0016986211431556">
<title>Innovation Achievements</title>
<p>As a field, gifted education has educational innovations to celebrate. In the 1970s, the last big wave of interest in gifted education, few people were talking about higher order thinking—we taught and learned in a basic skills environment. On we plugged with our critical and creative thinking efforts, and now these kinds of thinking skills and instructional programs are accepted as the norm in general education. The same general education adoption goes for individual projects. A more recent example is problem-based learning (PBL), which was initially developed in the medical field to prepare emergency room physicians, but was adopted early on in gifted education, too. Today, a search of the research literature on PBL provides citations largely from two fields—medical education and gifted education.</p>
<p>If the bread and butter “inventions” of gifted education—critical thinking, project work, PBL—have now become innovations through the general acceptance of others, what should the field turn to next? How can we stay at the leading edge? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0016986211431556">Sawyer (2008)</xref> analyzed trends and created scenarios about education in the Age of Innovation. I have selected three of those trends as most applicable to the field of gifted education. They are diverse knowledge sources, customization, and diffusion of education. Let’s unpack these three trends. One is a direct challenge to schools as we know them. As a field we must be up to that challenge with full attention to both invention and innovation.</p>
<sec id="section9-0016986211431556">
<title>Diverse knowledge sources</title>
<p>Of Sawyer’s trends, diverse knowledge sources will be the most familiar to gifted educators. We recognize it as a shift from sage on the stage to guide on the side. The catchy phrase gained notice in the 1970s, but now the principle has permeated general educational practice. While direct instruction will be ever with us as long as accountability tests drive education, we know that students are getting their information and expertise from sources other than teachers in the classroom. Educators are in a supporting role; as a field we’ve been comfortable with that for some time. We’ve been on the leading edge. Let’s stay there.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0016986211431556">
<title>Customization</title>
<p>Customization is more challenging to the school as we know it. Bricks and mortar schools and classrooms with four walls are crumbling. As adults, we learn a great deal in the digital world. Schools are increasingly virtual, too. Teachers and administrators will be a part of education and the schools, but more in the roles of tutors, mentors, or resource brokers. Socialization, one of the important roles of the school, will need to find a new waterway to navigate. We’ll need to innovate new interfaces to preserve the human touch—it may not be in classrooms from eight to three that such face-to-face interactions take place.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0016986211431556">
<title>Diffusion</title>
<p>Finally, educational boundaries will become increasingly permeable. Diffusion is the trend described by Sawyer that poses the most “threat” to schools as we know them. Boundaries between formal and informal schooling will disappear. Informal education now takes place in museums, libraries, art collections, science centers, and that trend is likely to continue and to increase. As educators, we know that some of the best professional development and learning opportunities are provided by such institutions. It is the same for our students, and we need to be at the leading edge of collaboration with these institutions. They don’t operate by bells, classrooms, and master schedules, so they don’t necessarily focus on the importance of differentiation of services—the difference between basic literacy in a discipline and the enriched and accelerated access necessary for a child talented in that discipline. We have a role to play. Once again, informal, diffuse learning opportunities will be increasingly virtual. Currently, multiple trends buffet the field of gifted education. In the volatile policy landscape and an environment given to hostility toward formal education, we have to stand firm against the negative economic and policy trends and get out in front of the trends we can lead like diverse knowledge sources, customization, and diffusion of knowledge.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0016986211431556">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In the final analysis, can innovation save gifted education? Can we make the move once again from the inventive educational practices we espoused in the 1970s—the thinking skills movement, the independent project development, and more recently, the PBL curricula—to the next instructional inventions? Diverse knowledge sources are made manifest. Customization is enabled by technology. Diffusion of education increases as boundaries between schools, universities, and informal educational providers blur. These three trends are good candidates for our attention. We can contribute to them. In many cases we already lead the way. Can we take our successful ideas and convince others that we have the knowledge, experience, evidence, and commitment to make our inventions worthy of acceptance and adoption? That’s innovation. The ability to stay ahead of the curve and to convince others that the educational practices we explore with our talented learners fill a gap, meet a need, provide a practical solution, and deserve notice is crucial. It is gifted education in the Age of Innovation.</p>
