      <abstract>
        <p>The US Congress and the US Food and Drug Administration encouraged studies in children so
          that the labeling information about pediatric use could be updated for pharmaceutical
          products. Pediatricians receive this updated labeling information through many different
          sources. A pilot survey was conducted to determine what source pediatricians use to learn
          about this updated information and whether and when they learned of specific changes. It
          appears that most pediatricians did not know that there had been recent changes in
          pediatric drug labels, although changes to drugs that were used more commonly in practice
          were more likely to be known.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The US Congress has worked with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the
        Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association and other organizations over the past
        nearly 2 decades to improve information on prescription drugs that is made available to
        practicing pediatricians. These efforts culminated in both “carrot and stick” stimuli to
        encourage the pharmaceutical industry to provide appropriate labeling information for children.<sup>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512459854">1</xref>
        </sup> The FDA Modernization Act of 1997, the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2007, and the
        Best Practices for Children Act of 2007 all gave FDA increased abilities to ensure
        pediatricians have the best information possible to treat their patients.<sup>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512459854">1</xref>
        </sup>
      </p>
      <p>The question now seems to be whether pediatricians are aware of this newly available
        information. A Delphi Survey conducted by the National Institutes of Health for the American
        Academy of Pediatrics in 2005 revealed that the favorite source of labeling information for
        the majority of the approximately 1000 pediatricians who participated in the survey were
        sources that were not readily updated.<sup>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512459854">2</xref>
        </sup> Some of these hardcopy sources may be up to a year out of date when used.</p>
      <p>To determine whether pediatricians in clinical practice today are more likely to utilize
        electronic labeling information, and thus more current information, we designed a pilot
        survey to ask Michigan pediatricians if they were aware of specific labeling changes made
        during the previous 2 years.</p>

      <title>Methodology</title>
      <p>Pediatric labeling changes from April 2010 to December 2011 were gathered from the FDA
        website. These 25 changes were reviewed by the authors and 2 other pediatricians to generate
        a list of the 10 drugs thought to the most relevant to practicing pediatricians (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092861512459854">Table 1</xref>).</p>

      <p>An electronic survey was created. The survey asked if the respondent was currently in
        clinical practice and for how long. For each of the medications, the survey asked (1) if the
        pediatricians knew of the specific labeling change, (2) whether they used the drug in
        clinical practice, and (3) when and from what source they learned of the labeling change (if
        they could recall).</p>
      <p>In February 2012 the survey was sent electronically to the email addresses of record of the
        approximately 1300 members of the Michigan Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. To
        preserve the anonymity of the study, no identifying information was collected from those who
        participated. The survey was closed after 2 weeks.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>Completed surveys were received from 52 respondents, giving a response rate of 4%, which is
        typical for this population (D.A.C.F., personal communication, 17 February, 2012).</p>
      <p>Of the 52 respondents, all were currently in clinical practice and 77% had been in practice
        for &gt; 10 years. Data were obtained for 516 (99.2%) of the 520 drugs (10 drugs per survey
        respondent) possible. Familiarity with the labeling change was further examined by
        cross-tabulating these results with the use of the product in the pediatrician’s clinical
        practice. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0092861512459854">Table 2</xref> presents these

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This survey was conducted to determine whether and how pediatricians were learning of
        changes to the labeling of prescription drug products used in pediatric clinical practice.
        While the results are not definitive, it is hoped these data will generate interest for
        conducting a larger study on this issue.</p>
      <p>The results give us some insight into whether knowledge of the labeling change correlates
        with clinical use, therapeutic class, or time since labeling change. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0092861512459854">Table 2</xref>, respondents who used the
        drug in clinical practice were approximately twice as likely to have known of the change as
        respondents who rarely or did not use the drug in practice (49% vs 23% and 30%,
        respectively). While the numbers are too small to be statistically tested, the trend fits
        the hypothesis that clinicians are more likely to be familiar with labeling changes for
        drugs with which they are most familiar. It is unsettling, however, that even for these more
        commonly used drugs, awareness that a recent labeling change occurred is likely no better
        than 50%. Time from label change to the time of the survey varied from 7 months to 21 months
          (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0092861512459854">Table 2</xref>), certainly
        sufficient time for this information to have been communicated.</p>

      <p>Two possible interpretations exist for the observation that many pediatricians were unaware
        of label changes for these medications. One explanation is that pediatricians are unaware of
        these changes and continue to prescribe using outdated information. While this is possible,
        it would appear from our results that this group is a minority one, as the majority of the
        respondents who identified a source of label information listed more updated sources for
        their information. A more likely explanation is that many pediatricians use continuously
        updated electronic resources and do not realize that the information they’re using is the
        result of an updated label indication. If, however, the information was indeed new to the
        majority of the respondents, then one must consider a better way to assure prescribers of
        recent labeling changes.</p>
      <p>The results offer no trend of any correlation between knowledge of change and time during
        the time period tested in this survey. When the data for the 10 drugs tested were collapsed
        by therapeutic area, the results did not vary appreciably by therapeutic area (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0092861512459854">Table 4</xref>). Perhaps a larger database
        might indicate that pediatricians might be more likely to keep up to date with the labeling
        for riskier products, although our limited data do not indicate such a trend.</p>
      <p>Finally, no clear trend was seen with how these pediatricians obtain their labeling
        information (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0092861512459854">Table 3</xref>). The
        source of information is diverse, and unfortunately some of these sources do not provide
        “real-time” labeling updates. Compared to 2005 American Academy of Pediatrics survey,<sup>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512459854">2</xref>
        </sup> our results offer a different profile of source of drug information. Few of our
        respondents mention Harriet Lane or Physicians’ Desk Reference, while these were the 2 most
        mentioned sources in the American Academy of Pediatrics survey, suggesting a shift away from
        print resources to electronic ones. Our respondents most mentioned direct mail or email from
        the manufacturer or FDA. This source is likely the timeliest source of update, and while
        this is encouraging, it still was mentioned only 27%, out of the total who recalled the
        source of their learning of the change. Any conclusion would be premature, however, as 44 of
        the 118 (37%) who knew of the labeling change “did not recall” the source of their knowledge
        of the labeling change. Further studies are necessary to more accurately determine the
        source of pediatricians’ knowledge of labeling changes.</p>
      <p>The results of this pilot study suggest opportunities for future studies. The authors
        understand the limitations of a small study, but our data indicate that larger studies might
        help understand whether the efforts that have gone into pediatric pharmaceutical research
        are being fully utilized by today’s practitioners. We suggest a survey that includes
        pediatricians, family practice physicians, and pediatric nurse practitioners. The sources of
        labeling information used by these groups as well as the time for each of these sources to
        publish the new information also need to be explored. Changes in labeling relating to
        safety, dosing, or efficacy should all be examined. We also suggest an educational campaign
        by the professional organizations of these 3 professional groups in which the benefits of
        “real-time” labeling information are emphasized. Ideally, a follow-up survey after these
        programs would determine if behavior had been influenced and more recent information
        utilized.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>A survey of members of the Michigan Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics revealed
        that fewer than half of the respondents who used specific drugs in their clinical practice
        knew that their labels had been changed in the previous 2 years. There were no trends
        related to time since label change or therapeutic class of the drug. Sources of labeling
        change information were diverse, with most respondents not recalling how they learned of
        changes.</p>
