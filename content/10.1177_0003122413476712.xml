<abstract>
<p>With the dramatic rise in the U.S. Hispanic population, scholars have struggled to explain how race affects welfare state development beyond the Black-White divide. This article uses a comparative analysis of welfare reforms in California and Arizona to examine how anti-Hispanic stereotypes affect social policy formation. Drawing on interviews, archival materials, and newspaper content analysis, I find that animus toward Hispanics is mobilized through two collective action frames: a legality frame and a racial frame. The legality frame lauds the contributions of documented noncitizens while demonizing illegal immigrants. The racial frame celebrates the moral worth of White citizens and uses explicit racial language to deride Hispanics as undeserving. These subtle differences in racialization and worth attribution create divergent political opportunities for welfare policy. When advocates employ the legality frame, they create openings for rights claims by documented noncitizens. Use of the racial frame, however, dampens cross-racial mobilization and effective claims-making for expansive welfare policies. These findings help to explain why the relationship between race and welfare policy is less predictable for Hispanics than for Blacks. They also reveal surprising ways in which race and immigration affect contemporary politics and political mobilization.</p>

<body>
<p>From its formative years, U.S. social policy has been inextricably linked with race. Foundational programs in the early-twentieth century employed occupational restrictions and harsh eligibility requirements to exclude Blacks from participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0003122413476712">Lieberman 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0003122413476712">Neubeck and Cazanave 2001</xref>). As the civil rights movement waned, White leaders launched an assault on anti-poverty programs in Black communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0003122413476712">Quadagno 1996</xref>). Two decades later, Reagan’s Cadillac-driving welfare queen became a mainstay of welfare attacks, and racialized media portrayals of welfare recipients heightened White ambivalence toward the program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0003122413476712">Gilens 1999</xref>). Combined with shifting social norms about women’s work participation and a global trend toward workfare, this race-coded anti-welfare rhetoric propelled Congress to eliminate the federal entitlement to cash relief in 1996 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0003122413476712">Reese 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Although we have convincing evidence about Black-White relations and welfare state development, we know far less about how the growing Hispanic population affects welfare policy. At 16 percent of the population, Hispanics are the largest and fastest growing ethno-racial group in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0003122413476712">Pew Hispanic Center 2011</xref>). Despite low uptake rates, they comprise an increasing share of federal welfare rolls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003122413476712">Cherlin et al. 2009</xref>). Nonetheless, the relationship between Hispanics and welfare policy remains unclear. Extant work asserts that negative stereotypes of Hispanics have fueled welfare retrenchment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122413476712">Chavez 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122413476712">Fox 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0003122413476712">Jacobson 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0003122413476712">Neubeck and Cazanave 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0003122413476712">Reese 2005</xref>). This argument mirrors the widespread public caricature of Hispanics as illegal immigrants who birth “anchor babies” to reap welfare benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0003122413476712">Jacobson 2006</xref>:645). However, studies of the policy effects of anti- Hispanic attitudes have yielded inconsistent results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0003122413476712">Fox 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0003122413476712">Harris 2002</xref>). The percentage of Blacks in a polity remains a much stronger predictor of welfare attitudes and policies than does the percentage of Hispanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122413476712">Fellowes and Rowe 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0003122413476712">Soss, Fording, and Schram 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This article asks how the growing Hispanic population affects welfare policy. I find that the relationship between Hispanics and welfare policy is complex because animus toward Hispanics can be mobilized through two different cultural discourses. Unlike stereotypes of Blacks, which are mobilized through a singular “welfare queen” narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0003122413476712">Hancock 2004</xref>), anti-Hispanic stereotypes are mobilized through at least two frames: a <italic>legality frame</italic> and a <italic>racial frame</italic>. The legality frame draws moral boundaries based on legal status, lauding the contributions of <italic>legal</italic> immigrants while chastising their <italic>illegal</italic> counterparts. The racial frame explicitly racializes moral worth, blaming <italic>Hispanics</italic> or <italic>Mexicans</italic> for the suffering of deserving <italic>White American citizens</italic>. Because these frames attribute worth to different groups, their use by policymakers and activists creates divergent political opportunities for welfare policy. When advocates employ the legality frame, they create openings for rights claims by documented noncitizens. In contrast, advocates’ use of the racial frame dampens cross-racial welfare advocacy and delegitimizes claims for expansive policies.</p>
<p>I demonstrate these effects through an analysis of the 1996 welfare reforms. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act was a landmark bill that eliminated federal entitlements to cash relief, enforced strict time limits and work requirements for welfare, and dramatically curtailed noncitizen benefits. I examine reform efforts in California and Arizona from 1990 to 1997. At the time, these states were home to nearly 40 percent of the country’s Hispanic population and to virulent anti-immigrant movements. Prevailing theories of welfare state development would predict that both states would have passed punitive reforms in the 1990s. Arizona did adopt stringent welfare rules, but California deviated from its history of harsh noncitizen welfare regulations and adopted an expansive program for poor noncitizens.</p>
<p>Drawing on archival materials, media analysis, and in-depth interviews with policymakers and activists, I attribute these policy differences to the frames employed in anti-immigrant discourse. Anti-immigrant groups in Arizona deployed a racial frame to justify attacks on immigrants, whereas activists in California used a legality frame. These frames had discursive, organizational, and electoral effects on welfare politics. That is, they altered the discursive opportunity structure in state politics, presented different opportunities for welfare coalition-building, and pressured political leaders to pass welfare reforms that matched the social construction of perceived beneficiaries. These welfare histories help explain why the relationship between Hispanics and welfare policy is less predictable than the relationship for Blacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122413476712">Fellowes and Rowe 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0003122413476712">Fox 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0003122413476712">Soss et al. 2011</xref>). Because California’s and Arizona’s politics have diverged so drastically since the 1990s, their experiences in this era may shed light on contemporary political polarization and serve as a portent for politics in new immigrant destinations.</p>

<title>Hispanic Stereotypes, Welfare Attitudes, and Welfare Reform</title>
<p>Over the past decades, race has become central to explanations for social policy formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0003122413476712">Katznelson 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0003122413476712">Neubeck and Cazanave 2001</xref>). Studies of the early welfare state emphasize the institutional avenues through which race altered social policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0003122413476712">Lieberman 1998</xref>), and much research on race and contemporary welfare policy focuses on racial attitudes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0003122413476712">Gilens’s (1999)</xref> landmark study found that White opposition to welfare reflects doubts about the work ethic of Blacks. Other scholars have not only replicated these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0003122413476712">Harris 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0003122413476712">Soss et al. 2011</xref>), but have found that anti-Black stereotypes have emboldened get-tough welfare campaigns since the 1950s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0003122413476712">Neubeck and Cazanave 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0003122413476712">Reese 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Welfare state research has historically focused on Black-White relations, but there is speculation that rapid growth in the U.S. Hispanic population is creating equally strong associations between Hispanics and welfare use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0003122413476712">Fox 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0003122413476712">Gilens 1999</xref>). Since the early-twentieth century, social workers and policymakers have expressed concerns that Mexicans are likely to become public charges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122413476712">Fox 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0003122413476712">Meeks 2007</xref>). Between 1970 and 2010, the U.S. Hispanic population increased five-fold, and anti-Hispanic sentiment increasingly saturated public discourse; stereotypes depicted Latinos as lazy, poor, and calculating illegal immigrants who bear citizen children to reap welfare benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122413476712">Chavez 2008</xref>). Citing the shifting racialization of welfare politics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003122413476712">Ansell (1997)</xref> asserted that the new welfare recipient in the U.S. imaginary is not a Black welfare queen but a Latino immigrant.</p>
<p>These racial tensions surfaced during the 1996 welfare reform debates when policymakers argued that a generous welfare state had a magnetic effect, drawing illegal Hispanic immigrants across the border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122413476712">Chavez 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0003122413476712">Reese 2005</xref>). In addition to restructuring the cash welfare system, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act excluded most noncitizens from receiving aid, retaining eligibility only for refugees, asylees, and long-standing permanent residents. Immigration scholars were unambiguous in their agreement that these stringent reforms were bolstered by stereotypes of Hispanics as illegal aliens and welfare freeloaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0003122413476712">De Genova and Ramos-Zayas 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0003122413476712">Massey and Sanchez 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0003122413476712">VanHook and Bean 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these assertions, empirical evidence about the policy effects of anti- Hispanic stereotypes is mixed. Some studies have found a significant relationship between anti-Hispanic attitudes and welfare policy preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0003122413476712">Harris 2002</xref>), but others have found no correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0003122413476712">Fox 2004</xref>). Similarly, racial demographics, a significant predictor of attitudes toward Blacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003122413476712">Bobo 1988</xref>), have less consistent effects for Latinos. The strength of the relationship between a polity’s percentage of Hispanics and the harshness of its welfare policies varies across policies (e.g., work and sanction policies) and across studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122413476712">Fellowes and Rowe 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0003122413476712">Howard 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0003122413476712">Soss et al. 2011</xref>). These mixed results contrast with the consistently large and powerful effect of anti-Black attitudes on welfare policy preferences and outcomes.</p>

<title>Racial and Legality Frames</title>
<p>These studies reveal a significant gap in our understanding of how race affects welfare policy beyond the Black-White divide. There is broad consensus that anti-Hispanic attitudes are widespread, politically potent, and grounded in racialized beliefs about welfare dependency. Yet, empirical analyses have not specified when or how such stereotypes affect policy outcomes. To bridge this gap, I consult the literatures on collective action framing and cultural categories of worth.</p>
<p>Research on racial attitudes tends to view welfare stereotypes as independent forces shaping policy debates. However, racial attitudes must be activated and mobilized to be politically consequential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0003122413476712">Mendelberg 2001</xref>). Policymakers and advocacy organizations<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0003122413476712">1</xref></sup> employ many tactics to prime voters to support specific policies, but one of the most consequential choices is the selection of collective action frames, the “interpretive schemata” that orient and justify mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0003122413476712">Snow and Benford 1992</xref>:137). If one singular frame activates racial attitudes about welfare, we might expect to see consistent effects on welfare policy outcomes. This is true for anti-Black stereotypes that policymakers activate through a narrative about poor work ethic and hypersexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0003122413476712">Hancock 2004</xref>). However, if policymakers have access to multiple frames to activate racial animus, framing choices might alter the stakes and opportunities for policy reforms. This is the case with anti-Hispanic attitudes, which I argue are mobilized through at least two frames: race and legality.</p>
<p>To comprehend the differences between these frames requires understanding discursive opportunity structure, the cultural milieu that structures political work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0003122413476712">Koopmans and Statham 1999</xref>). The policy effects of collective action frames depend on their alignment with prevailing cultural discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0003122413476712">Paschel 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0003122413476712">Skrentny 2006</xref>). Culturally aligned frames afford legitimacy to political actors, bolstering their chances of success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003122413476712">Benford and Snow 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0003122413476712">McCammon et al. 2007</xref>). Cultural categories of worth are a crucial aspect of the discursive opportunity structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0003122413476712">Steensland 2006</xref>). Cognitively, they divide the social world into groups, deserving and undeserving. Behaviorally, they present “scripts of action” for policymakers, generating support for policies that privilege worthy groups or punish the unworthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0003122413476712">Wimmer 2008</xref>:975; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0003122413476712">Schneider and Ingram 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Because the categories of work and nonwork guide U.S. welfare debates, interpretive frames that invoke the laziness of Blacks have encouraged punitive policy responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0003122413476712">Neubeck and Cazanave 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0003122413476712">Steensland 2006</xref>). However, immigration politics are inherently ambivalent and invoke contradictory emotions from constituents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0003122413476712">HoSang 2010</xref>). From one policy debate to the next, immigrants may be portrayed as hardworking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0003122413476712">Voss and Bloemraad 2011</xref>) or as scheming welfare seekers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122413476712">Chavez 2008</xref>). Because there are multiple axes of difference in immigration politics (national origin, legality, citizenship, race, and generation), the categories of worth in immigration debates are blurry and negotiable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0003122413476712">Newton 2008</xref>). Policymakers must select from these classification schemes to frame policy claims, deciding whom to deride or legitimate. I contend that this discursive flexibility is what destabilizes the coupling of race and welfare policy outcomes for Hispanics.</p>
<p>Here, I identify two collective action narratives through which negative Hispanic stereotypes are mobilized: a legality frame and a racial frame (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0003122413476712">Figure 1</xref>). Because they use categories of worth, these frames specify an <italic>us</italic> and a <italic>them</italic>. The racial frame racializes worthy and unworthy beneficiaries, deriding <italic>Hispanics</italic> but validating the contributions of implicitly White <italic>American citizens</italic>. The legality frame employs no explicit racial terminology. Rather, it relies solely on legal status categories as markers of worth, demonizing <italic>illegal immigrants</italic> but espousing the virtues of <italic>legal immigrants</italic>. Because the two frames attribute moral worth and legitimacy to very different groups, they create divergent openings for rights claims. Specifically, when anti-immigration advocates legitimize the contributions of legal immigrants through the legality frame, they encourage policymakers to adopt policies that favor these positively privileged groups and encourage the groups themselves to mobilize for change if their rights are threatened. In contrast, when immigration foes deride all Hispanics through the racial frame, it is more difficult for Hispanics to claim moral legitimacy, regardless of their legal status.</p>

</fig>
<p>Legality and race are not cleanly separated in U.S. political culture. Early immigration politics established racialized associations between illegal immigrants and Mexicans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0003122413476712">Jacobson 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0003122413476712">Ngai 2005</xref>). Undocumented Hispanic immigrants certainly experience illegality as a form of racial discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0003122413476712">Coutin 2003</xref>). The two frames presented here do not dispute the entangled nature of race and legality. As the overlapping area in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0003122413476712">Figure 1</xref> shows, undocumented immigrants may encounter censure in both frames. Although the term <italic>illegal immigrant</italic> might appear in both discourses, only in the racial frame is it accompanied by an explicit racial marker (e.g., <italic>Latino</italic> illegal immigrant). As I will show, whether anti-immigrant groups explicitly racialized immigrants and whether they afforded moral worth to legal immigrants or merely to U.S. citizens affected the racialization of welfare politics in the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>I demonstrate the consequences of these frames by analyzing anti-immigrant activism and welfare reform politics in California and Arizona in the 1990s. Arizona enacted harsh welfare reforms. Lawmakers adopted a stringent four-year lifetime time limit on receipt and the strictest possible sanctions for recipients who violated participation rules, suspending the entire family benefit after one infraction. The state refused to re-extend benefits to federally ineligible legal noncitizens. California adopted one of the most generous welfare programs in the country. It created a state-funded program to support children after their parents exceeded the federal time limit, employed only lenient sanctions (never eliminating the full-family benefit), and created a state-supported program for documented noncitizen welfare recipients.</p>
<p>These states adopted radically different polices despite their similar institutional, political, and social contexts in 1996. Anti-immigration activists’ framing choices set off divergent chain reactions in each state, contributing to the adoption of opposing welfare policies. When “meaning entrepreneurs” in California decided to frame attacks on immigration in terms of legality, their efforts institutionalized a moral boundary between legal and illegal immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0003122413476712">Skrentny 2006</xref>:11). Although anti-immigration activists initially employed this legality frame to demand restrictive immigration policies, anti-poverty advocates later adopted the same frame to push for expansive welfare benefits for legal immigrants. In Arizona, anti-immigration advocates adopted a racial frame, facilitating the later racialization of welfare debates and the adoption of harsh reforms. In both cases, frames diffused from immigration debates to welfare debates through the activation of specific social identities that shaped the structure of emergent political coalitions and the attractiveness of policy interventions. In the next section, I explain the logic of this paired-case comparison and review alternative explanations for California’s and Arizona’s divergent policy paths.</p>

<title>Studying and Theorizing The Welfare State</title>
<p>This study follows a long-standing methodological tradition in welfare state research: the use of a paired comparison (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003122413476712">Amenta 2003</xref>). Such comparisons allow researchers to build robust theoretical models while staying attuned to historical processes and controlling for known causal forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0003122413476712">Mahoney and Rueschemeyer 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0003122413476712">Ragin 1997</xref>). Welfare reform is particularly well-suited for this type of analysis. Because the 1996 federal act forced all 50 states to restructure their welfare policies simultaneously, it created a somewhat controlled environment for policy analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0003122413476712">Soss et al. 2001</xref>). A systematic comparison of reforms in California and Arizona offers critical leverage in identifying the relationship between race relations and policy formation. As I will show, although the states differed on many levels in the early 1990s, they shared many socioeconomic, political, and institutional characteristics known to influence social policy development (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003122413476712">Table 1</xref>). Controlling for these characteristics allows me to isolate and theorize the effect of race relations on social policy formation.</p>

<title>Socioeconomic Theories</title>
<p>Early socioeconomic theories of the welfare state posited that welfare policies expand to ease the strains accompanying the rise of an industrial wage-based economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0003122413476712">Wilensky 1975</xref>). Modernization accounts have largely fallen out of favor with scholars, particularly given their inadequacies in predicting late-twentieth-century policy development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0003122413476712">Quadagno 1987</xref>). However, socioeconomic factors like unemployment and state financial health continue to affect policy outcomes. High unemployment rates may prompt benefits expansion, and low unemployment can spur cutbacks to meet the needs of capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0003122413476712">Piven and Cloward 1971</xref>). Similarly, states facing fiscal crises may reduce benefits or tighten participation rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0003122413476712">O’Connor 2001</xref>). Although modernization theories asserted that family dissolution might prompt welfare state expansion, high rates of unwed motherhood now correlate with strict welfare regulations because citizens generally oppose benefits for those who engage in what they consider immoral behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0003122413476712">Misra, Moller, and Karides 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>It is surprising, then, that socioeconomic trends were similarly patterned in Arizona and California at this time. The late-1980s recession upended the economy in both states, almost doubling unemployment rates by 1992. The recession also created perilous budget shortfalls in both states, prompting heated debates in Phoenix and Sacramento about viable remedies. Arizona adopted welfare cutbacks as a response to these shortfalls, but California did not. Moreover, Arizona pursued stringent welfare policies despite its faster recovery from the recession. If policymakers considered welfare retrenchment a mechanism for reducing out-of-wedlock childbirth, they would have had more cause to pursue cutbacks in California, where nonmarital childbirth rates were 7 percent higher than in Arizona. California pursued lenient reforms despite its higher caseload rate, a trend typically associated with fiscal strain and stringent reforms. As I will show, whether socioeconomic measures proved consequential for welfare politics depended not on objective statistics but on the narratives that advocates constructed to explain them.</p>

<sec id="section5-0003122413476712">
<title>Political Theories</title>
<p>Political theories offer additional explanations for social policy outcomes, suggesting that variation in public opinion and partisanship determine reform timing and content. Public support for reforms must be high to prompt adoption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003122413476712">Brooks and Manza 2006</xref>). Because governors played an unusually instrumental role in the 1996 welfare reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0003122413476712">Teles 1996</xref>), having a Republican governor significantly increased the likelihood that a state would adopt stringent reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0003122413476712">Zylan and Soule 2000</xref>). States with more Republican voters were also more likely to adopt stringent welfare reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0003122413476712">Soss et al. 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>California and Arizona, however, exhibited few differences in the 1990s in terms of welfare opinion or partisan politics. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003122413476712">American National Election Survey (1996)</xref>, nearly three-quarters of residents in each state supported two-year lifetime time limits for welfare, showing widespread support for stringent reforms. Both states were home to strong conservative political coalitions in the 1990s and had incumbent Republican governors with national electoral ambitions. Although Arizona’s citizenry was slightly more conservative than California’s, both states voted for the Democratic presidential candidate, Bill Clinton, in 1996. More important, in neither state did welfare reform votes fall along party lines. In Arizona, Democrats overwhelmingly joined Republicans in support of a meager welfare program. In California, all but one Republican assemblyman supported the state’s generous plan. These patterns indicate, and I will show, that mobilization of different welfare discourses and coalitions pressured policymakers to support specific policies, regardless of party affiliation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0003122413476712">
<title>Institutional Theories</title>
<p>Institutional theories seek to reintegrate the state into prevailing theoretical models of welfare state development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003122413476712">Cauthen and Amenta 1996</xref>). Viewing the state as an autonomous force in policymaking, these theories stress the importance of political learning, interest groups, and state institutions in the policy process. Policymakers may consult previous policies when developing alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003122413476712">Cauthen and Amenta 1996</xref>). As a result, early establishment of a meager welfare state creates an institutional environment unfriendly to expansion, whereas early adopters of generous policies are unlikely to later restrict benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0003122413476712">Pierson 2000</xref>). Existing social programs also create new interest groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0003122413476712">Pierson 2000</xref>). Such groups can be instrumental in welfare state expansion, but their ability to be efficacious requires an open political system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122413476712">Fox 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0003122413476712">Key 1984</xref>). Political exclusion, particularly of minorities, can hamper efforts to expand the welfare state.</p>
<p>Institutional arrangements are powerful predictors of policy outcomes, but they are insufficient explanations for the divergent policy outcomes in California and Arizona. Both states adopted moderate welfare policies in the 1930s and pursued expansive reforms in the 1940s. Since 1950, both states have enacted progressively harsher work requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0003122413476712">Soule and Zylan 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0003122413476712">Zylan and Soule 2000</xref>). In monetary terms, Arizona offered more meager benefits than California and opposed Medicaid into the 1980s, but the states’ rules of welfare participation, a more robust measure of welfare ideology and institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0003122413476712">Hero 1998</xref>), were nearly identical. Administration of different social services programs is often split between government branches, but California and Arizona both have centralized and autonomous welfare departments, led by stalwart proponents of restrictive reforms. The percentage of eligible voters who voted in the 1996 elections, a common measure of electoral access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003122413476712">Cauthen and Amenta 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122413476712">Fox 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0003122413476712">Soule and Zylan 1997</xref>), was 45 percent in both states.</p>
<p>Interest group strength was also similar across the two states. Political theories posit that Hispanic political participation might compel more generous policy responses. Hispanics constituted approximately 10 percent of active voters in each state. Despite the Chicano movement of the 1960s, Hispanic political participation rates stagnated in both states in the 1980s and early 1990s, and organizations like the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project labored to increase Hispanic political participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0003122413476712">Foley 2001</xref>). Furthermore, when policymakers began debating welfare for noncitizens, more of Arizona’s foreign born were naturalized citizens (39 percent) than in California (30 percent). These rates not only show more electoral access in Arizona (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122413476712">Fox 2010</xref>), they suggest, and I will argue, that interest groups affect welfare policy formation not by virtue of their size but through their skillful use of discursive and organizational resources.</p>

<title>Race-Centered Theories</title>
<p>Race-centered theories are increasingly joining socioeconomic, political, and institutional theories as central accounts of welfare state development. However, the most prominent theories of race and welfare policy (threat, resentment, and fractionalization) provide insufficient explanations for states’ policy divergences in the 1990s.</p>
<p><italic>Racial threat</italic> arguments assert that as minority populations grow, Whites feel psychologically, economically, or politically threatened and promote restrictive policies that target minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0003122413476712">Key 1984</xref>). There is much historical evidence of racial threat in California and Arizona. During early statehood, Mexicans in each state encountered Jim Crow-style segregation and faced ongoing threats of deportation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0003122413476712">Ngai 2005</xref>). California had a more generous welfare state than Arizona, but California’s social policies toward Mexicans have long surpassed Arizona’s as the country’s most stringent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0003122413476712">Reese 2005</xref>). This shared history of racially driven policy cannot explain the states’ divergent reforms in the 1990s. Arizona’s large Hispanic population may have prompted a punitive response, as threat theory would predict, but threat cannot explain why California expanded welfare benefits <italic>despite</italic> its large Hispanic population.</p>
<p>Distinct from threat, <italic>racial resentment</italic> theory posits that welfare restrictions arise with negative stereotyping and resentment about a minority group’s perceived use of public resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0003122413476712">Mendelberg 2001</xref>). When racial stereotypes are policy-relevant (e.g., stereotypes about work ethic), they may guide debates about policy alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0003122413476712">Soss et al. 2011</xref>). Racial resentment was certainly high in Arizona and California in the 1990s. Arizonans did not acquiesce to an official holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr. until 1991; Californians voted down every civil rights initiative placed on the ballot between 1945 and 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0003122413476712">HoSang 2010</xref>). Polls reveal few differences in Hispanic stereotypes or support for welfare restrictions in these states. These histories suggest a common trajectory of racial resentment, meaning that racial resentment cannot explain the fact that welfare policy was more stringent in Arizona. If anything, resentment was higher in California, where the citizenry was also more skeptical of Black work ethic than in Arizona.</p>
<p>Finally, <italic>fractionalization</italic> theories contend that ethno-racial diversity decreases welfare generosity. Whether or not Whites feel threatened or resentful, diversity decreases the demand for redistribution by limiting solidarity and trust, the bases for a strong welfare state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003122413476712">Alesina and Glaeser 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0003122413476712">Putnam 2007</xref>). However, fractionalization cannot explain the fact that Arizona adopted harsher reforms than California, because California was more fractionalized in the 1990s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0003122413476712">2</xref></sup> In this article, I suggest that fractionalization and framing interact to produce unanticipated outcomes. The legality frame may provide a discursive opening for an effective multiracial alliance in more fractionalized polities, opening the door for adoption of expansive welfare policies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0003122413476712">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Data and Methods</title>
<p>I will show that the framing of anti-immigration conflicts in California and Arizona affected pro-welfare activists’ ability to mount successful campaigns for lenient reforms, mediating the effect of racial politics on welfare policy outcomes. To make this argument, I triangulated data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0003122413476712">King, Keohane, and Verba 1994</xref>) from media content analysis, archival materials, and in-depth interviews from both states. First, I assessed the stereotypes and categories of worth employed in public discourse about welfare. Because mass media is a critical site for the contestation and consolidation of meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0003122413476712">Ferree et al. 2002</xref>), I conducted a content analysis of 500 randomly sampled news stories about welfare reform from 1993 to 1997 from the largest newspaper in each state: the <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic> and the <italic>Arizona Republic</italic>. To create the sample, a research assistant and I searched for articles containing the term <italic>welfare</italic> in each state in each year. We then read each story and retained only those stories that (1) used welfare to refer to means-tested assistance for low-income individuals and (2) referred to the state in question. Then, we sampled from the eligible stories so as to retain for analysis 50 stories per state per year. We did this by taking every <italic>N</italic>th story, where <italic>N</italic> equaled the number of eligible stories that year divided by 50.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0003122413476712">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because welfare stereotypes are hypothesized to affect policy outcomes, we used Atlas.ti to code these stories for the prevalence and content of welfare stereotypes across the states, using paragraphs as the quotation (the term for unit of analysis in Atlas.ti). I employed a modified version of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0003122413476712">Hancock’s (2004)</xref> coding scheme for the public identity of the welfare queen, adding an <italic>immigrant drain</italic> stereotype to the model. Derived from existing research, this code captures the claim that immigrants place an undue burden on the welfare system. Results revealed nearly identical rates of stereotyping across the two states and similar stereotype content. In both states, approximately 11 percent of news quotations contained a welfare stereotype, and the most frequent stereotypes were that welfare recipients lacked work ethic, had pathological family structures, and drained collective resources. Because popular welfare stereotypes offered little explanatory power for these state policy differences, I coded for racial and citizenship boundaries used in media discourse. I created five codes that measure racial and citizenship boundaries: <italic>illegal, legal, Hispanic, White</italic>, and <italic>citizen/American</italic>. Explicit references to Whiteness are rare, so I also coded for use of <italic>citizen</italic> and <italic>American</italic>, which historical and experimental studies have established as implicit referents to Whiteness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413476712">Calavita 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0003122413476712">Devos and Mahzarin 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0003122413476712">HoSang 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0003122413476712">Theiss-Morse 2009</xref>). The intercoder reliability rating for all codes averaged 91 percent.</p>
<p>I used these codes as an initial assessment of the stereotypes and categories of worth employed in each state. However, although newspapers offer a useful measure of public discourse, they provide only a weak measure of policy discourse. I turned to archival sources for a more robust account of the political use of these categories in immigration and welfare debates. To detect any patterned use of racial and legal categories of worth in policy debates, I collected and analyzed more than 600 pages of archival materials from each state. I obtained materials from the California and Arizona State Archives, the California Regional Oral History Office, the Arizona State University Library Special Collections, and the Arizona State Senate and House of Representatives. I examined files from welfare reform committees and any collections indexed with the words welfare reform. My analysis gave most weight to transcripts of legislative testimonies, committee meeting minutes, speeches, and press releases, because these are the archival materials most likely to be representative, credible, and accurate accounts of policymaking in action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0003122413476712">Mariampolski and Hughes 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0003122413476712">Scott 1990</xref>). Documents of questionable origin or authenticity were checked for validity against other historical, newspaper, or interview sources (see below) and disregarded in the absence of external validation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0003122413476712">Mariampolski and Hughes 1978</xref>). When reviewing these sources, statements that celebrated <italic>legal</italic> immigrants while denigrating <italic>illegal</italic> immigrants were coded for the legality frame. Statements criticizing <italic>Hispanics</italic> but lauding <italic>Whites</italic> or <italic>American/citizens</italic> were coded for the racial frame. Comparing news media and archival documents allowed me to distinguish between policymakers’ public and private views and to map the diffusion of frames across policy spheres.</p>
<p>To fill gaps in the legislative and advocacy histories I constructed from media and archival data, I conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 legislators, staffers, and advocates who played key roles in welfare reform. In each state, I interviewed the legislators responsible for crafting and sponsoring welfare reform proposals. During these interviews, I requested the names of other legislative and gubernatorial staffers to interview. I also interviewed leaders of the most prominent advocacy organizations during this time in each state (as determined by their role in crafting legislation and participating in committee meetings).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0003122413476712">5</xref></sup> I stopped recruiting interviewees when my requests for new names and my own archival work generated no new central figures in the reform process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0003122413476712">6</xref></sup> I followed a semi-structured interview questionnaire that contained questions about the minutiae of the reform process, key players and alliances, and significant debates. For each individual interviewee, I also developed specific questions tailored to the person’s ability to provide information about legislative processes, bill histories, or committee appointments not adequately addressed by other data. Thus, rather than using the interviews to assess legislators’ interpretations of the policymaking process, I triangulated interview, archival, and media data to assess the resonance, salience, and political consequences of the legality and racial frames in each state. This process involved continuously revisiting the three data sources to clarify the specific features and overlapping elements of each frame and, when necessary, recoding the data to account for increasing specification of frames.</p>
<p>I deploy this evidence to demonstrate that the framing of anti-immigration conflicts differed in the two states and to reveal how these frames affected welfare policy debates. I outline three ways frames shaped welfare policy: discursive, organizational, and electoral effects. Immigration advocates’ framing choices shifted the wider discursive opportunity structure available to activists in nontargeted political arenas, affected the formation of political coalitions, and changed the political stakes of welfare reform.</p>

<title>The Legality Frame in California</title>
<p>By the 1990s, California was home to 40 percent of undocumented immigrants in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0003122413476712">Geen et al. 1998</xref>). Anticipating the 1994 elections, a coalition of California nativists, the Save Our State (SOS) campaign, rallied the state’s citizens against illegal immigrants. The lynchpin of their crusade was a state ballot initiative, Proposition 187. Proposition 187 declared unauthorized immigrants ineligible for public benefits and services and required all public employees to report anyone they suspected might be undocumented. Dubbing California the “Illegal Immigrant State,” SOS preyed on fears of an emerging Latino majority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0003122413476712">Fujiwara 2008</xref>:10). Politicians like Republican Governor Pete Wilson supported 187 to demonstrate their tough stance on immigration, depicting undocumented immigrants as a threat to the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122413476712">Chavez 2008</xref>). The proposition passed with nearly two-thirds of the vote, ensuring Wilson’s re-election despite sagging early poll numbers. When they voted, 90 percent of Californians knew Wilson’s stance on 187, more than knew that Sacramento was the state capitol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0003122413476712">HoSang 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Declared “the most important direct democracy proposal for the last 25 years,” Proposition 187 reshaped the landscape of U.S. immigration politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0003122413476712">Wroe 2008</xref>:3; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0003122413476712">Jacobson 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0003122413476712">Santa Ana 2002</xref>). Although overturned in the courts, 187 emboldened anti-immigration campaigns in other states and fueled dramatic shifts in federal immigration enforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0003122413476712">Wroe 2008</xref>). As I will show, Proposition 187 also institutionalized two categories of worth in public discourse: legal and illegal.</p>
<sec id="section10-0003122413476712">
<title>Suffering Californians: Proposition 187 and the Legality Frame</title>
<p>As they sought to curtail rights for undocumented immigrants, the SOS campaign and a handful of powerful politicians adopted a legality frame, arguing that social citizenship rights should depend on legal status. Although the 187 campaign had significant racial undertones, pro-187 activists portrayed the quest for state resources as a zero-sum game wherein illegal immigrants stole resources from deserving legal immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0003122413476712">Mehan 1997</xref>). Drawing a moral boundary between illegal aliens and documented immigrants, this legality frame was a new discursive tool. In the past, anti-immigration campaigns in California had employed a racial frame, demonizing minority groups regardless of immigration status while championing the cause of White citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0003122413476712">Ngai 2005</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0003122413476712">7</xref></sup> The campaign for Proposition 187 marked the first time the term “illegal” was used as a noun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0003122413476712">Santa Ana 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>This legal–illegal boundary was strategically promoted by Democratic officials, led by California Senator Diane Feinstein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0003122413476712">HoSang 2010</xref>). During the launch of anti-illegal immigration campaigns in the early 1990s, Feinstein attributed California’s fiscal and social problems to lax federal border enforcement and undocumented immigrants. Recognizing that the prevailing racial frame generated negative consequences for all Hispanics, regardless of legal status, Feinstein sought to popularize a new discourse that contrasted illegal immigrants with their hardworking legal counterparts. By adopting this legality frame, she hoped “to avoid a serious backlash against all immigrants” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003122413476712">Bunting and Miller 1993</xref>). Her tactics proved successful. My media content analysis shows that just 15 percent of California immigration news quotations explicitly racialized immigrants as Hispanic, compared to nearly 40 percent of Arizona news quotations. Moreover, California immigration quotations were nearly three times as likely (20.3 to 7.3 percent) to juxtapose negative depictions of illegal immigrants with virtuous portrayals of legal ones.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0003122413476712">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>These categories of worth were even more palpable in Pete Wilson’s campaign ads and writings than in news reporting on immigration. In virtually all of his speeches and ads about 187, Wilson juxtaposed the foreign, alien threat of illegal immigrants against documented immigrants:<disp-quote>
<p>If we ignore the flood of illegal immigration, we’ll erode the quality of life for those who live here legally. . . . It is hard working legal immigrants who suffer the most from our failure to deal with illegal immigration. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0003122413476712">Wilson 1994</xref>:14)</p>
</disp-quote>

<p>Similarly, in a television ad, Wilson stated that immigration is “how most of us got here. It’s how this country was built. But now the rules are being broken” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0003122413476712">Wroe 2008</xref>:66). Contrasting imagery of legal immigrants receiving citizenship with footage of illegal immigrants jumping border fences, the ad reaffirmed the unworthiness of unauthorized immigrants and the worthiness of legal immigrants while blurring the distinction between citizen and documented immigrants.</p>

<title>Categories, Alliances, and Electoral Consequences in California’s Welfare Reforms</title>
<p>Previous studies have argued that Proposition 187 affected welfare reform by catalyzing Latino naturalization and voter participation; the resulting class of elected Latino leaders shepherded lenient welfare reforms through the legislature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0003122413476712">Reese and Ramirez 2002</xref>). Although 187 certainly increased Latino mobilization, Latino leadership explanations cannot explain why all but one Republican assembly member switched sides during reform debates to support lenient reforms, despite initial and overwhelming opposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0003122413476712">McClintock 1997b</xref>). This shift was facilitated by the categories of worth employed in the legality frame. When policymakers sought to restrict legal immigrants’ access to welfare benefits, advocates adopted 187-style rhetoric to push for lenient reforms and a multiracial coalition of legal immigrants and citizens rallied to secure passage. I will describe three consequences of this legality frame: discursive, organizational, and electoral effects.</p>
<p>Advocates for lenient welfare reforms capitalized on the new discursive opportunity structure presented by the legality frame to counter Pete Wilson’s appeals for punitive reforms. Wilson’s initial response to the federal act was to demand prompt and extensive work participation from welfare beneficiaries and to reject benefit extensions for most legal noncitizens. In return, policymakers and activists capitalized on the discursive opening created by the valorization of legal immigrants during the 187 debate. Although welfare recipients had been negatively construed in the state in the past, a coalition of advocates for lenient reforms adopted the legality frame to argue that reforms should reward families who were “playing by the rules” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003122413476712">Children’s Advocates N.d.</xref>:2).</p>
<p>Mimicking the discourse of 187 proponents, these advocates proclaimed legal immigrants to be legitimate and deserving beneficiaries. In support of a lenient package proposed by a Joint Committee on Welfare Reform, Cruz Bustamante, a newly elected Latino legislative leader, argued,<disp-quote>
<p>There are still legal immigrants in need of a safety net who are in danger of falling through the cracks. It is basic decency . . . to make sure that people who came to this country legally and worked hard . . . don’t have to live in terror of being thrown into destitution. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003122413476712">Bustamante 1997</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>State Senator Diane Watson reaffirmed these sentiments when she criticized Republican lawmakers for their attacks on legal immigrants:<disp-quote>
<p>The Governor and my Republican colleagues would have us end welfare with virtually no safety net. They would risk putting elderly immigrants on the streets, take food out of the mouths of immigrant children, and limit struggling families to no more than two years on public assistance. . . . Our plan is . . . a humane safety net for vulnerable children, seniors, and legal immigrants. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0003122413476712">Watson 1997</xref>:2)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Although they had previously supported a more restrictive bill, the California State Association of Counties (CSAC) switched positions to support the Joint Committee’s expansive plan. CSAC leaders argued that “denying federal benefits to <italic>legal</italic> immigrants disproportionately harms California communities” (emphasis in original) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0003122413476712">Lockyer 1996</xref>). Just as Proposition 187 advocates had emphasized the <italic>illegal</italic> in the term illegal alien, advocates for more lenient welfare reforms stressed the <italic>legal</italic> and law-abiding character of documented immigrants, asserting their entitlement to a social safety net. A frame originally adopted to support immigration restriction became a justification for welfare expansion.</p>
<p>To press for restrictive reforms, many anti-welfare advocates advanced an opposing characterization of legal immigrants, portraying them as defrauders who relied on welfare despite their families’ initial promises to sponsor them when they immigrated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0003122413476712">9</xref></sup> Testifying before the legislature, Assemblyman Roy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003122413476712">Ashburn (1997)</xref> derided “legal immigrants, who come to this country under sponsorship, and then expect to be provided with welfare benefits.” Welfare opponents commissioned data from state agencies to document the burden immigrants placed on state finances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0003122413476712">Wroe 2008</xref>). When resulting reports measured total immigration expenditures, a coalition of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003122413476712">Children’s Advocates (N.d.)</xref> quickly demanded that state analysts recognize the differential worth of legal and illegal immigrants by disaggregating measures of spending by legal and illegal immigrants. In a television ad, legislative leaders lashed out at Wilson, arguing that their lenient reform plan “[recognizes] that ‘legal is legal’ [and] rejects the . . . attempt to equate legal and illegal immigrants” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003122413476712">Bustamante and Villaraigosa 1997</xref>:3). In making this statement, they challenged Wilson’s blurring of the legal–illegal distinction and reaffirmed the moral boundary erected during Proposition 187 debates. This discursive maneuvering was critical to the success of the lenient bill. As Assemblywoman Dion Aroner said in an interview, “Our language [won us the battle] not just . . . our positions.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0003122413476712">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The legality frame also had organizational effects, signifying the logic of cross-racial alliances. Because Proposition 187 valorized legal noncitizens, regardless of race, the legal category created an opening for broad-based multiracial welfare mobilization. Citizen and noncitizen welfare rights groups collaborated to create a network of expansive and well-funded welfare coalitions like the Los Angeles Welfare Reform Network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0003122413476712">Reese and Ramirez 2002</xref>). This collaborative organizing spread to the state capitol. The legislature’s Black and Latino caucuses were not historically aligned, but they issued joint publicity materials and collaborated at rallies to press for generous reforms. In a joint statement, caucus leaders asserted that “[legal immigrants are] vulnerable persons and . . . will be cut off first as a result of the federal bill” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0003122413476712">California State Senate N.d.</xref>). This statement and the organizational cooperation behind it reflected the perception that legal noncitizens were deserving beneficiaries. When legislators were deadlocked around work requirements and a safety net program, thousands rallied in Los Angeles to push for re- extension of noncitizen benefits. Twice in the first half of 1997, immigrant activists held Immigrant Lobby Day, flooding legislative offices to advocate for lenient reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0003122413476712">Fujiwara 2008</xref>). Organizations such as the Western Center for Law and Poverty, the Asian Pacific Policy Planning Council, and a number of Hispanic organizations spearheaded the effort. Despite their extensive histories in state politics, welfare reform marked a rare occasion on which they joined forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0003122413476712">Reese and Ramirez 2002</xref>). The legality frame exposed common interests for these groups, facilitating collective mobilization.</p>
<p>The legality frame also had electoral consequences. Latino political leaders crafted television ads that criticized Wilson’s anti-immigrant positions and pushed for expansive welfare reforms: “If people are here legally, have played by all the rules . . . they are entitled to the same benefits the rest of us are entitled to” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003122413476712">Bustamante and Villaraigosa 1997</xref>:3). These ads frightened many 187 supporters. According to a Wilson aide,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0003122413476712">11</xref></sup> many Republicans began to support more expansive welfare reforms because they feared being seen as anti-immigrant if they refused to re-extend benefits to legal noncitizens. This was a particular concern because Proposition 187 sparked a significant increase in Latino voter turnout and naturalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0003122413476712">Reese and Ramirez 2002</xref>). Newly aware of the Latino vote, politicians recognized that punitive welfare reforms might jeopardize their political futures. According to a powerful gubernatorial staffer,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0003122413476712">12</xref></sup> this narrative about the worth of legal immigrants resonated with Republican leaders who “felt really strongly that there was a big distinction” between legal and illegal immigrants and who wanted to reward legal residents who were “doing everything to become a citizen and who followed the rules.” The legality frame, initially adopted during Proposition 187 debates, had become a part of politicians’ views about entitlement and worth.</p>
<p>By focusing the debate on <italic>legal</italic> immigrants, welfare advocates made it difficult for politicians to demonize welfare-receiving documented immigrants already labeled as hardworking, law-abiding, and deserving of public services. Politicians who failed to reward what was widely perceived as good behavior from legal immigrants risked losing the support of a newly mobilized immigrant political force as well as other voters who ascribed to the Proposition 187 distinction between worthy and unworthy residents. California’s new welfare program, CalWORKs, became law in August 1997. With a safety net to assist timed-out and noncitizen recipients, it was one of the most expansive and lenient Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) programs in the country. Although the bill passed without significant substantive changes from its first draft, anti-welfare legislators went from vocal opponents to proud supporters, claiming the bill as a chief accomplishment of the session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0003122413476712">McClintock 1997a</xref>). In the end, only one Republican assemblyman voted against the bill. The legality frame, initially used to justify exclusion of undocumented immigrants, created a discursive opportunity for welfare advocates, setting the stage for a diverse group of organizations to rally for lenient reforms, and creating political pressure to aid worthy groups.</p>

<sec id="section12-0003122413476712">
<title>Arizona’s Racial Frame</title>
<p>Arizona’s welfare reform efforts pose a stark contrast to California’s. Historically, immigration foes in both states employed a racial frame to justify attacks on immigrants, characterizing Hispanics as undeserving, regardless of their legal status, and identifying White citizens as their worthy counterparts. However, while California Democrats like Senator Feinstein worked strategically to validate the contributions of legal citizens, these efforts had no counterpart in Arizona. My archival and interview data suggest that rather than engage in deliberative framing efforts, Arizona activists adopted the long-standing racial frame with little reflection or debate, explicitly racializing undeserving state residents using terms like Hispanic and Mexican. The prevalence of this racializing narrative in Arizona likely reflects the fact that the state’s anti-immigrant campaign was less bipartisan, less centralized, and less experienced with strategic meaning work than California’s. Activists’ adoption of a racialized immigration discourse eased the passage of punitive welfare reforms and hampered coalitions between Hispanic and non-Hispanic advocates.</p>
<p>As in California, in the 1990s Arizona’s anti-immigrant movement intensified and Arizonans contemplated passing a 187-style policy. Large signs at the state line warned Arizonans, “Welcome to California, the Illegal Immigrant State. Don’t let this happen to your state” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0003122413476712">Fujiwara 2008</xref>:10). Local newspapers cautioned that “Arizona may be next,” forecasting growth in the state’s immigrant population and an eventual full-scale anti-immigrant crusade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0003122413476712">Shaffer 1994</xref>). One of the authors of California’s 187 traveled regularly to Arizona to spark a copycat initiative. The SOS Arizona campaign eventually took off, organizing residents around the state and collecting signatures for a proposition. By 1995, 86 percent of Arizonans were familiar with 187, and 80 percent identified immigration as a major concern facing the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0003122413476712">Solop 1995</xref>). Arizona residents began calling for a similar proposition.</p>
<p>Unlike in California, Arizona activists demonized Hispanic residents of all legal statuses while lauding the contributions of White citizens. In doing so, they interchangeably used racialized terms like <italic>Latino, Hispanic</italic>, and <italic>Mexican</italic>. These patterns were particularly apparent in the coordinated letter writing campaigns conducted by local anti-immigrant groups. Demonstrating the racialization of state immigration discourse as well as the centrality of welfare politics to anti-immigrant claims, one immigration foe proclaimed in a public forum on intolerance: “Who are you Latino Mexicans? . . . Watch what us of . . . European [descent] do. We raise our children and don’t put them on welfare” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0003122413476712">Lobaco 1990</xref>). Using even sharper racial distinctions, an opinion piece in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003122413476712"><italic>Arizona Republic</italic> (1992)</xref> declared, “If you are not Hispanic or black, getting help (from social services) even when you need it desperately, is almost impossible. The whole system is so unfair to Anglos.” Characteristic of the racial frame, these arguments invoked a racialized moral boundary between deserving Whites and undeserving Hispanics.</p>
<p>These quotes demonstrate the explicit racial boundaries drawn during Arizona’s anti-immigration conflict. This racial frame always explicitly denigrated Hispanics, but it also sometimes invoked veiled references to Whiteness, attributing worth to implicitly White <italic>Americans</italic> or <italic>citizens</italic>. By juxtaposing <italic>Hispanics</italic> or <italic>Mexicans</italic> against <italic>Americans</italic> or <italic>citizens</italic>, this moral boundary excluded <italic>all</italic> Hispanics, even U.S.-citizen Hispanics, from the deserving categories of American and citizen. One anti-immigration and Republican Party activist argued:<disp-quote>
<p>We have a hemorrhage of people across our southern border . . . costing taxpayers dearly in money spent on . . . law enforcement, welfare. . . . U.S. citizens have to wait in line behind people who’ve never paid a dime in taxes . . . we should give Mexicans less incentive to migrate . . . we owe it to ourselves and our children to protect our land, our resources and our hard-earned tax dollars. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0003122413476712">Holland 1993</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>By proclaiming that Mexicans had no right to “<italic>our</italic> resources,” anti-immigration activists excluded Mexicans, even naturalized U.S. citizens, from the community of U.S. citizens. Using race-coded terms like citizen and taxpayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0003122413476712">Devos and Mahzarin 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0003122413476712">Theiss-Morse 2009</xref>), they also implicitly identified Whites as the deserving yet suffering victims of Mexican welfare use.</p>
<p>The patterned use of the racial frame in Arizona politics even pervaded discussions of illegal immigration. My content analysis reveals that over 85 percent of Arizona news quotations about illegal immigration explicitly identified illegal immigrants as Hispanic or Mexican, compared to just 17 percent of California quotations (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0003122413476712">Table 2</xref>). Typical of this trend, Thomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0003122413476712">Taylor (1994)</xref>, an anti-immigrant activist, wrote to the <italic>Arizona Republic</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>Winners? The illegals who get jobs that pay five times what they can earn in their country, plus food stamps, medical care and an education. . . . The Mexican government that benefits from . . . funds [they send] back to Mexico. . . . Losers? The hard-working, overtaxed American citizen paying for the above mess through higher taxes for welfare, medical care and education.</p>

<p>As with the legality arguments made in California, legal status boundaries are a critical component of Taylor’s statement. However, there are subtle yet consequential differences between the California narratives and this argument. Immigration foes in California rarely engaged in explicit racialization of illegal immigrants and lauded the contributions of <italic>legal immigrants</italic>, a term with no documented racial connotations. Taylor’s claim explicitly racializes illegal immigrants as Mexican and implicitly characterizes Whites as the losers. As I will show, statements by pro-immigrant coalitions, newspaper editors, and policy elites illuminate the fact that statements like Taylor’s were about much more than legal status and that the subtle racialization of immigration discourse had profound implications for welfare politics.</p>
<p>Despite calls for a 187-style initiative, Arizona’s politicians refused to comply. The most vocal opponent was Republican Governor Fife Symington, who believed a referendum would compromise Arizona’s fledgling business relations with Mexico. Instead, Symington demanded that the federal government reimburse the state for its immigration-related expenses. In doing so, he used a racial frame. When other governors filed lawsuits against the federal government they spoke directly to the issue of illegal aliens. In contrast, Symington’s congressional testimony and public addresses echoed earlier racial stereotypes of “Mexican wetbacks” as he claimed that Arizona faced a broad-sweeping invasion by “sewer bandits . . . from Mexico” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0003122413476712">Cobb 1994</xref>). Demonizing all Mexicans, legal and illegal, Symington proclaimed that “the real problem [facing Arizona] is the number of legal Mexican visitors who crowd processing points along the border. . . . They can’t get across in a legal fashion, so they go around” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0003122413476712">Pitzl 1994</xref>). Unlike in California where the legality frame championed the virtues of legal immigrants, Symington’s statements deemed legal and illegal Mexicans as equally unworthy, demonstrating that the fault lines of immigration were fundamentally racial.</p>
<p>In an effort to expose these racial categories of worth, Scottsdale resident Ernest Perez used the example of an undocumented immigrant from England, a homeless welfare recipient with five children. Her pending deportation sparked calls from her friends and family for legislative action that would allow her and her children to remain in the United States. When the case attracted favorable media coverage and overwhelming public support, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0003122413476712">Perez (1994)</xref> asked, “Isn’t this an example of an alien using up our resources without contributing to our output? Could the difference be that this alien is from England, rather than from Central America or Mexico?” This critique clearly shows that the racial frame demonized on the basis of race more than legal status. The worth attributed to the English immigrant, despite her illegal status, demonstrates the centrality of race as a marker of deservingness. By demonstrating that immigration attacks targeted all Hispanics, and not immigrants from largely White countries like England, advocates exposed the racial grounding of anti-immigrant discourse.</p>
<p>Immigrant advocates were frustrated by the increasing dominance of the racial frame and protested its homogenization of Hispanics. In a prominent editorial, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003122413476712"><italic>Arizona Republic</italic> (1994)</xref> criticized anti-immigrant groups for “dehumanizing a whole class of people [including] legal immigrants and U.S.-born Latinos.” Advocating for the state’s Yaqui community, Blanca Wiese protested a spate of attacks on area Hispanics, complaining of the government: “They think all Hispanics . . . are trouble, that we steal and we don’t work for a living and we’re just on welfare and we’re in gangs and we carry guns, which we don’t. They treat us all the same” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0003122413476712">Roberts 1997</xref>). In making such claims, these advocates tried to highlight the diversity among Arizona’s Hispanic population but expressed exasperation with the increasing racialization of state politics.</p>
<p>Although Arizona failed to pass a 187-style referendum until 2004, the racial framing of this formative immigration conflict had lasting effects on state politics. Immigrants in California could claim moral worth on the basis of their legal status, but discourses in Arizona prevented legal Hispanic immigrants and citizens from doing the same, instead racializing them and obscuring the population’s internal diversity. As I will show, this frame had three spillover effects on welfare reform: discursive, organizational, and electoral effects.</p>
<sec id="section13-0003122413476712">
<title>Race, Citizenship, and Welfare in Arizona</title>
<p>While anti-immigrant groups’ use of the legality frame shifted welfare politics in a lenient direction in California, the racial framing of immigration in Arizona propelled the state toward punitive reforms by creating a racialized discursive opportunity structure and foreclosing opportunities for cross-racial coalitions. The belief that Mexicans abused welfare compelled many to support restrictions.</p>
<p>After the 187-style campaign, anti-welfare forces in Arizona quickly adopted this racial frame to advocate for restrictive policies, deriding Mexicans and championing citizen rights. Advocating for restrictive reforms, Tom Patterson, a state senator and legislative leader, argued,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0003122413476712">13</xref></sup><disp-quote>
<p>Welfare is very corrosive to human beings and it’s one of the worst things that can happen to you to fall into a welfare trap . . . it’s been a horrible influence on minorities . . . welfare is the number one reason why the civil rights movement stalled out. . . . [In Arizona] it applies to a little different minority but the dynamics are basically the same.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In welfare debates, policymakers illuminated the centrality of racial rather than citizenship or legal categorization by repeatedly asserting that welfare “disproportionately affect[s] . . . minorities” like Hispanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003122413476712"><italic>Arizona Daily Star</italic> 1997</xref>). When a bipartisan team of legislators proposed stringent reforms that denied benefits to most legal noncitizens—a valorized group in California—they justified the bill by claiming, as Senator Patterson did, that “the United States has become a ‘magnet’ for people around the world because of its benefit system” and the dependency rates of “poor Latinos” demanded a harsh response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003122413476712">Arizona State Legislature 1997a</xref>:12).</p>
<p>Gubernatorial staffers reported a range of “destructive stereotypes” of “brown people” voiced by both Democrats and Republicans that “constantly had to be challenged” in the negotiations process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0003122413476712">14</xref></sup> Declaring all Hispanics to be welfare recipients, Patterson expressed anger at Arizona’s Hispanic elected officials: “Hispanics frustrated me because they were so rigidly collectivist in their outlooks . . . their political identity was obviously Mexican or Hispanic or whatever you want to call it.” He accused Hispanic elected officials of having a “my people get them [benefits] and your people pay for them” attitude.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0003122413476712">15</xref></sup> Recognizing the racialized nature of these debates, Tillie Arvizu, vice president of Arizona’s main Hispanic service organization, Chicanos Por La Causa, called welfare reform “racist and discriminatory because it targets Hispanics [even those who are] seventh generation” U.S. citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0003122413476712">Ibarra 1996</xref>). Highlighting the irrelevance of legal categories of worth in state and national politics, Esther Aguillera, the director of the Hispanic Caucus, declared the reforms an “effort to confuse the American public on the issues of legal and illegal immigration” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0003122413476712">Ibarra 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>While the legality frame facilitated advocacy for lenient reforms in California, the racial frame in Arizona limited advocates’ ability to claim that welfare recipients deserved state support, especially in debates about whether to extend welfare benefits to legal noncitizens. Federal law allowed states to provide benefits to all noncitizens using state funds. California did so, but a noncitizen program held little appeal in Arizona. Two of the lone legislative advocates for such a policy, Representatives Herschella Horton and Marion Pickens, expressed concerns about the effect of welfare reform on the state’s noncitizen residents. In one contentious debate, a local anti-poverty advocate joined them, employing a legality frame to advocate for benefits for legal immigrants. She argued that the state had a responsibility to aid legal immigrants “who have been taxpaying citizens” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003122413476712">Arizona House of Representatives 1997</xref>:10). Because mainstream political discourse demonized all Hispanics, even legal residents, these efforts failed to resonate. When anti-poverty advocates declared legal immigrants to be “taxpaying citizens” or argued that legal immigrants rarely accessed public relief, anti-welfare legislators countered, “the assertion that legal immigrants use less services than others in the United States was debatable” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003122413476712">Arizona State Legislature 1997a</xref>:12). Such statements contrasted with the public discourse in California, where policymakers rarely questioned the moral worth of legal immigrants. Key committee leaders in Arizona even refused to gather cost estimates for providing benefits to legal noncitizens. Thus, while activists in California successfully forced policymakers to disaggregate immigration spending into expenditures on legal and illegal immigrants, Arizona’s racial frame afforded no legitimacy to legal immigrants. Rather, this frame made claims of welfare over-use by Hispanics so unassailable that validation with data seemed unnecessary.</p>
<p>The racial frame also had organizational effects, limiting the formation of effective pro-welfare coalitions. As in California, a large and racially diverse array of advocacy organizations lobbied in Arizona to challenge EMPOWER, the state’s TANF program. However, anti-immigrant groups’ use of the racial frame prevented different sides from capitalizing on their common interests. Hispanic advocacy organizations, Native American groups, refugee and immigrant rights organizations, and children’s rights groups all organized independently. Chicanos Por La Causa (CPLC), the main Hispanic advocacy organization, called for benefits for noncitizens and supportive services for all welfare recipients, including legal citizens; however, they never joined forces with other groups to mount a sustained campaign. As advocate Hector Yturralde noted in an interview,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0003122413476712">16</xref></sup> Hispanic U.S. citizens expressed a sense of solidarity with undocumented Hispanics rather than with other legal citizens. Although they shared the primary goal of benefits for legal noncitizens and newly naturalized U.S. citizens, refugee aid organizations never met with CPLC representatives to strategize or share resources.</p>
<p>Children’s rights and religious groups also worked independently during the reform process, expressing only limited support for Hispanic and Mexican organizations, even those who advocated on behalf of Hispanic U.S. citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003122413476712">Arizona State Legislature 1997a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003122413476712">1997b</xref>). Along with CPLC, the Children’s Action Alliance (a Phoenix-based children’s advocacy group), the Arizona Community Action Association, the Inter-Tribal Council of Arizona, the Arizona Justice Institute, and a lobbyist for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Phoenix played prominent roles in legislative committee meetings. Despite their regular meeting attendance and their public appeals for supportive policies, the only time these groups acted together was when they joined 200 other groups in endorsing a document titled “Block Grants with a Vision.” The document listed vague principles for welfare reform, including local community control and government accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003122413476712">Arizona Community Action Association 1995</xref>). In interviews, former legislators and nonprofit advocates stated that many welfare proponents feared that allying too closely with Hispanic organizations, even those working primarily with documented and citizen Hispanics, would jeopardize the fight for lenient reforms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0003122413476712">17</xref></sup> These groups advocated for specific issues like childcare for deserving citizen welfare recipients rather than for noncitizen benefits. While the institutionalization of the legality frame in California allowed for effective cross-racial coalition building around rights for worthy recipients, Arizona advocates’ racial framing created different interests for advocacy organizations, fracturing citizen groups along issue-specific lines.</p>
<p>The racial frame also altered electoral politics. Policymakers viewed stringent welfare reforms, especially restrictions on noncitizen benefits, as a way to reap electoral rewards. By supporting such policies, leaders could demonstrate their get-tough stance on Hispanics. The first reforms passed the state legislature with resounding support. Although Symington entered the session a maligned figure facing a federal indictment, he saw his political career reinvigorated by welfare reform. Championing his successes, Symington (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0003122413476712">1994</xref>:3) said, “Arizona has charged ahead with its own welfare reform. . . . Arizona can no longer afford to waste its time on Lyndon Johnson’s 30-year loser that Bill Clinton has adopted. Our program is different, it is better, and it will fulfill the promise theirs can’t.” Symington’s welfare successes resuscitated his campaign and helped secure him a second term in office (although he would be convicted of bank fraud in federal court years later). My interviews suggest that the racial framing of welfare even prompted many Democrats to support punitive reforms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0003122413476712">18</xref></sup> Ultimately, only three state senators voted against the bipartisan proposals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0003122413476712">Noyes 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Punitive welfare reforms continued to provide political benefits in subsequent legislative sessions when legislators restructured EMPOWER to meet new federal mandates. Given the state’s prevailing racial climate, the state legislature adopted virtually all of the recommendations made by the Joint Committee on Block Grants charged with developing the revised policy, including limiting adult welfare eligibility to two years within a five-year period and requiring adult work participation once a child was 2 months old. Republican Senator Tom Patterson also lobbied successfully to privatize a portion of the state’s welfare services, making Arizona one of only two states in the country to privatize welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0003122413476712">Phillips and Franciosi 2001</xref>). This program also had racial consequences. The privatized Arizona Works pilot program was more lenient than the state-run program. It used an expanded definition of work that included community service and education, and had a life-time limit of five years, rather than the public program’s two of five years. For most families, the grant amount was also higher under the privatized program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0003122413476712">Children’s Action Alliance 1997</xref>). However, the trial Arizona Works project was implemented in a predominantly White section of the state, effectively creating a less punitive welfare program for many of the state’s White recipients.</p>
<p>Patterson, Symington, and other legislators identified the center of the welfare revolution as a “politically opportunistic place to be.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0003122413476712">19</xref></sup> While the state’s emerging conservative consensus certainly fueled the passage of harsh reforms, these lawmakers capitalized on the framings of worth popularized by earlier anti-immigration activists. Indeed, conservative lawmakers across the state gained increasing majorities over subsequent years due largely to their ability to exploit the racialized moral boundaries drawn in prior immigration conflicts. These constructions of beneficiaries justified the passage of punitive welfare policies and complicated advocates’ attempts to depict Hispanics as deserving. Unlike attacks on legal immigrants in California, which inspired collaboration between diverse groups, the racialized categories of worth in Arizona divided potential advocates, giving them different policy goals. In the end, punitive reforms provided electoral awards for policymakers.</p>

<title>Discussion and Summary</title>
<p>The anti-immigrant and welfare reform efforts of the mid-1990s provide a unique opportunity to examine how race affects welfare policy beyond the Black-White divide. The anti-immigrant coalitions that emerged in California and Arizona not only altered the politics of legal citizenship but the politics of social citizenship. In each state, the frames employed by anti-immigration groups had discursive, organizational, and electoral effects on welfare politics. Advocates in California employed a legality frame that scapegoated illegal immigrants and identified legal immigrants as hardworking and worthy beneficiaries. Advocates for expansive reforms seized this frame and demanded that the state protect noncitizens. The legality frame also provided an opening for the emergence of a diverse anti-poverty coalition that pressured policymakers to reward valorized groups. In subsequent years, many activists in California shifted the scale of their lobbying efforts to force federal repeal of some of the 1996 anti-immigrant measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0003122413476712">Wroe 2008</xref>). Their successes attest to the power of the legality frame to propel rights expansions at the national level.</p>
<p>Unlike in California, Arizona’s anti- immigrant activists employed a racial frame, depicting Mexicans as a threat to the state. By racializing state political discourse, anti-immigrant groups limited the resonance of rights claims by documented Mexican immigrants and U.S. citizens of Mexican descent. Policymakers supported punitive welfare reforms to demonstrate their tough stance toward the state’s undeserving Hispanic population. Use of the legality frame opened the door for noncitizen and citizen groups to unite in California; in Arizona, however, Native American, refugee, and child advocates never considered allying with Hispanic groups, viewing their interests as unaligned. These frames had long-term effects. California became one of only two states (with Maine) to re-extend all social welfare benefits to legal noncitizens. Arizona has intensified its campaign against noncitizen residents since the 1990s, culminating in the 2010 passage of a draconian anti-immigrant bill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003122413476712">Archibold 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>My analysis of Arizona and California suggests that the categories of worth invoked in immigration debates may explain the inconsistent results in previous studies of the relationship between Hispanic stereotypes, demographics, and welfare policies. The frame instability surrounding Hispanics and welfare likely reflects the contradicting associations surrounding immigrant and racial labels. In the United States, immigrants are often depicted as hardworking newcomers who do the jobs that are unpalatable to citizens. The racialization process, however, is often accompanied by narratives of laziness. While Hispanics may be considered deserving of social citizenship in one context, they can encounter race-based exclusion in another. This unevenness contrasts with the persistent categorization of Black welfare recipients as lazy and undeserving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0003122413476712">Gilens 1999</xref>). My results suggest that when a dominant frame activates racial attitudes about welfare, we can expect relatively consistent policy effects. However, if policymakers have access to multiple frames to activate racial animus, framing choices can alter the stakes and opportunities for social policy. Although additional research is necessary, it is likely that the discursive flexibility surrounding Hispanics is also characteristic of public discourse about Asian immigrants.</p>
<p>Scholars have largely assumed that the terms <italic>illegality</italic> and <italic>Hispanic</italic> are equally racialized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0003122413476712">HoSang 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0003122413476712">Jacobson 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0003122413476712">Ngai 2005</xref>). Research also finds that racial appeals are at their most powerful when they are implicit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0003122413476712">Mendelberg 2001</xref>). The present study provides important elaborations on both claims. <italic>Illegal</italic> may be a racially coded term, but I have demonstrated powerful political consequences to the use of explicit racial markers to denote unworthiness. Demeaning Hispanics or Hispanic illegal immigrants divides potential allies in a way that the language of illegality does not. Explicit racial references may reduce the persuasive power of political messaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0003122413476712">Mendelberg 2001</xref>), but they also change the stakes of future political debates, making restrictive welfare policies a form of political currency that can be traded for votes. That Arizona failed to adopt an anti-immigrant proposition in the mid-1990s but adopted stringent and racialized welfare reforms offers direct evidence to this point.</p>
<p>A matched pair comparison offers advantages for theory-building, but it precludes an examination of possible interactions between race relations and political, socioeconomic, or institutional forces on policy outcomes. Future research is needed to parse out these relationships; however, my results hint at two specific interactions of consequence. First, fractionalization and framing may combine to produce outcomes unanticipated by existing research. Fractionalization arguments posit a negative relationship between ethno-racial diversity and welfare generosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003122413476712">Alesina and Glaeser 2004</xref>). Yet, in terms of policy, the legality frame may be most effective in more diverse polities because it incorporates multiple groups under the umbrella of <italic>legal</italic> immigrants. In California, Latino, Asian, Black, and children’s rights groups seized on the legality frame to demand a more generous welfare program. Politicians struggled to ignore such a diverse constituency of lobbyists and activists, shifting their positions to accommodate the emerging consensus in favor of legal immigrants. This outcome suggests that collective action frames and ethno-racial diversity can intersect to create a political environment that is actually advantageous to welfare state expansion. Although my data gave no indication that California’s more diverse immigrant population affected immigration activists’ frame selection, future research should examine the possibility that ethnic fractionalization structures this strategic process. Activists in heterogeneous northeastern states may be more likely to adopt a legality frame given their long-standing and diverse immigrant populations, but their counterparts in new destination midwestern and southern states may turn more readily to a racial framing of immigration.</p>
<p>Second, my findings suggest that framing and civic capacity interact to produce specific constellations of welfare state policies. I have shown that the racial frame stymied effective pro-welfare mobilization in Arizona, and the legality frame created a discursive opening for broad coalition formation in California. Yet advocacy organizations’ ability to capitalize on this opening depended on their preexisting civic capacity. Proposition 187 not only institutionalized new categories of worth in California politics, it galvanized a wide range of social movement and immigrant organizations and fueled the rise of a new cadre of immigrant activists. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003122413476712">Brilliant’s (2010)</xref> work on the civil rights movement indicates, it was by no means inevitable that these organizations would later unite as welfare activists. The wide resonance of the legality frame encouraged these groups to view such alliances as beneficial. However, when these coalitions did form, California’s activist groups then had significant resources at their disposal to pressure elected officials to pursue sought after goals. These patterns suggest that framing choices have direct discursive and organizational effects on welfare politics, and framing’s electoral effects are heavily linked to civic capacity.</p>
<p>Since 2010, more than a dozen states have passed draconian statutes restricting the rights of undocumented immigrants. Pundits have dubbed these initiatives copycats of earlier Arizona and California laws. But in the 1990s, observers used the same language to describe Arizona’s efforts to pursue a 187-style initiative. These assumptions of cross-campaign similarity not only oversimplify critical policy developments, they are indicative of a broader public and scholarly tendency to understate the constructed nature of race and immigration. Racial threat and fractionalization models are typically operationalized in a way that assumes an inflexible relationship between racial and immigrant groups and specified educational, policy, or other outcomes. Furthermore, in applying these theories beyond the Black-White divide, researchers assume that race and immigration operate similarly across groups and contexts. By analyzing the political processes through which such differences are created, reified, and transformed, we reach a more nuanced and accurate understanding of emergent patterns in immigrant incorporation and race relations. Future research on these processes can illuminate the various discursive and political arrangements that destabilize race and create opportunities for social and policy change.</p>
