<title>Preterm infants have different nutritional requirements from term infants. Current literature includes recommendation for supplementation with protein and vitamin D. Please discuss the type and amount of supplementation that you recommend for preterm infants at discharge</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Carey:</speaker>
<p>At discharge, I usually prescribe the following supplements, regardless of breast or formula feeding: iron 1 mg/kg/day, protein (in human milk fortifier) and vitamin D (400 IU/day as in Poly-vi-sol without iron). The issue, however, is not at discharge, but at follow-up visits with their primary physicians. I work in a community hospital in a small, rural town and many patients have a family practice physician as their primary physician, not a pediatrician. This is not a treatise against family medicine; however, I do find that many of the physicians (including some pediatricians) are less aware of the challenges in growth and development of preterm infants. As a result, I see some previous preterm patients that I discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) get readmitted to the hospital for another health issue and realize that their physician never refilled the prescription for the above supplements.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Russek:</speaker>
<p>In preparation for discharge from the hospital key nutrients of concern for the preterm infant are <italic>iron</italic> and <italic>vitamin D</italic>. Goals include the following: <italic>iron</italic> 2 mg/kg/day (2-4 mg/kg/day) and <italic>vitamin D</italic> 400 IU/day (400-1000 IU/day): An infant receiving primarily breast milk would receive 1 mL/day of multivitamins with iron. An infant receiving iron-fortified formula would receive 1 mL/day of multivitamins. At times, there is the need for additional calcium and phosphorus supplementation on discharge if the infant is recovering from osteopenia of prematurity or fracture. The goal is to provide the infant with a total of 200 mg/kg/day of calcium (feeding and supplement). Supplementation of this mineral is in the form of calcium gluconate. Phosphorus supplementation is in the form of sodium or potassium phosphate with the goal of feedings and supplement to provide 100 mg/kg/day. If an infant is discharged home on calcium and phosphorus supplements close follow-up will be required. Monitoring of laboratory values and growth is a must. On discharge, protein needs are met by adding premature discharge formula to breast milk and/or feeding premature discharge.</p>

<p>Each issue, we ask different professionals a set of questions about an aspect of their practice or a specific problem or disease condition they encounter. This month’s topic is Nutritional Supplementation. Our participants are <bold>Donna Carey, MD, Megan Russek, MS, RD</bold>, and <bold>Patricia Esposito, MS, RD</bold>. Full bios for each of the contributors can be found at the end of this article.</p>

<speech>
<speaker>Esposito:</speaker>
<p>Many of our infants are being fed mom’s own milk here in our NICU and at discharge. Supplementation of mom’s milk is most often done with an easy to purchase formula powder intended for premature infants postdischarge. Fortification with up to 4 calories/ounce added is routine. For infants who may have enhanced requirement (&lt;1800 g at birth/history of diuretic therapy) we may actually fortify up to 6 or 8 additional calories/ounce. An extra 100 calories/day via fortification might provide up to 1 g protein/kg/day additional along with an extra 40 mg/kg/day calcium. The vitamin D addition using this approach is minimal; therefore supplementation with a standard infant multivitamin with iron (1 mL drop/day) is my usual approach for a full 400 units of vitamin D<sub>3</sub>/day.</p>

<title>Late preterm infants were once considered “almost term” from a nutrition point of view. We now know that they have special nutrition concerns. Please describe what you do in your practice to meet their unique nutritional requirements</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Carey:</speaker>
<p>The majority of the families in my practice area have a strong tendency to feed with a combination of breast milk and formula. Many of our late preterm infants have poor suck/swallow coordination and so have difficulty latching onto and feeding from their mother’s breasts. As a result, the majority of mothers begin to lean toward exclusive bottle feeding. If our best efforts fail to convince a mother to continue breastfeeding through the challenge, then we encourage all of our mothers to pump their breast milk and add human milk fortifier to the pumped milk. This provides extra protein and calories often needed for the late preterm infant. Also, while there is no formal recommendation by the American Academy of Pediatrics, I also encourage my families, if possible, to purchase long chain fatty acid supplements, especially once the infant begins solids.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Russek:</speaker>
<p>The late preterm infant is physiologically and metabolically immature. A constant reminder that size does not equate maturity is needed. The precise nutrient needs for this population are not well defined. Ideally the goal is to provide nutrients based on gestational age and clinical response instead of relying on a weight, which can be misleading. At present, if stable those infants born late preterm will be started on enteral feedings on day of birth with breast milk, preterm formula or premature discharge formula. These feedings will be supplemented on the day of birth with starter parenteral nutrition. On the days following, the infant is transitioned to enteral feedings and standard parenteral nutrition is supplemented based on the rate of enteral advancement.</p>
</speech>
<p>Once the infant progresses to all enteral feedings ad libitum feeding is encouraged. Feeding types may vary depending on the infant’s needs and may include the following: breast milk fortified with human milk fortifier at 22 or 24 kcal/ounce; breast milk with premature discharge formula added to provide a 22 or 24 kcal/ounce mix/premature 24 kcal/ounce formula with iron; premature discharge formula at 22 or 24 kcal/ounce.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Esposito:</speaker>
<p>The late preterm infant is described as being born between 34-0 weeks’ through 36-6 weeks’ gestation. In 2005, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists held an Expert Panel meeting. Since then any terms other than “late preterm” have been discouraged. These babies are sometimes low birth weight, but often are born between 2000 and 3000 g. It is important to remember that their brains are only at 65% of term volume at 34 weeks! These infants are at higher rate of morbidity, readmission, and mortality. They often have poor feeding skills and are at risk of hypoglycemia, hypothermia, hyperbilirubinemia, dehydration, and poor caloric intake. Since mom’s own milk is preferred feeding, our NICU mom’s are encouraged to “double pump” using a hospital grade electric pump to establish milk supply. All moms providing any of their own human milk at discharge are called by our IBCLC (<italic>International Board Certified Lactation Consultant</italic>) team at 2 days postdischarge and weekly thereafter for at least 4 weeks. These infants are usually not fortified with anything other than an infant multivitamin with iron (1 mL drop/day) as we encourage exclusive human milk feeding if possible.</p>

<title>Nutrition recommendations for preterm infants after discharge have changed substantially over the past 5 years. Please describe what upcoming trends do you see for the future and what should have the greatest priority?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Carey:</speaker>
<p>What I believe should have the greatest priority is closing the gap of economic disparities in the nutrition of preterm infant health. Infants born to mothers of lower socioeconomic status should have access to the same nutritional supplements and food items that infants born to economically stable families have. This, however, will only be accomplished if our national organizations, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, will take the step forward and <italic>formally</italic> state, as a standard of care issue, the use of supplements in preterm and late preterm infants.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Russek:</speaker>
<p>The collection of research that guides the care of premature infants after discharge from the hospital is growing and welcomed. One area of knowledge that is growing is our understanding of how the type and amount of nutrients fed to an infant has consequences on adult health. Preventing and reducing the incidence of obesity and metabolic syndrome and improving neurodevelopmental outcomes are a few of the consequences that feeding types can have on the neonate. As this body of knowledge increases, I foresee clearer guidelines on feeding preterm infants that will assist in the reduction and prevention of potential health concerns.</p>
</speech>
<p>Second, another trend to see in the future will be a focus on individualization of feedings or feedings specific to subgroups of infants such as the small for gestational age baby. Answers to questions such as, “Should boys be fed differently than girls?”</p>
<p>Last, as more options have become available for inpatient use to fortify expressed breast milk along with the body of knowledge that breast milk is the preferred feeding, methods to fortify/manipulate breast milk feedings at discharge will take on more significance. This area will become delineated and discharge feeding strategies improved.</p>
<p>The area of greatest priority is that of the effect of nutrient intake and consequences on adult health. An increased understanding of this topic will effect a lifetime.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Esposito:</speaker>
<p>The use of human milk feeding for preterm infants has grown, especially with the use of donor human milk trending upward. Families inquire about donor human milk postdischarge as well as extra “protein” fortification postdischarge. In hospital, we use donor milk that has been pooled and pasteurized. We stress the benefits of human milk versus cow’s milk formula feeding to parents. This message is a strong one! Something to watch for is the “borrowing/sharing” of human milk postdischarge. As those of us caring for premature infants stress the importance of human milk for the first feedings to parents, we need to be mindful of the long-term impact this will have on their willingness to provide adequate nutrition to their infants at home. An example is that of an infant patient who was refusing frozen “breast milk.” Interviewing mom, I asked how long the milk had been frozen and if it was in a deep freezer or not, as I was concerned for “freezer burn”/altered taste . . . she was unable to tell me the answer to this question. As it turned out, the milk she was using was not her own, but some that had been given to her by a friend. She wanted her infant to continue on human milk despite her own short supply. Research is needed to determine long-term outcomes and best practice for situations of short supply. As NICUs around the country use more donor milk, I hope that the demand does not exceed supply!</p>
