<abstract>
<p>Using primary sources (oral tradition, archival materials, archaeological evidence, 19th century European explorers’ and missionaries’ accounts) and secondary sources (historical, anthropological, archaeological, etc.), this article reevaluates, in a historical perspective, the decline and diminishment in political power and scale as well as in population and landmass of Bunyoro-Kitara, the earliest kingdom in East Africa’s lake region. It concludes that, contrary to the conventional wisdom proffered by 19th century Europeans and sanctified by Makerere University scholarship, the kingdom declined essentially because of the extraordinary errors of judgment and incompetence of most of its rulers from the close of the 17th century to the close of the 19th century, devastating deceases (human and animal), and brutal British conquest resulting in the death of thousands of individuals and loss of territory. By 1900 the kingdom’s population had declined by about four-fifths and landmass by about two-thirds. No major African kingdom experienced such an enormous outcome. Herein lies the fascination with this subject.</p>

<title>Prologue: State Formation and the Struggle for Mastery in the Interlacustrine Region of East Africa</title>
<p>The interlacustrine region of East Africa encompassing the kingdoms of Bunyoro-Kitara, Tooro, Buganda, Nkore, Rwanda, Karagwe, Kiziiba, and Ihangiro<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0021909611432094">1</xref></sup> was an area of great historical activity from about 900 AD to the European conquest of the 1890s. That activity resulted in the formation of centralized and semi-centralized state systems of varying degrees of power and political scale leading, inevitably, to the struggle for mastery among themselves. By the 1860s the balance of power had swung decisively in favor of Buganda. Baganda leaders who first came into contact with the British by this period were quick to realize the advantages to be derived by cooperating with the invaders. They made a great impression on them by presenting their kingdom – quite correctly – as the great power in the region whose friendship was worth cultivating and took pains not to give the impression that they were whimpering inferiors to the foreigners. Thus beautifully positioned, they used the British to further increase their kingdom’s territorial extent. The British, too, used Baganda chiefs as political agents for administering the conquered kingdoms of southern Uganda. The Baganda also presented the history of the lake region through their eyes. Not unnaturally, Buganda’s neighbors became jealous of the Baganda and resented particularly the idea of the colonial administration using Baganda chiefs as sub-imperialists.</p>
<p>No kingdom was more distressed by this turn of events than Bunyoro-Kitara, the major loser in the struggle for mastery. The British had halted emphatically the spirited efforts of Omukama Chwa II Kabarega (1871–99) to reverse the situation by recreating what he believed would be a new Kitara ‘empire.’ He was defeated and exiled to the Seychelles in 1899.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0021909611432094">2</xref></sup> The Banyoro regard him as their greatest ruler. During the early years of colonial rule, predictably, the Banyoro formed the bulwark of resistance against British overrule. They blamed the British for: restoring the Tooro kingdom which Kabarega had reconquered; transferring huge chunks of their kingdom to Buganda – the ‘Lost Countries’ – the return of which to them became a major political issue in colonial Uganda; and the most painful of all for them, the indignity of being ruled by Baganda chiefs appointed by the colonial government. These sentiments climaxed in the Nyangire Revolt of 1907. The revolt was suppressed and what amounted to direct colonial rule was imposed on Bunyoro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1970c</xref>: 30–66).</p>
<p>In 1933 the colonial government signed the Bunyoro Agreement with Omukama Winyi IV by which Bunyoro became a mere district in colonial Uganda, but was also officially recognized as the Kingdom of Bunyoro-Kitara. The Banyoro regarded this recognition as a vindication, in part, of their claim that their ancestors presided over an extensive ‘empire’ that exercised some sort of dominion throughout East Africa’s lake region and as far as some parts of northern Uganda.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0021909611432094">3</xref></sup>The agreement also ended the era of direct colonial rule from Kampala.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0021909611432094">4</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the Bunyoro Agreement of 1955 formally ensured that Omukama Winyi IV became a titular head of his so-called kingdom. On being forced to sign the document he declared ruefully: ‘I am not the Mukama.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0021909611432094">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The independence of Uganda in 1962, far from restoring the equanimity of the Banyoro, caused them much disquietude instead. Not even the restoration to them of Buyaga and Bugangaizi – two of the Lost Counties – would comfort them. In 1967 the government of Milton Obote, in pursuance of a socialist agendum, declared Uganda a republic in a document called <italic>The</italic>
 <italic>Move to the Left</italic> and pensioned off all the Ugandan kings. Finally, in 1994 the government of Yoweri Museveni decided to restore the Ugandan kingdoms in the context of a republican constitution! And on 11 June 1994 Prince Solomon Gafabusa Iguru was crowned the 27th Omukama of the Ababiito Dynasty of Bunyoro-Kitara founded, according to Bunyoro oral tradition, by Isingoma Mpuga Rukidi sometime during the 15th or 16th century. The Banyoro are currently engaged in what they call the ‘Rebirth of Bunyoro-Kitara’ in the context of their reduced circumstances. And Museveni’s government has recently elevated Kabarega as one of the iconic figures in Ugandan history.</p>

<title>The Historiographical Problem</title>
<p>The discussion that follows and the historiographical issues it poses will be more beneficially comprehended in the light of the earlier summary. What the Banyoro apparently lost in the battlefield and from the politics of shifting alliances and alignments that characterized the history of the region for some 600 years they tried to keep alive through their historical traditions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0021909611432094">6</xref></sup> These traditions inform us in masterful and amazing detail – in spite of several lacunae – how their ancestors founded the first state system in the lake region and later converted it into a large, albeit loosely-organized ‘empire,’ that extended beyond the region. That ‘empire’ they called Kitara Kya Nyamenga, an ‘empire’ won by the sword by larger-than-life individuals. Here is a tale, not totally incorrect, but told with exaggerations from the point of view of a loser in a struggle. It is a didactic story addressed especially to the young people of colonial Bunyoro assuring them that, in spite of the lowly situation of their kingdom in the colonial dispensation, they had an ancestry worthy of pride. This tradition has generated a lot of controversy, interestingly enough not from the oral traditions of Bunyoro’s neighbors but from modern historians which has made the study of the region’s history and culture a fascinating subject (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611432094">Chretien, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909611432094">Doyle, 2006</xref>: 5–9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909611432094">Dunbar, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021909611432094">Ingham, 1957</xref>: xxi, vol.2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611432094">Karugire, 1980</xref>: 1–17; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021909611432094">Kiwanuka, 1968</xref>: 603–619; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909611432094">Low, 1963</xref>: 329–330; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021909611432094">Ogot, 1999</xref>: 381–406; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021909611432094">Okot P’ Bitek, 1971</xref>: 10–39; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1973a</xref>: 49–71, 1998: 18–65).</p>
<p>The aim of this article is modest but nonetheless still fascinating because at the center of the main debate are the reasons that accounted for the decline and diminishment of Bunyoro-Kitara. Various reasons have been advanced – for the most part in passing – to account for its diminishment but no consensus has been arrived at.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0021909611432094">7</xref></sup> Although this article may not put the controversy to rest, nevertheless I chose to revisit the subject after many years distance from active involvement with the region’s history as a sort of <italic>nunc dimitis</italic>, or swan song, if you will – a final contribution to the history of a region that has occupied my serious attention for more than a generation. The reader may therefore pardon me if the endnotes and references refer perhaps too heavily to my experiences and publications.</p>
<p>Because of the criticisms that Bunyoro oral traditions have attracted, mostly from historians – especially from those who have done no serious fieldwork in Bunyoro – some comments on oral tradition and history are in order (for details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1973b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021909611432094">1998</xref>: 35–37). Historians do not know the earliest history of Bunyoro-Kitara. It is suspected, however, that human beings have inhabited the region since the Stone Age. The Banyoro, however, claim that their ancestor founded the earliest state system in the interlacustrine region. The founding dynasty, the Abatembuzi (pioneer kings), were probably a pastoral dynasty whose activities are imperfectly remembered. The dynasty apparently exercised dominion over agricultural communities who earlier had displaced the region’s hunter-gatherers to whom archaeologists attribute the origins of the Sangoan and Lupembam industries of the Late Stone Age, themselves regional variations of that technological innovation which fashioned blades from stone and constructed them into a variety of small, geometrical shapes called microliths.</p>
<p>By the 15th century this dynasty – whose humanity some historians dispute – was displayed by another pastoral dynasty, the Abachwezi who, within a century, turned the Abatembuzi state into a large but loosely-organized and amorphous empire called Kitara. Most historians accept the humanity of the Abachwezi, but whose activities are also imperfectly remembered. Many, too, question particularly the accuracy of describing their dominion as an empire and the territorial extent of that dominion. Nevertheless, Abachwezi reign is conceded to have been short but exciting. Oral traditions of the lake region credit them with performing super human feats and with exercising effortless dominion over all who came into contact with them. Thus perceived as superstars and icons, they were elevated to a cult status – the Abachwezi Cult – after their defeat and dispersal. The dynasty comprised only three rulers.</p>
<p>The last dynasty, comprising 27 kings, the Ababiito – the main focus of this article – still reigns in Bunyoro-Kitara. Founded by a pastoral dynasty of Nilotic ancestry by Isingoma Mpuga Rukidi (‘the Father of the Drums [Isingoma], the spotted one [Mpuga], from the land of the naked people [Rukidi]’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021909611432094">Oliver, 1953</xref>: 135–7), Rukidi appears to have commanded the largest and most influential following of the Luo migrating groups. Nicknamed Ababiito, a name Rukidi adopted and turned into a royal line, the Luo first occupied northern Bunyoro that later became known as Paluo country, from where they gradually asserted their control over large areas of the Abachwezi’s power complex. This feat was achieved primarily, tradition informs us, by manufacturing local collaborating groups (as shown by the legend of Rukidi’s acquisition of the royal drum from the powerful Abasiita clan in return for a supply of millet!), and rarely by actual military conquest.</p>
<p>It is suspected that internal quarrels, disagreements, and princely ambitions may have caused Rukidi’s followers to fragment and fan out from his later capital in Bugangaizi to found Ababiito-type states in various parts of the lake region and in northern Uganda over whom the Ababiito exercised ritual authority and, for some time, received tribute from some of them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0021909611432094">8</xref></sup> Undaunted the same tradition claims that, at the same time, Ruhinda, Wamara’s chief cattle-keeper retreated southward from the advancing Luo with his fellow pastoralists and their cattle, settling for a while at Isingoro (‘a place of refuge’) before proceeding to Karagwe where they established a stronghold. From Karagwe Ruhinda turned his attention to Nkore and to the Buhaya states. The degree of his effective authority is not clear but he is credited with founding the Bahinda Dynasty of Nkore by using ‘diplomacy and duplicity rather than … might’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1998</xref>: 34). With Ruhinda’s death his state fragmented into the Bahinda successor states to Kitara of Nkore, Karagwe, Kyamutwara, and Ihangiro. For 200 years Bunyoro-Kitara’s sporadic occupations of Nkore and Rwanda did not endure and on each occasion ended in defeat and retreat. This is the story in a nutshell. It is not difficult to see what the traditional historians of Bunyoro-Kitara were trying to do in an adverse colonial situation: providing a counter claim to Buganda’s claim and, by so doing, hopefully expose the bumptiousness of the kabakas of Buganda and their chiefs.</p>
<p>It is also not surprising that some historians and other scholars of Bunyoro’s neighbors question Bunyoro’s account of their traditional history while obliquely accepting the accounts of these neighbors. And yet a comparison of the historical traditions of the lake region and parts of northern Uganda lead to the following agreed conclusions: Bunyoro-Kitara is central to the history of the region; the ancestors of Bunyoro-Kitara founded the earliest state system in the region; there was an exciting ruling dynasty called Abachwezi; the present Bunyoro-Kitara is very much diminished in landmass today than it was by the close of the 17th century; historically it formed the nucleus of a Kitara power complex whose influence was extensively felt; the Nilotic Luo under the leadership of Rukidi did not only displace the Abachwezi but also founded some kingdoms and chiefdoms in northern Uganda; the Ababiito were real human beings of Luo ancestry; some of the Ababiito kings did actually invade and occupy for a while western Uganda and Rwanda; they successfully repelled for a while the northern expansion of Buganda, but by the 19th century Buganda had become the dominant power in the region; the founder of Tooro kingdom in 1835 was the first son of a king of Bunyoro-Kitara; and the territorial diminishment of Bunyoro-Kitara started in late 17th century and became irreversible with the British conquest of the 1890s.</p>
<p>Having compared some of these traditions, Roland Oliver stated without equivocation that Bunyoro’s tradition<disp-quote>
<p>bears fairly careful examination. If it was forgery it would be brilliant. For it is in a very real sense that of the reverse side of the Ganda model, corroborating the story of the struggle for power in southern Uganda, but from the point of view of the loser instead of the gainer. Generation by generation and province by province it squares with the traditions of Buganda. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021909611432094">Oliver, 1955</xref>: 111–17)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It also corroborates the traditions of Nkore, Kiziiba, Kooki, Karagwe, Rwanda, Tooro, Acholi, Alur and Langi at appropriate points. However, the reasons why such a major kingdom suffered a dramatic decline within two centuries are still contested.</p>
<p>The historical value of these accounts has generated controversy. The exaggerations, romaticizations, and the menacing overlay of supernatural agencies apparent in Bunyoro’s earliest historical tradition notwithstanding, no one today seriously regards the Abatembuzi as ‘gods’ and the ‘Abachwezi’ as ‘demigods’ in the fashion of AB Fisher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021909611432094">Fisher, 1911</xref>). Nor are Bunyoro traditions mythical as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0021909611432094">CC Wrigley (1958)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611432094">Jean-Pierre Chretien (2006)</xref> suppose<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0021909611432094">9</xref></sup> because myth, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021909611432094">RG Collingwood (1963)</xref>, is ‘quasi-history’ but which ‘is not concerned with human actions at all. The human element has been completely purged away and the characters of the story are simply gods’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021909611432094">Posnansky, 1970</xref>: p. xxi), implying that the recorded traditions of Bunyoro-Kitara, or indeed of Africa as a whole, lie outside the realm of myth. Admittedly, ‘gods’ (Ruhanga, Kintu or Nkya Mba, Nyaminyonga), ‘goddesses’ (Nyamata, Nyanamwiru), giants (Mugasa, Misinga, Kagoro), and goblins (Kantu, Kyarunda) occasionally stalk the historical stage but everything is ‘concerned with human action’ and the human element has not been purged away. We may also note that Bunyoro traditions do not even clothe these historical actors with a divine garb to the extent that Greek traditions, for example, clothe the ‘historical’ actors of Mount Olympus. I agree with Merrick Posnansky to some degree when he writes:<disp-quote>
<p>Threaded through the vivid tapestry of the Cwezi tales there is circumstantial evidence which indicates improperly remembered history rather than myth. The Cwezi were a distinct episode between the age of the gods and the kings of men. They were not creators of men as their predecessors the Batembuzi had been; rather, they engaged in real wars against, identifiable peoples. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1998</xref>: 35)</p>

<sec id="section3-0021909611432094">
<title>The Ababiito State System</title>
<p>Not even Wrigley or Chretien question the humanity of the Ababiito. Rukidi’s new dynasty displaced the rather fractious Abachwezi who were dislodged from Bwera, their capital (now in western Buganda), which contained excellent grazing land. Abachwezi rule within the core was certainly effective; in the periphery (that did not even include most of present Bunyoro district) it was less so. Once this core fell to Rukidi and his followers the so-called Abachwezi empire completely disintegrated. This important event occurred by most accounts in the 16th century. Apparently the Ababiito took advantage of the Abachwezi celebrity status by carefully crafting a historic charter that linked it agnatically to its defeated predecessors, thus legitimizing its usurpation of power. Most historians would agree that the claimed relationship as postulated by traditional sources was a deliberate fabrication. Over time, however, the Ababiito became Bantuized but their original stronghold in northern Bunyoro remained essentially Luo-speaking, and is still known as Paluo. Historians also agree that from northern Bunyoro the Ababiito founded various states and chiefdoms in northern Uganda where, for centuries, they exercised some sort of influence, not as colonists but influence based essentially on consanguinal relationships. Southward, too, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611432094">Samwiri Karugire (1980)</xref> contended – and I agree with him – that the sudden rise of such kingdoms as Ankole, Buganda, Burundi, Rwanda, Karagwe, Kyamutwara, and Ihangiro, for example, ‘were set up as defensive units against the invaders and that they succeeded in arresting the Luo drive southwards’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611432094">Karugire, 1980</xref>: 6). The later efforts of the Ababiito to exert influence over these kingdoms, for a variety of motives, caused them to overstretch their territorial commitments. The consequences were dire. Governing the type of state system inherited by the Ababiito presented a very difficult and complex problem.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0021909611432094">
<title>Administrative Structure</title>
<p>Did this system inevitably lead to the decline of Bunyoro-Kitara? Karugire answered, reflecting conventional wisdom, in the affirmative: ‘It is in Bunyoro’s system of government that we have to look for an explanation of her diminishing influence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611432094">Karugire, 1980</xref>: 21). An examination of this system of government, however, does not support this explanation. The Ababiito, indeed, inherited a state system with fissiparous tendencies. It was a monarchy in which cohesion was deep only insofar as the ruling groups were concerned. The rest of the population lived in their isolated villages where they eked out an existence in self-sufficient independence, not caring who ruled provided their lives were not adversely affected. Under the Abachwezi, particularly, cohesion and subordination were not as high as traditional sources tend to suggest. Superficially the state was a monocracy with steep stratification; in reality, clan and lineage organizations exhibited segmentary characteristics. Indeed, by stating that the Abachwezi, disgusted with the insubordination of their subjects, abandoned their so-called empire and ‘disappeared’ into Lake Wamara in ambiguous circumstances, traditional sources obliquely support this interpretation. To their credit the Ababiito, unlike the Abachwezi, tried to balance the opposing forces – namely, centralization and decentralization – by establishing a set of institutions of government intended to create an acceptable political culture that involved not only the rulers and the ruled but also the ruling classes themselves, an important innovation that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021909611432094">John Beattie (1971)</xref> noted but which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611432094">Karugire (1980)</xref> failed to. Thus evolved a state structure characterized by a monarchy that saw its position as both centrifugal and centripetal, operating a highly monocephalous constitution that functioned on the principle of power delegation and checks and balances.</p>
<p>At the same time social mobility was highly intrastatic or vertical. This balance was achieved by making a clear distinction between obukama (kingship) and obulemi (government). Kingship was astutely cultivated and explained to be of divine origin-based, not on conquest but on the historic charter. No distinction was made between the state and the kingship. Indeed, the literal rendering of obukama is kingdom or state and that of Omukama is king or monarch. It is important also to note that the Ababiito had no concept of empire, a concept Europeans introduced during the 19th century and consequently adopted by historians and other scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611432094">Chretien, 2006</xref>: 103–4). What mattered to the Ababiito was the legitimization of their usurpation of power, and they proved to be very successful at it because that legitimacy was gradually conceded them. The Omukama’s officials spoke to him submissively and in kneeling position. They praised him extravagantly and offered their services as humble king’s men (for details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1973</xref>: 191). The Omukama was expected to commit suicide if he shed blood. He was expected to sleep in one position at night for fear that if he turned from side to side some danger was bound to befall the state. The coronation of a new Omukama was carefully calculated to emphasize both his divinity on earth and the historic charter. It was impressively elaborate and the technical court vocabulary used enhanced the solemnity of myth and ritual that surrounded his person. The Empyema Succession rite – performed on a hill called Buru near the area Rukidi is said to have built his first capital – ended the ceremony.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0021909611432094">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Omukama was also head of government. A hierarchy of officials assisted him. The abakama b’obuhanga (provincial governors) were the highest-ranking political administrators. A governor was normally, but not necessarily, appointed by the Omukama on the advice of the abakuru b’ ebitebe (counselors of state). Originally the position was not hereditary and did not reside in a particular class because a governor could be an omubiito (prince), an important omuhuma (pastoralist) or distinguished omuiiru (cultivator).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0021909611432094">11</xref></sup> The allegiance of the governors, however, was assured so long as the Omukama was perceived to be strong. From about the 18th century to the middle of the 19th century, when the monarchy was in decline, the appointive nature of the territorial governorships became severely eroded. This resulted in several governors ruling practically independently of their so-called overlords and making their positions hereditary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0021909611432094">12</xref></sup> They became kings except in name and maintained courts that paralleled that of the Omukama. Each governor also maintained a private army in his province which was considered part of his <italic>obwesengeze</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0021909611432094">13</xref></sup> He therefore exercised a lot of influence over his subjects. Below the governors was a hierarchy of territorial administrators down to the village level. As long as the governor worked well with them, the Omukama’s influence over them was minimal.</p>
<p>Such other institutions of government as the amakumu g’Omukama (royal stewards) who existed as parallel territorial administrative setup and were in charge of royal estates and lands, and the abakuru b’emirwa (royal household) comprising officials selected diffusely throughout the land to perform specific functions, were devices that went some way to bridging the gap and easing the tension generated by the centralizing tendencies of the constitution on the one hand, and the tendency to fission that characterized the clans and the periphery on the other. The abakama also used the abajwara kondo (crown wearers) who were members of the austere order of counselors, and the abasekura, a small select group of informal advisors and sycophants (‘kitchen cabinet’?), permitted to speak with the king in intimate terms, to maintain the stability and smooth functioning of the state. The mugema, a very important governor of the hereditary county Kigimba (Nyakabimba, now in modern Tooro), exerted a lot of influence in governance as head of the crown wearers, aptly described by the Reverend John Roscoe as belonging to a ‘Sacred Guild’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021909611432094">Roscoe, 1923</xref>: 112). The abasekura, too, were indirectly, at any rate, politically and socially influential.</p>
<p>The Ababiito also are said to have introduced the concept of parliament (orukurato orukuru rw’ihanga). It was made up of some senior governors and other important officials of the realm. These parliamentarians were called to the capital four times a year to discuss matters of national importance. Although their ability to influence policy appears to have been limited and the Omukama could dismiss them at his pleasure, he had to handle them with care in the interest of stability. Real formal power lay with the Omukama and the orukurato rw’omubananu (cabinet), however. The bamuroga – a sort of prime minister – headed the cabinet and was also the Omukama’s double when he was unavailable. The cabinet was the policy-making arm of government. Parliament could not override its decisions but the Omukama must approve them. The cabinet included also the mugema and an unspecified number of important officials. The Omukama was by no means <italic>primus inter pares</italic> in relation to his cabinet although the influence of any cabinet depended on the authority the incumbent Omukama was capable or willing to wield.</p>
<p>Included in the administration were the princes and princesses (Ababiito and Ababiitokati respectively), the Omukama’s mother, the okwiri or mugamba who was the male head of the Ababiito clan as well as the Omukama’s ‘official brother,’ and the kalyota or batebe – the Omukama’s ‘official sister’ who ruled the princesses of the clan just as the okwiri ruled the princes of the clan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1973</xref>: 185). In short, they ruled their clan just as the Omukama ruled the state. But a constitutional device whereby the okwiri was the Omukama’s subject at the national level and the Omukama was the okwiri’s subject at the clan level sometimes created difficulties because the okwiri was in a position, if he could, to cause him infinite trouble if he had to do so. Ankole’s cultivation of the Bagyendanwa cult and the Asante idea of the Golden Stool were better constitutional mechanisms for achieving the same end.</p>
<p>Finally, an interesting aspect of Bunyoro-Kitara’s government institutions was the absence of separation of powers. Because an eminent or favored individual could be at once a provincial governor, a counselor, a cabinet member, a prince, a parliamentarian, and even a court president, real authority was unhealthily concentrated in the hands of a few important individuals. Parliament was not a law-making body. Officials of the realm exercised their political authority at the pleasure of the Omukama to whose person they were bound by ‘a close bond of personal dependence … and attachment.’ He alone virtually exercised ‘all authority over people’, but this authority, it must be emphasized, he could only exercise through the process of power delegation, the monitoring of which was not always thorough or effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021909611432094">Beattie, 1971</xref>: 103). The Omukama’s real importance was that he was the main integrating force in the state. His symbolic omnipotence was signified by an annual ceremony during which he shot arrows to the north, south, east, and west and shouted: ‘I have shot the nations to overcome them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021909611432094">Roscoe, 1923</xref>: 112).</p>
<p>This discussion shows that, although the Bunyoro state had obvious administrative flaws, historians of Uganda have generally failed to emphasize the following: the sophistication of the machinery of government of Bunyoro-Kitara; that the state’s persistent tendencies to fission can be better explained in terms of the numerous errors of judgment of the abakamas; the incompetence of some of them; and the cantankerous propensities of the ruling clan itself than in the imperfections of the constitution as such.</p>

<title>Mechanisms For Power Transfer</title>
<p>Did what has also been considered the imperfect mechanisms for the transfer of power therefore cause the decline and fall of Bunyoro-Kitara (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611432094">Karugire, 1980</xref>: 43; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021909611432094">Ogot, 1999</xref>: 392–3)? The evidence in support of this proposition has been studied in some detail and found wanting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1973a</xref>: <italic>loc. cit</italic>). We know, however, that succession difficulties that had their roots in the mechanism for the transfer of power did lead several times to debilitating succession and civil wars. The first and perhaps most debilitating, but certainly the longest, of those difficulties was the succession war that followed the death of Nyabongo I, the sixth Omukama. Nyakatura wrote: ‘It is said that during the reign of Winyi II [who won the war] ghosts frequently appeared,’ anxious to know ‘who succeeded to the throne in the end and people used to say to them: “it was Winyi”; and the ghosts used to retort: “That’s what we thought too.”’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0021909611432094">14</xref></sup> We also know from the subsequent history of Bunyoro-Kitara that this major trauma was not the primary cause of the decline. It is true that, because the historic charter stipulated that only the Ababiito b’Engoma (‘the Ababiito of the Drum’) could rule, the Ababiito Kwonka (‘ordinary Ababiito’) constituted a restive element in the society. Also by limiting the Ababiito b’engoma specifically to the sons of the reigning monarch, many more princes became disaffected, a problem exacerbated by the kingdom’s prolific polygynous system. Thus the surfeit of restless princes and the proliferation of the royal eligible which became manifest in the second generation during the reign of Oyo I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1973</xref>: 66) – Oyo alone had more than 200 children – caused some princes to bid for power in their own provinces, in part to escape the ignominy of being regarded as part of the Ababiito Kwonka, the royal castaways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1973</xref>: 66).</p>
<p>Even among the royal eligible no law of primogenitor existed. Informants unanimously agreed that the ‘Drum [Throne] chose its own heir;’ that is, the throne chose whomsoever it willed to sit on it. In short, succession struggles were supposed to produce the strongest and best rulers through divine intervention. But if this were so it becomes difficult to explain the existence of the successive weak rulers from Olimi IV (c. 1782–6) to Kyebambe Kamurasi (1852–69) which coincided with the main era of the decline of Bunyoro-Kitara – unless, of course, the gods also destined it to be so!</p>
<p>Indeed, the presumed open scramble for succession whenever a vacancy occurred is not borne out by recorded practice. Bunyoro tradition states that the first six kings succeeded to the throne without a struggle. This supports Audrey Richards’ finding that ‘after the third or fourth generation of royal succession’ dynastic difficulties begin to occur in African kingdoms because, by that period, the monarchies began to show signs of instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021909611432094">Richards, 1961</xref>: 136). The first disputed succession under the Ababiito occurred during the fourth generation; the first civil war occurred during the seventh. Force as a mechanism for power transfer was not a constitutional fact, however. The main mechanism for this purpose was popular support generated by a series of alliances and alignments. That tradition, in fact, records only eight succession wars in the kingdom’s long history suggests that the system apparently produced an acceptable successor more often than not. The explanation lay in the fact that a prince who contested the throne and lost also lost his life. That proved to be a huge deterrent.</p>
<p>Another important cause of instability was usurpation of power. This was resorted to when a prince could not afford to wage a succession war, when a successful prince won an inconclusive victory, when a royal eligible felt cheated out of power, or when the Omukama left no heir. Such a mechanism was considered legal. But it succeeded only through a careful realignment of forces. A princely usurper had the name kyebambe (usurper) affixed to his royal title. Only four usurpers are officially recorded, however, but we know that there was a fifth, Chwa I, who callously eliminated his brother Nyarwa from the throne. Indeed, in Bunyoro these difficulties occurred too infrequently that they alone could not have accounted for its decline and fall.</p>
<p>Perhaps more seriously were secession movements. These were aided by the gradual rise of the aristocracy and disaffected princes at the expense of the monarchy. This development became manifested by the second half of the 18th century. Let us take the princes first. By making some princes provincial governors as a way of satisfying the ambitions of a proliferating royalty who had little to do, it was hoped that their loyalty would be assured. Unfortunately the result, on the contrary, was the growth of a state system characterized by a tendency to territorial shedding off as well as to a kingdom with peripheral <italic>foci.</italic> Indeed, some of the Ababiito governors took advantage of a weak Omukama to seize authority traditionally belonging to the central government. They did so to ensure that their descendants would not be relegated to the detested status of Ababiito Kwonka. We learn, for example, that Nyamutukura (1786–1835), a peace-loving man and a cattle man at heart who could best be described as a macro-manager, distributed territorial administration among some of his 14 recorded children: six received governorships, while a daughter, the lady Nyinamwiru, was also given a territory to administer. Because the king refused to retire, even in his dotage, an ambitious prince, Karasuma, his fifth son, attempted to overthrow him but was tricked by his father and killed. His province of Bugungu knew no peace from that date, however.</p>
<p>The king’s first and favorite son, Kaboyo, fared better. He did not attempt to overthrow his father: he simply excised his large and rich province of Tooro from Bunyoro-Kitara and was installed Omukama in his own right. His father made no serious attempt to reduce him to obedience. Thus did Tooro become an independent kingdom. This was a disastrous loss because it cut Bunyoro-Kitara’s access to the trade routes running to the east and the coast. It also contained the profitable salt deposits at Katwe and Kibiro<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0021909611432094">15</xref></sup> and the rich grazing lands. Thus the loss of Tooro adversely affected Bunyoro-Kitara’s economy and seriously compromised its security.</p>
<p>Events in Tooro appeared to have emboldened the Paluo princes of the north, namely, Isagara Katiritiri (provincial governor of Kihukya) and Kachope (provincial governor of Kibanda), the king’s third and fourth sons respectively, to declare their independence. Their father also simply ignored their rebellion because in his opinion what was his belonged to his children and what belonged to his children also belonged to him. He killed Karasuma only because he plotted to overthrow him. The loss of the vast northern provinces further diminished the kingdom’s territorial extent. When the king died in 1835 of natural causes his kingdom was greatly diminished in size, wealth and power. Incredibly, some princes were persuaded, to no avail, to take over the throne of Bunyoro-Kitara. Kaboyo, comfortably settled in his Tooro kingdom, refused to succeed his father; the Paluo princes had no wish to rule over what they described as fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1973</xref>: 66). The eventual accession of Nyabongo II (1835–48) was therefore uneventful. Like his father Nyabongo cared more about his cattle than about anything else and his reign was inconsequential. The convulsions that occurred during the reigns of Olimi V (1848–52) and Kamurasi (1852–69) led to further disintegration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1973b</xref>: 66–7).</p>
<p>What about the aristocracy? The Omukama of Bunyoro-Kitara was, in fact, not the ‘absolute despot’ described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021909611432094">John Roscoe (1923)</xref>. Constitutionally, of course, he had the power of life and death over his subjects, but this power was wisely rarely invoked. On the contrary, he ruled through a hierarchy of territorial administrators who were left with much independent authority. However, the constitutional balance worked out by the early Ababiito did not always endure. ‘[The] decentralization of authority,’ it has been noted<disp-quote>
<p>led to several cases of insubordination and even insurrection which were one of the causes of the decline of Kitara as the major power in lacustrine region of East Africa. During the heyday of chiefly power, some provincial chiefs collaborated for the purpose of invading another province of the kingdom. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1970a</xref>: 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Bunyoro-Kitara was divided into sazas (provinces), each saza being placed under the control of a great chief known by the traditional name of his saza. Under him a hierarchy of subordinate rulers administered smaller territories called ebihinda. The saza chiefs owed allegiance to the Omukama; the subordinate rulers also did so through their respective overlords. The sazas were traditionally hereditary. The monarch usually appointed the administrators as a reward for military valor. By the 18th century, however, it appears that the appointive principle of territorial governance had been largely eroded. Nevertheless, by whatever means they assumed authority the provincial governors were supposed to provide soldiers for the Omukama’s wars as a sign of loyalty. Failure to do so was regarded as rebellion that succeeded or failed depending on the alignment of various forces. Military service brought with it wealth, influence, and a measure of power within the social hierarchy. Sometimes a prince or provincial governor who became militarily powerful assumed the role of the over mighty subject and flouted the king’s authority with impunity. In the reign of Kamurasi, for example, some of the Paluo provinces even invaded what was left of Bunyoro-Kitara and drove Kamurasi out of his kingdom for a while. Kamurasi managed to regroup and drove them out. The second invasion was disastrous for the princes, however, because of the great slaughter at Kokoitwa (1869) in which Prince Nsale, the rebel commander, and practically all the princes lost their lives. The king himself died shortly afterwards after dissipating a lot of energy and resources suppressing rebellions.</p>
<p>His death initiated the second most disastrous civil war in the kingdom’s history (1869–71). The eventual winner, Chwa II Kabarega (1871–99), owed his victory not to the aristocracy but primarily to his clan relatives as well as to popular support. Kamurasi’s reign also witnessed the rise of chief Namuyonjo, said to be the terror of the Baganda, who pursued an independent policy in the border area of his control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1970a</xref>: 2). The provincial administrators were the backbone of the kingdom’s military power. This power was based on the system of obwesengeze (provincial armies) which were under their direct control. Their main duty was the protection of their aristocratic overlords. This made the lords potentially very dangerous. They were, in reality, private companies when mobilized, who owed allegiance to the king but through their respective lords. A hostile combination of them could easily overwhelm the king’s own bodyguard as happened in the case of Kamurasi and the Paluo princes. The king, therefore, required the provincial administrators to maintain residences near the palace and to attend court regularly. If any governor, for any reason, wished to leave the capital he was required to leave behind a deputy who assumed all his titles and functions. This was designed as a check to sedition, but it did not always work, especially as provincial governors who were also princes usually led the rebellions. The successful king was one who managed by one device or the other to exercise effective power over the lords. This the abakama could not do successfully from about 1710–1869. It is significant that eight out of 13 recorded instances of rebellion and civil war occurred during this relatively short period. Only Olimi III (c. 1710–30) and Duhaga I (c. 1731–82) out of seven abakama who ruled during that period were regarded as effective and strong kings. The conclusion, then, is that Bunyoro-Kitara did not necessarily decline because of the inherent weaknesses of the mechanism of power transfer but, to a large extent, because of the weakness of the abakama from the second half of the 18th century to the first half of the 19th century.</p>

<title>Territorial Expansion</title>
<p>Did Bunyoro-Kitara decline primarily because of the ambition and aggression of the Ababiito for territorial aggrandizement? A careful reading of the available information does not support this interpretation either. The early Ababiito at no time sought extra-territorial responsibilities in nuclear Buganda, for example, as is generally claimed after the consolidation of their conquest. Three reasons may have accounted for this. First, the Ababiito did not regard Buganda as an enemy state presumably because they believed, rightly or wrongly, that Kato Kimera, Kabaka of Buganda, was the younger twin brother (hence the name Kato) of Rukidi, Omukama of Bunyoro-Kitara. Second, nuclear Buganda comprised only the counties of Kyaddodondo, Mawokota, Busiro, Busujju, and small enclaves of southern Bulemeezi and Ssingo counties, all encompassed within a 25-mile radius from Kampala. There was therefore nothing particularly attractive about annexing it. Third, Buganda possessed no substantial grazing lands and cattle that would have attracted the cupidity of the cattle-loving Ababiito. It was, indeed, Buganda that sought, understandably, every favorable occasion to expand at the expense of Bunyoro-Kitara. It did so not out of hatred of the Ababiito but because it was in dire need of room to expand.</p>
<p>Two of Buganda’s initial attempts to appropriate Bunyoro’s territory were made in the early 16th century. Each ended in defeat and the death of the kabaka. The first campaign, led in person by Winyi I, was an expedition to expel the Baganda who were in occupation of Bwiru (Buddu). Kabaka Kaima lost his life in the encounter and the Baganda were expelled. Winyi’s son and successor, Olimi I, undertook the second campaign for the purpose also not of territory but to expel the Baganda, who had reoccupied Bwiru and seized a part of Bulemeezi. The Baganda were once more beaten and driven out following the bloody battle of Mulago at which Kabaka Nyakibinge lost his life. Once more the Ababiito made no attempt to occupy Buganda, a task at that time they could have accomplished with relative ease. It has been claimed that Buganda was not occupied because Bunyoro’s expeditionary force was too exhausted to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021909611432094">Kiwanuka, 1971</xref>: 60–5). More plausibly, it did not do so because Buganda was not worth the bother because an exhausted army could not have almost immediately invaded and conquered Ankole successfully and with ease, as was the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611432094">Karugire, 1980</xref>: 33). More about Ankole later.</p>
<p>It is curious that a so-called imperially-ambitious kingdom did not invade Buganda again for almost 300 years after the battle of Mulago. Throughout this period it was Buganda that seized the initiative. Inexplicably, the Ababiito chose to ignore Buganda’s expansion northward and eastward. During this period, therefore, Bunyoro-Kitara lost, uncontested, the following territories to Buganda: Mityana (c. 16th century); Butambala and Ggomba (17th century); and most of Ssingo and Kyaggwe, Buddu, and Kooki (18th century); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1973</xref>: 41. No further territory was lost to Buganda until the British conquest. However, by the close of the 18th century it had become clear that Buganda was the strongest power in the lake region. The smaller and vulnerable states began to look to Buganda rather than to Bunyoro-Kitara for protection. The Ababiito did not seem to care. The vast territories lost meant the loss of valuable grazing lands with serious economic consequences. Curiously, also, Buganda did not take advantage of the succession of weak Abakama from Olimi IV (c. 1782–6) to Kamurasi (1852–69), the secessionist movements, and the succession and civil wars to achieve further expansion. Perhaps the Kabakas could not or had no further desire to risk what they had received on a platter of gold by engaging in such adventures.</p>
<p>It was to the south, interestingly, that the Ababiito showed robust interest. What accounted for this? The answer, too, does not lie in their imperial ambitions, as traditional sources claim, but rather in the desire to replenish their stock of cattle. Because of the decentralized nature of the Ankole kingdom at the time, and because it contained by far more cattle than even greater Buganda, the Ababiito may have felt that Ankole was more useful to them than Buganda and could be dealt with more easily as well. If this was their thinking, they were apparently proved right. Olimi I, the so-called ‘scourge of nations,’ left Bwiru immediately, as we saw, after defeating the Baganda and invaded Ankole, conquered it with ease and held it for several years. We are informed that the <italic>eclipsis solaris</italic> that caused fear and panic among the people forced him to withdraw from Ankole. This eclipse has been dated to 1520 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021909611432094">Gray, 1968</xref>). Bunyoro tradition states that the Banyoro so denuded Ankole of cattle during their withdrawal that famine ravaged the kingdom after their departure. Ntare I was Omugabe (king) of Ankole at the time, a fact also confirmed by Ankole tradition. By defeating Buganda and Ankole in succession there was no doubt what state was the premier power in the lake region in the 16th century. The defeat did increase the resolve of the defeated kingdoms to fortify themselves against future humiliation.</p>
<p>The second invasion of Ankole took place in the early 18th century. This invasion was led by Omukama Chwa I, praised as ‘the true Chwa [cutter], the scourge of the cows of Nkore.’ He led the campaign in person to replenish his stock of cattle which had been decimated by cattle epidemic (kyeyo). Ankole was once more easily defeated. Its symbol of statehood, the royal drum, was captured. Ntare IV (c. 1699–1727) was Omugabe of Ankole. Chwa I, known as Cwamali in Ankole tradition, occupied Ankole for about four years. Karugire wrote: ‘The occupation seems to have been leisurely accomplished since the Banyoro took time off to make extensive water wells to ensure their supplies of water. These water wells are still identifiable today’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611432094">Karugire, 1980</xref>: 41). Ankole, apparently, could not mount any credible counter-offensive. Thus emboldened, Cwamali invaded Rwanda, again not for territory but for more cattle. The invasion was successful. Cwamali occupied Rwanda for about four years and used it as a center for cattle raiding expeditions. It is claimed that he raided as far away as Lake Kivu. Regarding this episode HF Morris wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>Cwamali occupied the country for several years and then went on to conquer Rwanda. Here, however, the Banyoro over-reached themselves. Cwamali was defeated and killed and his army, retreating through Kaarokarungi [Nkore], was set upon by Ntare and slaughtered, Ntare, thus earning the name of Kiitabanyoro [killer of Banyoro]. Cwamali’s mother when she heard the news is said to have cried, ‘Ebi shii Ente za kaaro zankora omunda’ [‘The cows of Kaaro have broken my heart’]. Thus did Kaaro get the name of Nkore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021909611432094">Morris, 2008</xref>: 10–11).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Apparently Ntare, who had been in hiding all those years, had emerged to rally his people. Thus it was Ankole who initiated the third conflict between Bunyoro-Kitara and Ankole. It occurred because the Banyankole, short of grazing land, were forced to pasture their cattle in Kyaka without Olimi III Isansa’s (c.1710–30) permission. Olimi III had no choice but to invade Ankole. That he was able to do so successfully, occupy Ankole’s capital, and proceed to Rwanda and Ihangiro not long after the disaster that befell Cwamali is clear evidence that Bunyoro-Kitara was still a force to be reckoned with in the lake region during the first third of the 18th century.</p>
<p>However, having lost extensive grazing lands to Buganda without a contest and eventually driven out of Rwanda and Ankole, the Ababiito were confronted with internal problems. The disappearance of Cwamali’s son, Winyi, during the occupation of Ankole and Rwanda meant that Bunyoro-Kitara was left leaderless at the center. The king’s apparent neglect of his core territories during the several years he was away is, frankly, difficult to comprehend. Not surprisingly his treatment of his kingdom with benign neglect paved the way for the regency of the lady Mashamba, daughter of Winyi II. When Winyi suddenly reappeared on the scene a major crisis arose. Mashamba’s plot, in collusion with a few of the elders, to eliminate the prince was leaked. Winyi’s supporters moved swiftly and assassinated Mashamba. Winyi was raised to the Omukamaship and given the royal name of Kyebambe I Omuzikya. Unlike his father he attempted no foreign adventures; he did not even bother to take advantage of the civil conflict in Buganda between the supporters of Kabaka Juko and those of Kyebambe. His son and successor Winyi III, was more interested in long distance running and hunting than in territorial expansion. Winyi’s son and successor, Nyaika I, ruled for only two years before he was overthrown and killed by his brother Kyebambe II Bikaju. He, too, did not rule for long. It was during his reign that Buganda excised Kyaigwe (Kyaggwe) from his kingdom, a development he ignored. Seriously wounded in a surprise attack by his wife’s lover, who was also his uncle, he followed tradition, took poison and died. His son and successor Olimi III not only avenged his death but also practically liquidated members of the Abasaiga clan to which the attacker, Katenga, belonged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1973</xref>: 72–84).</p>

<title>British Conquest of Uganda</title>
<p>To many Banyoro British imperialism was essentially responsible for the decline and fall of Bunyoro-Kitara. This belief, although understandable, is of course not totally true. As we saw, by 1871, Buganda had become the premier power in the lake region. Bunyoro-Kitara was already in decline but it had not fallen. It remained perhaps the second strongest power in the region. The change of fortunes had nothing to do with British imperialism. However, that Britain was responsible for the fall of Bunyoro-Kitara as, indeed, it was for that of the other kingdoms, is historical fact.</p>
<p>Before the British conquest of Uganda, Kabarega was in the process of reviving the fortunes of Bunyoro-Kitara (for details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1970b</xref>: 5–21; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909611432094">Doyle, 2006</xref>: 42–61; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021909611432094">Ikime, 1974</xref>: 87–103; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611432094">Low, 2009</xref>). Building from the foundations he inherited he had professionalized his country’s military by forming a standing army that he called the Abarusura, thus eroding the military power of the aristocracy and ambitious princes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1970c</xref>: 1–29). According to Gaetano Casati, who was held prisoner at Kabarega’s court, stripped naked and tied to a tree:<disp-quote>
<p>… the power of banasura [sic] in the government was assured. The owners of the land were deprived of every customary right, and the king was happy in exclaiming, ‘I reign alone, since my ministers are the low and the weak.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909611432094">Casati, 1891</xref>: 272)</p>
<p>Strengthened by new weapons, and surrounded by hundreds of fusiliers, he [Kabarega] felt convinced that he was the most powerful monarch in the world. His heroes saluted him with blank cartridges, and he meditated distant conquests, commanded numerous raids for slaves and cattle, challenged the once feared [B] Uganda warriors, and assumed the right of arbitrator amongst the tribes of lake district … The military party became preponderant in [B] Unyoro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909611432094">Casati, 1891</xref>: 272–3).</p>

<p>This was indeed a revolutionary development, the consequences of which have been studied in detail (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1970c</xref>: 1–29). With this new force Kabarega: reconquered Tooro by 1876 but pockets of resistance continued until the British intervention; effectively occupied Busongora, Bukonjo, Bwamba, Bubira, and Mboga;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0021909611432094">16</xref></sup> and terrorized Ankole, Rwanda, and Karagwe from the abarasura’s stronghold in Katwe (the center of the rich salt mines) until they were dislodged by Henry Stanley during his return march from the Emin Pasha relief expedition, to the general relief of the people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0021909611432094">17</xref></sup> Kabarega was also able to muster between 8,000 and 10,000 Abarusura against Stanley while he was crossing the Kafo river during his so-called journey across Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909611432094">Dunbar, 1965</xref>: 11). He defeated Buganda at the ferocious battle of Kisiki (Rwengabi) in 1886. According to Emin Pasha the Baganda ‘got a thrashing’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0021909611432094">18</xref></sup> in that encounter.</p>
<p>Kabarega commanded his troops in person. He also intervened in Buganda’s civil war in support of the cause of the Muslim prince Kalema. His army occupied Buganda’s capital briefly but was later chased out when the supporters of Mwanga regrouped and counter attacked.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0021909611432094">19</xref></sup> Clearly by 1886 Bunyoro-Kitara posed a real threat to Buganda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021909611432094">Colvile, 1895</xref>: 70; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021909611432094">Oliver and Mathew, 1963</xref>: 329–30). Col. Henry Colvile, indeed, informed the British government that Kabarega was holding some 20,000 Baganda in slavery. He had stated earlier that in the 1890s the Abarusura invaded Busoga, ‘a state owing allegiance to [B] Uganda.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0021909611432094">20</xref></sup> And to the northward, Kabarega exacted tribute from the Alur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021909611432094">Schweinfurth et al., 1888</xref>: 15, 118; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1970a</xref>: 69–77), and exercised some influence in Acholi.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0021909611432094">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Relationships between Bunyoro-Kitara and the states of northern Uganda were for the most part cordial, even among states such as Lango and Teso that had no dynastic connection with Bunyoro-Kitara. For some reason the peoples of northern Uganda had an exaggerated sense of the power and importance of Bunyoro-Kitara. Kabarega made sure that he did not alienate them, however (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1970a</xref>).</p>
<p>Under Kabarega, then, Bunyoro-Kitara became a centralized state. There were no rebellions; the state enjoyed relative peace and stability. But these achievements were to be jeopardized by the Anglo-Buganda coalition against him in the 1890s. By this time the British authorities had been effectively schooled by Baganda and British travelers to regard Bunyoro-Kitara, with some justification, as an enemy state, and an obstacle to Britain’s imperial interests in the lake region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909611432094">Doyle, 2006</xref>: 6, 61–92). Thus in 1891, when Kabarega was at the height of his power, FD Lugard invaded Tooro unexpectedly, drove out the Abarusura, and restored the independence of the Tooro kingdom. He rebuffed Kabarega’s request for negotiation. In 1893, the Tooro garrison was withdrawn. Kabarega promptly reoccupied the country. In the following year, unfortunately for him, Britain proclaimed Uganda a British protectorate and decided on the total subjugation of Bunyoro-Kitara. ‘To free Tooro from Bunyoro’s depredations’ that had lasted ‘five years,’ Britain established under its ‘control a ‘Tooro Confederacy’ made up of ‘Tooro Proper’ and several of its smaller related neighbors.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0021909611432094">22</xref></sup> That task was entrusted to Henry Colvile.</p>
<p>By 1894 Kabarega had been chased out of his capital by the Anglo-Buganda coalition. He fled to the friendly confines of northern Uganda from where he conducted a protracted guerilla war. An official British report lamented: ‘Bunyoro … tied down the bulk of the protectorate’s forces for many years … It was largely because of the government’s pre-occupation with Kabarega in the past that pacification of the Eastern Province [of Kenya] had been deferred’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021909611432094">Matson, 1972</xref>: 239). Finally Kabarega was hunted down and captured in the swamps of a village in Lango in 1899. He was exiled to the Seychelles where he remained until his death in 1923 on his way back to his kingdom but as ‘Mr John Kabarega, private citizen.’ Exile did not mitigate his anti-British feelings. He blamed the British for the woes of his people and for raising the Baganda above them. He requested that his burial place at the royal village of Mparo should not be covered with any European-type roofing. Today an imposing grass structure protects his grave (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1970b</xref>: 5–21; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909611432094">Dunbar, 1965</xref>).</p>
<p>Already in 1894, Colvile, acting independent of Downing Street, had presumably decided arbitrarily that the river Kafo was the natural boundary between Bunyoro-Kitara and Buganda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021909611432094">Colvile, 1895</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611432094">Molson, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021909611432094">Roberts, 1962</xref>). Military considerations may have dictated his action<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0021909611432094">23</xref></sup> but Banyoro saw the action as a reward to his Baganda collaborators. In 1896 Lord Salisbury, British prime minister and foreign secretary, ratified Colvile’s action, arguing that, since Uganda had become a British protectorate, these ‘international’ boundaries no longer made sense.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0021909611432094">24</xref></sup> ‘This decision is particularly important,’ it has been pointed out ‘because the struggle for the return of the “Lost Countries” [of Bunyoro] was the primary theme of Nyoro-Ganda relations for over half a century. It was a relationship marked by hatred and bad neighborliness. It also made Banyoro reconciliation to the new imperial domination particularly difficult’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1973</xref>: xv; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611432094">Molson, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1970c</xref>: ‘The Kyanyanguire 1907’, 30–66; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe, 1982</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In 1879, on the eve of the British conquest of Uganda, the population of Bunyoro-Kitara was estimated to be 2,500,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021909611432094">Felkin, 1971</xref>: 47). Frederick Lugard accepted this figure in 1892. Lugard, who had no love for Bunyoro-Kitara, was nonetheless convinced that Banyoro outnumbered Baganda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021909611432094">Lugard, 1892</xref>: 432). The official Guide Book for East Africa published in 1893 also accepted the 1879 estimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021909611432094">Langlands, 1971</xref>: 48). And JW Gregory also estimated that the kingdom’s population was reduced fourfold as a result of the devastation it suffered during the 19th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021909611432094">Langlands, 1971</xref>: 48; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611432094">Low, 2009</xref>: 335). It is, of course, difficult to say how reliable these figures are. All that we can conclude from available evidence is that the population of Bunyoro-Kitara had much diminished by the close of the 19th century. Today, Bunyoro-Kitara is one of the smallest administrate districts of Uganda. The provisional results of the 1969 census – that is, a century later – put the population at only 348,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021909611432094">Langlands, 1971</xref>: 48). Assuming that the 1879 figure included Tooro, the calculation may not be as wide of the mark as it seems at first blush. However one may look at it, the decline by 1969 was drastic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0021909611432094">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is, therefore, surprising that historians of Uganda have been chastised for being ‘obsessed with Bunyoro’s decline being one of the major, if not the major, development of this region’s history during the 19th century’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611432094">Karugire, 1980</xref>: 46). The writer proceeds to argue that the decline by 1900 has been exaggerated and that Kabarega’s role in revitalizing Bunyoro-Kitara has also been overstated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0021909611432094">26</xref></sup> This article has, hopefully, demonstrated that Bunyoro-Kitara suffered severe decline and diminishment in territorial size, power, population, and influence between the 18th and 19th centuries and that the quantum of evidence provided refute the charge of exaggeration and overstatement. Several factors, in conclusion, accounted for this development. The most significant of these factors were: (1) the inexplicable errors of judgment made by many of the Ababiito kings; (2) the weakness or incompetence of the kings who reigned between c. 1782 and 1869; (3) the cantankerous disposition of the ruling clan itself; (4) the ability of Baganda leaders to take advantage of these factors to expand their small kingdom, for the most part uncontested, at Bunyoro-Kitara’s expense; (5) British conquest of the kingdom, in alliance with Buganda, that led to more territorial loss; and (6) negative environmental factors associated with the barbarity of the conquest, especially ‘famine, disease and demographic collapse’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909611432094">Doyle, 2006</xref>: 85).</p>
<p>Britain’s role in the fall of Bunyoro-Kitara was, indeed, crucial. Between 1871 and 1899 the kingdom experienced a remarkable revival under Kabarega to the point of Bunyoro becoming a credible threat to Buganda before the British intervention. It was this intervention predicated, quite correctly, on the belief that Kabarega was decidedly an enemy of British imperialism that finally led to the fall of his kingdom and the emphatic diminishment of Bunyoro-Kitrara.</p>

Before the 19th century the present Bunyoro was just an outlying province of what 19th century writers called the ‘Wakitara Empire.’ Bunyoro was a nickname the Baganda used as a derogatory term for those they considered inferior foreigners who lived directly north of them. Bunyoro-Kitara, too, is a 20th century invention by Banyoro leaders as a remembrance of the ‘great empire’ that they believed the Abachwezi made famous but which, somehow, the Ababiito managed to lose.

<p>The Ababiito’s claim to have presided over such a large and complex empire, a claim that historians and other scholars rightly dispute, is obviously an exaggeration that critics have failed to comprehend in its historical context; that is, a deliberate claim intended by Banyoro nationalists as a counterweight to equally spurious claims by Baganda nationalists. For some of these critics see Chretien (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611432094">2006</xref>: 103–5) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021909611432094">Kiwanuka (1968)</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0021909611432094">Wrigley (1958)</xref>. It is interesting, however, to note that many years ago, when I played devil’s advocate, as it were, and disputed some of these claims (with regard to Tooro especially) a respected Munyoro traditional historian asked me rhetorically and revealingly: ‘when the louse crawls from the hair to the beard, has it strayed?’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021909611432094">Uzoigwe 1973b</xref>: 66).</p></fn>

Kabaka Mutesa had helped Kabarega win the succession war in the 1870s and Kabarega was grateful for that. However, worried about the increasing power of Bunyoro in the 1880s, Buganda began to raid Bunyoro vigorosly, as well as allied with Tooro and the British againgst Kabarega. Kabarega retaliated by vowing to destroy Kabaka Mwanga, Muteesa’s successor. By the late 1890s both were forced, in their own interests, to join together in the fight against the British intruders. Both, too, were defeated and removed from power.</p></fn>
