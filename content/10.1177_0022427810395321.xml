<abstract>
<p>Although recent corporate crime studies have made important advances by investigating how individuals decide to offend, they have paid limited attention to a corporation’s organizational structures. Yet, the extant organizational studies have generated inconclusive evidence when assessing the relationship between financial performance and corporate crime, and few studies have combined organizational and industrial factors in models of corporate crime. Building on strain and opportunity theories and prior research, the authors develop hypotheses about the direct and interactive effects of corporation- and industry-level strains and opportunity structures. The authors test these hypotheses using Clinard and Yeager’s <italic>Illegal Corporate Behavior</italic> data. In short, the results indicate that the effect of corporation-level strain is more pronounced for corporations marked by lower levels of diversification and corporations that operate in industries experiencing higher levels of strain. The authors discuss the implications of the findings for theory, research, and policy.</p>

<p>Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022427810395321">Sutherland’s (1949)</xref> initial study, corporate crime has garnered considerable research attention. Criminologists have been interested in whether theories originally developed to explain street crime also apply to illegal corporate behavior. The bulk of these studies have focused on individual-level decision making, and theories previously tested include rational choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022427810395321">Paternoster and Simpson 1996</xref>), self-control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022427810395321">Benson and Moore 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022427810395321">Simpson and Piquero 2002</xref>), and recently, control balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022427810395321">Piquero and Piquero 2006</xref>). Using vignette surveys, these studies have advanced scholarship on how individuals decide to commit corporate crime. In doing so, some have manipulated corporation- and industry-level factors that may contribute to illegal corporate behavior. Notably, however, these studies have paid limited attention to a corporation’s organizational structures. First, most vignette surveys have only included one dimension of economic performance such as declining sales versus growing sales (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022427810395321">Paternoster and Simpson 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022427810395321">Simpson and Piquero 2002</xref>). In contrast, organizational theorists have documented that multiple measures of financial distress may be in play and have called for research that extends beyond a simple measure of financial performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427810395321">Alexander and Cohen 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427810395321">Baucus 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022427810395321">Hill et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022427810395321">Keane 1993</xref>). Second, when controlling and manipulating organizational characteristics in vignettes, researchers have tested only for main effects, which runs counter to most conceptual models of corporate crime that are “complex and interactive” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427810395321">McKendall and Wagner 1997</xref>:625; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427810395321">Baucus 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Drawing on organizational theory, others have largely focused on identifying whether corporation-level financial performance or other characteristics are consequential for corporate crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427810395321">Alexander and Cohen 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427810395321">Baucus 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022427810395321">Baucus and Near 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427810395321">Clinard and Yeager 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022427810395321">Hill et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427810395321">McKendall and Wagner 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022427810395321">Simpson 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022427810395321">Simpson and Koper 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022427810395321">Staw and Szwajkowski 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022427810395321">Stretesky 2006</xref>). Although such research has identified some structural factors, a number of questions and issues remain to be addressed. For instance, the research to date provides mixed evidence regarding the association between corporation- and industry-level financial performance and corporate crime, with some finding a negative association and some finding none. In addition, with the exception of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427810395321">McKendall and Wagner (1997)</xref>, the extant studies have only considered the main effects of organizational characteristics, with little attention paid to interactive effects. This inattention is notable because corporate illegality may arise from the combined effects of variables that provide motive and opportunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427810395321">Baucus 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427810395321">McKendall and Wagner 1997</xref>), and a number of scholars have called for research to assess the interaction between corporation-level characteristics and a corporation’s environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427810395321">Baucus 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022427810395321">Simpson and Koper 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, we examine how corporation- and industry-level factors, directly and interactively, influence illegal corporate behavior. In so doing, we heed calls to study organizations and account for contextual influences on corporate offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022427810395321">Coleman 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022427810395321">Gross 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022427810395321">Reiss 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022427810395321">Simpson 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022427810395321">Vaughan 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022427810395321">2002</xref>) and calls to investigate the interactive effects between corporation- and industry-level factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427810395321">Baucus 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427810395321">McKendall and Wagner 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022427810395321">Simpson and Koper 1997</xref>). Specifically, we organize our analyses within the strain and opportunity theory framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022427810395321">Cloward and Ohlin 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022427810395321">Merton 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022427810395321">Passas 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022427810395321">Vaughan 1983</xref>). Of particular interest is how corporation- and industry-level strains are consequential for corporate crime and whether strain has differential effects in corporations and industries that present different opportunity structures for crime. This research could potentially provide evidence for a more complex model of corporate illegality than has been examined to date. This research also addresses two significant gaps in general tests of strain theory. First, with a few exceptions, tests of strain theory have almost exclusively focused on street crime. Second, although theorists have incorporated the opportunity component into strain theory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022427810395321">Cloward and Ohlin 1960</xref>), this component has not been fully explored.</p>
<p>Toward this end, we use data originally collected by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427810395321">Clinard and Yeager (1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427810395321">2006</xref>) on 461 of the largest publicly owned manufacturing corporations in the United States. Their research remains one of the most influential studies of corporate crime. However, the original analyses primarily examined the direct effects of corporation- and industry-level characteristics, with little attention to their interactive effects. In addition, their original study was restricted to statistical techniques available prior to the development of more sophisticated, data analytic strategies that more appropriately take into account the effect of organizational context on offending. Below we review the extant corporate crime literature on strain and opportunity theories. We then develop a series of hypotheses that build on prior theory and research. After describing the data and methods, we present the findings and conclude by discussing the study’s implications for theory, research, and policy.</p>
<sec id="section1-0022427810395321">
<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>Consistent with prior research, we conceptualize corporate crime as “a conduct of a corporation, or of employees acting on behalf of a corporation, which is proscribed and punishable by law” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427810395321">Braithwaite 1984</xref>:6; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022427810395321">Simpson 2002</xref>). Thus, corporate crime not only includes acts in violation of criminal law but civil and administrative violations as well. Using strain and opportunity theories, we argue that corporation- and industry-level strains and opportunity structures increase corporate crime by increasing the motivation (strain) of corporations to commit crime and by increasing the opportunities in these corporations and industries for them to do so (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427810395321">McKendall and Wagner 1997</xref>). We suspect that corporation- and industry-level strain and opportunity can generate increased corporate crime in a diffuse manner through effects on employees in general or in a centralized manner through effects on executive-level administrative decision making. In the former instance, individuals within certain corporations are individually motivated, by force of corporate context, to engage in corporate crime. In the latter instance, corporations exert force from the highest levels (e.g., CEOs) to systematically commit corporate crime; in this instance, crime is clearly more willful and stems from a centralized operation within the organization. That said, it is beyond the scope of this study to investigate which mechanism is at work.</p>
<sec id="section2-0022427810395321">
<title>Strain and Corporate Crime</title>
<p>Traditional strain theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022427810395321">Cloward and Ohlin 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427810395321">Cohen 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022427810395321">Merton 1938</xref>) posits that individuals are pressured into crime when they are prevented from achieving cultural goals like monetary success or middle-class status through legitimate means. In particular, Merton originally formulated strain theory to account for aggregate patterns of crime by arguing that societal strain results from a cultural emphasis on material success when structural arrangements often preclude some people from access to legitimate means to achieve this goal. This goal blockage may pressure some to pursue their goal through illegitimate means (e.g., crime). A number of studies have tested this theory by examining the association between goal blockage and deviance among individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427810395321">Agnew et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022427810395321">Hirschi 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022427810395321">Kornhauser 1978</xref>) and have generated valuable knowledge about how individual-level strain operates in a street crime context.</p>
<p>However, with a few exceptions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022427810395321">Keane 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022427810395321">Simpson and Koper 1997</xref>), these theoretical tests have focused almost exclusively on traditional street crime (e.g., violence). One outcome that remains relatively unexplored is corporate crime. This oversight is significant because the goal of financial success has been heavily emphasized in the corporate world. For example, it is stressed, “without financial success, corporate survival is unlikely” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022427810395321">Simpson and Koper 1997</xref>:375; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022427810395321">Vaughan 1983</xref>). For that reason, scholars have theoretically outlined the applicability of strain in a corporate crime context. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022427810395321">Passas (1990)</xref>, for example, has highlighted that profit maximization is the vital objective for corporations, a cultural prescription that is likely to be passed on to those who work in and for corporations. As a result, those members are required by their business ethics to be committed to this goal. Moreover, in contrast to this heavy emphasis on profit maximization, there is less emphasis on legitimate means, and it is often reinforced that this goal may have to be achieved by all means. When legitimate market manipulation fails, corporations may resort to illegal activities. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022427810395321">Vaughan (1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022427810395321">1992</xref>) argued that growth pressures, blocked goal attainment, and resource access would increase the likelihood of organizational innovation manifested as corporate crime (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022427810395321">Keane 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427810395321">McKendall and Wagner 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022427810395321">Simpson and Koper 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, all public corporations are subjected to the ultimate goal of profit maximization and the competitive pressures for scarce resources, regardless of their rank in the stratification system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022427810395321">Boies 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022427810395321">Gross 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022427810395321">Simpson and Koper 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022427810395321">Vaughan 2002</xref>). All corporations are subjected to pressure to increase profits, and this growth pressure is not restricted to marginal or failing ones. In turn, those that cannot sustain rapid growth through legitimate means may be pressured to “reverse its declining performance and/or stabilize long-term profit and growth prospects” through illegal means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022427810395321">Simpson 1986</xref>:861; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427810395321">Alexander and Cohen 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, strain may operate at the industry level as intimated by strain theory and prior research. The varying demand for profit produces different levels of strain across industries, which may influence corporations that operate within each industry. In other words, the goal of financial success and profit maximization may be more heavily emphasized in some industries, such as oil, automobile, and pharmaceutical industries, than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427810395321">Clinard and Yeager 2006</xref>). In contrast, legitimate means and opportunities for corporations within those industries may be limited, due to “common constraints and sources of uncertainty” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427810395321">Clinard and Yeager 2006</xref>:52-53). Therefore, when an industry declines because of conditions of environmental constraints and industry-wide problems, such as “poor demand for a given class of products, shortage of raw materials, or widespread strikes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022427810395321">Staw and Szwajkowski 1975</xref>:351), the future performance of all corporations in such an industry may be questionable, resulting in illegal actions as a means to procure additional and limited resources. In turn, corporate crime may increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427810395321">McKendall and Wagner 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022427810395321">Simpson 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022427810395321">Staw and Szwajkowski 1975</xref>). Further, failing corporations operating in declining industries may experience more strain than their counterparts in growing industries and are therefore more likely to take illegal actions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427810395321">Baucus 1994</xref>). Thus, operating in a munificent environment and a rapidly growing industry could potentially lessen performance pressure on a failing corporation, whereas operating in a scarce environment and a declining industry could increase the pressure, thus producing even more violations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022427810395321">Simpson and Piquero 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Opportunity Structures and Corporate Crime</title>
<p>Building upon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022427810395321">Merton’s (1938)</xref> strain theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022427810395321">Cloward and Ohlin (1960)</xref> have argued that strained individuals are unlikely to engage in crime unless illegitimate opportunities are available. As such, opportunity structures condition the relationship between strain and illegality, and the strength of the relationship should be greater as the availability of illegitimate opportunities increases. In the absence of such illegitimate opportunity structures, strain is likely to be channeled into other (i.e., noncriminal) responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022427810395321">Cullen 1984</xref>). Previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427810395321">Cloward (1959)</xref> identified two key mechanisms of opportunity structures—that is, learning and situations conducive to carrying out criminal roles. Yet, tests of strain theory have not fully explored whether strain is differentially associated with offending across opportunity structures, specifically across the two key mechanisms of opportunity structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022427810395321">Cullen 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427810395321">1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022427810395321">Cullen and Wright 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022427810395321">Hoffmann and Ireland 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The logic of opportunity theory has been applied to organizations as well. In their detailed discussion of opportunity and its role in facilitating corporate crime, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427810395321">McKendall and Wagner (1997</xref>:626) described that “the opportunity to engage in corporate illegality arises when the conditions needed to carry out illegal acts are present and when individuals and groups can break laws and expect, with reasonable confidence, to avoid detection or significant retribution” (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427810395321">Baucus 1994</xref>). In the meantime, scholars have asserted that opportunities must be available for strained corporations to commit corporate crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022427810395321">Simpson and Koper 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022427810395321">Vaughan 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Because not all strained corporations take illegal actions and some industries are more tolerant of illegality, a more precise conceptualization of opportunity structures should consider both corporation- and industry-level opportunities. First, we identify situations conducive to carrying out criminal roles within the organizational structure of a corporation. Research on opportunity and corporate crime has identified structural complexity as characteristics that will provide opportunities conducive to corporate crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427810395321">Baucus 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427810395321">McKendall and Wagner 1997</xref>). Specifically, enhanced complexity creates problems of communication, coordination, and control, thus offering more opportunities for violations and providing greater protection from discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022427810395321">Vaughan 1983</xref>, 1996).</p>
<p>Next, we locate the second mechanism of opportunity structures—learning—within the industry where the corporation operates. In particular, industry may influence corporate crime by promoting a subculture of corporate illegality that provides learning opportunities for corporations operating within them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427810395321">Baucus 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022427810395321">Farberman 1975</xref>). Corporations within an industry may “learn the necessary values, motives, rationalizations, and techniques favorable to particular kinds of crimes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427810395321">Clinard and Yeager 2006</xref>:61). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022427810395321">Sutherland (1949)</xref> has also suggested that criminal behavior by the corporation and its executives often results from diffusion of illegal practices within an industry (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427810395321">Clinard and Yeager 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427810395321">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022427810395321">Coleman 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022427810395321">Vaughan 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>In short, what is needed are studies of corporate crime within the framework of strain and opportunity theories that (a) examine corporation-level growth trend in different dimensions of financial performance, (b) assess direct and interactive effects of industry-level strain, and (c) investigate how opportunity structures at corporation and industry levels amplify the effect of corporation-level strain. The present study aims to fill these research gaps, and in so doing contributes to corporate crime research, and strain and opportunity theories in general.</p>

<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>Drawing on the discussions above, we develop a series of hypotheses. Our first two hypotheses assess direct effects of corporation- and industry-level strains. We then present the third hypothesis related to the interactive effect of corporation-level strain and opportunity structures. The final two hypotheses investigate whether the association between corporation-level strain and corporate crime is influenced by industry-level strain and opportunity. <list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 1:</italic>
<italic>Corporation-level strain will increase corporate crime</italic>. Given that profitable corporations are also subjected to growth pressure, growth trend—which reflects financial performance over time and long-term economic success—may be more relevant to strain. In the corporate crime literature, however, researchers have typically used various measures of financial performance—which reflect static levels—as an indicator of strain. These studies to date provide divergent findings regarding the association between strain and corporate crime. For example, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022427810395321">Staw and Szwajkowski (1975)</xref> found that the mean return on equity and mean return on sales (ROS) were negatively associated with violations of antitrust laws and the Federal Trade Commission Act between 1968 and 1972 (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022427810395321">Dalton and Kesner 1985</xref>), other scholars have found no evidence of a similar relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022427810395321">Baucus and Near 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022427810395321">Stretesky 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0022427810395321">Williams, Fadil, and Armstrong 2005</xref>). Absent from prior work is the investigation of whether growth trend in financial performance may influence corporate crime. The gap is notable for two reasons. First, strain theory suggests that all corporations experience strain and those that have a decline in their performance may experience more strain. Second, a very small number of studies that examined the association between corporations’ growth trend and corporate illegality have established that low rates of growth lead to illegal corporate behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427810395321">Alexander and Cohen 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022427810395321">Keane 1993</xref>). In this study, we operationalize financial strain using a number of measures that tap into corporations’ decay in financial performance.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 2:</italic>
<italic>Industry-level strain will increase corporate crime</italic>. This hypothesis flows directly from strain theory and the importance of industrial environments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022427810395321">Simpson (1986)</xref>, for example, suggested that industry trends may predict corporation-level illegal behavior separate from or in conjunction with internal forces. Several studies have found that industry-level strain, as measured by financial performance, increases corporate crime (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427810395321">Clinard and Yeager 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427810395321">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427810395321">Jamieson 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022427810395321">Keane 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022427810395321">Simpson 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022427810395321">Staw and Szwajkowski 1975</xref>). However, empirical evidence is mixed. In contrast to findings that poor industry financial performance gives rise to illegal corporate behavior, several studies have documented the opposite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427810395321">Alexander and Cohen 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022427810395321">Baucus and Near 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022427810395321">Stretesky 2006</xref>).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: <italic>The effect of corporation-level strain</italic>
<italic>on corporate crime will be greater in corporations characterized by a higher level of organizational complexity</italic>. We hypothesize that corporation-level opportunity structures, as conceptualized by organizational complexity, will moderate the relationship between corporation-level strain and corporate crime. Previous studies have used size and diversification as proxies for organizational complexity and have assessed their direct effects on corporate crime (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427810395321">Alexander and Cohen 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022427810395321">Baucus and Near 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427810395321">Clinard and Yeager 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427810395321">Cochran and Nigh 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022427810395321">Simpson 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022427810395321">Stretesky 2006</xref>). However, the extant studies have not considered conditioning effects of size and diversification. This is a potentially significant oversight, because the moderating effect of opportunity is central to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022427810395321">Cloward and Ohlin’s (1960)</xref> theoretical arguments and is further suggested by prior corporate crime studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427810395321">Baucus 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427810395321">McKendall and Wagner 1997</xref>). For example, increased diversification may intensify financial pressures and strain within a corporation due to intra-corporation competition among various lines of business for corporate resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427810395321">Clinard and Yeager 2006</xref>). The counterhypothesis, however, is that diversification might reduce financial pressures, thus weakening the effect of corporation-level strain on corporate crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022427810395321">Clinard et al. 1979</xref>). In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022427810395321">Simpson and Koper (1997)</xref> argued that the diversification strategy may spread market vulnerability and risk around, thus reducing potential strain when goals of the corporation are not met in a particular industry.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 4:</italic>
<italic>The effect of corporation-level strain on corporate crime will be greater in financially strained industries</italic>. That is, we anticipate that because corporations experiencing a decline in their performance record have more financial strain, an increase in industry-level strain should exert greater effects for those corporations as compared with rapidly growing corporations. This need—to empirically evaluate whether industrial sources of strain interacts with strain in the corporation to lead to higher levels of offending—has been suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022427810395321">Staw and Szwajkowski (1975)</xref>, who contended that the larger environment may interact with organizational factors to influence the procurement of environmental resources (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427810395321">Baucus 1994</xref>). In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022427810395321">Simpson and Piquero (2002</xref>:515) argued that “location in a munificent environment is apt to lessen performance pressure, while scarcity increases it.” This idea, however, remains largely untested.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 5:</italic>
<italic>The effect of corporation-level strain on corporate crime will be more pronounced in industries where corporate illegality is more prevalent.</italic> Here, again, the question is whether industry-level opportunity, as conceptualized by industry-level prevalence of violations, will intensify the relationship between corporation-level strain and corporate crime. We anticipate that corporations characterized by a decline in their financial performance will be more likely to resort to illegal behavior if they are within an industry in which more corporations take illegal actions.</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>We test our hypotheses using <italic>Illegal Corporate Behavior</italic> data provided by the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). These data include detailed information on corporation and industry characteristics of the 461 largest publicly owned manufacturing corporations operating in 20 industries in the United States. Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes in these data are used to identify the primary industry where a particular corporation operates. These data also reflect all administrative, civil, and criminal actions either initiated or completed by 24 federal agencies during 1975 and 1976. Although comprehensive, these data do not provide complete information on all corporate violations and enforcement actions and probably represent at least a one-third undercount of actual government actions against corporations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427810395321">Clinard and Yeager 1987</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022427810395321">1</xref>
</sup> The violation data thus only provide crude approximations of illegal corporate activities.</p>
<p>Originally, these data contained information on 461 corporations nested in 20 industries. A closer look at these data revealed that three industries had too few corporations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022427810395321">2</xref>

<title>Dependent Variable</title>
<p>Our dependent variable—total violations—is operationalized as the total number of administrative, civil, and criminal legal actions brought against the corporation in 1975 and 1976, excluding those legal actions involving violations known to have occurred in 1973 or before. Prior research has examined such illegal corporate behavior as antitrust violations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022427810395321">Simpson 1986</xref>), OSHA violations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022427810395321">Hill et al. 1992</xref>), and environmental law violations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427810395321">McKendall and Wagner 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022427810395321">Stretesky 2006</xref>). However, given that strain and opportunity are general concepts, they should in fact explain a variety of corporate crime. Accordingly, we incorporate multiple types of violations, including administrative, environmental, financial, labor, manufacturing, and trade. In doing so, we address prior calls for research focusing on multiple forms of corporate crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022427810395321">Keane 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427810395321">McKendall and Wagner 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022427810395321">Table 2</xref>

Researchers have also called for a broader and more refined set of measures in studies of financial performance and corporate crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427810395321">Alexander and Cohen 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427810395321">Baucus 1994</xref>). In this study, we use a set of variables tapping the 5-year growth trend in financial improvement or decline over the period 1971–1975, including growth in return on assets (ROA), growth in return on common equity (ROCE), growth in efficiency, and growth in liquidity, to measure corporation-level financial strain. As demonstrated indicators of financial performance, ROA measures how a corporation is managing its money; ROCE shows the effect of common shares on profitability; efficiency reflects the degree and speed with which a public corporation accurately incorporates market information into its prices; while liquidity indicates a high level of trading activity and permits buying and selling with a minimum amount of price disturbance. In our theoretical framework, these indicators reflect increased financial pressures that, when coupled with reduced legitimate opportunities, increase the likelihood of engaging in corporate crime. These variables were computed as slopes of regression lines, indicated by unstandardized coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427810395321">Clinard and Yeager 1987</xref>). A negative slope indicates declining performance and a positive slope suggests rising performance. In addition, we use industry-level growth in ROCE as a measure of industry-level strain.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022427810395321">3</xref>
</sup> Similarly, this variable was computed as the slope: A positive slope indicates growth and a negative slope reflects decline. In our analyses, we reversed the coding of all the strain measures so that they, representing decay, are coded in the direction hypothesized to increase corporate crime.</p>

<title>Opportunity structures</title>
<p>We operationalize opportunity structures as structural factors that make it possible for violations to occur. Our measure of corporation-level opportunity structures includes two indicators of organizational complexity: size and diversification. Notably, prior research has used the number of employees or assets to reflect size. To achieve a higher level of measurement validity, we entered assets, sales, and the number of employees (all in natural log) into a principal components analysis that resulted in one latent construct (λ = 2.70, factor loadings &gt; .90). We extracted the second opportunity structure—diversification—from four indicators of degree of diversification, number of manufacturing lines, and total number of business lines (λ = 4.17, factor loadings &gt; .80).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022427810395321">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>At the industry level, we propose that an industry provides learning opportunities for corporations nested within. To capture the extent to which each industry violates laws and regulations, we use the prevalence of violations to measure how widespread corporate crime is within the larger industry of <italic>Fortune</italic>
<italic>500</italic> corporations. We calculated the percentage of corporations that had any violation as our industry-level opportunity measure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022427810395321">5</xref>
</sup> Although such a measure indicates regulatory agencies’ patterns of detection and enforcement, it also signals “industry cultures that support wrongdoings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427810395321">Baucus 1994</xref>:712). Thus, this variable is hypothesized to act as a cultural factor making it possible for violations to occur in corporations within a particular industry.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section10-0022427810395321">
<title>Control Variables</title>
<p>The analyses include several control variables. First, we include several measures reflecting the 5-year average performance level for 1971–1975. Prior studies employed the following measures of corporation-level financial performance: ROA, ROCE, ROS, profitability ratio (net income/total assets), liquidity ratio (net working capital/total assets), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022427810395321">Altman’s <italic>Z</italic> (1968)</xref>. Since ROA is similar to the profitability ratio, and ROA is highly correlated with ROS (<italic>r</italic> = .80), we only include ROA, in addition to ROCE, liquidity ratio, and Altman’s <italic>Z</italic>, in our analyses. These variables were coded such that higher scores indicate better financial performance. Ultimately, by operationalizing strain using growth trend (i.e., financial performance over time) and controlling for average financial performance, we attempt to capture the possible disjunction between expectation (average performance) and aspiration (growth trend). Lastly, because corporations with more market power have more legitimate means available to pursue profits, we also control for market power, which indicates the relative ability of a corporation to control market conditions (e.g., prices and supplies), rather than merely react to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427810395321">Clinard and Yeager 2006</xref>). To capture a corporation’s market power, we use the corporation’s relative dominance that measures the size of the corporation relative to the four largest corporations in the industry.</p>

<title>Analytic Strategy</title>
<p>Approximately 10 percent of the cases were missing at least one variable included in this study. To address this issue, we use multiple imputation that has several advantages and is considered to be “one of the most attractive methods for general-purpose handling of missing data in multivariate analysis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427810395321">Allison 2000</xref>:301). Specifically, multiple imputation generates approximately unbiased estimates of all parameters, produces good estimates of standard errors, and can be used with any kind of data and analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427810395321">Allison 2000</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427810395321">Acock 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022427810395321">Brown and Kros 2003</xref>). We performed 10 multiple imputations with Patrick Royston’s Imputation using Chained Equation (ICE) program, which is implemented in STATA (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022427810395321">Horton and Kleinman 2007</xref>). In the multiple imputation process, we followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427810395321">Acock’s (2005</xref>:1026) recommendation and included additional variables besides those used for the subsequent analyses, such as a range of organizational indicators available in the data (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427810395321">Clinard and Yeager 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Our primary objective is to determine whether corporation- and industry-level strains and opportunity structures influence corporate crime. In light of this objective and the hierarchical nature of the data, we use hierarchical modeling techniques, which incorporate a unique random effect into the statistical model for each industry, and produce more robust standard errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022427810395321">Raudenbush and Bryk 2002</xref>). In addition, because corporate crime is operationalized as the number of legal actions, a count measure with a preponderance of 0 counts and a positively skewed distribution, we apply hierarchical Poisson regression models, allowing for overdispersion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022427810395321">Raudenbush and Bryk 2002</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022427810395321">6</xref>
</sup> Because HLM 6.0 supports the analysis for multiply-imputed data sets, we applied hierarchical generalized linear modeling (HGLM) to the imputed data (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427810395321">Raudenbush et al. 2004</xref>) and estimated unit-specific model parameters with robust standard errors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022427810395321">7</xref>
</sup> Since all the corporations have the same observation period windows (1975 and 1976), we used constant exposure.</p>
<p>It bears mention that we standardized all the strain and opportunity structure measures for two reasons. First, standardization allows for clearer interpretations of the direct and interaction effects because the coefficients can be interpreted in terms of standard deviation unit impacts on violation rates. This is important because strains and opportunity structures were originally measured at different scales. For example, strain measures were computed as slopes of regression lines, and corporation diversification was weighted factor scores. Second, every variable is, by standardizing, centered, which is suggested when creating multiplicative interaction terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427810395321">Aiken and West 1991</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The first step in our analyses is to determine whether there is a significant amount of industry-level variation to be explained. We address this question using an HGLM analysis of variance (ANOVA) model that presents the industry-level variance estimates. The results reveal that statistically significant between-industry variation in illegality exists among corporations (χ<sup>2</sup> = 145.71, <italic>df</italic> = 16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p>Next, we estimate a series of hierarchical Poisson regression models to investigate the effects of corporation- and industry-level financial strains and opportunity structures on violations. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022427810395321">Table 3</xref>
 presents the results of the multilevel models. Inspection of model 1 shows that although all four corporation-level strain measures are positively associated with total violations, none emerges as statistically significant. Thus, we find no support for Hypothesis 1. Further review of model 1 also indicates that our industry-level strain measure—that is, industry-level decay in ROCE—is statistically significant and negative. This finding suggests that corporations in rapidly growing industries have higher violation rates than corporations in strained (i.e., financially depressed) industries. This finding thus refutes Hypothesis 2. We discuss this finding in the conclusion.</p>

<p>We now turn to Hypothesis 3 that requires a test for interactions between corporation-level strain and opportunity structure measures. To this end, we added interaction terms between each strain measure and each opportunity structure measure. No statistically significant interaction between any strain measure and size emerged (results not shown). Review of model 2 shows that the product of decay in ROCE and diversification is statistically significant. The negative coefficient for this interaction term suggests that opportunity structure, when measured as diversification, reduces the criminogenic effect of strain on corporate crime. Here, to facilitate discussion on this interaction effect, we graph the predicted violation rates across different values of corporation-level decay in ROCE, setting all the covariates at their means and using three different values for diversification (−1, 0, and 1).<sup>

<p>Inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022427810395321">Figure 1</xref>
 shows that corporation-level strain has differential effects across different levels of diversification. More specifically, corporation-level decay in ROCE has a positive effect on corporate crime when diversification is low (diversification = −1). Within corporations that have a mean level of diversification (0), however, opportunity diminishes the positive effect of strain, and eventually reverses the positive effect of corporation-level strain when diversification is high (diversification = 1). This interaction effect suggests two patterns: First, in less diversified corporations, those characterized by greater financial strain have higher violation rates, thus supporting Hypothesis 1; second, in more diversified corporations, however, corporations experiencing strain have fewer violations. This result suggests that diversification reduces the criminogenic effect of corporation-level strain. This finding is opposite to Hypothesis 3 but consistent with our counterhypothesis; namely, diversification provides a legitimate means to reach desirable financial ends, thus buffering the corporation from strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0022427810395321">Thompson 1967</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We also hypothesized that the effect of corporation-level strain would be more pronounced in industries with higher levels of financial strain (Hypothesis 4). To assess this hypothesis, we included interactions between corporation-level strain and industry-level strain. Review of model 3 shows that statistically significant interactions emerge between industry-level decay in ROCE and two measures of corporation-level strain: decay in ROA and decay in efficiency. Again, to facilitate discussion on these interaction effects, we graph the predicted violation rates across different values of corporation-level strains, including decay in ROA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022427810395321">Figure 2A</xref>) and decay in efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022427810395321">Figure 2B</xref>), setting all the covariates at their means and using three different values for industry-level strain (−1, 0, and 1).</p>

</fig>
<p>Both figures reveal a similar pattern—that is, the criminogenic effect of corporation-level strain is substantially greater when industry-level strain is at one standard deviation above the mean (1) than that when industry-level strain is at the mean (0). In essence and consistent with Hypothesis 4—that is, corporation- and industry-level financial strains will interact to produce greater effects on corporate crime, it appears that in industries that experience more strain, financially strained corporations have higher violation rates than their counterparts in industries that experience less strain. However, when industry-level strain is at one standard deviation below the mean (−1), two indicators of corporation-level strain have negative effects on violation rates. In short, this interaction effect suggests two patterns: First, in financially strained industries, corporations characterized by strain have higher violation rates, thus supporting Hypothesis 4; second, in industries that experience growth, however, corporations experiencing growth have more violations. We return to this finding in the discussion.</p>
<p>Next, we focus on the interaction effect between corporation-level strain measures and industry-level prevalence of violations (model 4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022427810395321">Table 3</xref>). Inspection of this model indicates that there is no evidence that corporations experiencing a decline in financial performance commit more violations in more crime-prone industries; we thus find no support for Hypothesis 5.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>Building on strain and opportunity theories, we examined how corporation-level strain affects corporate crime, directly and interactively with industry-level strain, and whether corporation-level strain interacts with corporation- and industry-level opportunity structures to produce greater effects on corporate crime. The focus on direct and interactive effects of strain and opportunity structures at different levels stems from calls for research to consider multilevel influences on corporate crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022427810395321">Holtfreter 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427810395321">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022427810395321">Piquero and Piquero 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022427810395321">Simpson and Piquero 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022427810395321">Vaughan 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022427810395321">2002</xref>), calls to examine interactions between corporation- and industry-level factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427810395321">Baucus 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427810395321">McKendall and Wagner 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022427810395321">Simpson and Koper 1997</xref>), and calls to assess interactions of opportunity structures with strain in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022427810395321">Cullen 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427810395321">1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022427810395321">Hoffmann and Ireland 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Using data from Clinard and Yeager’s <italic>Illegal Corporate Behavior</italic> data, we tested five hypotheses. We anticipated that increased corporation-level strain would increase corporate crime rates (Hypothesis 1); we expected that increased industry-level strain would increase corporate crime rates (Hypothesis 2); we anticipated that the effect of financial strain would be more pronounced in corporations characterized by a higher level of organizational complexity (Hypothesis 3); and we expected that the effect of corporation-level strain would be more pronounced in industries marked by increased financial strain (Hypothesis 4) and a greater prevalence of violations (Hypothesis 5).</p>
<p>Overall, we found limited support for strain and opportunity theories. With respect to Hypothesis 1, we found no evidence of corporation-level strain on violations. Contrary to Hypothesis 2, we found that corporations in rapidly growing, but not decaying, industries had higher violation rates. Regarding Hypothesis 3, we found that the effect of corporation-level strain was less pronounced in corporations characterized by a higher level of diversification. With respect to Hypothesis 4, we found evidence that financially strained corporations had even higher violation rates in industries experiencing a decline in their financial performance; in addition, we found that corporations experiencing growth in financial performance had higher violation rates in rapidly growing industries. Finally, we found no support for Hypothesis 5 that financially strained corporations had by far higher violation rates in industries characterized by more prevalent corporate illegality.</p>
<p>Before turning to the implications of the study, two anomalous findings warrant discussion. First, corporations in industries experiencing rapid growth in financial performance have higher violation rates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022427810395321">Simpson (1986</xref>:872) suggested that “industry profitability produces its own kind of criminality.” Absent more detailed information about industrial environments and federal agencies’ enforcement actions, we cannot provide a definitive explanation of this finding. We can, however, speculate on what may account for it. The first possible explanation is that when an industry is rapidly growing and the market is expanding for the industry, executives from corporations in the industry may see this industrial growth as an opportunity, which they may seize upon to further grow their own corporations by all means, including illegitimate means (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427810395321">Baucus 1994</xref>). Results from other studies provide some support for this speculation, showing that corporations operating in munificent environments engaged in more illegal acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427810395321">Alexander and Cohen 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022427810395321">Stretesky 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A second possible explanation is that fast growing industries may be highly competitive. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427810395321">Clinard and Yeager (2006</xref>:52) argued, “in highly competitive industries…, firms may feel compelled to engage in such violations as false advertising and bribery to sell their products.” In these industries where markets are expanding and there is potential for corporations’ growth, some violations may be considered as competitive strategies for corporations to survive and prosper; as a result, these violations may be spread rapidly throughout the industry.</p>
<p>A third possible explanation pertains to the operationalization of our dependent variable: the legal actions taken by federal agencies in 1975–1976. This variable may not reflect true corporate offending, but how each industry is regulated and federal agencies’ differential enforcement practices. In the early 1970s, the United States was going through a global economic crisis, including oil shock and the brink of an economic recession in 1975. Given this historical context, we speculate that booming industries’ fast growth may have received considerable attention from federal regulators, which may have resulted in more detections of illegal behavior in corporations in those industries. Therefore, a different regulatory environment may have existed for industries experiencing growth versus those experiencing a decline. In the end, whether any of these three explanations truly accounts for the finding that corporations in rapidly growing industries have more violations requires future theoretical and empirical investigations. That said, operationalizing the outcome by enforcement actions is a common problem in most white-collar and corporate crime research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022427810395321">Simpson 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0022427810395321">Weisburd, Waring, and Chayet 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0022427810395321">Wheeler, Weisburd, and Bode 1982</xref>). Unfortunately, “it [is] necessary to base indicators of corporate wrongdoing on official data regarding the enforcement actions taken by the various federal regulatory agencies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0022427810395321">Yeager 1987</xref>:331). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0022427810395321">Yeager (1987)</xref> further established, a corporation’s violation record is the most important predictor of the number of sanctions it received. Future research should explore how enforcement and true offending are related in the context of corporate crime.</p>
<p>We now turn to the second contrary finding—that is, why do rapidly growing corporations have higher violation rates if they operate in booming industries? This seemingly anomalous finding is to some extent related to the finding previously discussed—that is, corporations in rapidly growing industries have more violations. Indeed, we build our speculations on the potential explanations discussed above. First, an industry’s rapid growth may represent an opportunity for corporations within the industry or fast growing industries may be highly competitive. In addition, munificence may combine with competitive conditions to create opportunities in an industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427810395321">Baucus 1994</xref>). Successful corporations may be more aggressive at accepting industry-based opportunities to maximize profit or to constantly innovate for new methods, including illegal ones, to maintain their rapid growth in the highly competitive environment. Second, if booming industries received extensive attention from federal regulators in the 1970s, fast growing corporations within these industries may have been targeted, thus leading to increased detection of violations. Whether these speculations explain our finding demands future theoretical and empirical examinations.</p>
<p>Several implications emerge from this study’s findings. First, strain and opportunity theories hold some promise for explaining corporate crime. Despite the prominence of strain and opportunity theories as a framework for understanding crime more generally, several key propositions remained unexplored in a corporate crime context. The current study addressed these voids by assessing the conditional role of opportunity structures on the association between strain and crime and by examining interaction effects of strain at different levels. Further, social disorganization/collective efficacy perspectives may provide an alternative explanation to the hypothesized association between corporation-level strain and corporate crime—that is, declining corporations may engage in more corporate crime not because of financial strain but because their low economic standing reduces collective efficacy, which in turn increases corporate crime.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022427810395321">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Second, extending these observations, our findings highlight the need for further theoretical and empirical research on the links between different levels involved in the operation of corporations (e.g., individuals, corporations, and industries). An important direction for future research would be to investigate the extent to which corporation- and industry-level strain and opportunity factors contribute to crime in a diffuse manner through effects on employees in general or in a centralized manner through effects on executives.</p>
<p>Two additional research implications bear mention. First, a corporation’s growth trend, in contrast to static levels of financial performance, may more closely reflect the level of strain, and such effect may be conditioned by the corporation’s structure (e.g., diversification) and its industrial environment (e.g., industry-level growth). This study thus casts into doubt the research practice of using static corporation-level financial performance as a measure of strain and focusing on direct effects only. Future research should explore alternative ways of measuring strain in a corporate crime context. In addition, we measured different dimensions of financial performance over time and found that they have differential interaction effects with opportunity structures and industry-level sources of strain. For example, corporation-level strain, as measured by decay in ROCE, interacted significantly with diversification. Because ROCE indicates that a corporation is spending wisely, this finding suggests that a corporation’s effectiveness at employing capital to generate profits increases sensitivity to diversification. Given that ROA is an ultimate test of managerial effectiveness, and efficiency reflects sales generating ability of corporate assets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427810395321">Clinard and Yeager 2006</xref>), statistically significant interactions between industry-level strain and corporation-level decay in ROA and decay in efficiency may suggest that a corporation’s managerial effectiveness and sales generating ability of corporate assets are dependent on industry-level environment. Further, our measures do not capture all of the opportunity structures that make it possible for violations to occur, and future research ideally should use more refined measures of opportunity structures to explore ways in which corporation- and industry-level opportunity structures may influence corporate crime.</p>
<p>Second, the generalizability of our findings to the twenty-first century Corporate America is an important concern. Since the early 1970s, the regulatory environment has undergone substantial changes. For example, through lobbying, political contributions, and sophisticated public relations campaigns, corporations have managed to remove government regulations and restrictions on their operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022427810395321">Bakan 2004</xref>). As a consequence, practices that were once considered violations have since become legal. Despite transformations in the regulatory environment, many features of modern-day Corporate America remain remarkably similar. Note that both the 2009 and the 1975 <italic>Fortune</italic>
<italic>500</italic> lists included Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Ford Motor Company, General Electric, and General Motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022427810395321">Fortune 1975</xref>, 2009). The demonstrated validity of strain and opportunity perspectives in a variety of historical contexts also suggests that the explanatory power of models testing these frameworks is in no way restricted by time (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022427810395321">Baumer and Gustafson 2007</xref>). Whether replication of the current study using more recent data would produce consistent results remains an open empirical question. Along these lines, research that accounts for key changes in the regulatory environment would be a welcome addition to the corporate crime literature.</p>
<p>From a policy perspective, an issue beyond the scope of the current study concerns regulatory strategies and public policies designed to deter corporate crime. In the United States, the ability of corporations to favorably influence policy has a long history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022427810395321">Bakan 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022427810395321">Boies 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427810395321">Clinard and Yeager 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427810395321">2006</xref>). Nonetheless, recent efforts such as the 2002 Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act (i.e., Sarbanes-Oxley) have prompted increased regulation and intervention into corporate governance and have also targeted the mechanisms by which opportunities to violate were previously available (e.g., the nonindependence of public accounting firms). Additionally, other efforts have been enacted to reduce corporate crime (e.g., the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act that restricts limitations on raising and spending of soft money). It is perhaps too soon to tell if they have been successful, although much skepticism abides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022427810395321">Bank Security Report 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022427810395321">Gips 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022427810395321">Hurley and Boyd 2007</xref>). If the current study is any indication, legislation will likely be ineffective, or less effective, if it does not address sources of corporation- and industry-level strains and opportunities.</p>
<p>As scholars have long acknowledged, the most effective corporate regulatory strategies may not be those imposed directly by governmental agents but by American consumers themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022427810395321">Stone 1975</xref>). For instance, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022427810395321">Karpoff, Lee, and Martin (2006)</xref> found, reputational penalties in the form of lost revenue far exceeded those administered by regulators. This particular finding thus has highlighted the key role that nongovernmental institutions (e.g., mass media) may play in the not-so-distant future. Drawing on institutional anomie theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022427810395321">Baumer and Gustafson 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022427810395321">Messner and Rosenfeld 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022427810395321">2007</xref>), the dominance of economic systems—widely evident in Corporate America—might also be addressed via the strengthening of noneconomic institutions (e.g., school, family, and welfare). Whether such approaches would substantially reduce corporate crime remains an open question worthy of future empirical scrutiny.</p>

<p>Not included are detected violations responded informally, as well as undetected violations. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022427810395321">Simpson (1986)</xref>, corporate crime reporting is perhaps most similar to the Uniform Crime Report (UCR) rape or drug statistics, because law, interpretation of the law, and enforcement practices vary across industries. In addition, the problem of underreporting may not be randomly distributed across the corporations and industries within this sample. Unfortunately, all crime, street or white-collar, is subjected to underreporting and differential processing.</p>

<p>Specifically, the furniture industry has one corporation; the leather and leather products industry and the miscellaneous manufacturing industry include two corporations, respectively. We excluded these three industries and five corporations from the analyses. Further, we identified one corporation within the petroleum industry that had an extreme value (−11.14) on ROCE, when all the others have values on this variable falling between −1 and 1. Since no transformation could ameliorate the problem, and we still have adequate number of corporations (27) to represent the petroleum industry after excluding this outlier, we removed this corporation from our analyses.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-0022427810395321">
<label>3.</label>
<p>Several measures available in the data tap into industry-level strain. In the interest of parsimony and model specification, we only included decay in ROCE in the analyses for two main reasons. First, prior research has frequently used return on equity to measure industry-level financial performance and has established its significant effect on corporate crime (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022427810395321">Staw and Szwajkowski 1975</xref>). Second, this measure indicates an industry’s effectiveness at employing capital to generate profits and is significantly associated with our outcome variable in several preliminary models.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-0022427810395321">
<label>4.</label>
<p>Degree of diversification was calculated using four different industry criteria with the formula, <italic>D</italic> = 1 − <italic>Pi</italic>
<sup>2</sup>/(<italic>Pi</italic>)<sup>2</sup>, where <italic>Pi</italic> = proportion of operations in the industry <italic>i</italic> to total non-foreign operations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427810395321">Clinard and Yeager 1987</xref>). Four different industry criteria include all industries indicated at the two-digit level of the SIC codes (D1), all industries indicated at the four-digit level (D2), only manufacturing industries indicated at the two-digit level (D3), and only manufacturing industries indicated at the four-digit level (D4). Whereas two-digit SIC codes provide the broad descriptions, business types can be more clearly differentiated with use of four-digit codes.</p>

<p>The zero-order correlation between number of violations at the corporation level and percentage of corporations involved in violations at the industry level is .26.</p>

<label>6.</label>
<p>The Poisson model has a restrictive distributional feature with equal mean and variance. In practice, most crime counts tend to exhibit overdispersion: having variance greater than the mean (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022427810395321">Osgood 2000</xref>). For that reason, we first estimated a negative binomial regression model using STATA’s nbreg command that provides a test for overdispersion (HLM 6.0 does not provide a rigorous test). We found that the overdispersion term is significantly different from 0. Given this finding, we used overdispersed Poisson models—which allow us to generalize Poisson regression models to “include a scalar variance component, σ<sup>2</sup>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022427810395321">Raudenbush and Bryk 2002</xref>: 317; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427810395321">Raudenbush et al. 2004</xref>)—for two reasons. First, the hierarchical modeling techniques (HLM) used in this study do not yet accommodate negative binomial models. Second, the overdispersed model, compared to negative binomial models, is a better approach “when the researcher is interested primarily in the hypothesis tests about the regression coefficients” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022427810395321">Gardner, Mulvey, and Shaw 1995</xref>:403).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn9-0022427810395321">
<label>7.</label>
<p>To determine whether multicollinearity was a problem, we examined variance inflation factor (VIF) scores and also evaluated the condition indices. The results indicated acceptable levels of collinearity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022427810395321">Tabachnick and Fiddell 2001</xref>).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn10-0022427810395321">
<label>8.</label>
<p>Because we have standardized our strain and opportunity structure measures, values (−1), 0, and 1 on diversification or industry-level decay in ROCE in the figures indicate, correspondingly, one standard deviation below the mean, the mean, and one standard deviation above the mean.</p>
