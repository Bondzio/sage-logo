<abstract>
<p>Literature circles or book clubs are small, heterogeneous groups of students who have chosen to read and discuss the same book together. The research on literature circles suggests that they hold great promise for increasing students’ enjoyment of reading and honing their literacy skills. When evidence-based strategies are embedded into a literature circles framework and coteachers use multiple coteaching arrangements to teach and monitor literacy strategies, all students in an inclusive classroom can benefit. Through description and vignettes, this article explains how to introduce literature circles, manage the schedule and coteacher involvement, and provide students with guidance in the literature circles process. In addition, there are suggestions for supporting all levels of learners within a variety of coteaching configurations and evaluating student progress.</p>

<p><italic>Ms. Briggs, a middle school general education teacher, and Ms. Coulter, a special education teacher, met to plan for their language arts class for the upcoming school year. Last year they cotaught in their inclusive classroom and worked out many of the initial philosophical, pedagogical, and classroom management issues. Both are comfortable with coteaching arrangements that utilize large group instruction. Now, they want to enhance their students’ academic and social progress by implementing more intensive small group instruction. Both teachers attended a professional development workshop on literature circles and heard colleagues talk about their students’ enthusiastic responses to them, so they decided to implement this instructional approach in their classroom</italic> (see Note <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1053451211424601">1</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1053451211424601">
<title>Understanding Literature Circles</title>
<p>Literature circles, also known as book clubs, are small, heterogeneous, peer-led discussion groups in which members have chosen to read the same texts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451211424601">Daniels, 2002</xref>). Used widely in general education classrooms and popular with many classroom teachers, this instructional approach is effective in improving reading comprehension and social skills for a broad range of students, including students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053451211424601">Anderson &amp; Corbett, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451211424601">Blum, Lipsett, &amp; Yocum, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053451211424601">Certo, Moxley, Reffitt, &amp; Miller, 2010</xref>). However, teachers must address certain instructional challenges for all students to benefit. Research with students with learning disabilities has demonstrated that three instructional components produce a strong impact on student learning: control of task difficulty, small group instruction, and procedures that help students to “think aloud” about text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1053451211424601">Swanson, Hoskyn, &amp; Lee, 1999</xref>). Students with learning disabilities struggle with reading comprehension because they do not read strategically or monitor their understanding of text. Therefore, teachers must provide deliberate instruction in evidenced-based strategies (e.g., comprehension monitoring, questioning, elaboration, summarization) and provide repeated opportunities for practice and feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053451211424601">Jitendra, Burgess, &amp; Gajria, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1053451211424601">Roberts, Torgesen, Boardman, &amp; Scammacca, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1053451211424601">Sencibaugh, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1053451211424601">Vaughn, Gersten, &amp; Chard, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The most effective instructional approaches for struggling readers (a) use peer and teacher feedback, (b) elicit ongoing interaction, and (c) encourage task completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1053451211424601">Vaughn et al., 2000</xref>). Coteachers can easily incorporate these elements into a literature circles approach. It is important that these literature circle enhancements for students with disabilities result in the same or higher positive effects for all students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1053451211424601">Raphael, Florio-Ruane, &amp; George, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1053451211424601">Vaughn et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, when highly qualified coteachers implement a range of coteaching arrangements within a literature circles approach, the opportunity for specialized instruction is greatly increased.</p>

<title>Using Multiple Coteaching Arrangements</title>
<p>In response to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053451211424601">Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (2004)</xref> requirement for increased emphasis on educating students in the least restrictive environment, state and district implementation of coteaching has intensified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053451211424601">Friend, Cook, Hurley-Chamberlain, &amp; Shamberger, 2010</xref>). To date, the research on the effectiveness of coteaching is inconclusive. Although teachers and students are generally positive about having two teachers in the general education classroom, research on student achievement outcomes is mixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053451211424601">Friend et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1053451211424601">McDuffie, Mastropieri, &amp; Scruggs, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053451211424601">Moin, Magiera, &amp; Zigmond, 2009</xref>). Possible explanations for this finding include inadequate professional development for both teachers implementing the model, insufficient administrative support, classes with an overrepresentation of struggling students, and replication of instructional approaches used in a classroom taught by one teacher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053451211424601">Dieker &amp; Murawski, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1053451211424601">Nichols, Dowdy, &amp; Nichols, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1053451211424601">Scruggs, Mastropieri, &amp; McDuffie, 2007</xref>). Rather than increasing the teacher–student interaction and student time on task by implementing small group coteaching configurations, most coteachers rely on large group approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053451211424601">Moin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1053451211424601">Scruggs et al., 2007</xref>). In short, many coteachers are not taking full advantage of the opportunities available for specialized instruction and increasing engaged time on task, an established correlate of achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1053451211424601">McDuffie et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>There is considerable agreement that administrative support and teacher collaboration are critical to successful coteaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053451211424601">Keefe, Moore, &amp; Duff, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053451211424601">Murawski, &amp; Dieker, 2004</xref>). Administrators must schedule reasonable planning time for coteachers and ensure that classes are heterogeneous, and teachers must use planning time and collaborative tools effectively. When these prerequisites exist, small group coteaching arrangements promote specialized instruction within collaborative learning approaches such as literature circles.</p>
<p>Given the increase in coteaching implementation and the need for specialized instruction for students with disabilities, examples of how to use small group coteaching arrangements within commonly established general education approaches are critical. This article outlines important considerations for implementing literature circles based on a considerable history of teacher narrative and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451211424601">Daniels, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053451211424601">Daniels &amp; Steineke, 2004</xref>). Suggestions for introducing, managing, guiding, and evaluating the literature circles are provided through the lens of Ms. Briggs and Ms. Coulter’s decision-making process.</p>
<p><italic>Ms. Briggs and Ms. Coulter listed the major decisions needed to implement literature circles. They would have a class of about 25 students, at least 6 of whom were placed in their inclusive classroom based on the individualized education program (IEP) team’s recommendation. These 6 students were all reading 2 or 3 years below grade level, so the class reading level ranged from fourth to ninth grade. Ms. Briggs and Ms. Coulter made a list of the questions to discuss before school started</italic>:</p>

<sec id="section3-1053451211424601">
<title>Introducing Literature Circles</title>
<p>Coteachers should introduce literature circles after reviewing information about their students’ academic and social skills. This process allows them to select authentic texts, share text choices with the class, and form heterogeneous groups.</p>
<sec id="section4-1053451211424601">
<title>Reviewing Student Assessment Information</title>
<p>At the beginning of the school year, coteachers need sufficient time to become familiar with all students’ abilities before attempting literature circles. In addition to reviewing standardized test scores, student records, and IEPs, both teachers can use curriculum-based assessments, informal reading inventories, cloze or maze tests, and observational checklists to enhance their ability to design specialized reading instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053451211424601">King-Sears &amp; Bowman-Kruhm, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1053451211424601">Salend, 2009</xref>). Once teachers have an initial understanding of their students’ abilities, they can create heterogeneous circles based on student choice and use formative assessment for planning and instruction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1053451211424601">
<title>Selecting Appropriate Texts</title>
<p>Teachers should choose trade books that approximate the range of reading levels present in the class. To familiarize students with the literature circles format, coteachers may decide to start with relatively short texts such as short stories, chapter books, poetry, or nonfiction articles. All texts usually have a theme, topic, or author in common that will engage the students’ interests and are appropriate for their developmental level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1053451211424601">
<title>Presenting Text Choices</title>
<p>Coteachers should introduce the class to each text by describing the characters, opening event, or topic in an appealing manner. Then texts are displayed in the classroom so students can peruse them individually before they submit their choices. Individual students may need guidance in choosing texts appropriate for their reading level. Frequently there are opportunities for students to access text that is somewhat above their reading level by using technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1053451211424601">Salend, 2009</xref>). Students can use portable text readers that have text-to-speech, highlighting, note taking, and online dictionary capabilities. Reading pens enable them to pronounce and learn unfamiliar words. In addition, students can access books through Bookshare, a federally funded program that provides digital text and software applications to people with print disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1053451211424601">IRIS Center, n.d.</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1053451211424601">
<title>Determining Group Composition</title>
<p>The number of texts selected will influence group size. Initial groups should range from two to six students. Coteachers need to place students in heterogeneous groups that reflect student characteristics, literacy abilities, and classroom context. Students have critical input by making a prioritized list of text preferences, but they must understand that they may not always get their first choice. Once groups are determined, they remain together until they complete the text.</p>
<p><italic>Ms. Briggs and Ms. Coulter introduced literature circles after they spent most of the first month of school getting to know their students’ strengths and challenges and establishing basic expectations and routines. They started with five short books on the theme of “Becoming Independent” and saved longer books for later in the year. They took turns giving “advertisements” for each story, tantalizing the class with enough of the story to hook their interest, and encouraged students to scan them before submitting their first three choices. Considering students’ choices, they formed five groups with five students in each. In addition to mixing students by gender, race, and first language, they put some students who might not know each other well in the same group to enhance socialization. They placed two students with disabilities in each of three groups to provide them with structured support more easily. The teachers told students who did not get their first choice that they would honor their first requests the next time they had literature circles.</italic></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1053451211424601">
<title>Managing the Literature Circles Process</title>
<p>Once coteachers form literature circles, they should establish an instructional schedule. It should be flexible enough to allow for a varying amount of teacher involvement with groups and individuals over time.</p>
<sec id="section9-1053451211424601">
<title>Establishing a Schedule</title>
<p>Coteachers should create an instructional cycle that determines how much time is dedicated on a daily and weekly basis to literature circles (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053451211424601">Table 1</xref>). The literature circles cycle can be uninterrupted or interspersed with other activities on specified days. Ms. Briggs and Ms. Coulter established a short session before the circles to give directions or teach a strategy to the whole class or selected individuals. Then during circle time, both teachers would scaffold initial discussions by interacting with students to support their language development and later diminish that support as students take responsibility for discussing their own questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451211424601">Blum et al., 2002</xref>). They allowed time after circles met to monitor group or individual progress. They planned three opportunities for literature circles during the school year, knowing that they also needed to work with students on leveled texts to improve reading comprehension outside the literature circles experience.</p>

<title>Varying Teacher Involvement</title>
<p>As it becomes apparent which circles can function independently and which need more intensive instruction, teachers can meet with the latter groups to deliver evidence-based literacy instruction that describes and models the skill, provides guided practice with corrective feedback, and monitors progress. This support should be faded over time to meet the goal of literature circles: student-led discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451211424601">Allen, Möller, &amp; Stroup, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053451211424601">Clarke &amp; Holwadel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1053451211424601">Paxton-Buursma &amp; Walker, 2008</xref>). If only a few students need assistance on specific skills, a teacher can direct regularly scheduled circles to proceed on their own while a teacher meets with a small group or individual to provide a focus lesson on a particular strategy.</p>
<p><italic>The school schedule allowed 45 minutes each day for Ms. Briggs and Ms. Coulter’s English language arts class. Each period began with directions to the whole class on how to participate in literature circles (see Guiding the Literature Circles Process below). They decided that they wanted circles to last 20 minutes at the beginning of the year, with the goal of extending them to 35 minutes by June. To give students sufficient time to read, they set up a schedule based on a 3-day cycle. Initially one teacher met with each group to determine the extent to which they understood the literature circles process and to predict the need for future support. In addition, Ms. Coulter was available on Day 3 to work with students who might need help with literacy skills.</italic></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1053451211424601">
<title>Guiding the Literature Circles Process</title>
<p>A central tenet of literature circles is that students have ownership of their thinking and discourse, which requires them to learn to function as mature readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451211424601">Daniels, 2002</xref>). Therefore, readers control the discussion topics. However, coteachers can guide students to become independent learners by carefully structuring the process.</p>
<p>One way to scaffold the discussion process is to assign a different role to each member of the group. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451211424601">Daniels (2002)</xref> has suggested basic roles (i.e., connector, questioner, vocabulary enricher, literary luminary, and summarizer) and designed role sheets to guide students’ thinking and prompt written response. Optional roles (e.g., researcher, illustrator, and travel tracer) may be added as appropriate (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1053451211424601">Table 2</xref>). Initial role assignments should be made based on corresponding goals in students’ IEPs or other assessment data. If students are unfamiliar with the roles, it is important to introduce, model, and practice each role as a group. Typically, students rotate roles each time they meet; however, some circles or students may need continued practice with a particular role. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1053451211424601">Table 2</xref> suggests literacy skills needed for each role with examples of student responses from <italic>Tuck Everlasting</italic> by Natalie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451211424601">Babbitt (1975)</xref>.</p>

<p><italic>Since most students were new to literature circles, Ms. Briggs and Ms. Coulter introduced and explained the five basic roles to the class. First they decided to demonstrate the questioner’s role. Ms. Briggs read the text aloud and Ms. Coulter stopped her when she had a question about the characters’ interactions, the setting, or plot. Mrs. Coulter asked open-ended questions that usually started with “how” or “why.” They exchanged ideas by citing the text and their own experience. Then Ms. Coulter read aloud and asked students to ask questions to which other students were encouraged to respond. The teachers talked about what made a good question and highlighted the specific wording of students’ questions that involved critical thinking.</italic></p>
<p><italic>Next, they divided the class into their circles and asked all students to write open-ended questions in their response journals as they read. Then each student asked one of their questions while others in their circle answered based on the text and their own prior knowledge. The teachers listened in and commented on good questioning skills. At the end of the period, they reconvened the entire class to summarize what makes a good question. Students wrote prompts for accomplishing the questioner’s role in their response journals.</italic></p>

<title>Supporting All Learners</title>
<p>Students should be encouraged to read and write based on their readiness and learning preference. Some will read independently, some with a peer, and some with the support of technology. Students who struggle may need to learn strategies for comprehending text and formulating appropriate role sheet responses. For example, students who need to develop their vocabulary can be the vocabulary enricher. A traditional role sheet might require students to list the page number of unfamiliar vocabulary words accompanied by the definition. However, some students may benefit from more explicit teacher guidance while completing a role sheet that includes a graphic organizer such as a vocabulary map for each new word (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1053451211424601">Hairrell et al., 2011</xref>). A vocabulary map can include a variety of elements that support meaning: the new word, the sentence using the word in the text, a student-generated definition based on context, a dictionary definition, an illustration, a synonym, or an antonym. During a focus group, a teacher can discuss and model aloud the use of each part of the vocabulary map for a particular word, guide the students’ attempt to use the map, and finally assess their independent use.</p>
<p>Many students who struggle with comprehension should learn the summarizer role. However, they will need more than a role sheet that simply asks them to summarize what they have read. One solution is to provide explicit instruction in story mapping, a strategy for identifying critical elements of the story to aid recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1053451211424601">Stone, Boon, Fore, Bender, &amp; Spencer, 2009</xref>). The teacher introduces the meaning of these elements (i.e., characters, setting, events, problems, solutions) with a graphic organizer and then models her or his thought process while identifying each element using a familiar story and writing a summary sentence. Next, teachers and students practice “thinking aloud” together on another accessible text with the teacher providing prompts if necessary (e.g., Who are the important characters? What problem did they encounter? How can I say that in a sentence?). If, after independent practice, there are students who still struggle with the process, the teacher can provide practice with story cards that provide a graphic and written prompt for each element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1053451211424601">Whalon &amp; Hanline, 2008</xref>). Alternatively, coteachers can ask more specific questions about the text (e.g., What problem is Winnie having with her parents?) or think aloud about how to incorporate story elements into a summarizing sentence.</p>
<p>Once students are more experienced in using the various thinking processes that role sheets reinforce, alternative formats can be substituted (see Evaluating Student Progress below; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053451211424601">Daniels &amp; Steineke, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053451211424601">Long &amp; Gove, 2003–2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1053451211424601">Schlick Noe &amp; Johnson, 1999</xref>). Teachers can use blogs and related online resources (e.g., Moodle, ThinkQuest, Blogger) to create virtual literature circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451211424601">Collins, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451211424601">Day &amp; Kroon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1053451211424601">Kitsis, 2010</xref>). Initially, teachers report a variety of ways to structure a virtual discussion such as approving and posting the students’ discussion prompts and requiring one comment with a word limit and then adjusting requirements as students become familiar with the online environment. Most students are very enthusiastic about virtual discussions, participate more often, feel more comfortable admitting their confusions about text, and formulate their responses more thoughtfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451211424601">Day &amp; Kroon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1053451211424601">Kitsis, 2010</xref>). Teachers usually combine online with face-to-face circles, reporting that online discussions allow them to “listen in” without having their presence change the dynamic. As is true with face-to-face circles, students need strategies and prompts for conducting meaningful discussions.</p>

<sec id="section13-1053451211424601">
<title>Varying Coteaching Arrangements</title>
<p>To differentiate literature circles for all learners in a general education classroom, coteachers can be involved with literature circles in a variety of ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1053451211424601">Schlick Noe &amp; Johnson, 1999</xref>). Formats for teacher involvement range from most to least intensive and include teacher as leader, group member, outside observer of one group, and roaming observer of multiple groups. Since the goal is student-led discussion, the level of teacher involvement is diminished over time based on each group’s previous experience, literacy skills, interpersonal skills, and quality of response.</p>
<p>Coteaching enhances the differentiation process because both teachers are available to facilitate the literature circles process and then lead focus groups in response to specific group or individual needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1053451211424601">Sileo &amp; vanGarderen, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053451211424601">Friend and Cook (2010)</xref> identified six essential models for coteaching (i.e., one teach, one drift; one teach, one observe; parallel teaching; alternative teaching; station teaching; and team teaching). Ms. Coulter and Ms. Briggs exemplified team teaching when they introduced literature circle roles. They used station teaching on Days 1 and 2 when they each met with a different circle and the other students were reading and completing role sheets. On Day 3, they implemented a type of alternative teaching since Ms. Briggs met with a circle and Ms. Coulter was able to meet with selected students to provide specialized instruction (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053451211424601">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Ms. Briggs and Ms. Coulter met during their biweekly planning period to discuss the students’ progress by reviewing the students’ role sheets, journals, and the anecdotal records they had taken while leading the groups. Using a planning guide to structure Cycle 2, they decided that during the large group time all students needed to develop the discussion strategy of “piggybacking.” Piggybacking is the ability to expand on, question, or clarify other circle members’ contributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1053451211424601">Paxton-Buursma &amp; Walker, 2008</xref>). During the first cycle of literature circles, many students started their literature circles by simply reporting on what they had written on their role sheets without responding to their peers. The teachers agreed that Circles 1, 2, and 4 still needed the teacher to lead the discussion to prompt piggybacking whereas the others could meet with the teacher as a member to give positive and corrective feedback. In addition, they noticed that the questioners in Circles 1–4 could benefit from strategy instruction on higher order questioning. In fact, Renee, who had a learning disability, had recorded only one detail question on her role sheet for Circle 4.</italic></p>
<p><italic>Ms. Coulter and Ms. Briggs used a planning sheet to design and organize their instruction (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1053451211424601">Table 3</xref>). During the large group time, they would teach the students how to “piggyback.” In addition, Ms. Coulter would provide specialized instruction to Rene on Day 1 by reviewing, modeling, and practicing good questioning using cue cards with “how” and “why” questions as prompts.</italic></p>

<p><italic>During check-in, both teachers would give feedback to the students on their progress with piggybacking. Students would self-evaluate, writing a goal for improvement in the next cycle.

<title>Evaluating Student Progress</title>
<p>Literature circles provide multiple opportunities for assessment of students’ reading comprehension, oral language, written expression, group discussion, and independent work skills. Therefore, coteachers should agree on which skills they want to evaluate based on previous assessment, IEP goals, and ongoing teacher monitoring. Evaluation can be accomplished using a variety of formats designed to provide either teacher or student reflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1053451211424601">Salend, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1053451211424601">Schlick Noe &amp; Johnson, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Whether coteachers are facilitating or observing a literature circle, they should utilize simple formats for instructional decision making. For example, a list of group discussion skills can prompt teachers to check off observed behaviors, record the date, rate proficiency, or record examples or comments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1053451211424601">Figure 1</xref>). If more in-depth data are desired, teachers can audiotape or videotape circles or examine online discussions. Alternatively, a coteacher can record a student’s name and an example of a desired skill on sticky notes and then organize them into student folders or portfolios. Furthermore, students can reflect on their own reading, discussion, or independent work skills using rating scales or respond to prompts in their response journals and set a goal for improvement.</p>

</fig>
<p>Coteachers can assess many reading comprehension and written expression skills by reviewing the students’ role sheets, response logs, or online posts to determine skill proficiency (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1053451211424601">Table 2</xref>). Once students have internalized the skills needed to complete role sheets, they may switch to other response modes such as open-ended prompts in journals or blogs, bookmarks, comments on sticky notes, drawings with captions, face-to-face conferences, and written conversations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451211424601">Daniels, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053451211424601">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1053451211424601">Schlick Noe &amp; Johnson, 1999</xref>). Teachers can compile these options in a portfolio to give a comprehensive view of learning and share them with families. Some coteachers feel that an individual or group book project provides an excellent culminating experience for literature circles (e.g., talk shows, tableaux, song parodies, glogs). Students enjoy using PowerPoint, TuxPaint, and Glogster for their book projects. These projects are most helpful when they encourage students to reread and deepen their understanding, allow for a variety of learning preferences, and require real audiences.</p>
<p>With two teachers available, evaluation can occur throughout the literacy period. One coteacher can assess a student’s reading comprehension, fluency, or vocabulary knowledge while the other teacher leads the large group time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451211424601">Espin, Shin, &amp; Busch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451211424601">Garcia, 2007</xref>). During circles, a coteacher can observe all or particular students’ ability to ask higher-order questions or piggyback and later meet with small groups needing remediation or enrichment. The final evaluation and check-in time provides an opportunity for teachers to review role sheets or other data collected. The rubric in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1053451211424601">Figure 1</xref> could be simplified for students to use for self-reflection and goal setting.</p>
<p><italic>Ms. Briggs and Ms. Coulter met again after Cycle 2 to review the data collected and plan the next cycle of literature circles. They agreed that most students were conversing with each other by using piggybacking strategies. They used their anecdotal records to determine which students still needed practice during Cycle 3. Consulting their list of discussion strategies, they decided to teach the skill of asking for clarification to the whole class next. During the final 10 minutes, they would give feedback and ask students to set an individual discussion skill goal for the next circle.</italic></p>
<p><italic>The coteachers understood that their students would need to learn many literacy skills before they could all function independently within a literature circles approach. Their long-term plan was to use literature circles two more times during the school year, establish a schedule that allowed for intensive literacy instruction based on progress monitoring within and between literature circles, and incorporate virtual discussion. They knew it would take time for both the students and themselves to become comfortable with new coteaching arrangements, but they were excited about the opportunity to see their students develop academically and socially and to grow as professionals in an inclusive environment.</italic></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1053451211424601">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>Literature circles hold great promise for increasing students’ enjoyment of reading of different genres and honing their literacy skills in the inclusive classroom. Students who are avid or struggling readers can participate enthusiastically when they choose their own texts and receive deliberate instruction in the literature circles process. Literature circle discussions are not a substitute for the small group instruction needed by students with learning disabilities, but by connecting data from discussions with systematic focus lessons, coteachers can differentiate for individual student needs. Furthermore, having two teachers in the classroom who are skilled at a variety of coteaching arrangements and share the monitoring of student progress maximizes the differentiation of instruction and quality of response.</p>
