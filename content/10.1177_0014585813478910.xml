<p>Eric Lamet’s memoir about his time spent in Italy in the run-up to Mussolini’s intervention into the Second World War and during the conflict, escaping Nazi persecution in his native Austria, is an extraordinary firsthand account of the vicissitudes faced by foreign nationals, and foreign Jews in particular, during the last years of fascist rule. The author, born Erich Lifschütz in 1930, fled Vienna with his mother Lotte (his father went to Poland to take care of his family there) in March 1938, leaving behind a comfortable and happy life as Hitler’s troops entered the city. His description of the atmosphere of suspicion and hate that had started to encompass his family and the Jewish people in the days preceding the ‘Anschluss’ – powerfully symbolized by his childish astonishment in the face of the unexpected volte-face of the family’s affectionate housekeeper and governess Millie – shows how the anti-Semitic campaign insidiously permeated the feelings of ordinary people in the ‘Großdeutschland’, melding ideological and racial stereotypes with a stream of social revulsion against the middle and upper classes.</p>
<p>Eric and Lotte’s first stop during their escape from the Nazi hunters was Milan, where they lived for 8 months in the home of a kind Italian family. Anti-Semitism dominated the debate among fascist hierarchies at the time, but the bulk of the Italians, despite being targeted by a pervasive and noisy propaganda, never showed any real hostility towards Jews. Racial laws were passed in late 1938, but they barely affected the life of the fugitive family. They found shelter and friends, sharing with their hosts the hardships imposed by the extraordinary measures the Italian government adopted at the outbreak of war in Europe.</p>
<p>After leaving Milan, Eric and Lotte stayed for 9 months between Paris and Nice. In September 1939, they escaped to Sanremo, where ‘local authorities seldom took steps to enforce racial laws’. Even Mussolini’s decision to enter the war in June 1940 did not upset the exiles’ life, and after the surrender of France to Italy 2 weeks later the area remained quiet for several months. Their stay on the Ligurian coast left the child with cherished memories of having a proper house, friends, and a life not so different from that of ordinary Italians.</p>
<p>For nearly 2 years, police authorities almost everywhere ignored German pressing requests urging fascist Italy to substantiate their policies against Jews. A law passed in November 1938 had stated that all foreign Jews had to leave Italy before March 1939, but in 1941 only 27 per cent of Jews had complied with that order. In previous months, even after Mussolini’s decision to fight by Hitler’s side against Britain and France, the flux of refugees had actually increased. In June 1941, however, Eric and Lotte were interned at Ospedaletto d’Alpinolo, a small mountain village near the provincial city of Avellino in the southern Campania region. Lamet’s pages recalling that time resound with other remembrances of sudden acquaintance with the harsh reality of life in the Italian ‘Mezzogiorno’, such as the memorable recollection of the Jewish anti-fascist writer and painter, Carlo Levi, of his confinement in Lucania in the autobiographical novel <italic>Christ Stopped at Eboli</italic>, first published in Italy in 1945. Like Levi, Lamet noticed around him not only destitution and backwardness, but also warmth and unselfishness.</p>
<p>In Ospedaletto, Eric and his mother were appalled by the villagers’ condition (all the women dressed in black because in large families there was always someone to mourn, dirty children roaming the streets all day, superstition and obsessive religious practices ruling people’s lives, men working hard in the fields), but they soon realized that they were well accepted by the community and made plenty of friends, including the small circle of internees (of whom there were about 90 in Ospedaletto, among them foreign Jews, nationals of enemy countries and some Italian anti-fascists). The only act of betrayal in that time (a tip-off to the Italian police suggesting that one of the Jews confined at Ospedaletto was an enemy spy) came from another internee, William Pierce, a British citizen who, paradoxically, was a fervent and fanatical philo-fascist.</p>
<p>The account of the last months of Mussolini in power is especially illuminating, vividly rendering the ways the condition for civilians in Campania became even more horrible after Spring 1943: people were trapped in the vice between the occupation of German troops, who were more and more brutal as they moved north, and the Allied air incursions. In particular, the author offers moving details about an episode that is neglected even in the Italian historiography of the Second World War – the Anglo-American bombing of Avellino on 14 September 1943, which killed 4000 civilians (‘aside from the officer’s cadet school, there was no other military target there’, Lamet recalls) from a population of around 30,000. Three weeks after the raid, the author went to Avellino and on the outskirts of the city saw ‘smoldering dead bodies piled up high on street corners’. A bystander explained to him that it was not possible to bury all the dead: ‘Allied soldiers had poured gasoline over the corpses and set them on fire’.</p>
<p>After the war, Eric Lamet and his mother, who in the meantime had became attached to Pietro Russo, himself an internee in Ospedaletto from his native Sicily, settled in Naples, where they lived until 1950. Their decision to leave Austria in 1938 had given them the chance to survive persecution, seeking refuge in a country that, notwithstanding the bombastic rhetoric of fascist leaders and the Duce’s uncritical support of Nazi racial policies, was a faulty cogwheel − as Raul Hilberg and Renzo De Felice have shown − in the inhuman workings devised to destroy the Jews in Europe.</p>
