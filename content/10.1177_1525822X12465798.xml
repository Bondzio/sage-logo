We interviewed 40 inmates to explore their reasons for participating in previous research, the benefits and harm they experienced, and whether they felt coerced into participation. Inmates report several benefits from participating in research, including psychological satisfactions, a respite from the boredom of prison life, and monetary gain. Participants stated that they did not experience harm from the research or feel coerced to take part.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>prison research</kwd><kwd>human subjects protection</kwd><kwd>IRB</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Without regulation and careful protections, inmate research participants are especially vulnerable to coercion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525822X12465798">Dugosh et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1525822X12465798">Mobley et al. 2008</xref>). To protect against this possibility, university institutional review boards (IRBs) require investigators to measure potential risks against assumed benefits. According to the standards for Health and Human Services funding delineated in 45 CFR § 46.305(a), institutions and investigators should be certain that the advantages of participating in research are not so great that they interfere with the ability to consider risks; that risks are similar to those that a nonprisoner volunteer would take; that procedures for selection are not based on arbitrary decisions by prison authorities; and that the prisoner be fully informed that participation will have no bearing on parole or other administrative decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1525822X12465798">Colecchia 2007</xref>).</p><p>Even when researchers abide by ethical standards and promise confidentiality, critics argue that inmates may deceive researchers to gain favor with criminal justice officials, think that they cannot speak freely due to legal concerns, or perceive that participating in research could have negative consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1525822X12465798">Jacques and Wright 2008</xref>, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525822X12465798">Polsky 1998</xref>). These critics focus on the issues of validity and reliability associated with failing to establish trust, but their conclusions highlight potential for coercion and other ethical issues when dealing with prisoners.</p><p>Despite these misgivings about coercion and validity, interviews with inmates have shed light on the lifestyles offenders lead, criminal decision-making processes, inmate culture and prison life, and more effective ways to manage crime and inmate populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1525822X12465798">Fleisher 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1525822X12465798">Giallombardo 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1525822X12465798">Shover 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525822X12465798">Sykes 1958</xref>). Therefore, investigators will continue to draw on data from imprisoned research participants. Our project was designed to allow inmates who have participated in prison-based research to speak for themselves about whether they experienced any benefit or harm from the research process and whether they felt coerced to participate. Questions we seek answers to include: Do inmates think that they benefit in tangible ways? Do they think they have been coerced? Do they have hopes of getting perks or preferential treatment from staff? Do they experience harm or fear harm from staff or other inmates after speaking with researchers? Understanding the perspective of inmates will allow us to better evaluate whether the costs of such research outweigh risks to participants.</p><sec id="section1-1525822X12465798" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We base our findings on interviews with 40 inmates in an Alabama prison who had participated previously in a study aimed at understanding their perceptions of parole revocation. Within 1 week of their participation in the initial parole revocation study, Copes (not one of the initial interviewers) conducted follow-up interviews with inmates about their experiences. The delay between interviews gave participants time to process the interview and experience potential harms or benefits but was short enough that participants would not have forgotten about their experiences. Respondents ranged in age from 19 to 66 (mean age = 41). All were male. Ten were white and 30 were black. Convictions ranged in severity from low-level drug distribution to violent acts such as robbery, rape, and murder.</p><p>Following guidelines approved by our IRB, the investigators for the original study maintained the names of those interviewed. We contacted those interviewed and asked if they would speak with us about their experiences as research participants. We explained that these interviews would focus on their perceptions of the initial interview. To lessen threats to their confidentiality, we minimized the number of correctional officer escorts and used an information sheet instead of a signed consent form. We compensated inmates $10 for the interview by making payment to their institutional account. Paying inmates for participation is a matter of some controversy but is common in criminological research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1525822X12465798">Copes et al. 2011</xref>). A recent survey on inmate compensation policies from 50 states and the Federal Bureau of Prisons found that 56% of state agencies and the federal bureau do not allow compensation for research purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1525822X12465798">Smoyer et al. 2009</xref>). While the Alabama Department of Corrections (DoC) allows compensation, it does not have clear guidelines on acceptable amounts. Guidelines give wardens discretion to make decisions on a study-by-study basis. The warden at the prison and our universities’ IRBs approved the compensation we offered.</p><p>The follow-up interviews were semistructured and conversational. That is, inmates were asked a core set of questions, but the interviewer had liberty in the wording of the questions. Questions addressed motivations for consenting to the initial interview, the experienced benefits and harms that came from consenting, and inmates’ impressions of coercion (from staff and researchers). The interviews took place in a client office located in a secure and scarcely trafficked area of the facility. Only the study participants and the interviewer were in the room, and the space allowed for private conversation. Correctional officers could look into the room, but they could not hear the exchanges. Each interview lasted about 30 minutes. During transcription, we removed all identifiers and assigned aliases. In interpreting percentages reported below, readers should keep in mind that (1) how the remainder of the respondents answered cannot always be inferred; (2) interview questions were open-ended; (3) interviewers allowed respondents flexibility to talk freely; and (4) some responses fit more than one category.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1525822X12465798"><title>Perceived Benefits of Participating in Research</title><p>When asked if they benefited from taking part in this research, all participants answered that they did. Benefits they reported included feeling better about themselves and their situation, having the opportunity to get a break from their daily routine, speaking with strangers, and being compensated financially.</p><sec id="section3-1525822X12465798"><title>Emotional Benefits</title><p>It was common for participants to claim that they experienced emotional benefits from participating. Fifteen (38%) participants made statements like Derrick’s, “I felt better after the interview,” and Jackson’s, “[The interview] gave me a sense of worth.” When asked if anything good came from the experience, Melvin answered, “The therapeutic value of being able to discuss as many details of my life and to remain honest in those assessments.” These statements support what is often found when offenders participate in interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1525822X12465798">Bosworth et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1525822X12465798">Clark 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1525822X12465798">Schlosser 2008</xref>). The simple act of talking about their crimes can aid ex-offenders in the process of making sense of and contextualizing past mistakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525822X12465798">Maruna 2001</xref>).</p><p>None of the offenders found the interview upsetting. In fact, 19 (48%) claimed that the interview allowed them to reflect on and improve their outlook or behavior, which was consistent with their attempts to reassess their crimes and related mistakes, to engage in a new way of life, and to explore the possibility of a new mental outlook. Antonio said:<disp-quote><p>I got to relive some moments that I never talked about and I never thought I’d get a chance to talk about with nobody else ever again. And [the interview] gave me a chance to think about the whole conversation over once again and benefit from it in a way that some of the things that I know I’ve been slacking on, such as to backslide on different things. Gave me a chance to open up to it again and think about it once again. So it was a benefit to me and enlightened me and brought my wellness up.</p></disp-quote>And Derrick said:<disp-quote><p>It really gave me something to think on ’cause in a process of what I went through and what I’m going through, it really opened my mind up more and made me take it more seriously. . . . I didn’t feel anything bad. It really kind of like benefited, helped ’cause it put my mind more on the level that I been trying to reach.</p></disp-quote></p><p>These claims may also be consistent with a self-improvement role that prisoners are expected to play. In another common trope, 22 participants (56%) claimed that being in a position to help others increased their self-worth. For some, this was part of what they said was their desire to do the right thing and make amends. For others, it was an attempt, they said, to advise outsiders. Omar said, “I just hope whatever I said could help. Like I said, it’s too late for me…. I hope the information could get help to others…and help the next person.”</p></sec><sec id="section4-1525822X12465798"><title>Talking to Someone</title><p>After long periods under the supervision of the state, daily routines become monotonous, schedules become repetitive, and the acceptable subject matter for prisoner communication can become stifling and tiresome. The degree to which the interview offered a valued respite from boredom and a change in routine cannot be overstated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525822X12465798">Patenaude 2004</xref>). Twenty-eight inmates (70%) stated that they simply enjoyed the pleasure of “getting away and getting out for a while.” Warren expressed the sentiment bluntly:<disp-quote><p>A dude told me about it and I said, “Shoot I gotta get up there ’cause there ain’t nothing to do around here. Absolutely nothing! We don’t have nothing but running, exercising, reading, and writing.” That’s it! I just wanted to get out, to be honest with you.</p></disp-quote>Tony remarked on the importance of discrete conversation in prison:<disp-quote><p>You can’t talk to everybody in your dorm because you might not like everybody to know your business ’cause people talk too much. I might want to tell you something, but I might not want to tell someone else, because I know you ain’t gonna say nothing of what I got to say. But then I know someone else he’ll go back and tell the whole world.</p></disp-quote></p><p>Simply put, inmates said that it was nice to interact casually with an interested but emotionally uninvolved stranger who cared little about the norms of conversational suppression and could not perpetuate gossip. There is reason to believe that such opportunities benefit mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525822X12465798">Durcan 2008</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the break from routine, nine inmates (23%) said that knowing that others were interested in understanding the criminal justice system lessened the pessimistic attitude they held about the criminal justice system and society. Chip stated:<disp-quote><p>In a way it shows me that people out there still care about people in here. A lot of us in here figure [that] since we’re here, society has just forgot about us. Like Alabama corrections, when they send you here, they’re through with you. You’re just in the system now. Every once in a while you’ll catch a class but when you’re through with that class you’re just back out in population. You don’t know whether they really care. It makes you think. Makes you wonder.</p></disp-quote>Marvin said:<disp-quote><p>I kinda had a better feeling just going back to the dorm. Just to know that somebody cared enough to come check things out. You kinda lost down here. Free world people don’t come see you. These people in here ain’t gonna give you no information on nothing except we got you.</p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="section5-1525822X12465798"><title>Financial Compensation</title><p>Although financial compensation is not considered a benefit for participants when IRBs construct cost–benefits ratios, inmates saw it as such. About one-third (13) of the participants made statements such as Chip’s: “[Money] helps ’cause a lot of us don’t get money. And if you ain’t got none, that’ll buy your cosmetics for a month. So yeah, [money’s] a good thing.” However, only three inmates claimed that money was the sole benefit they received. Even when inmates acknowledged that they were motivated by money, they typically pointed to the factors previously discussed as being just as or more important. Francis explained:<disp-quote><p>[I] needed some money. But no, then again it was a chance to see what’s really up, different aspects on what someone thinks and the like. [Maybe] I could get some pointers on trying to classify my life. . . . The money was good, but the interview and session was pretty good, too.</p></disp-quote>Participants underplayed the importance of remuneration by suggesting that altruism or personal growth were the “real” reasons for participating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1525822X12465798">Fry and Dwyer 2001</xref>). This, too, may have been consistent with expected role behavior, but it was clear that participants also saw financial compensation as a significant benefit of participating in research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section6-1525822X12465798"><title>Risks</title><p>Researchers generally assume that as long as interviews are kept confidential (usually by striking identifying comments in the interview transcripts), the risks are minimized to a degree such that potential benefits outweigh the costs. However, there are other potential dangers of interviewing inmates. Here we focus on some of the potential consequences of consenting to interviews for inmates: being perceived as violating the inmate code and experiencing negative emotions due to participation.</p><sec id="section7-1525822X12465798"><title>Consequences of Violating Inmate Code</title><p>Ethnographic research on persistent street offenders suggests that they typically avoid speaking with authorities and that violating this code can have serious consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525822X12465798">Rosenfeld et al. 2003</xref>). Thus, one potential risk of speaking with researchers is that other inmates will mistake willingness to speak with outsiders as “snitching.” To address this issue, we asked participants if they experienced any threats or confrontations from other inmates, or any other type of harm, due to their decision to speak with us. No participants stated that they had a negative interaction because of their decision to speak with us.</p><p>Twenty-four (60%) participants noted that the stricture against speaking with authorities did not apply to the interview situation. As Warren said, “This ain’t got nothing to do with the code you’re talking about.” Steven explained, “It is a different kind of code. There’s the code of talking to an officer about something that could put another inmate’s life or security in danger. That’s what they was meaning. Not just by talking to an officer.” They acknowledged that informing could be dangerous, but made clear distinctions between these activities and innocuous interaction with authorities or outsiders.</p><p>Eight participants (20%) asserted that their reputation for being a “good con” kept others from mistaking participation in research with informing authorities. Jerry’s comments reflected this idea:<speech><speaker>Interviewer:</speaker><p>Did people want to know why you were called up there?</p></speech><speech><speaker>Jerry:</speaker><p>Yeah. Most people, most of the time, want to get in other people’s business. Asking, “Why they calling you up there?” I told ’em, “It’s something they want to talk to me about.” And I leave it at that.</p></speech><speech><speaker>Interviewer:</speaker><p>Did you get a feeling like they’re trying to find out if you’re a snitch?</p></speech><speech><speaker>Jerry:</speaker><p>Yeah, that’s mostly what they’s talking about.</p></speech><speech><speaker>Interviewer:</speaker><p>Do you think any of them thought that’s what you were doing?</p></speech><speech><speaker>Jerry:</speaker><p>No, because they know me. Some of ’em does. They know how I am already—I ain’t talking to no police.</p></speech></p></sec><sec id="section8-1525822X12465798"><title>Recalling Painful Memories</title><p>Another potential source of harm that can come from consenting to an interview is emotional discomfort emerging from reliving painful experiences. It is possible that asking the imprisoned to discuss painful events and times may trigger anxiety, self-doubt, and/or depression. To assess this, we asked all participants if they experienced negative emotions after the interview. None said they did. As shown in the previous section, participants said that they felt better after the interview.</p></sec><sec id="section9-1525822X12465798"><title>Coercion</title><p>The letter and spirit of human subjects regulations forbids coercion when recruiting participants. This requires extra attention for special populations like inmates who may be more likely to experience pressure to consent than those not under state supervision. Coercion in prison can come from many places, including undue use of authority from prison staff, mistaken beliefs about the rewards of participating (e.g., special favor with parole board or prison staff), the mistaken belief that interviewers work for the DoC, or excessive payment. Despite the potential for coercion, it appears that being coerced to participate in research is not widespread in prisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1525822X12465798">Moser et al. 2004</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525822X12465798">Dugosh et al. 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section10-1525822X12465798"><title>Excessive Pressure from Correctional Staff</title><p>We asked inmates if at any time they felt pressured by correctional officers to participate. No inmate answered yes. Antonio said, “I wouldn’t say so much pressured as a chance. It really gave me an opportunity to open up and talk about things with her [initial interviewer] that I’ve never really got a chance to talk about with anyone else.” Other inmates indicated that correctional officers seemed entirely indifferent to whether or not they participated, probably revealing the institutional reality that correctional officers’ primary concerns are safety and order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1525822X12465798">Fox et al. 2011</xref>).</p><p>Officers retrieved inmate volunteers from their living quarters, which offered a potential setting for coercion. When asked if he felt pressured by correctional officers, Omar responded, “None of that because they didn’t say nothing at the front. They just said you got an interview.” While the inmates may have experienced routine pressure to accompany correctional officers, it was clear to all that they did not have to participate once they arrived and that they could stop the interview at any time. As one participant stated, “[The interviewer] told me, ‘If you don’t want to talk to me, I understand. You can just go back.’ I said, ‘I’ll talk.’” Kenneth said, “I could have easily just walked off. I could have said I don’t feel like doing that and walked back.” After reviewing the consent form, inmates understood that they were free to make their own decisions.</p></sec><sec id="section11-1525822X12465798"><title>Mistaken Belief of Obtaining Benefits from Parole Board</title><p>Critics of prison-based research charge that inmates may be inclined to participate, even when they may not want to, due to the mistaken belief that they will accrue benefits from the parole board and as such may be subject to coercion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525822X12465798">Dugosh et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1525822X12465798">Wright and Decker 1997</xref>). This problem would be exacerbated if prisoners assume that researchers work for the institution or have closely aligned interests. Therefore, we sought to determine whether inmates believed that their participation would help them with the parole board or administrators.</p><p>Twenty-eight inmates (70%) acknowledged that participation would have no direct effect on their criminal justice status. Some said they knew that they would not receive benefits because interviewers informed them of this beforehand. When asked if he thought he would receive any benefits for participation Francis replied, “No. They say this ain’t got nothing to do with that. . . . She explained that real good. This ain’t got nothing to do with parole.” Russell answered, “No. Not really. Of course the paper [consent form] said it wouldn’t. I pretty much read the paper as I was going through and so I see okay, no.” Others said they knew they would not receive benefits because of their familiarity with how the system works. Rodney said:<disp-quote><p>No. I’d like to say hell no. Shoot if you can come to prison and do well for five or six years, build up a stack of certificates, try to do the right things and respect people, and try to change the way you used to be and go in front of the parole board and they still deny you for no apparent reason other than them just looking at your jacket and making their own opinion about you. Then I don’t see why this would help.</p></disp-quote>Echoing this, Antoine replied:<disp-quote><p>No. Because I don’t have no confidence in [the parole board]. They tell you to do good and do this, do that, . . . but if you give ’em a year or two, with a clean record, no dirty urines, no disciplinaries, no kind of trouble—I’ll come up in December and I’ll have well over two years on a ten-year sentence—and I ain’t sure I’ll make it. Last time I thought well I’ll make parole. No. So I knew y’all couldn’t help me with parole.</p></disp-quote></p><p>The remaining 12 inmates (30%) said that they were aware that no direct benefit would come to them from prison officials but held out hope that it would benefit them in a more abstract sense. They said either that they took every opportunity offered to show that they were transforming themselves and changing behavior or that by helping other persons good things might come to them. Inmates make efforts at rehabilitation of varying degrees of sincerity. Some use the language of treatment and rehabilitation to gain favor in the system, while others conduct their daily lives with real transformative projects in mind. In both cases, participation in interviews can be cast as part of rehabilitative efforts, even if expected benefits of any singular action are indirect.</p><p>A related benefit of participation derives from the idea that good things come to good people. This is seen in Trevor’s response to being asked if he benefited from talking to us: “Not really, I just think somewhere down the line it will help out. . . . It will come back to me.” An understanding that fortunate parole decisions might come from accumulated attempts at good works is qualitatively different than the claim that offenders are coerced into participating because they believe it will aid their legal position.</p></sec><sec id="section12-1525822X12465798"><title>Mistaking Researchers for DoC Officials</title><p>There is a reasonable concern that inmates may think that they must speak to researchers or that they should tailor what they say to please an audience of correctional officials or legal authorities. Belief that authorities wanted them interviewed or would use what they say would, indeed, constitute a form of coercion. However, none of the 40 inmates who participated in this study were suspicious that the investigators worked for the DoC or were there to investigate them in any way beyond the scope of the project. Inmates claimed that it was obvious to them that interviewers were not prison employees or law enforcement officers in the first minutes of speaking with them. Participants recognized this because of the interviewers’ tone, appearance, demeanor, attention to their rights, and the nature of the questions asked. When asked if he thought the interviewer worked for the DoC, Alex said:<disp-quote><p>No sir. See the DoC they have a character that’s a lot different, it’s a lot more of a hostile relationship. So now with her, it was more understanding. She treated me like I was a regular human being. It was a respectful conversation. I enjoyed it.</p></disp-quote>Others laughed at the hypothetical that the interviewer might have worked or the DoC. Steven explained that daily experience in institutions fostered an ability to discern those who are employed by prisons and those who are not (e.g., university students or professors):<speech><speaker>Interviewer:</speaker><p>Did it seem like [he] worked for the DoC?</p></speech><speech><speaker>Steven:</speaker><p>No. I kinda see straight through. I ask him was he a student or something.</p></speech><speech><speaker>Interviewer:</speaker><p>How did you know? How did he present himself that told you he wasn’t part of the DoC?</p></speech><speech><speaker>Steven:</speaker><p>It’s just something I felt. I been around, I been locked up for eleven years of my life, so I pretty much know officers, you know what I mean? . . . Officers carry themselves a certain way and [he] kinda put himself off like he was just an ordinary kid in school. Just an ordinary person.</p></speech>In our study at least, inmates did not appear pressured to participate in the research or to change their stories because of suspicions that interviewers might represent prison authorities.</p></sec><sec id="section13-1525822X12465798"><title>Excessive Payment</title><p>Researchers often provide small monetary incentives to encourage participation in research. While there are some ethical dilemmas when deciding how much money to offer, most investigators agree that it is appropriate to compensate participants for their time and knowledge. According to participants, financial incentive encouraged participation, but it was uncommon for them to state that their primary reason for participating in the research was the money. To help determine if the amount we offered participants was coercive, we asked them if they would have consented to the interview without remuneration. All 40 respondents said that they would. Omar’s answer was typical of these responses:<disp-quote><p>I would yeah. Because it’s for research. If somebody could pinpoint a certain aspect where somebody doing something wrong and it could be corrected by me telling ‘em. Yeah, I want everybody to know about it. Not just for myself now, but for fellow inmates.</p></disp-quote></p></sec></sec><sec id="section14-1525822X12465798"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our goal in this research was to give inmates in an Alabama prison a voice in describing whether they experienced benefits, harms, and coercion from participating in interview-based research. Respondents reported some intangible benefits and no harms or negative consequences. They also reported the interviews as being a positive and rewarding experience and uniformly said that they had not been subject to coercive persuasion.</p><p>Our findings have implications for how researchers complete IRB protocols and for how scholars evaluate the validity of research based on interviews with inmates. IRBs are tasked with ensuring that researchers treat human subjects of research ethically. Researchers seeking IRB approval must demonstrate that the benefits of the study outweigh potential harm to participants. Cautious IRBs often see significant risks from interviewing inmates.</p><p>Members of university IRBs may be wary of researchers’ abilities to maintain confidentiality, litigiousness on the part of inmates, coercive potential from institutional staff, and psychological repercussions of participation. Careful design of procedure and convincing argument must be used to allay these concerns. As part of this effort, those who engage in ethnographic research in prisons typically point to the abstract benefits of the research such as how the study informs criminal justice policy or leads to a better understanding of the causes of crime. Understanding whether and how the research process benefits participants can make it easier for researchers who interview prisoners to gain IRB approval.</p><p>Our findings also speak to criticisms about the validity of data from inmate interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525822X12465798">Polsky 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1525822X12465798">Wright and Decker 1997</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1525822X12465798">Jacobs and Wright (2006</xref>) contend that:<disp-quote><p>prisoners often bring an agenda to the interview setting that can compromise the validity and reliability of any information they provide to researchers. No matter how much they are assured otherwise, incarcerated offenders often associate researchers with prison staff and other criminal justice functionaries who can provide benefits or mete out punishment. (p. 10)</p></disp-quote>The inmates in our study were aware that interviewers were unaffiliated with any law enforcement agency and could not influence how inmates were treated by criminal justice agents. But we acknowledge that our research has several shortcomings.</p><p>First, the consistency of responses across 40 interviews leads us to believe that relating their stories may benefit prison inmate research participants. Nevertheless, our findings are based on a sample of inmates who were serving time for parole violations in a single prison. Replication of this study in other state prisons would test the reliability of our findings.</p><p>Second, the interviews did not focus on topics that are likely to be upsetting for inmates. In our research, inmates had few concerns about upsetting prison authorities by speaking about the parole revocation process. Speaking with sex offenders about their crimes or asking inmates to talk about the loss of family by imprisonment may provoke more emotional responses than speaking about parole revocation.</p><p>Third, we must be wary about saying that participants experienced no coercion since it can be subtle. The interview may have offered enjoyment to the bored and institutionalized but being interviewed may not be so attractive to free and busy citizens. In this sense, being incarcerated enhances the perceived rewards of research participation. While those interviewed said they were not coerced (and we believe this to be true), no researcher should become complacent about human subjects concerns or the well-being of inmate participants.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn1-1525822X12465798"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn2-1525822X12465798"><label>Funding</label><p>The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-1525822X12465798"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bosworth</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Campbell</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Demby</surname><given-names>B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferranti</surname><given-names>S.
