<p><italic>Visualizing Space in Banaras: Images, Maps and the Practice of Representation</italic> spins a comprehensive and delightful narrative on urban spatial evolution in Vārānasī spanning different historical layers and engagements of various social players. The collection of research articles by seventeen senior researchers and experts has been arranged in four thematic sections that act as mines of information on not only the ‘built environment’ of the riverfront city but also its changing representation in images and maps against the background of colonial conditions situated in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Furthermore the volume traces the changing urban identity, from the dominance of its commercial economy (resulting from its strategic placement at the crossroads of the east–west and north–south trade routes) to its emergence as the socio-cultural artefact of Indian nationalism and Hindu India in the nineteenth century; and as the pilgrimage city of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It thus witnessed accommodation, acculturation and encounter between the Hindus and Muslims, to the dynamics of ‘appropriation, negotiation and contestation’ reflecting social tension and power struggle within the urban centre. The volume focuses on such shifting spatial meanings and the existence of multiple semi-spaces that were constantly defined and redefined by the activities of its residents from different caste, class and sectarian groups. In reconstructing and critically analyzing the peculiar and unique identity of the city, the scholars draw upon a variety of primary sources—textual, archaeological, architectural, ritual and customary practices—that augment the quality and academic value of the book.</p>
<p>The first section on ‘Sacred Topography’ retraces the physicality of the city both geographically and spatially through primary texts (such as the Skandapurāna, the Mārkandeyapurāna, Matsyapurāna, Lakshmidhara’s Tīrthavivecanakānda, Brahmapurāna, Jābāla Upanisads, Dandin’s Daśakumāracarita, Hsiuen Tsang’s account); power asserting religious structures; and the socio-cultural claims of dominant groups (rulers, Brahmins and wealthy merchants) through ritual performances and processions. It demonstrates how the cosmic site of Kāśī positioned Vārānasī within ‘part of a more complex “imagined landscape” in which mythology and topography were intrinsically interlinked (p. 8).’ Hans Bakker studies the <italic>tīrtha</italic>, its expanding frontiers, intricate passages unifying the sacred topography (consisting of the central <italic>tīrthas</italic>’—the Madhyameśvara and the Avimukteśvara—<italic>linga</italic> sanctuaries and cremation ground; and new spatial appropriations accommodating the Pasupata doctrine and <italic>tantric</italic> practices (of the cremation ground) within the city space. The research paper brilliantly reconstructs five made-to-scale illustrations of the Avimuktasetra (the holy field around Avimukteśvara, the sanctuary of Siva) demonstrating spatial rearrangements that carved the unique ‘localized’ identity of Vārānasī with the <italic>Kāśīkṣetra</italic> as the pan-Hindu <italic>tīrtha</italic>; and accommodating conflicting folk (non-Brahmanical) and non-Banarsi ideologies within the Brahmanical fold binding their loyalties to the holy city and Brahmanical politico-ideological structure.</p>
<p>Ravi S. Singh and Rana P.B. Singh link the centrality of the worship of goddesses and <italic>Kṣetradevīs</italic> (<italic>Durgās</italic>, <italic>Gaurīs</italic> and <italic>Caṇḍīs</italic>); altered visual representation (and sometimes disappearance) of popular local deities such as Kālī and Tārā (<italic>Yoginīs</italic>), Chinnamasta, Matangi and Dhumavati (Dasamahavidyas); peripheralization of local independent goddesses (Śitālā Mātā and Sankatā Devī) to processes of Brahmanical acculturation and accommodation of previous folk customary practices and socio-cultural relations. The research paper stands out for its exhaustive compilation of various Hindu goddesses and deities within the cosmic circuit of Kāśī; descriptions of the ceremonies and characteristics of the forty one <italic>Ksetrādevis</italic>, sixty four <italic>Yoginis</italic> (local spirits), nine <italic>Durgās</italic>, twelve <italic>Gaurīs</italic>, twelve <italic>Mātṛkās</italic>, ten <italic>Caṇḍīs</italic>, and ten <italic>Dasamahavidyas.</italic> Its complex illustrations of the <italic>maṇḍalic</italic> (cosmic geometry based on a Brahmanical aesthetic) spatial organization of Banarasi temples, shrines and connecting sacred routes, and Goddess shrines in Kāśī renders it quite significant to both scholars of urbanization in Banaras as well as those dealing with socio-cultural and religious history.</p>
<p>Likewise, Annette Wilke, too explores the plurality of urban socio-cultural space and their unification in the pilgrimage city through the window of Brahmanical assimilation and accommodation. To her, the making and marking of diverse socio-cultural and ethnic spaces gleaned in the hybridized goddess worship in the temples of Banaras, each with its own set of rites, ceremonies and wealth—such as the predominantly women worshippers of Katyayani (sixth <italic>Durgā</italic>); <italic>tantric</italic> pujari and rites at Śailapurtī temple (first avatar) and Śitālā Mātā shrine; Gujarati and Maharashtrian devotees of Brahmacārinī (second <italic>Durgā</italic>); Tamil followers of Mahāgaurī (eighth <italic>Durgā</italic>); folk culture and animal sacrifices at Kūsmāndā (fourth <italic>Durgā</italic>) and so on—jointly portrayed the cosmopolitan pan-India appeal of Vārānasī in post-Independence India. Her reconstruction of shifting pilgrimage routes associated with the Banarsi Navadurga celebrations from the worship of sixty four <italic>Yoginīs</italic> in the eighth and ninth centuries to the protective circular <italic>mandlaic</italic> format of the twelfth century, comprising eight peripheral directional goddesses or <italic>Saktis</italic> and the ninth central goddess (Saubhāgyagaurī) and further on to the twentieth century <italic>yoni</italic>-like triangular route around the nine <italic>Devikṣetras (</italic>with new additions like Brahmacārinī occupying central space than the surviving eleventh and sixteenth century temples of Kūsmāndā and Annapurna respectively) demonstrates the multi layered processes that constantly shaped and reshaped the pilgrimage city in differing political and historical contexts.</p>
<p>Sunthar Visuvalingam and Elizabeth Chalier-Visuvalingam analyze the multiple encounters at the contested site of Lāt Bhairõ—‘peaceful co-existence’, ‘cultural commerce’, ‘religious symbiosis’, ‘syncretic assimilation at the folk level’ and ‘ideological struggle’—reflective of local, inter-caste and sectarian tensions affecting and shaping urban sacred geography. It critically reconstructs new angles to urban dynamics by analyzing reactions of caste Hindus (who viewed the Lāt as symbolic of the ‘punisher’ Bhairava) and Muslims, especially the lower caste <italic>julahas</italic> or weaver converts (treating it as the shrine of their ‘decapitated’ martyr saint Ghazi Miya), in different temporal periods (such as the Mughal intervention in Banaras under Aurangzeb; nineteenth century Hindu–Muslim riots of Banaras; anti-House and tax protests of 1811). Their identification of the pilgrimage city working as the ‘ideological heart’ shaping the socio-cultural lifestyle and thought of both Hindus and Indian Muslims establishes the impact of its sacred geography in mobilizing hitherto heterogeneous communities as unified power blocs claiming socio-cultural domination and politico-religious assertion.</p>
<p>The second section brings out the uniqueness of religious and patriotic maps as essentially ‘social constructs’ graphically archiving the ‘imagined’ sacred spaces in absolute terms (that often escaped being defined in terms of topographical limitations or centre–periphery relations) and thus aiding historical knowledge production of the same ‘felt’ space in a given period of time. Axel Michaels compares two early <italic>maṇḍalic</italic> maps of Vārānasī—the Kāśīdarpana of Kailasanatha Sukula (1876) and Kāśīdarpanapurti of Krsnacandra Sarma (1877)—illustrating the ‘imagined’ holy field of Kāśī (sacred routes, <italic>tīrthas</italic> and temples) as prescribed by authoritative spatial Brahmanical texts. Likewise Jörg Gengnagel reads these text-based pilgrimage maps outlining sacred spaces and routes as essentially political devices used by the religious orthodoxy and dominant classes to present the imagery of a single unified, homogenous and absolute Hindu religious space (of the <italic>tīrtha</italic>) rather than acknowledge the co-existence of heterogenous ethnic, religious and cultural spaces. Sumati Ramaswamy uses the made-to-scale twentieth century pre-Partition ‘patriotic’ printed maps deifying ‘Mother India’ and occupying the central space in the <italic>Bharat Mata mandir</italic> of Banaras—differing from contemporary pilgrimage maps of Banaras in its use of colonial scientific cartographic methodology—to demonstrate how such visual constructs were alternatively used by Indian nationalists to consolidate the idea of a homogenous and sacred ‘India’ for mobilizing the pride and loyalty of its heterogenous ethnic and regional communities against colonial domination.</p>
<p>The complexities surrounding knowledge and identity formation, both locally and internationally, is once again studied through the lens of ‘images’ predominantly photographs, panoramic paintings, sketches and ‘regional cultural artifacts’ of Banaras as researched by Niels Gutschow, Joachim K. Bautze and Sandria B Freitag that constitute the third section of this volume. Gutschow studies shifting techniques of representing space through eight panoramic paintings, including, (a) the simplistic Imperialist or missionary illustrations of 1786 and 1860s of the riverfront city; (b) the complex bird’s eye view of nationalist Banarasi authors (1860s, 1870s and 1911) archiving Banaras’ predominant ‘religious infrastructure’ and the ‘other-ness’ of Muslim rulers and the colonial government through discriminative labels such as <italic>Aurangzeb ki masjid</italic>/Aurangzeb’s mosque and the <italic>ţaun hāl</italic>/Town Hall; (c) Hindu pilgrimage maps that granted not only the ‘<italic>darshan’</italic> of Kashi’s major <italic>tīrthas</italic> to the viewer, but also encapsulated the ‘multivalent environment’ of the urban centre. While Gutschow does not develop upon the themes of urban evolution and complexities marking the city space between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries, his collection and presentation of panoramic paintings does hint at the evolution of a multifaceted town wherein the centrality of Kāśī’s sacred space was shared from the colonial period onwards with new administrative buildings, like the town hall, and these were linked to commercial spaces and peripheral zones through an intricate web of interlinked streets.</p>
<p>Likewise, Joachim K. Bautze’s and Sandria Freitag’s study of the varied and incoherent imagery of Banaras represented in photographs circulated by the ‘Orientalists’ on the one hand and regional political and economic potentates patronizing ‘cultural production’ (artisanal and craft production apart from the ‘cultural’ renaissance in Banaras) on the other hand, was often rife with inaccuracies and attempted at consolidating their respective politico-economic interests and social claims within the city space. Thus these articles, alternatively, also demonstrate how the nineteenth and twentieth century city of Banaras was culled out and created by various social actors and groups constituting several ‘mini spaces’ that often conflicted with (and sometimes were accommodated within) the dominant Brahmanical ‘pilgrimage’ space.</p>
<p>The theme of urban dynamics stemming from tension between such mini spaces inhabited by varied economic classes (reflected in the wealthy, middle class and poor neighbourhoods or <italic>mohallās</italic>); ethnic and non-national inhabitant residents (such as Nepalis); ‘service’ sector workers (craftsmen, musicians, courtesans, dancing girls and prostitutes and caste-based occupational groups, like Banarsi washermen or <italic>dhobī</italic>s is further developed in the fourth and final section of the volume. Nita Kumar, Stefan Schütte, Martin Gaenszle and Vasudha Dalmia study how urban spatial organization shaped and was in turn influenced by the engagements, identity, disciplining and organization of its resident social groups. Dalmia’s study of the <italic>tawa’ifs</italic> (prostitutes) shows their powerful and influential position within the urban circuit: as wielders of its cultural legacy (dance, music and poetry); and facilitating the flow and concentration of wealth into the urban centre. They were also donors of funds for urban undertakings and by accelerating the wheels of urban commerce through their engagements in the <italic>bazaar</italic> were represented visually in their central location within the eighteenth and early nineteenth century city layout. She grants invaluable insights into the shifting trajectory of urban identification as gained from the marginalization and peripherization of these prostitutes by late nineteenth century reformist movements upholding the sacred topography of the pilgrimage city, outlined on Brahmanical prescriptions and with a dominant ‘Sanskritized’ culture.</p>
<p>Likewise, Kumar, Schütte and Gaenszle, too explore the carving out of these mini spaces as well as its power assertions by analyzing how the living and working conditions of these social actors were regulated by such spaces. Thus in the case of the child, traditional value systems of ‘caste’, ‘class’ and ‘gender’ were imparted by the child’s family, neighbourhood and school; in the case of the <italic>dhobīs</italic> their local caste-based governing bodies defined and protected their politico-administrative interests and socio-economic relations in the urban centre. In the case of Nepali residents, appropriation of public spaces (temples, ghats, streets, and so on) was achieved by superimposing their Buddhist and <italic>tantric</italic> customary practices (rites, rituals, Buddha sculptures, and so on); financing the building of the Nepali <italic>mandir</italic> at a crucial site that was within the holy field encompassed by the sacred pilgrimage routes and by controlling the built environment and socio-cultural activities (poetry, literature and musical recitations, marriage celebrations, festivals) in semi-public spaces around areas such as Ram Ghat, Dudh Vinayak and Mangala Gauri. Nepali residents also acquired residential plots and flats, and helped to finance and maintain dharamshalas or hostels for Nepali pilgrims, as well as streets, market squares, tea stalls and entire neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>The different contributors explore almost all tropes of visual representation including historical maps, photographs, paintings, reconstructing scaled diagrams depicting pilgrimage routes and city layouts, apart from tabulating data gained from literary texts. Moreover, the thematic arrangement of the articles in the volume systematically deal with a wide range of issues such as power sharing, class and caste conflict, cultural co-existence, acculturation and the formation of mini-spaces. However some lacunae include under-researched processes such as the effects of urban markets, industries and production on city evolution and visual representation. Nevertheless this does not take away from the overall significance of this collection, making it a must read for scholars researching on urban history in general and the historical city of Banaras in particular.</p>
