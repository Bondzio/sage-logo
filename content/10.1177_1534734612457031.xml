<abstract>
<p>Lower extremity amputation (LEA) is devastating for those affected and a significant factor in health care costs. Although the overall incidence of amputation has been declining, the decline is not universal. The objectives of this study were to identify patients with nontraumatic amputation at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center (HUMC) from January 2000 to January 2007, to calculate their 1-year and 5-year mortality rates after amputation and to estimate the financial cost of those amputations. The authors searched the HUMC electronic database by ICD codes (84.10-84.18) to identify patients with LEA and subsequently searched the National Death Index database for deaths in study subjects to calculate mortality rates. HUMC is a Los Angeles County tertiary teaching medical center that provides medical care to a large percentage of the Los Angeles County population, especially those without health insurance. There were 1169 admissions in 847 patients with nontraumatic LEA with a 1-year mortality rate of 9.1% and 5-year mortality rate of 25.6%. Only major amputation and increasing age were independent risk factors for 1-year mortality rate. At 1 year, the re-amputation rate for nontraumatic LEA was 26.7%. African American and Hispanic females had a significantly higher percentage of major amputations than corresponding males and white females. The average length of hospital stay was more than double for patients with nontraumatic amputation than for all other admissions (12.7 vs 5.3 days). There were 14 846 hospital days for 1169 nontraumatic amputation admissions with an estimated cost of $47 033 767. Amputation remains common at HUMC and the associated mortality rates and economic costs are high. In the authors’ opinion, a coordinated and serious campaign by all involved in the health care system is urgently needed to implement proven and effective measures such as establishing multidisciplinary foot care clinics to reduce amputation.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>HUMC is an academic tertiary county hospital serving a large portion of uninsured patients in Los Angeles County. The study was approved by the institutional review board of Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. The HUMC electronic database was searched by procedure codes (84.10-84.18) to identify patients with a lower extremity amputation (LEA) performed January 2000 to December 2006. Also identified were patient age, gender, race, diabetes status, and dates of admission and discharge. The total number of HUMC discharges and hospitalization days per year and the average length of hospital stay at HUMC were obtained from the State of California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612457031">7</xref></sup> The National Death Index database was queried for deaths in the study subjects. Using death information through 2009, one-year mortality rates were calculated for all study subjects and 5-year mortality rates were calculated for those who had amputations in years 2000 to 2004. For patients with multiple amputations, the first amputation within the study period was considered the index amputation. Amputations preceding the study period or performed outside of HUMC were not included. Children were excluded, as were adults with traumatic or cancer-related amputations. An amputation distal to the ankle joint was considered “minor,” whereas an amputation through or proximal to the ankle joint was considered “major.” A calculator and Microsoft Excel were used to calculate percentages and averages. Chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests were used for comparing percentages.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>During the study period, 847 adult patients (617 male and 230 female) underwent 1169 amputations that met inclusion and exclusion criteria; these included 253 patients with major amputations (198 with diabetes mellitus and 55 without) and 594 patients with minor amputations (550 with diabetes mellitus and 44 without; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534734612457031">Table 1</xref>). Following the index amputation, the re-amputation rate at 1 year was 26.7%. The overall 1-year mortality rate was 9.1%; for subjects with minor LEA it was 4.9% versus 19% for those with major LEA. The 5-year mortality rate for subjects who had an LEA from 2000 to 2004 was 25.6% (162/633); this included a 19.2% rate (84/437) for those with minor LEA versus 39.8% (78/196) for those with major amputation. Major amputation and increasing age were independent risk factors for 1-year mortality (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) while diabetes status, gender, and race were not. Overall, 79% of patients with LEA were younger than 65 years and 88% were diabetics. There were 171 (19%) African American patients, 554 (60%) Hispanic, 152 (16%) white, and 47 (5%) were other minorities. Five were of unknown race. Females had a higher percentage of major amputation than males (43% vs 25%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). The average age at time of amputation for females was 58.95 years versus 53.7 years for males (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534734612457031">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Comment</title>
<p>During the study period, LEA remained common at HUMC; there was no decrease in the percentage of HUMC discharges or hospital days due to LEA over the 7-year study period. Within 1 year after a nontraumatic amputation, 35.8% of patients either died or had a re-amputation. The average length of hospital stay was more than double for patients with nontraumatic amputation than for all admissions (12.7 vs 5.3 days). In 1996, the average cost of direct medical care for 12 months following a nontraumatic toe or transtibial amputation was $45 513 and $82 657, respectively, in diabetics and $34 409 and $74 937, respectively, in nondiabetics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612457031">1</xref></sup> Based on these figures, the unadjusted estimated cost (in 1996 dollars) for nontraumatic amputation at HUMC during the study period was $47 033 767. Hispanic and African American females had a higher percentage of major amputation than white females and corresponding males. Further studies are warranted to explore the reason for this discrepancy, including the possibility that treatment of minority females differs from the treatment of white females<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734612457031">8</xref></sup> or the possibility minority females present later than males and white females in their disease process.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Amputations performed outside HUMC were not included in the study, which could result in an underestimation of the incidence of re-amputation.</p>
