<abstract>
<p>Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play a fundamental role in tissue regeneration and vascular repair both by differentiating into endothelial cells and by secretion of vasoactive substances that promote angiogenesis and maintain vascular homeostasis. It has previously been shown that hyperglycaemia impairs early and late EPC functions, such as differentiation, proliferation and adhesion. However, its role in the regulation of the production of vasoactive substances in EPCs, especially in late EPCs, is less well defined. We investigated the effects of hyperglycaemia on the production of vasodilator, fibrinolytic and angiogenic growth factors, and also on the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in late EPCs. For this purpose, late EPCs were incubated with different concentrations of D-glucose (5–40 mmol/L) for 24 hr. Levels of nitric oxide (NO), tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), prostaglandin I<sub>2</sub> (PGI<sub>2</sub>), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the activity of SOD were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Under high glucose stress conditions, late EPCs exhibited lower levels of NO, t-PA, PAI-1, PGI<sub>2</sub> and VEGF compared to control medium (5 mmol/L glucose). Moreover, high glucose was also observed to decrease the activity of SOD in late EPCs. These results suggest that hyperglycaemia-induced impairment of late EPC secretion functions could contribute to the development of vascular disease in diabetes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Loss of endothelial integrity and impaired capacity for neovascularisation are thought to contribute to vascular complications of diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1479164112444639">1</xref></sup> A growing body of evidence indicates that endothelial regeneration and repair do not exclusively rely on the proliferation of local endothelial cells but also involve bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1479164112444639">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1479164112444639">3</xref></sup> It has been shown that the number of circulating EPCs is decreased, and that functions such as proliferation, adhesion, migration and incorporation into vascular structures are impaired, in patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1479164112444639">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1479164112444639">5</xref></sup> Furthermore, the number of circulating EPCs is inversely correlated with the severity of peripheral vascular complications of patients with diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1479164112444639">6</xref></sup> However, the mechanisms underlying EPC dysfunction in diabetes have not been fully elucidated.</p>
<p>It has long been recognised that good glucose control reduces the risk of microvascular complications of diabetes such as retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1479164112444639">7</xref></sup> Moreover, the long-term follow-up of participants in the Diabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT) has demonstrated that intensive insulin treatment and glycaemic control of type 1 diabetes patients decreases the incidence of acute coronary syndromes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1479164112444639">8</xref></sup> These results suggest that hyperglycaemia is a key pathogenic factor in the development of vascular diseases in diabetes mellitus. Recently, both in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that glucose toxicity determined by hyperglycaemia is associated with impaired EPC functions. For example, Tepper et al. reported that EPCs from type 2 diabetes patients exhibit impaired proliferation, adhesion and incorporation into vascular structures, likely as a consequence of hyperglycaemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1479164112444639">5</xref></sup> Moreover, Chen et al. demonstrated that hyperglycaemia enhances senescence and reduces the tube-forming ability of early and late EPCs from adult peripheral blood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1479164112444639">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Growing evidence also suggests that EPCs contribute to the structural integrity of the vasculature, by promoting angiogenesis and maintaining vascular homeostasis through the secretion of matrix proteins, growth factors and cytokines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1479164112444639">10</xref></sup> Although many vasoactive substances can be secreted by both types of EPCs, most of the previous studies mainly focused on early, rather than late, EPCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479164112444639">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1479164112444639">12</xref></sup> Actually, late EPCs seem more important in promoting vascular integrity since they express a variety of endothelial markers and functionally differentiate into mature endothelial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1479164112444639">13</xref></sup> The present study aims to evaluate the effects of hyperglycaemia on late EPC secretion by determining the release of vasoactive substances such as nitric oxide (NO), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), prostaglandin I<sub>2</sub> (PGI<sub>2</sub>) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); and by measuring the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD).</p>

<title>Isolation of bone marrow mononuclear cells and cell culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1479164112444639">14</xref></sup></title>
<p>Whole bone marrow was isolated from both the femurs and tibias of Sprague-Dawley rats (150–175 g) (Weifang Medical University, China). Bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNCs) were fractionated by density gradient centrifugation (Histopaque®-1083, SIGMA, USA) and purity was evaluated by CD45 staining<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1479164112444639">15</xref></sup> (around 80%, Supplementary Figure S1). MNCs were plated on dishes precoated with fibronectin (ROCHE, Germany), and maintained in complete EGM-2 medium (supplemented with EGM-2 bullet kit, including 5% foetal calf serum, recombinant rat VEGF, recombinant human bFGF, Invitrogen, USA). After four days in culture, unattached cells were removed by a single washing step with phosphate buffer saline (PBS), after which fresh medium was added. Endothelial colonies subsequently appeared (on average one colony per 10<sup>7</sup> or 10<sup>8</sup> plated MNCs). Highly proliferative endothelial cells grew out from these colonies which formed a confluent monolayer. Cells in the third-fifth passage, namely late EPCs, were used for the experiments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1479164112444639">9</xref></sup> All animal protocols were approved by the local ethics committee at Weifang Medical University.</p>

<sec id="section4-1479164112444639">
<title>Identification of late EPCs</title>
<p>EPCs were characterised by the uptake of 1,1′-dioctadecyl- 3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindo-carbo-cyanine-labelled acetylated low density lipoprotein (Dil-AcLDL, Molecular Probes, USA), and by fluorescein isothiocyanate labeled Anti-Ulex Europaeus Lectin 1/UEA1 (FITC-UEA-1, SIGMA, USA) staining. In short, the adherent cells were first incubated with 2 μg/ml Dil-AcLDL for 1 hr, after which they were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and counterstained with 10 μg/ml FITC-UEA-1 for 1 hr. After staining, samples were viewed with an inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica, Germany). Cells demonstrating double-positive fluorescence were identified as differential EPCs. Furthermore, the cellular expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2(VEGFR2, eBioscience, USA, dilution 1:100), von Willebrand factor (Sigma, USA, dilution 1:200), vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin (BD, USA, dilution 1:400) and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1(eBioscience, USA, dilution 1:100) were analysed by Fluorescence Activating Cell Sorter (FACS).</p>

<sec id="section5-1479164112444639">
<title>Assay of secretion actions of late EPCs</title>
<p>To measure the secretory capacity actions of late EPCs, cultures were washed and re-fed with either basal medium, in which the D-glucose concentration was 5 mmol/L, or medium supplemented with additional glucose to reach the final concentration. To normalise for the resulting hyperosmosis, the parallel cultures were maintained in the presence of 5 mmol/L glucose and 35 mmol/L mannitol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1479164112444639">9</xref></sup> After 24 hr, the medium was collected and concentrated 10 × by centrifugation for 20 min at 5000 × g at 4<sup>°</sup>C using Ultrafree-4 centrifugal filter tubes with Biomax-5 membrane(Millipore, USA). Levels of NO, t-PA, PAI-1, PGI<sub>2</sub> and VEGF, and the activity of SOD in the cell culture supernatants, were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, RD, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, a standard or testing sample (50 μl) was added to the 96-well plate containing immobilised monoclonal antibodies. After mixing by shaking gently, the plate was incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The wells were washed five times, and incubated with HRP-conjugate reagent at 37°C for 30 min. Afterwards chromogen solution A and chromogen solution B were added to each well. The reaction was terminated after 20 min by adding the stop solution. A blank well was taken as zero, and the optical density (OD) was measured at 450 nm with an ELISA reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA).</p>

<title>Characterisation of bone marrow-derived EPCs</title>
<p>The bone marrow-derived MNCs that initially seeded were round (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1479164112444639">Figure 1A</xref>).

<title>Effects of high glucose on NO production in late EPCs</title>
<p>To investigate the effects of high glucose on NO production in late EPCs, cells were incubated for 24 hr in mediums containing different concentrations of glucose or mannitol. The cultured media were collected, and levels of NO determined by ELISA. The results show that glucose concentrations of 10 or 20 mmol/L glucose had no effects on the production of NO from EPCs. However, a glucose concentration of 40 mmol/L was observed to significantly decrease NO production compared to the control medium (5 mmol/L glucose), whereas the osmotic control did not influence the production of NO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1479164112444639">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

Our findings show that hyperglycaemia causes a reduction in NO, PGI<sub>2</sub>, t-PA, PAI-1 and VEGF in late EPCs. Furthermore, hyperglycaemia decreases the SOD activity of late EPCs.</p>
<p>NO is a major vasodilator and a key survival factor of the endothelium. Endothelial dysfunction is characterised by low bioavailability of endothelium-derived NO which itself is an independent predictor of future cardiovascular events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1479164112444639">21</xref></sup> The reduction in NO production is therefore ossibly contributory to the development of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis in diabetes mellitus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1479164112444639">22</xref></sup> Ozuyaman et al. have demonstrated that NO can stimulate EPC mobilisation from bone marrow stem cell niches to the peripheral circulation, implying that they participate in neovascularisation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1479164112444639">23</xref></sup> Furthermore, transplantation of autologous EPCs overexpressing endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in injured vessels enhances the vasculoprotective prosperities of reconstituted endothelium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1479164112444639">24</xref></sup> Therefore, it seems that NO produced by EPCs creates a favorable and optimal environment in regulating function. In the present study, we have shown that a 24 hr incubation with high glucose (40 mmol/L) significantly decreases bioavailable NO, which is in agreement with the findings of Chen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1479164112444639">9</xref></sup> Our findings are also similar to those observed in mature vascular endothelial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1479164112444639">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>It has become evident that O<sub>2<sup>-</sup></sub> is important in the development of mature endothelial cell and EPC dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1479164112444639">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1479164112444639">27</xref></sup> Increased vascular oxidative stress is closely associated with reduced extracellular SOD activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1479164112444639">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1479164112444639">29</xref></sup> It has previously been shown that EPCs have high intracellular expression levels of SOD which protects against oxidative stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1479164112444639">30</xref></sup> Tao et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1479164112444639">31</xref></sup> demonstrated that augmenting Cu/Zn SOD expression in human EPCs by shear stress accelerates O<sub>2<sup>-</sup></sub> neutralisation. This leads to an increase of EPC repair potential in the vascular system. We have here shown that high glucose decreases SOD activity. Thus decreased SOD activity may not be sufficient to neutralise the high O<sub>2<sup>-</sup></sub> caused by diabetes, which may contribute to increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease in diabetic patients. Besides NO and SOD, both clinical and experimental studies suggest that thrombus formation and plaque rupture are other major aspect of cardiovascular disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1479164112444639">32</xref></sup> Thus, we studied the effects of high glucose on the fibrinolytic factors t-PA and PAI-1. In addition to endothelial cells, EPCs also produce t-PA, at amounts comparable to that secreted by mature endothelial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1479164112444639">33</xref></sup> As the primary inhibitor of t-PA, PAI-1 also plays a critical role in the regulation of fibrinolysis, and the balance between these proteins is thought to control thrombolysis. In the present study, although high glucose was found to significantly decrease the secretion of both t-PA and PAI-1 by EPCs, the reduction of t-PA was greater than that of PAI-1. Moreover, the PAI-1/ t-PA ratios showed a positive correlation with the glucose concentration. This indicates that high glucose, by disturbing the balance between PAI-1 and t-PA, induces EPCs to exhibit decreased fibrinolytic potential which may contribute to vascular risk.</p>
<p>EPCs have high anti-thrombogenic potentials, similar to that of mature endothelial cells, and they have approximately half the anti-platelet function as compared to mature endothelial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1479164112444639">33</xref></sup> In addition to NO, PGI<sub>2</sub> is a potent inhibitor of platelet activation. Moreover, PGI<sub>2</sub> is a potent vasodilator contributing to the protection and maintenance of homeostasis in the vasculature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1479164112444639">34</xref></sup> Suppressed levels of PGI<sub>2</sub> have been reported in the early stages of diabetes. For example, the production of PGI<sub>2</sub> by the blood vessels in patients with diabetes is depressed and urinary and circulating levels of 6-keto-PGF<sub>1α</sub> are reduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1479164112444639">35</xref></sup> Furthermore, decreased PGI<sub>2</sub> has been linked to platelet hyperaggregability, increased adhesiveness and increased release of PGH<sub>2</sub> and TXA<sub>2</sub> in diabetes patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1479164112444639">36</xref></sup> Our findings show that high glucose decreases EPC production of PGI<sub>2</sub> which may contribute to increased platelet activity, and partially explain why the platelet activity recovers with improved glycaemic control in patients with diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1479164112444639">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>As one of the most important factors involved in angiogenesis as well as vasculogenesis, VEGF induces endothelial cell and EPC proliferation, migration and the recruitment of EPCs from the bone marrow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1479164112444639">38</xref></sup> Moreover, VEGF exerts strong cytoprotective and prosurvival activity by inducing expression of anti-apoptotic and antioxidant proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1479164112444639">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1479164112444639">40</xref></sup> It has also been demonstrated that gene and protein levels of VEGF are higher in EPCs compared to mature endothelial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1479164112444639">10</xref></sup> In the present study, high glucose decreased production of VEGF from EPCs which could contribute to the impairment of EPCs and EPC-related vascular repair in clinical diabetes.</p>
<p>Taken together, the present study demonstrates that hyperglycaemia exerts deleterious effects on late EPC secretion actions. These findings provide further insight into the mechanisms by which EPCs exhibit impaired vascular repair and abnormal neovasculogenesis in diabetes patients.</p>
