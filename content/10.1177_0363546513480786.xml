<sec id="section1-0363546513480786">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from humans cultured under hypoxic conditions increase bone healing capacity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513480786">
<title>Hypothesis:</title>
<p>Rat MSCs cultured under hypoxic conditions increase the tendon healing potential after transplantation into injured Achilles tendons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513480786">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Controlled laboratory study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513480786">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Biomechanical testing, histological analysis, and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling/collagen immunohistochemistry were performed to demonstrate that augmentation of an Achilles tendon rupture site with hypoxic MSCs increases healing capacity compared with normoxic MSCs and controls. Fifty Sprague-Dawley rats were used for the experiments, with 2 rats as the source of bone marrow MSCs. The cut Achilles tendons in the rats were equally divided into 3 groups: hypoxic MSC, normoxic MSC, and nontreated (vehicle control). The uncut tendons served as normal uncut controls. Outcome measures included mechanical testing in 24 rats, histological analysis, and BrdU labeling/collagen immunohistochemistry in another 24 rats.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513480786">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The ultimate failure load in the hypoxic MSC group was significantly greater than that in the nontreated or normoxic MSC group at 2 weeks after incision (2.1 N/mm<sup>2</sup> vs 1.1 N/mm<sup>2</sup> or 1.9 N/mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively) and at 4 weeks after incision (5.5 N/mm<sup>2</sup> vs 1.7 N/mm<sup>2</sup> or 2.7 N/mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively). The ultimate failure load in the hypoxic MSC group at 4 weeks after incision (5.5 N/mm<sup>2</sup>) was close to but still significantly less than that of the uncut tendon (7.2 N/mm<sup>2</sup>). Histological analysis as determined by the semiquantitative Bonar histopathological grading scale revealed that the hypoxic MSC group underwent a significant improvement in Achilles tendon healing both at 2 and 4 weeks when compared with the nontreated or normoxic MSC group via statistical analysis. Immunohistochemistry further demonstrated that the hypoxic and normoxic MSC groups had stronger immunostaining for type I and type III collagen than did the nontreated group both at 2 and 4 weeks after incision. Moreover, BrdU labeling of MSCs before injection further determined the incorporation and retention of transplanted cells at the rupture site.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546513480786">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Transplantation of hypoxic MSCs may be a better and more readily available treatment than normoxic MSCs for Achilles tendon ruptures.</p>

<p>Bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells capable of proliferating in vitro under conditions in which they remain undifferentiated and can differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes with appropriate induction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546513480786">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513480786">35</xref></sup> Recently, several studies using animal models have demonstrated that Achilles tendon healing can be accelerated by the application of MSCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513480786">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513480786">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0363546513480786">46</xref></sup> The therapeutic effects of transplantation of MSCs could be caused not only by direct differentiation of the MSCs but also by the release of paracrine factors such as growth factors and cytokines by the cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513480786">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Human MSCs expanded under hypoxic conditions (hereafter referred to as hypoxic MSCs) showed decreases in replicative senescence and increases in the proliferation rate and differentiation potential compared with MSCs cultured under normoxic conditions (normoxic MSCs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513480786">39</xref></sup> Similar results were also found in MSCs isolated from the rabbit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546513480786">44</xref></sup> and mouse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546513480786">43</xref></sup> In addition, hypoxic MSCs improved in migration and engraftment after transplantation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513480786">20</xref></sup> and secreted more cytokines and growth factors than did normoxic MSCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513480786">19</xref></sup> The conditioned media derived from hypoxic MSCs have been applied for stimulating wound<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546513480786">45</xref></sup> and fracture healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546513480786">40</xref></sup> These results suggest that hypoxic cultures provide a variety of benefits in MSCs.</p>
<p>This study aimed to investigate whether the use of hypoxic or normoxic MSCs could enhance tendon healing in a rat Achilles tendon rupture model via engraftment into type I and type III collagen–positive cells. Efforts were also made to compare the effects of hypoxic and normoxic MSCs on Achilles tendon healing through biomechanical testing, histological analysis, and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling/collagen immunohistochemistry. The results provided here will help to develop a protocol for preclinical scale-up of MSCs for transplantation in treating a tendon rupture or degeneration.</p>

<title>Rat Bone Marrow Cell Culture</title>
<p>The study protocol was approved according to the institutional animal welfare guidelines of Taipei Veterans General Hospital (Taipei, Taiwan). Both femora of 2 female Sprague-Dawley rats (BioLASCO Taiwan Co Ltd, Taipei, Taiwan), 8 to 10 weeks of age, were removed, and the soft tissues were detached aseptically. Bone marrow was extruded by inserting a 23-gauge needle into the shaft of the bone and flushed out with basal medium (α-minimal essential medium [α-MEM], Gibco-BRL, Gaithersburg, Maryland). Isolation of MSCs was performed according to similar procedures as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546513480786">43</xref></sup> In brief, mononuclear cells isolated from the bone marrow aspirates by the density gradient centrifugation method were suspended in complete culture medium (CCM: α-MEM supplemented with 16.6% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine) and seeded in plastic dishes. After 24 hours of the initial culture, nonadherent cells were removed by a change of medium and irrigation of the culture. The culture typically reaches 65% to 70% confluence within 6 to 8 days and reaches subconfluence at 9 days, when the cells (passage 0) were harvested for further subcultures. Starting from passage 1, the cells were seeded at 100 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> and grown in CCM with a medium change twice per week. For hypoxic cultures, cells were cultured in a gas mixture composed of 94% N<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 1% O<sub>2</sub>. For maintenance of the hypoxic gas mixture, an incubator with 2 air sensors, one for CO<sub>2</sub> and the other for O<sub>2</sub>, was used; O<sub>2</sub> concentration was achieved and maintained using delivery of N<sub>2</sub> gas from a tank containing pure N<sub>2</sub>. If the O<sub>2</sub> concentration rose above the desired level, N<sub>2</sub> gas was automatically injected into the system to displace the excess O<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<sec id="section10-0363546513480786">
<title>Animal Protocol</title>
<p>A total of 48 female Sprague-Dawley rats, 8 to 10 weeks of age and weighing 250 to 300 g, were used for Achilles tendon healing experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513480786">Figure 1</xref>), which involved biomechanical testing (48 tendons) and histological and immunohistochemical analyses (48 tendons). All rats were kept in single cages and fed a standard diet. The Achilles tendon surgery was conducted under general anesthesia using xylazine and ketamine. After the aseptic procedure, a transverse incision was made directly over each Achilles tendon with a surgical blade 7 mm proximal from the calcaneal insertion of each Achilles tendon. An ankle manipulation procedure was performed to confirm a complete incision. The skin was then sutured with 4-0 monofilament nylon. Next, 50 μL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without or with donor MSCs (1 × 10<sup>6</sup>) was injected around the Achilles tendon with use of a 1-mL syringe (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan). Rats with incisions to both Achilles tendons received an injection of hypoxic MSCs in the right tendon (hypoxic MSC group) and normoxic MSCs in the left tendon (normoxic MSC group), while those with an incision to only the left Achilles tendon received an injection of PBS to both left and right tendons (left side: nontreated group; right side: normal uncut group). After surgery and injection with PBS or MSCs, both ankles were placed in casts with limited range of motion but no weightbearing. Both Achilles tendons in each rat were used for either biomechanical analysis or histological evaluation.</p>

<sec id="section11-0363546513480786">
<title>BrdU Tracking System</title>
<p>The thymidine analog BrdU (10 μM) was used to label cells in a culture for 18 hours before harvest. To detect BrdU-labeled MSCs in the samples, immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence for detecting BrdU was carried out with the use of primary antibodies against BrdU (GeneTex, Irvine, California) in the 4-week specimens. The central areas of damaged tendons were assayed for BrdU-positive (BrdU<sup>+</sup>) cells. The average total BrdU<sup>+</sup> cell number (Nt) in the healed tendon was calculated according to the following formula: Nt = N × D/4 × 10<sup>3</sup>, where N is the average BrdU<sup>+</sup> cell number in 1 section (4 μm) and D (mm) is the average diameter of the Achilles tendon.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0363546513480786">
<title>Biomechanical Testing</title>
<p>The treated rats were euthanized, and the Achilles tendon with the plantaris tendon transected was harvested between the musculotendinous junction and the calcaneus at 2 and 4 weeks after incision. Six to 8 Achilles tendons in each group were used at each time point. Both ends of the Achilles tendon were fixed securely in serrated grips and mounted onto a universal testing instrument (HT-8504, Hung Ta, Taipei, Taiwan). After the specimen was clamped, a small (1-N) preload was applied to remove specimen laxity. The load cell capacity of this system was 10 N, and the Achilles tendon was pulled at a constant speed of 50 mm/min until failure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0363546513480786">
<title>Tissue Preparation, Histological Analysis, and Immunostaining</title>
<p>The harvested Achilles tendon was fixed for 1 week in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, cut into 4-μm sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Alcian blue, or Masson trichrome. For histological analyses, the evaluators were blinded to the sample groups. Histopathological analysis of longitudinal sections of the Achilles tendon was performed with use of the semiquantitative Bonar histopathological scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513480786">1</xref></sup> In brief, this scale consists of 4 features, each graded on a scale from 0 (best) to 3 (worst): (1) tenocyte (spindle cell) morphology and proliferation, (2) presence or absence of ground substance, (3) collagen bundle characteristics, and (4) vascularity. Each slide (nontreated, normoxic MSC, and hypoxic MSC groups) was examined by 3 histologists. Immunohistochemistry was applied to analyze the vascularity, distribution of type I and type III collagen, and BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells. In brief, sections were reacted with anti-CD31 (500× dilution, sc-28188, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, California), anti–type I collagen (200× dilution, ab292, Abcam, Cambridge, Massachusetts) or anti–type III collagen (200× dilution, ab7778, Abcam), or anti-BrdU (500× dilution, GTX28039, GeneTex). The sections were washed 3 times with PBS and reacted with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (BioGenex, San Ramon, California)–conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 minutes at room temperature. Finally, diaminobenzidine (BioGenex) was added for coloration. The sections were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri) and mounted. For immunofluorescence, primary antibodies against type I or type III collagen and BrdU were placed on slides at appropriate dilutions. The sections were then incubated with DyLight 594–conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG and DyLight 488–conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc, West Grove, Pennsylvania). The sections were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California) for nuclear (blue) fluorescent staining.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Statistical comparisons of the ultimate failure load and the histopathological grade among the hypoxic MSC, normoxic MSC, nontreated, and uncut groups were performed with nonparametric tests (the Kruskal-Wallis test for groups of ≥3, Mann-Whitney test for unpaired groups of 2, and Wilcoxon test for paired groups of 2) to analyze the statistical power. Differences were considered significant when the <italic>P</italic> value was &lt;.05.</p>

<title>Preparation and Expansion of MSCs Under Hypoxic and Normoxic Conditions</title>
<p>To prepare and expand MSCs under hypoxic and normoxic conditions and to compare their effects on Achilles tendon healing, MSCs were isolated from the same Sprague-Dawley rats. First, bone marrow mononuclear cells were seeded at a density of 10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> and cultured under both normoxic (air, equal to 21% O<sub>2</sub>) and hypoxic (1% O<sub>2</sub>) conditions. At 24 hours after the initial culture, nonadherent cells were removed by a change of medium and irrigation of the culture. Seventy-two hours after the initial culture, some adherent cells were observed both under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. About 9 days after the initial culture, typically most of the cells in the hypoxic culture formed aggregates, with the center reaching confluence, while the cells in the normoxic culture were still discrete in some areas (see Appendix Figure S1A, available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ajsm.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://ajsm.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>). The cells were then harvested and subcultured at a low density (100 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>), where cells always reached confluence 9 days later under hypoxic conditions, when subcultures were performed again. Interestingly, the fold increase in cell number with each passage (9-day interval) was significantly greater in the hypoxic culture since passage 1 (Appendix Figure S1B). The population doubling time (PDT) increased by up to 2-fold with an increase in passage number at passage 3 under normoxic conditions, but under hypoxic conditions, the PDT did not show a significant change compared with the earliest passages (Appendix Figure S1B). The hypoxic cells could be expanded at up to 7 passages, while normoxic cells ceased to proliferate and were unable to reach confluence or be subcultured after passage 4. Essentially, most of the cells at passage 4 in the normoxic culture became enlarged and broadly expanded, whereas the cells in the hypoxic culture were still tiny and spindle shaped (Appendix Figure S1C). These data suggest that a low-density culture combined with a hypoxic culture increases the proliferation capacity and expansion efficiency in rat MSCs.</p>
<p>We then examined the expansion insults on the stem cell properties of MSCs under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. Cells grown under both conditions had the same surface cluster of differentiation (CD) marker profiles; they were consistently positive for CD29, CD44, CD90, and CD106, the putative markers of MSCs, but negative for CD11b, CD31, and CD45, the markers of hematopoietic cells (see Appendix Figure S2A). One of the properties of MSCs is to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513480786">11</xref></sup>; therefore, hypoxic and normoxic MSCs at passage 3 were induced to undergo differentiation into osteoblasts (Appendix Figure S2B), adipocytes (Appendix Figure S2C), and chondrocytes (Appendix Figure S2D). Differentiation assays followed by histochemical staining or immunocytochemistry revealed that hypoxic MSCs increased in the differentiation potential in all the lineages compared with normoxic MSCs. For osteogenic differentiation, quantitative Alizarin Red S staining revealed that hypoxic MSCs increased in osteogenic differentiation compared with normoxic MSCs 2 weeks after induction (Appendix Figure S2B, right). For adipogenic differentiation, quantitative Oil Red O staining revealed that hypoxic MSCs increased in adipogenic differentiation compared with normoxic MSCs 2 weeks after induction (Appendix Figure S2C, right). For chondrogenic differentiation, the pellet cultures stained with Alcian blue also revealed that hypoxic MSCs increased in chondrogenic differentiation compared with normoxic MSCs 21 days after induction (Appendix Figure S2D, right). Similar with previous studies that show the positive effects of hypoxic cultures in human,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513480786">39</xref></sup> rabbit,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546513480786">44</xref></sup> and mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546513480786">43</xref></sup> MSCs, these results also demonstrate that hypoxic cultures can enhance the proliferation ability and differentiation potential in rat MSCs.</p>

<title>Macroscopic Assessment</title>
<p>We then examined the effects of hypoxic and normoxic MSCs from the same Sprague-Dawley rat donor in enhancing tendon healing after transplantation to the incised Achilles tendons for up to 4 weeks. The gapping, defined as a distance greater than 1 mm, in the Achilles tendon was hardly detectable in the hypoxic and normoxic MSC groups, and the appearances in these 2 groups were similar at 2 weeks after incision. In contrast, the Achilles tendon gapping was clearly detectable in the nontreated group at 2 weeks after incision. However, no macroscopic differences could be seen among the 3 groups at 4 weeks after incision (data not shown).</p>

<p>The ultimate failure load in the hypoxic MSC group was significantly greater than that in the nontreated group or the normoxic MSC group at 2 weeks after incision (2.08 ± 0.14 N/mm<sup>2</sup> vs 1.13 ± 0.22 N/mm<sup>2</sup> or 1.93 ± 0.13 N/mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively). At 4 weeks after incision, the ultimate failure load in the hypoxic MSC group was significantly greater than that in the nontreated group or the normoxic MSC group (5.47 ± 0.92 N/mm<sup>2</sup> vs 1.66 ± 0.13 N/mm<sup>2</sup> or 2.73 ± 0.48 N/mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively), and the tendons in the hypoxic MSC group had reached almost normal strength (7.21 ± 0.33 N/mm<sup>2</sup>).

<title>Immunostaining for MSC Engraftment</title>
<p>To examine the engraftment of donor-derived MSCs injected around the incised Achilles tendon, we analyzed paraffin sections from animals injected with MSCs labeled with BrdU before transplantation. Donor-derived BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells were detectable around the incised region not only at 2 weeks but also at 4 weeks after incision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546513480786">Figure 5A</xref>). The percentages of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells were not different between the normoxic MSC group and the hypoxic MSC group at 2 weeks, while they were significantly higher in the hypoxic MSC group than the normoxic MSC group at 4 weeks (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Calculation of the total BrdU<sup>+</sup> cell number in each tendon revealed that the average total BrdU<sup>+</sup> cell number in the tendons of the hypoxic and normoxic MSC groups was around 9.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> and 5.6 × 10<sup>5</sup>, respectively. The specificity of anti-BrdU immunostaining was demonstrated by negative controls, which were incubated in the absence of primary antibodies (Appendix Figure S3), and by negative anti-BrdU immunostaining in intact tendons, which did not receive cell transplantation (Appendix Figure S4). Because a significant difference in the BrdU<sup>+</sup> percentage was only observed at 4 weeks, only the 4-week samples were applied for in vivo differentiation study. Double immunofluorescence revealed both hypoxic and normoxic MSCs engrafted in injured Achilles tendon tissues and differentiated into cells containing type I and type III collagen fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546513480786">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546513480786">B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546513480786">C</xref>).

<p>Mesenchymal stem cells can be expanded in vitro and possess the capacity for self-renewal and multilineage potential to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546513480786">34</xref></sup> In vitro studies suggest that the induction of bone marrow MSCs into tendon cells can be achieved via the introduction of soluble, biophysical, and extracellular material factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513480786">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513480786">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513480786">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513480786">36</xref></sup> In vivo studies also demonstrate that transplanted MSCs can facilitate tendon healing in a variety of animal models, such as Achilles tendon defects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513480786">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513480786">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513480786">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513480786">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513480786">33</xref></sup> rotator cuff defects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513480786">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513480786"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513480786">18</xref></sup> and patellar tendinitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513480786">3</xref></sup> Despite the ability of MSCs to produce better histological or biomechanical outcomes in tendon healing than vehicles alone, most studies to date have not compared the effects of MSCs from different culture conditions. The current results demonstrated that MSCs from both hypoxic and normoxic cultures enhanced tendon healing in Achilles tendon defects compared with defects treated with a vehicle alone. Our data further demonstrated that hypoxic MSCs increased Achilles tendon healing with increased biomechanical strength and histological findings at 2 and 4 weeks of tendon healing compared with normoxic MSCs. Similar to the study by Tsai et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513480786">39</xref></sup> that demonstrated that hypoxic MSCs increased bone defect healing capacity, this study demonstrated that hypoxic MSCs increased tendon defect healing capacity.</p>
<p>The characteristics of MSCs expanded under hypoxic conditions were described in previous studies, which demonstrated that hypoxic MSCs show increases in proliferation capacity and differentiation potential both in vitro and in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513480786">39</xref></sup> We did not investigate the detailed mechanism by which hypoxic MSCs are determined to be better than normoxic MSCs in tendon defect healing after transplantation; however, several possibilities can be hypothesized. First, hypoxic culture improved the differentiation potential of MSCs both in vitro and in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513480786">39</xref></sup> and may also improve their ability to differentiate into tendon tissues and enhance tendon healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513480786">39</xref></sup> Second, hypoxic culture may improve the ability of MSCs to enhance regeneration by endogenous stem cells or progenitors or suppress host immune and inflammation responses after injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546513480786">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>With the use of BrdU labeling, we can trace the fate of transplanted MSCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546513480786">44</xref></sup> We found that BrdU-labeled MSCs were detectable at 2 and 4 weeks after transplantation, and the percentages were increased in the hypoxic MSCs compared with the normoxic MSCs. We also found that type I and type III collagen immunostaining was increased in defects receiving either hypoxic or normoxic MSCs compared with those receiving a vehicle alone. Moreover, the intensity of immunostaining was greater in the hypoxic MSC group compared with the normoxic MSC group. Double immunostaining with antibodies against BrdU and type I or type III collagen further demonstrated that BrdU-labeled MSCs were positive for type I or type III collagen immunostaining in both hypoxic and normoxic MSCs. These data suggest that transplanted hypoxic and normoxic MSCs contributed to tendon healing via engraftment into type I or type III collagen–positive cells. Moreover, the effects were greater in hypoxic MSCs compared with normoxic MSCs.</p>
<p>The application of MSCs in treating diseases has also recently been demonstrated in using allogeneic MSCs to treat cartilage defects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513480786">10</xref></sup> graft versus host disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546513480786">38</xref></sup> and myocardial infarction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0363546513480786">47</xref></sup> All of these studies suggest that MSCs can be an alternative source of autologous MSCs in regenerative medicine. Hypoxic MSCs are superior to normoxic MSCs when applied in treating calvarial bone defects in allogeneic recipients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546513480786">44</xref></sup> The animals used in the current study were Sprague-Dawley rats, an outbred animal strain that has been used for the investigation of allogeneic transplantation of stem cells or progenitor cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513480786">37</xref></sup> Thus, the current study may implicate the suitability of applying hypoxic MSCs for Achilles tendon healing in allogeneic recipients. The current study demonstrated that hypoxic MSCs produced a greater amount of tendon tissues in Achilles tendon defects of allogeneic recipients compared with normoxic MSCs, suggesting that a hypoxic culture provides benefit when applied in allogeneic transplantation.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to our study. We know, for example, that Achilles tendon ruptures caused by reasons other than sports injuries have been found in considerably older patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546513480786">32</xref></sup>; therefore, the results obtained by experiments using Sprague-Dawley rats at 8 to 10 weeks of age may not completely mimic clinical situations. Further attention should be paid upon application of these results in future clinical uses especially in the cases with ruptures caused by combined degeneration. Second, only a single dose was used for cell injection, and dosing effects will be explored in our future studies. Third, hypoxic MSCs produced more type I or type III collagen in vivo compared with normoxic MSCs. This may be interpreted as reflecting the better healing effect of hypoxic MSCs compared with normoxic MSCs. Although the sample injected with hypoxic MSCs decreased in Masson trichrome staining, these data did not exclude the possibility that hypoxic MSCs may increase the risk of fibrosis. Further efforts should be made to clarify this point.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the transplantation of hypoxic MSCs in Achilles tendon defects produced superior healing compared with normoxic MSCs or the intrinsic healing of nontreated Achilles tendon defects (treated with a vehicle alone). This has a clinical implication on the wider use of hypoxic MSCs for cell-based therapy for Achilles tendon defect healing, as this option is associated with a more rapid and efficient expansion that would provide MSCs with abundant amounts and reliable qualities.</p>
