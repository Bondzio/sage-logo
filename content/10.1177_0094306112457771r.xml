<p>Tom Wilber has written the only book about fracking that you would care to read. High-volume hydraulic fracturing, AKA fracking, is an industrial process that releases tiny bubbles of natural gas in layers of shale by obliterating the shale stratum with millions of gallons of highly-pressurized water, some sand, and a chemical cocktail. Josh Fox visited many of the same locations and political contests in his documentary <italic>Gasland</italic> that Tom Wilbur explores much more thoroughly and academically herein.</p>
<p>Wilber is a career journalist who covered an environmental beat around Binghamton, NY until the shale gas boom began. Two years ago he quit reporting to focus completely on writing this book, and the density of factual information and evenhanded reportorial style evident in this exposé prove he quit for the right reasons. Wilber traveled to many of the locations in the northeastern United States where property leasing, drilling, and regulating for shale gas development has been happening since the mid-2000s. His narrative combines participant observation and key-stakeholder interviewing methods with document analysis of court proceedings, government reports, and news stories to excavate emerging themes within fracking. Areas of interest include U.S. energy security, water pollution, economic transitions, resource booms and gold-rush profiteering a lá Upton Sinclair’s <italic>Oil!</italic></p>
<p>Chapter One introduces the main characters of a story which provides the narrative scaffolding for Wilber’s investigation–the immediate and permanent destruction of the Dimock, PA watershed by fracking company Cabot Oil and Gas. In Chapter Two, Wilber explains the process whereby landowners, lawyers and gas companies negotiate drilling-rights leases, using the example of a 90-million-dollar exchange between residents around Deposit, NY and the energy company XTO. Chapter Three returns the reader to Dimock in 2008 when drilling has commenced and methane begins showing up in drinking water wells. Chapter Four surveys the estimates and data that gas companies used in arguing for shale gas development, including interviews with Terry Engelder, a vocal proponent of shale gas development and professor of geosciences at Penn State. Chapter Five explores the formation of a protest movement in Dimock which sought state, federal, and corporate inquiries and investigations of mounting environmental damage to local watersheds, wells, and ecosystems. Chapter Six exposes the social fragmentation that resulted from activism against fracking and the surveillance scandal which led to the resigning of Jim Powers, Pennsylvania Homeland Security Director, for tracking the activities of Dimock protesters and even screenings of <italic>Gasland</italic>. The final chapter offers the conclusion to the Dimock affair, an out-of-court settlement, and paints a foreboding future for Pennsylvania under Republican governor Tom Corbett, a pro-industry conservative known for his outspoken support of stripping government oversight and regulation out of industrial practice.</p>
<p>This book is of interest to rural sociologists, environmental sociologists, and anyone who wonders how and why their natural gas bill has been so low recently. Geographers also may find resonance with issues of environmental governance and the production of scale in shale gas discourse.</p>
