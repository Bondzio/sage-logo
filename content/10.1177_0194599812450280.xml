<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>Seventy-six revision endoscopic DCRs were randomized into 2 groups: endoscopic DCR with mitomycin (group I), where 0.5 mg/mL mitomycin C was applied for 10 minutes, and endoscopic DCR without mitomycin (group II).

<title>Results</title>
<p>Causes of failure in the original 92 patients included canalicular obstruction (14%), small misplaced bony window (43%), very small nasolacrimal stoma due to development of synechia (23%), and complete closure of nasolacrimal stoma with tough fibrous tissue (63%).

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Recurrent nasolacrimal duct obstruction after primary endoscopic DCR is mainly due to reclosure of the nasolacrimal stoma with synechia and fashioning of the small misplaced bony window. Mitomycin C does not increase the success rate of revision endoscopic DCR. It is a safe procedure and may be of value only in patients inaccessible to strict follow-up because it induces a better healing profile in terms of mucosal recovery, wound healing, and less need for debridement sessions.</p>

<p>Epiphora may be induced by hypersecretion, lacrimal pump dysfunction, and lacrimal outflow obstruction. The advent of dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) provided a revolution in the management of tearing secondary to nasolacrimal duct obstruction. It can be performed through an external or endonasal approach. The endonasal approach was introduced by Caldwell in 1893.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812450280">1</xref></sup> However, the popularity of endonasal DCR did not increase until the 1980s because of the difficulty in visualizing the endonasal anatomy during surgery. In 1988, Rice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812450280">2</xref></sup> demonstrated that endoscopic DCR was a viable option in cadaver studies. The first clinical study of endoscopic DCR was published by McDonogh and Meiring in 1989.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812450280">3</xref></sup> Success rates of endoscopic DCR in revision cases have been shown to be lower than primary DCR. Success rates up to 94% have been reported with primary endonasal DCR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812450280">4</xref></sup> On the other hand, success rates of revision endoscopic DCR have been shown to be between 60% and 84%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812450280">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812450280">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Mitomycin C is an aminoglycoside antibiotic with alkylating antineoplastic potential. It is synthesized by the fungus <italic>Streptomyces caespitosus</italic>. It prevents replication of fibroblasts and epithelial cells, being active against all cells, regardless of the cell cycle phase. It selectively interrupts DNA replication and inhibits mitosis and protein synthesis, thus affecting the healing process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812450280">7</xref></sup> In the field of otolaryngology, mitomycin C has been tried as an adjunct in different procedures such as functional endoscopic sinus surgery, management of laryngotracheal reconstruction, surgery for choanal atresia, and myringotomy. In the field of ophthalmology, it has been used with success in glaucoma, pterygium, and prevention of subepithelial fibrosis after refractive corneal surgery. However, results in endoscopic DCR are still controversial, with some authors reporting some benefit in improving the success rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812450280">8</xref></sup> but others demonstrating no benefit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812450280">9</xref></sup> To our knowledge, only 1 prospective randomized controlled trial in the literature has discussed the effect of mitomycin C in revision endoscopic DCR. It had a small sample size, with only 15 patients in the mitomycin group, and a short follow-up period of 6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812450280">6</xref></sup> Therefore, the aim of this study was (1) to conduct an adequately powered prospective randomized controlled trial investigating the safety and efficacy of mitomycin C–enhanced revision endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy in adult patients with recurrent nasolacrimal obstruction and (2) to analyze causes of failure after primary endoscopic DCR.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Adult patients with a history of recurrent epiphora after endoscopic DCR were investigated using lacrimal irrigation and probing of the canaliculi with a blunt-tipped Bangerter lacrimal cannula. The lids were inspected, focusing on the positions of the lacrimal puncta and the function of the orbicularis muscle. Dacryocystography was performed on all patients in the department of radiology. Examination of the nose was done using rigid 0- and 30-degree endoscopes (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) to reveal any nasal abnormality and assess the site of the old nasolacrimal stoma. Only patients with patent canaliculi, normal eye lid function, no suspected lacrimal sac neoplasia, no nasal pathology, recurrent acquired complete nasolacrimal obstruction after single endoscopic DCR, and duration of persistent symptoms more than 1 year after the primary surgery were included in this study. Exclusion criteria were canalicular or common canalicular obstruction ascertained with probing, noticeable lower lid laxity, age younger than 18 years, Down’s syndrome, suspicion of malignancy, radiation therapy, posttraumatic bony deformity, and bone diseases. The protocol of the study and the methods of consent had been approved by the Taiba Research Ethics Committee. After application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 76 participants were recruited between 2004 and 2011 to undergo revision endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy. There were 27 men and 49 women, with a mean (SD) age of 43.6 (10.4) years. They were prospectively equally randomized into 2 groups: revision endoscopic DCR with mitomycin C application (group I) and revision endoscopic DCR without mitomycin C application (group II). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812450280"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref> shows the flowchart of the study.</p>

<title>Group I</title>
<p>Surgery was performed under local anesthesia and minimal sedation. According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists, minimal sedation is a drug-induced state during which patients respond normally to verbal commands. Cognitive function and coordination may be impaired, whereas ventilatory and cardiovascular functions are unaffected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812450280">10</xref></sup> To reach such a state of minimal sedation, all patients received 50 mg pethidine 30 minutes before the operation. Local anesthesia consisted of infratrochlear and infraorbital blocks using lidocaine 2% with 1:100,000 epinephrine. Lidocaine with epinephrine was infiltrated in the anterior part of the middle turbinate and along the lateral wall of the nose around the proposed site, and nasal packs soaked in 1:100,000 epinephrine were applied as well. The procedure started with lacrimal punctual dilatation, and then a 20-gauge vitrectomy light pipe was threaded through the upper canaliculus. Using rigid 0- and 30-degree endoscopes (Karl Storz), the nasal cavity was assessed. Transillumination was seen, and the position of the lacrimal sac was defined. Fibrous tissue and remnants of mucosa overlying the transilluminated area were removed. The anterior part of the middle turbinate was partially resected if there was a synechia between it and the transilluminated area. The remnant of bone overlying the transilluminated area was drilled using a diamond burr to allow the light pipe tip to indent the lacrimal sac mucosa when held almost horizontally in the superior canaliculus. The lacrimal sac mucosa was tented with the light pipe, and the widest possible window was opened in the medial wall of the lacrimal sac using a knife blade. Further resection of the medial wall of the sac was performed using pediatric angled endoscopic scissors and forceps. The lacrimal sac specimen was submitted to histopathology in all cases. Irrigation through both the superior and inferior canaliculus was assessed, and if there was any resistance or reflux, additional bone and lacrimal sac mucosa were removed. In all cases, a small piece of cotton soaked with 0.5 mg/mL mitomycin C was applied to the nasolacrimal stoma site for 10 minutes. Last, a standard bicanalicular silicon intubation of the lacrimal passages was done, and the tube was tied and left in the nasal cavity.</p>

<sec id="section9-0194599812450280">
<title>Group II</title>
<p>Anesthesia and surgery were the same as group I, but no mitomycin C was applied to the nasolacrimal stoma.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0194599812450280">
<title>Postoperative Course and Follow-up</title>
<p>A course of postoperative oral antibiotics, steroid-decongestant nasal spray, alkaline nasal douche, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications were prescribed after surgery. Patients were sent home the same day of surgery. Regular follow-up settings were done weekly in the first month, then every 2 weeks in the next 3 months, and then monthly after that to document the patient’s subjective improvement, to debride the wound of any crustations or granulations, to judge ostium patency on irrigation, and to record any complications. The silicone stent was removed at the 3-month setting, and patients were followed 12 months after silicon tube removal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0194599812450280">
<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p>To maintain exactly equal treatment numbers in both groups, randomization was done using random blocks, which is a stratified random sampling that allows homogeneous blocks of the sample size. A sample size of 70 procedures was calculated at the 5% level of significance to give the study a statistical power of 80%. However, 76 procedures were performed to compensate for any loss during the follow-up period. The primary end point was determined to be the success of the surgery, as defined by the subjective disappearance of symptoms, because we believe that symptom clearance is the benchmark for success of any surgery and that functional results are more important than anatomical ones. At the time of randomization and during the follow-up period, both the patient and the investigator were unaware of the group assignment. The group assignment was placed in consecutively numbered envelopes, which were allocated to the successive cases in chronological order. The envelope was opened on the day of the operation. During the follow-up period, the patient was assigned to a different investigator. The patient file was coded and linked to a study sheet. The study sheet summarized all the information related to the patient except the operative data. The sheet was copied and added to the patient file after each session, whereas the original sheet was kept in the study folder. The analysis was done using SPSS version 17 for Windows statistics software package (SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, Illinois). Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). <italic>P</italic> values &lt;.05 were considered significant. Parametric tests such as the paired <italic>t</italic> test and 2-sample <italic>t</italic> test were applied for data that followed or were transformed to a normal distribution. Nonparametric tests such as the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, and χ<sup>2</sup> test were applied for data that did not follow a normal distribution.</p>

<title>Flowchart and Baseline Characteristics</title>
<p>Thirty-eight procedures in each group were included in the analysis at the 6-month setting, whereas 3 patients in group I and 2 patients in group II were lost in the 12-month setting. No significant difference between the 2 groups was found in the patient demographic characteristics (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). Analysis of the causes of failure in the original sample of 92 patients showed that 14% had canalicular obstruction and were excluded from the study, 43% had a small inferiorly misplaced bony window, 23% had a very small nasolacrimal stoma due to development of synechia, and 63% had a complete closure of the nasolacrimal stoma with tough fibrous tissue. Mixed causes of failure were found, including a misplaced bony window with small stoma in 15% and a misplaced window with complete closure in 28% of the cases.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Endoscopic DCR has become increasingly popular in the management of nasolacrimal duct obstruction. It has several advantages. These include lack of a cutaneous incision and the possibility of assessing intranasal pathology and an assortment of secondary procedures at the time of surgery. Blood loss and risk of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea are minimal in experienced hands. Endoscopic DCR can be safely performed under local anesthesia as an office-based procedure. Unfortunately, the success rate of revision endoscopic DCR is still lower than primary endoscopic DCR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812450280">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812450280"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812450280">6</xref></sup> Failure of DCR is commonly secondary to position and size of the ostium, common canalicular obstructions, intranasal abnormalities, development of synechia, and lacrimal fossa pathology. Most authors have stated that soft tissue obstruction of the neo-ostium with granulation tissue and synechia is the most common cause of DCR failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812450280">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812450280">12</xref></sup> Analysis of the causes of failure in the original sample of 92 patients showed that 14% had canalicular obstruction, 43% had a small misplaced bony window, 23% had a very small nasolacrimal stoma due to development of synechia, and 63% had a complete closure of the nasolacrimal stoma with a tough fibrous tissue. Mixed causes of failure were found, including a misplaced bony window with small stoma in 15% and a misplaced window with complete closure in 28% of the cases. Konuk et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812450280">13</xref></sup> reported similar common causes of failure after primary external DCR. These findings suggest that inhibition of the postoperative growth of fibrous tissue into the fistula may be crucial for a successful DCR. To achieve such inhibition, many modifications have been attempted, including the use of mitomycin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812450280">6</xref></sup> Therefore, the main aim of this study was to conduct a prospective randomized controlled trial investigating the safety and efficacy of mitomycin C–enhanced revision endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy in adult patients with recurrent nasolacrimal obstruction.</p>
<p>In the current study, mitomycin C–enhanced revision endoscopic DCR had a longer operative time with a comparable success rate and safety profile. The longer operative time could be explained by the 10-minute difference needed in all cases to apply mitomycin. Penttila et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812450280">6</xref></sup> reported a success rate of 93% in endoscopic DCR with mitomycin vs 60% in endoscopic DCR without mitomycin in a small cohort of 30 patients and a short follow-up of 6 months after surgery. Interestingly, they used a lower dose (0.4 mg/mL) and a shorter duration (5 minutes) of mitomycin than ours. Their very low figure of a success rate in endoscopic DCR without mitomycin is also questionable. They indicated that their small sample size was the cause of failure to find a statistical significant difference between the 2 groups. The defect in their short 6-month follow-up could be realized from the point that 3 of the 6 failure cases in our mitomycin group occurred between 4 and 6 months after stent removal (ie, between 7 and 9 months after surgery). We had about an 81% success rate in the nonmitomycin group 15 months after surgery. Kominek et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812450280">14</xref></sup> reported an 84% success rate in nonmitomycin revision endoscopic DCR in their cohort of 44 patients. Korkut et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812450280">15</xref></sup> reported an 84% success rate in revision endoscopic DCR without mitomycin as well. Zilelioglu et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812450280">16</xref></sup> studied the use of mitomycin in 17 cases of revision endoscopic DCR, reporting a 75% success rate for the mitomycin group vs 77.7% for the nonmitomycin group.</p>
<p>In this study, revision endoscopic DCR with mitomycin showed a significantly better healing profile with a lower number of debridement settings to clean granulations and crustations. It did not reflect any significant increase in the success rate of group I. This may be attributed to the strict follow-up in our series of cleaning the wound from granulations and crustations using endoscopic pediatric scissors and forceps. Postoperative care after endonasal DCR should include removal of fibrin, crusts, and granulations. Appropriate postoperative care is essential to prevent endonasal synechia and subsequent recurrences. Jin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812450280">17</xref></sup> demonstrated that improper postoperative care was one of the main causes of their lower success rate.</p>
<p>Epistaxis and synechiae were the only adverse events encountered in our study, with no significant difference between the 2 groups. Endoscopic DCR has been reported to be associated with some adverse events such as bleeding, synechiae, orbital injury, and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812450280">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812450280"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812450280">20</xref></sup> Although we did not encounter any significant adverse events with the use of mitomycin, some authors have demonstrated some mitomycin-induced complications in eye surgery, including secondary glaucoma, corneal perforation, secondary cataract, and scleral calcification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812450280">21</xref></sup> Previous studies have reported the safe use of mitomycin in external and endonasal DCR operations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812450280">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599812450280">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, we assume that the key points for improving the success rates and preventing recurrences after endoscopic DCR are (1) using transillumination through the superior canaliculus to exactly identify the anatomical confines of the lacrimal sac; (2) proper removal of the medial wall of the lacrimal sac; (3) delicate dissection to minimize the incidence of synechia; (4) strict follow-up regimens to remove fibrin, crusts, and granulations once weekly in the first month and then every 2 weeks until complete healing with no need for debridement in 2 successive settings; and (5) typical application of mitomycin C in patients not available for close follow-up.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Recurrent nasolacrimal duct obstruction after primary endoscopic DCR is mainly due to reclosure of the nasolacrimal stoma with synechia and fashioning of a small and/or misplaced bony window. Mitomycin C does not increase the success rate of revision endoscopic DCR. It is a safe procedure and may be of value only in patients inaccessible to strict follow-up because it induces a better healing profile in terms of mucosal recovery, wound healing, and less need for debridement sessions.</p>
