<sec id="section1-0890334413478177">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Recommendations for the introduction of solids and fluids to an infant’s diet have changed over the past decade. Since these changes, there has been minimal research to determine patterns in the introduction of foods and fluids to infants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0890334413478177">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>This retrospective cohort study surveyed mothers who birthed in Queensland, Australia, from February 1 to May 31, 2010, around 4 months postpartum. Frequencies of foods and fluids given to infants at 4, 8, 13, and 17 weeks were described. Logistic regression determined associations between infant feeding practices, the introduction of other foods and fluids at 17 weeks, and sociodemographic characteristics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0890334413478177">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Response rate was 35.8%. At 17 weeks, 68% of infants were breastfed and 33% exclusively breastfed. Solids and water had been introduced in 8.6% and 35.0% of infants, respectively. The introduction of solids by 17 weeks was associated with younger maternal age and the infant being given water and infant formula at 4 weeks. The infant being given water at 17 weeks was associated with younger maternal age, the infant being given infant formula at 4 weeks, level of education, relative socioeconomic disadvantage, parity, and birth facility.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0890334413478177">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Over the past decade, there has been a significant reduction in the proportion of infants in Australia who have been given solids by 17 weeks. Sociodemographic characteristics and formula feeding practices at 4 weeks were associated with the introduction of solids and water by 17 weeks. Further research should examine these barriers to improve compliance with current infant feeding recommendations.</p>

<title>Well Established</title>
<p><italic>Although there are debates about the ideal time to introduce foods/fluids other than breast milk to an infant, there is consensus that solids should not be commenced before 17 weeks. However, many infants are given other foods/fluids prior to 17 weeks.</italic></p>

<title>Newly Expressed</title>
<p><italic>The proportion of Australian infants receiving solids before 17 weeks fell from 44.0% in 2002-2003 to 8.6% in 2010. Infants had twice the odds of being given solids at 17 weeks if they had received water by 4 weeks.</italic></p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>The ideal timing for introducing foods and fluids besides breast milk to an infant’s diet is controversial and subject to continuing debate more than 10 years after the World Health Organization (WHO) changed its recommendation for infants to be exclusively breastfed (no other foods/fluids except vitamins, mineral supplements, and medicines) to 6 months rather than to 4-6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334413478177">1</xref></sup> In 2003, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) in Australia also changed its infant feeding guidelines to recommend the introduction of solids “around 6 months” rather than 4-6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334413478177">2</xref></sup> These guidelines are presently under revision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334413478177">3</xref></sup> Although recommendations rarely address the needs of exclusively formula-fed infants, similar recommendations for the introduction of solid or semisolid foods are generally given. Some commentaries identify complementary foods as foods or fluids other than breast milk or infant formula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334413478177">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although there is dispute in some sectors about the optimal time for the introduction of solids, there is consensus that other foods and fluids should not be introduced to either breast or formula-fed infants before 17 weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334413478177">4</xref></sup> because of an increased risk of infection,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334413478177">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334413478177"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334413478177"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334413478177">8</xref></sup> obesity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334413478177">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334413478177">10</xref></sup> and allergy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334413478177">4</xref></sup> Breastfed infants do not require water, even in hot conditions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334413478177">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0890334413478177"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334413478177">13</xref></sup> and there is no evidence that infants consuming appropriately prepared infant formula need water either.

<p>Since changes in WHO recommendations around the introduction of solid foods, there has been little research to determine patterns in the introduction of foods and fluids other than breast milk to infants in the first 17 weeks of life. Furthermore, there is no evidence for how the introduction of water might be associated with other infant feeding variables (such as formula feeding or the introduction of solids) or with maternal sociodemographic variables that could indicate sub-populations at higher risk of early introduction of food and other fluids.</p>
<p>The aims of this article were to determine (1) the proportion of infants receiving foods and fluids other than breast milk within the first 17 weeks and (2) the maternal sociodemographic and infant feeding variables associated with the introduction of solids and water before 17 weeks in an Australian population.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Participants were women who completed the 2010 Having a Baby in Queensland Survey, a retrospective cohort study of women birthing in Queensland, Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0890334413478177">25</xref></sup> Queensland is the third most populous (4,600,000 people in 2011) and second largest (1,730,648 sq km) state in Australia. All women who (1) had a live single or multiple birth in Queensland between February 1 and May 31, 2010, (2) did not have an infant who died after birth, and (3) had a complete and accurate mailing address in their Queensland Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages records were mailed a survey approximately 4 months after birth. Women could complete the paper survey and return it by reply paid mail or complete the survey over the telephone (using a translator if required) or via a secure online survey system. Reminder/thank you slips were mailed to all participants 2 weeks after the initial survey mailing. Ethical approval for the 2010 Having a Baby in Queensland Survey was obtained from the Behavioural and Social Sciences Ethical Review Committee of The University of Queensland.</p>
<sec id="section9-0890334413478177">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The 2010 Having a Baby in Queensland Survey was based on a pilot survey distributed in 2009 (N = 772).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0890334413478177">26</xref></sup> Changes or additions to the pilot items were tested for face validity by in-depth interviews with five recent maternity care consumers. The 167-item survey contained demographic items and items relating to pregnancy, birth, infant feeding, and postbirth care.</p>
<sec id="section10-0890334413478177">
<title>Infant feeding</title>
<p>Two questions specifically asked about infant feeding. One asked, “How old was your baby when he or she tried each of the following for the first time?” for breast milk; infant formula; vitamins, mineral supplements, or medicine; plain water; sweetened water; fruit juice; tea or infusion; tinned, powdered, or fresh milk; solid or semi-solid food; and oral rehydration solutions (ORS). Participants could tick “never” or enter the appropriate age in days, weeks, or months. Time of introduction of other fluids or foods was converted to weeks and variables were derived for whether each type of food/fluid had been introduced by 4, 8, 13, or 17 weeks. Plain and sweetened water were combined to form one “water” variable. Seventeen weeks was chosen as the last time point to include the majority of survey responses.</p>
<p>The second question asked, “How old was your baby when he or she last had breast milk?” with the following responses: in the last 24 hours; my baby has never had breast milk; or age reported in number of days, weeks, or months. Time of cessation of breastfeeding was converted to weeks.</p>
<p>Any breastfeeding at 4, 8, 13, and 17 weeks reflects women who had not ceased breastfeeding by 4, 8, 13, or 17 weeks, while exclusive breastfeeding rates included infants who were breastfed and had not received infant formula, water, fruit juice, tea or infusion, milk of any type, solid or semi-solid foods, or ORS by 4, 8, 13, and 17 weeks.</p>
<p>A variable was also derived to distinguish infants who were fully formula-fed from those who were breastfed and had had some formula (partially formula-fed) and from those who had not had any infant formula since birth (not formula-fed, although they may have had other fluids or solids).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0890334413478177">
<title>Sociodemographic characteristics</title>
<p>Maternal age (in whole years) was calculated from maternal and infant birth dates and then grouped in 5-year intervals from younger than 20 to 40 and older. Parity was dichotomously characterized as primiparous or multiparous. Type of birth facility recorded whether women birthed in a public or private facility. Three categories of relative socioeconomic disadvantage were derived based on deciles of Socioeconomic Index for Areas (SEIFA): high (1-4), medium (5-7), and low (8-10).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0890334413478177">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Level of maternal education was collapsed to a dichotomous variable to reflect whether women had completed secondary level education or not.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0890334413478177">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Area of residence was assessed using four categories based on the Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA) classification: major city, inner regional, outer regional, remote, and very remote.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0890334413478177">29</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0890334413478177">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Results were analyzed using SPSS for Windows (version 20.0).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0890334413478177">30</xref></sup> Sociodemographic characteristics of the sample were compared to those for the total Queensland population of birthing women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0890334413478177">31</xref></sup> using a chi-square test for discrete variables. Numbers and percentages were used to present the frequency of different foods and fluids given to infants in the first 17 weeks.</p>
<p>Univariate logistic regression determined associations between the degree of formula feeding and the introduction of other foods and fluids at 17 weeks. Univariate logistic regression was also used to determine associations between the introduction of solids at 17 weeks and (1) non-modifiable sociodemographic variables such as age, parity, level of education, rurality, socioeconomic disadvantage, and type of birthing facility; and (2) other types of infant feeding at 4 weeks, including fully formula feeding, partial formula feeding, and no formula feeding; vitamins, mineral supplements, and medicines; and water. A similar analysis was undertaken to assess the association between the introduction of water at 17 weeks and (1) the same non-modifiable sociodemographic variables; and (2) other types of infant feeding at 4 weeks, including fully formula feeding, partial formula feeding, and no formula feeding; vitamins, mineral supplements, and medicines; and solids. Variables that were significant in the unadjusted analysis were included in the final logistic regression model to determine the independent associations between each factor and introduction of solids and introduction of water. Because of the large cohort, alpha was set at .01 for all analyses.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0890334413478177" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Surveys were sent to 20 056 eligible women and 7194 returned usable data for a response rate of 35.8%. A further 724 women were excluded from the analysis because of completion of the survey before 17 weeks (1), uncertainty of the age of the infant at survey completion (239), no data concerning the introduction of solids (134) and water (4), and no or unreliable breastfeeding data (346), leaving a cohort of 6470 women.</p>
<p>The survey participants were more likely to be older, be born in Australia, live in a major city, be primiparous, and birth in a private facility compared to all women who birthed in Queensland around that time (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0890334413478177">Table 1</xref>). Most women had completed secondary schooling.</p>

<p>By 4 weeks, 40.1% of infants had been given infant formula, increasing to almost 60% by 17 weeks (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0890334413478177">Table 2</xref>). By 17 weeks, more than 35% of infants had received water and nearly 30% had had vitamins, mineral supplements, or medicines whereas a small number of infants had been offered fruit juice or teas. Only a few infants were given solid or semi-solid foods within the first 8 weeks. However, more than 8% of infants had been fed solids by 17 weeks.</p>

<p>At 17 weeks, infants who were being fully formula-fed had 4 times the odds of being introduced to water (58.4% vs 24.3%; unadjusted odds ratio [OR], 4.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.91-4.88), 3 times the odds of having had solids (15.1% vs 5.6%; unadjusted OR, 3.00; 95% CI, 2.51-3.57) and fruit juice (2.8% vs 0.9%; unadjusted OR, 3.09; 95% CI, 2.06-4.64), and 1.3 times the odds of having had vitamins, mineral supplements, or medicines (33.5% vs 28.0%; unadjusted OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.16-1.45) than infants who were having some breast milk.</p>

<title>Predictors for Introducing Solids or Water</title>
<p>In unadjusted logistic regression analyses, women had significantly higher odds of having introduced solids by 17 weeks if they were younger than 25, had not completed secondary education, lived in an inner regional area compared to a major city, were primiparous, birthed in a public hospital, had introduced water by 4 weeks, and were fully or partially formula feeding at 4 weeks (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0890334413478177">Table 3</xref>). Women who had moderate to low socioeconomic disadvantage had lower odds of introducing solids by 17 weeks. Data for maternal body mass index (BMI) were available for half the cohort but were not a significant univariate predictor of the early introduction of solids (data not shown). Fruit juice, other milks, teas and infusions, and ORS were not included in the analysis because of the small numbers of infants who were given these fluids by 17 weeks.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This is the first Australian study to comprehensively examine the introduction of foods and fluids other than breast milk to infants following changes in WHO and NHMRC recommendations for the introduction of complementary foods and fluids around 6 months rather than 4-6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334413478177">2</xref></sup> We found that 67% of infants had received other foods or fluids before 17 weeks of age, the most common addition being infant formula. Nevertheless, more than a third of infants had received water and nearly 30% had received vitamins, mineral supplements, or medicines even though there are no universal recommendations for infants to receive water or vitamin or mineral supplements in Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334413478177">2</xref></sup> More than 8% of infants had been given solid foods. Only a small proportion (less than 2%) of infants had received teas, other milks, fruit juice, or ORS. This is in contrast to the findings by Koh et al in a study of a cohort in Perth, Australia, in 2002-2003 where 12.3% of infants had been given fruit juice before 17 weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0890334413478177">22</xref></sup> and two studies from the United States where 24.0% and 7.9% of infants had received juice by 3 months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0890334413478177">32</xref></sup> and 4 months,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334413478177">19</xref></sup> respectively. The reduction in proportion of infants receiving juice may be due to changes in advertising regarding recommendations that infants only receive fruit juice when they are 6 months or older.</p>
<p>Infants who were exclusively formula-fed at 17 weeks had significantly higher odds of receiving solids and other fluids compared to infants who were receiving some breast milk. Other researchers have also found that there was a significant difference in the earlier introduction of solids between formula-fed (37.2%) and breastfed infants (17.3%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334413478177">15</xref></sup> Formula-fed infants are already at increased risk from a variety of infectious and chronic disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0890334413478177">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0890334413478177"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0890334413478177">35</xref></sup> Recent research indicates that in this population, introducing solids early resulted in a 6-fold increase in odds of obesity when the child was 3 years old, whereas no such association was evident for breastfed infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334413478177">9</xref></sup> Therefore, appropriately timed introduction of solids is as important, if not more so, for formula-fed infants than breastfed infants.</p>
<sec id="section16-0890334413478177">
<title>Solids</title>
<p>Since the recommended time for the introduction of solids in Australia changed from 4-6 months to 6 months in 2003, there has been a significant reduction in the proportion of infants given solids by 17 weeks—from 44.0% in 2002-2003 to 8.6% in the present study. Although many Australian women are still introducing solids before the recommended 6 months (eg, 56.2% at 5 months),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0890334413478177">23</xref></sup> this figure is also much less than in 2001 when 88% of infants had received solids by 26 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0890334413478177">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Results of studies investigating the introduction of foods and fluids to the infant’s diet are difficult to compare across jurisdictions because of differing recommendations, study definitions and methodologies, and cultural influences. In one study covering 5 European countries, the proportion of breastfed infants receiving solids at 4 months ranged from 4.9% to 43.2%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334413478177">15</xref></sup> In other cohorts from the late 1990s and early 2000s, around 20% of infants received solids before 4 months,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334413478177">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0890334413478177">17</xref></sup> and 47% at 4 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334413478177">16</xref></sup> Even in the mid-2000s, 71.3% of infants had begun solids by 17 weeks in Ireland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0890334413478177">18</xref></sup> and 21% by 15 weeks in the United States,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334413478177">19</xref></sup> although this level was much less in Switzerland (5% at 16 weeks).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0890334413478177">36</xref></sup> A drop in the early introduction of solids following the change in infant feeding recommendations is not unique to Australia with similar results being noted elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0890334413478177">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is apparent that many women introduce solids earlier than recommended for a variety of reasons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0890334413478177">37</xref></sup> Not all professional organizations agree with the recommendations to delay the introduction of solids until 6 months,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334413478177">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0890334413478177">38</xref></sup> whereas others are proposing that recommendations be changed from 6 months back to 4-6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0890334413478177">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0890334413478177">39</xref></sup> Any changes to the recommendations away from 6 months may result in an increase in the proportion of infants who receive solids by 17 weeks. As well as the increased health risks associated with the introduction of solids at this time, there is now evidence that introducing solids reduces the amount of breast milk consumed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0890334413478177">40</xref></sup> and may result in earlier weaning from the breast.</p>
<p>Our study found that introducing water before 4 weeks of age was also associated with increased odds of an infant also being introduced to solids prematurely, regardless of the method of infant feeding. In addition, similar to previous studies, younger maternal age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334413478177">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334413478177">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334413478177">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334413478177">20</xref></sup> and formula feeding (fully or partially)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334413478177">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0890334413478177">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0890334413478177"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334413478177"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334413478177">20</xref></sup> were associated with the early introduction of solids.

<title>Water</title>
<p>Although a number of studies have investigated the introduction of water to the infant’s diet within the first weeks of life,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334413478177">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0890334413478177">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0890334413478177"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0890334413478177">43</xref></sup> few have examined water consumption later in infancy and none have considered the effect of water introduction on the introduction of other foods and fluids. In this study, the proportion of infants receiving water rose from 13.1% at 4 weeks to 35.2% at 17 weeks. Nearly 60% of formula-fed infants and a quarter of breastfed infants were given water by this age. In a recent California study, 14.3% of infants were having water 4-6 weeks postpartum,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0890334413478177">42</xref></sup> whereas an earlier study found that 24.7% of infants had been given water during the first month.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0890334413478177">41</xref></sup> Although there are no Australian recommendations for formula-fed infants to be given water routinely,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334413478177">2</xref></sup> formula-feeding mothers may have thought that their infant needed water, and this may account for the higher odds of water introduction in this group.</p>
<p>Similar to associations with early introduction of solids, younger women and those fully or partially formula feeding at 4 weeks had higher odds of early introduction of water. Other factors increasing the odds of the infant receiving water included not completing secondary education, high socioeconomic disadvantage, being primiparous, and birthing in a public facility. Introducing solids by 4 weeks was not associated with being given water at 17 weeks after accounting for all other significant associations.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The low response rate for this study introduces the risk of bias in our sample. The fact that sampling was via birth notifications with minimal exclusions reduces this risk somewhat. However, the survey participants were not necessarily representative of all Queensland women who birthed around the time of the survey, and these results may not be transferable to other areas in Australia or in other countries because of differences in health systems, cultural influences, and infant feeding recommendations.</p>
<p>This retrospective survey also relies on maternal recall for the method of infant feeding and the timing of the introduction of other foods and fluids. As most women completed the questionnaire when their infants were 4-5 months old, recall bias would be limited.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It was found from the results of this study that changes to the Australian recommendation to introduce solids to around 6 months were associated with a reduction in the number of infants receiving solids before 17 weeks. These findings should be considered when reviewing and formulating infant feeding guidelines and advising mothers about introducing solids. Steps to reduce unnecessary and inappropriate water supplementation, in both breastfed and formula-fed infants, may also have the potential to influence the addition of other foods to the infant’s diet.</p>
<p>Informing women (particularly young women who have increased odds of giving their infants water and solids early) about how to determine when infants are ready for solids and the reasons for delaying the addition of other foods and fluids may be particularly important in efforts to reduce early introduction of other foods and fluids.</p>
<p>Further research should examine the modifiable barriers to delaying the introduction of solids until 6 months, including exposure to advice from health professionals about the optimal timing of introducing solids and the consistency of that advice with current recommendations.</p>
