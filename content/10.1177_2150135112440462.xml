<italic>Background</italic>: Secondary use of data, whether from clinical information systems or registries, for carrying out clinical research in rare diseases is a common practice but is fraught with potential errors. We sought to elucidate some of the limitations of database research and describe possible solutions to overcome these limitations. <italic>Methods</italic>: Using a disease model of a rare postsurgical outcome, we evaluated the ability of four different data sources to correctly identify patients who had that outcome both as individual databases and also when used in conjunction with each other. These results were compared with manual chart review. <italic>Results</italic>: The sensitivity of the various databases to pick up a rare and specific outcome was poor (9.9%-37%), while the specificities were fairly good (91%-96.7%). By combining the databases, the sensitivity was increased to as much as 56.8% without a large decrease in the specificity (85.2%-91.6%). The electronic medical record (EMR) search engine had the highest sensitivity (96.9%) and a high specificity (89.3%) with a very high negative predictive value (99.4%). <italic>Conclusion</italic>: For rare and specific diseases or outcomes, a single data source search methodology can miss large numbers of patients and potentially bias study results. Combining overlapping databases can improve the ability to capture these rare diseases or outcomes. While chart review remains the most accurate way to obtain complete case capture, new tools like EMR search engines can facilitate the efficiency of this process without sacrificing search quality.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In fields like pediatric cardiology, where even the most common diseases are rare, designing research studies to answer clinical questions is difficult. Prospective studies often require years of data collection or a multi-institutional approach to adequately power the study results, which can be prohibitive from both a cost and logistical standpoint. Retrospective studies allow for an increase in the study population but the interpretation and application of the results can be limited by various forms of statistical bias. One approach commonly used to increase the speed and lower the expense of clinical study in rare diseases is database-based research. Whether using a clinical database, administrative database, or data registry, these data sources allow for efficient acquisition of large amounts of data at little cost. However, there are many limitations to database-based research. These include, but are not limited to, what data were collected and captured by the individual databases, who collected the data and the accuracy of the data entry, and in what form the data were collected which might impede statistical analysis.<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135112440462"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135112440462">3</xref>
</sup> In this article, we describe the incidence of one rare disease in pediatric cardiology using a database-based approach in order to expose some of the potential pitfalls with database-based research and to offer alternative solutions to increase the accuracy and fidelity of data collected from databases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-2150135112440462" sec-type="methods">
<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<p>Our disease model for this analysis was junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET), a rare tachyarrhythmia uniquely associated with congenital heart disease surgery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135112440462">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135112440462"/>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135112440462"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135112440462">7</xref>
</sup> As a background for a related research project, we sought to determine the incidence of JET in our congenital heart disease patients less than 1-year old who underwent open heart surgery between July 1, 2005 and June 30, 2010. JET was defined as a junctional ectopic tachycardia or an accelerated junctional rhythm documented in the medical record by an experienced pediatric cardiac intensivist during the pediatric cardiothoracic intensive care unit (ICU) stay regardless of the necessity for treatment. After obtaining approval from our Institutional Review Board, to comprehensively identify all the infants who developed JET in our specific patient population, we utilized multiple data sources maintained primarily for operational purposes in our health system. These databases included (1) LUMEDX (LUMEDX Corporation, Oakland, California) surgical database, which is used for collecting and reporting our institutional data to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Congenital Heart Surgery Database registry. The LUMEDX data are initially collected on paper forms by both pediatric cardiac surgeons and cardiac surgery nurse practitioners and then the data are manually entered into a computerized database by analysts who have received training specific to the use of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database; (2) VPS (a commercial database formerly known as the Virtual Pediatric Intensive Care Unit System, VPS, LLC; Alexandria, Virginia), which has been used at our institution since 2004. Data for VPS are managed by respiratory therapists. Data were collected on data collection forms for patients admitted prior to June 2009. Since that time, the data have been entered directly into the VPS Web-based system and data collection forms are no longer used to gather data; (3) our institutional inpatient pharmacy database, WORx (Mediware Information Systems, Inc, Lenexa, Kansas); and (4) our electronic health record, CareWeb (home grown, live since 1998), which contains free text clinical documents related to both inpatient and outpatient clinical care episodes. These documents are stored in a clinical data repository (CDR) based on the Oracle database (Oracle Corporation, Redwood Shores, California).</p>
<p>Both LUMEDX and VPS systems were used to identify patients who had arrhythmias in the postoperative period. In LUMEDX, arrhythmia was defined in accordance with the STS Congenital Heart Surgery Database Data Specifications Version 3.0 as any arrhythmia which required drug therapy (STS complication code 72), required electrical cardioversion or defibrillation (STS complication code 73), or required a temporary or permanent pacemaker (STS complication codes 74 and 75, respectively).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135112440462">8</xref>
</sup> In VPS, the search was for patients whose primary or secondary diagnosis was arrhythmia or JET, based on the VPS Data Collection and Definitions user manual version 5.0.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135112440462">9</xref>
</sup> WORx, the pharmacy database, was queried for patients who received amiodarone, a medication that is often prescribed to treat JET, in the postoperative period. We also searched the contents of the clinical documents in our CDR for any mention of the terms “JET,” “junctional ectopic,” and “accelerated junctional” (accelerated junctional tachycardia is a common alternative term for JET) in patients who met the proper age criteria. This was done via database queries using Oracle “regular expressions,” which allows for powerful text matching functionality. Identified cases were then reviewed in depth using a locally developed electronic medical record search engine (EMERSE). For simplicity, the process of searching the CDR and using the electronic medical record search engine will be referred to as EMERSE. We then performed an extensive review of the electronic medical record on all patients who were identified using any of the above methods (possible JET) to determine which patients actually had documented JET (actual JET).</p>
<p>The completeness with which each data source captured patients with JET was compared. The number of patients found in each database to possibly have JET and then those who were confirmed to have JET by chart review were determined for each data source and the various combinations of the databases. For each data source, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for identifying patients with JET. Additionally, demographics and clinical information, diagnosis, and outcome data for patients found by each data source were compared to identify any distinguishing features of the patients found by the various databases, using chi-square tests for categorical variables and Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables. <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>As summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2150135112440462">Table 1</xref>, overall, the individual databases had fairly good specificities for identifying patients with JET (91%-97%), but the sensitivities were generally poor (10%-37%). Combining the various data sources increased the sensitivity to 57% for detecting JET with only a modest decrease in specificity to 85%. Notably, EMERSE had a very good sensitivity (96.9%) and specificity (89.3%) with an excellent negative predictive value (99.4%). When viewing this in tabular form in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2150135112440462">Table 2</xref>, if patients were not identified as potentially having JET by EMERSE, the other database searches, whether used alone or in combination, had a low yield of identifying actual cases of JET.</p>

<title>Comment</title>
<p>Database-based research plays a central role in a large number of studies designed to answer clinically relevant questions in the field of pediatric cardiology. In part, this is due to the relative ease of database research for accessing large amounts of data on rare diseases to yield statistically significant results. However, for rare and specific diseases or outcomes, using a single data source methodology can provide inaccurate and incomplete results leading to invalid conclusions. In our study, we found that individual databases performed poorly at identifying cases of JET in our patient population. There are several potential reasons for these inaccuracies and each is likely related to different purposes for which the individual databases are designed and to the inherent limitations of the individual data sources to detect specific and rare events. The presence of JET, or any other specific postoperative arrhythmia, is not an identified outcome of interest with a specific diagnostic code in LUMEDX. Instead, only arrhythmias that require treatment with a medication, electrical pacing, or electrical cardioversion/defibrillation are coded and captured. Thus, any patient with JET who did not require treatment would not be captured using the LUMEDX database. In our cohort, there were 24 patients who had JET and did not require treatment (14.8% of patients). Similarly, the VPS system does not specifically record JET but aggregates arrhythmias into larger diagnostic groups (eg, supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias), making it cumbersome to search for individual types of arrhythmias. Furthermore, because the VPS data are entered by noncardiologists, there is the opportunity for miscoding of arrhythmias like JET. On the other hand, our pharmacy database was queried for all patients for whom amiodarone was prescribed, either as a bolus dose or a continuous infusion, during their cardiac ICU admission. Since only a fraction of patients with JET received the treatment of amiodarone (∼58% in our cohort), it is not surprising that the sensitivity of this database to capture patients with JET was low. Also because patients who received amiodarone were likely those who were most adversely affected by JET, it is not surprising that the patients identified in this database had worse outcomes.</p>
<p>EMERSE, a proprietary electronic medical record search engine developed at the University of Michigan, was very good at detecting patients with JET. One of the search terms was “JET,” which is language commonly used to describe blood flow on echocardiogram (eg, tricuspid regurgitant jet velocities …). This search term likely led to an overestimation of the number of patients with JET. EMR search engines like EMERSE are really designed to facilitate chart review, since the data that is being searched is the electronic medical record.<sup>

</sup> Interestingly, the sensitivity of EMERSE was not 100%. Of the five patients who were missed by EMERSE, JET was abbreviated in one of the patient’s medical records (“junc. tach”) and so would not have been found by our search terms. The other four patients were missed due to user error and on further review of the results from a repeat EMERSE search, these patients were correctly identified. The eventual sensitivity of EMERSE was 99.4% on repeat analysis. Importantly, EMERSE is a product only available at our institution. There are other institutions with similar electronic medical search engines but because the search engines are not widespread, their use is limited to the institutions where they have been developed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, other than the pharmacy database, the patients found by the individual databases did not differ significantly with regard to demographics, cardiac diagnoses, or outcomes. Had the individual databases identified different subsets of patients, there would be the risk of drawing biased and nongeneralizable conclusions from the analysis of those patients only identified by one of the data sources.</p>
<p>Despite the limitations of the various databases, there are some advantages that can positively impact clinical research. For example, both STS and VPS are national databases. This increases the volume of patients that can be studied at one time, which increases both the statistical power of the study to find small differences between subgroups of patients and increases the generalizability of the study results to larger groups of patients. This latter point is especially important for studying rare diseases like congenital heart disease, where single institutional experience may not be generalizable to all patients. Furthermore, both STS and VPS are routinely audited to assure data validity. This is in contrast to the electronic medical record and electronic medical record search engines, like EMERSE, which are intuition specific and have no formal auditing process to ensure data integrity. Thus, while at our institution, EMERSE is a good tool to facilitate chart review, a large multicenter study using EMERSE would not be possible.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first comparison of several data sources to identify patients with rare diagnoses. In the future, it would be interesting to perform similar comparisons using other large national databases, like the National Inpatient Sample and The Pediatric Health Information System, to better characterize the strengths and limitations of these large data repositories. Furthermore, this study evaluated the ability of various administrative databases to identify patients with a specific disease in order to determine the incidence of that disease. The databases might have performed differently if used to study more clearly defined outcomes like mortality or postoperative cardiac arrest. Numerous studies have used single large administrative databases to evaluate mortality after congenital heart surgery.<sup>

</sup> If these same studies could be repeated using a different large database, it would be interesting and useful to compare the results obtained from different databases, as was done here, to determine the validity of the study results on a large scale.</p>
<p>When databases are a part of the methodology for clinical research, especially for rare diseases and outcomes, it is important to recognize and understand the limitations and strengths of the various databases that are available and then interpret the results of the data obtained from the databases with those strengths and limitations in mind to avoid drawing inaccurate conclusions or generalizations. This is true for both those conducting the research study and those using the results of the study to make informed decisions about patient care.</p>
<p>Overall, we found that individual databases had inherent strengths and weaknesses, which had an impact on the number of patients identified with a clinical outcome of interest. Combining the search results from multiple overlapping data sources improved identification of individuals with rare conditions, although there is probably no single database or combination of databases that approaches the accuracy and completeness of extensive manual chart review. Tools like EMERSE can render the chart review process much more efficient without sacrificing search accuracy, but may not be routinely available at some institutions. As databases become more extensive and widespread, finding ways to integrate various databases, allowing them to communicate with each other, will likely increase accuracy and our ability to answer specific research questions.<sup>
