<abstract>
<p><italic>Aims:</italic> This article addresses the under-researched area of men’s experiences of abuse. The aims were to estimate prevalence of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse and abuse in health care in a random sample of Swedish adult men, to compare these estimates with previously collected prevalence rates in a male clinical sample to see if prevalence rates were dependant on response rate and sampling method. We also wanted to contribute to a more general analysis of men’s experiences of victimisation. <italic>Methods:</italic> Cross-sectional study design. The NorVold Abuse Questionnaire that measures the prevalence of four kinds of abuse was sent to 6000 men selected at random from the population of Östergötland, Sweden. <italic>Results:</italic> The response rate was 50% (<italic>n</italic> = 2924). Lifetime experiences of emotional abuse were reported by 16.7%, physical abuse by 48.9%, sexual abuse by 4.5%, and abuse in health care by 7.3%. The proportion of men who currently suffered from abusive experiences was highest for emotional abuse and abuse in health care. No difference in prevalence was seen between the random population sample and the clinical sample despite significant differences regarding response rate and background characteristics. <bold><italic>Conclusions:</italic> Abuse against men is prevalent and men are victimised as patients in health care. Response rate and sampling method did not influence prevalence rates of abuse. Men’s victimisation from emotional abuse and abuse in health care was associated with low income and being born outside of the Nordic countries and hence needs to be analysed in the intersections of gender, class, and ethnicity.</bold></p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Over recent decades, much well-deserved attention has been directed towards men’s abuse of women, and the need for a gendered understanding of this has been emphasised. Serious and immediate, as well as long-term, implications for the health and wellbeing of victims of abuse have been well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811425711">1</xref>]. Abuse against men, however, remains relatively under-researched and under-theorised and only limited knowledge exists on the prevalence of abusive experiences among men. Most research so far has focused on specific kinds of abuse, such as abuse in intimate partner relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494811425711">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494811425711">3</xref>] or on childhood experiences of abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494811425711">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494811425711">5</xref>]. Population-based studies on lifetime experiences of different kinds of abuse; especially emotional abuse (EA) and abuse in health care (AHC) are scarce. The National Violence Against Women Survey from the USA is one of the studies that has measured physical (PA) and sexual abuse (SA) among both men and women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494811425711">6</xref>]. In that study 44% of men reported lifetime experiences of being pushed, grabbed, or shoved; 16% had been beaten up; 16% had been threatened with a knife; and 4% had experienced someone trying to choke or drown them. Of the surveyed men, 3% reported being the victim of completed or attempted rape.</p>
<p>In Sweden, the best national estimate of the prevalence of PA and SA against adult men comes from the Swedish Crime Surveys conducted by the National Council for Crime Prevention. They found that, during the year 2007, 3.8% of Swedish men were the victims of some kind of PA (defined as having experienced physical violence that lead to bodily harm or pain) and 0.3% were the victims of SA (defined as having been forced, attacked, or molested sexually) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494811425711">7</xref>]. No estimates of lifetime experiences of abuse in the adult Swedish male population exist.</p>
<p>From a methodological point of view it has often been debated regarding violence against women how response rates and sampling methods affect prevalence rates of abuse; victims of abuse may be more motivated to participate in studies on the subject, or they may be more likely to avoid it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494811425711">8</xref>]. To design and produce good studies that it is possible to draw conclusion from, we need to increase our knowledge about these methodological issues.</p>
<p>In short, relatively little is known about the prevalence and consequence of abuse against men, both in Sweden and worldwide, but the little we know signals that abuse is prevalent and most likely plays a significant role in men’s lives for their health and wellbeing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1403494811425711">
<title>Aims</title>
<p>The main objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of EA, PA, SA, and AHC by means of a validated questionnaire in a random sample of Swedish adult men. The second aim was to compare the prevalence of different kinds of abuse between this random population sample and a previously collected clinical sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494811425711">9</xref>], thus investigating whether different sampling methods and response rates influenced the reported levels of abusive experiences. Furthermore, we wish to contribute to the theoretical analysis of the impact that abuse has in men’s lives. Thus, the data in this study need to be considered within the broader range of scholarship on men’s various relations to abuse, and critical studies on men and masculinities.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section4-1403494811425711">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>During spring 2007 the NorVold Abuse Questionnaire (m-NorAQ), covering experiences of EA, PA, SA, and AHC, was sent together with an information letter to 6000 men living in Östergötland county in Sweden. The study population was men aged 18–64 selected at random from the National Population Register. The sample size was calculated by using the lowest prevalence of abuse estimated with the same instrument in a clinical male sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494811425711">9</xref>] and a margin of error of 1% (SA 3.5% (2.5–4.5%). Because of an invalid address or other practical obstacles to participation, such as not being able to read due to disability or language problems, 122 men were excluded (<italic>n</italic> = 5878). Prepaid envelopes were used and three reminders were sent out.</p>
<p>The participants in the clinical sample were male inpatients and outpatients recruited consecutively at six different somatic clinics at a university hospital in Sweden in 2005. The inclusion criteria were being more than 18 years of age and understanding Swedish language well enough to read the written information. The oldest participant was 91 years old. One or two weeks after their visit to the hospital, m-NorAQ and an information letter were sent out to them by mail. A detailed description of the procedure and sample have been published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494811425711">9</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1403494811425711">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The NorVold Abuse Questionnaire (NorAQ) was originally developed to measure prevalence of EA, PA, SA, and AHC in a Nordic multicentre study among gynaecological patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494811425711">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494811425711">12</xref>]. A male version of NorAQ (m-NorAQ) was developed and tested in 2004, and as in the original female version, the abuse questions showed good test-retest reliability and good concurrent validity using an interview as the gold standard. A detailed report on the development and validation of m-NorAQ has been published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494811425711">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494811425711">13</xref>].</p>
<p>The m-NorAQ is divided into seven parts and comprises 67 questions in total. Experiences of abuse were defined as having answered “yes” to one or several of the three or four questions about each specified kind of abuse in the m-NorAQ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494811425711">Table I</xref>). It was also specified if the abuse occurred in childhood (&lt;18 years), in adulthood, or both. If a man reported several degrees of a specific kind of abuse, he was classified according to the most severe act of abuse reported. If the respondent had ever experienced the specified kind of abuse, he was also asked to estimate, separately for each kind of abuse, how much he currently suffered from his experience(s) on an 11-point scale (0 = no suffering, 10 = suffers terribly). Answers to the current suffering items were dichotomised in no/yes categories (no current suffering = 0 and current suffering = 1–10). Besides abuse, m-NorAQ addresses socio-demography, self-estimated health, and medical history.</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Analyses were computed using the statistical program SPSS, version 17. We used a chi-squared test to test if the distribution in our sample differed from the official statistics for the population in the region regarding age, education, income, occupation, and proportion of persons born outside Sweden. The significant level was set at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. Differences in background characteristics between the two samples were analysed using Pearson’s chi-squared test. The reported prevalence of lifetime experiences of EA, PA, SA, and AHC, as well as the prevalence of experiencing the different kinds of abuse during the last 12 months, were compared between the two samples by means of age-stratified Pearson’s chi-squared tests (&lt;34 years, 35–49 years, and &gt;50 years old). The significant level was set at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for all analyses. This was done because the prevalence of abuse is known to correlate with age, and a considerable age difference exists between the two samples (see Results).</p>
<p>To test for significant differences regarding age at the time of the abuse, i.e. if the abuse had happened in childhood, in adulthood, or both, a Pearson chi-squared test was used. A Z-test for proportions were used to compare the proportion of victims that reported current suffering from abuse, i.e. to see if current suffering was reported more often by victims of a specific kind of abuse.</p>
<p>A binary logistic regression was used to analyse factors associated with lifetime EA, PA, SA, and AHC. Three models for each kind of abuse were constructed: one for each sample, and one with the two samples merged. Reporting lifetime experience of EA/PA/SA/AHC was used as the dependant variable. The model with the two samples merged was constructed to test if sampling method (i.e. the clinical sample or the population sample) had a significant influence on the risk of reporting the different kinds of abuse. A variable containing the sample information was used in the model as an independent variable, as were all the background variables measured. To test if there were statistically significant differences between the clinical sample and the population sample regarding how background characteristics were associated with the prevalence of abuse, the model was also tested for interaction effects between the sample variable and all the variables covering background characteristics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1403494811425711">
<title>Ethical consideration</title>
<p>Abuse is a sensitive topic and answering the questions in m-NorAQ might be uncomfortable for some respondents. All men receiving the questionnaire were therefore invited to contact either the research team or an independent therapist, if they had any questions, or if answering m-NorAQ triggered a need for help. Very few men used this possibility. The study was approved by the local ethical committee at Linköping University in 2007 (number 3707).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The response rate in the population sample was 50% (2924/5878). Our sample has a mean of 43 years, and compared to the official statistics for the region, our sample has a shortfall of 6% for men younger than 39 years. Men with more than 12 years’ education were overrepresented, as were men with midrange income, compared to official statistics. Men born outside Sweden were underrepresented to an extent of 5% in the middle age groups compared with Statistics Sweden demographics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494811425711">Tables II</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494811425711">III</xref>).

<p>No significant difference (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) was found in the age-stratified comparisons of prevalence rates of any lifetime abuse between the two samples. Neither were there any significant differences regarding the prevalence of abusive experiences over the last 12 months for any of the four different kinds of abuse. Data are not shown since no significant differences were found.</p>
<p>With the exception of a weak association to civil status, the lifetime prevalence of men’s experiences of SA was independent of background characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1403494811425711">Table VI</xref>). Lifetime PA was associated with high educational level and younger age, as well as, in the clinical sample, with being born outside of the Nordic countries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1403494811425711">Table VI</xref>). Lifetime prevalence of EA was associated with most of the socio-demographic factors surveyed. The strongest associations were found for AHC and two of the background variables: low annual income (merged sample, OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.5–5.3), and being born outside the Nordic countries (merged sample, OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.5–3.3; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1403494811425711">Table VI</xref>). In the model containing the merged sample the variable distinguishing between the population sample and the clinical sample was not significantly associated with the prevalence of any kind of abuse. The only significant interaction effect found between background characteristics and this distinguishing sample variable was for occupation in the model covering AHC (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01). Being on social welfare was associated with reporting AHC in the population sample, but not in the clinical sample (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1403494811425711">Table VI</xref>). The differences seen between the samples regarding country of birth and AHC were borderline significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.07), as were the differences between income and EA (<italic>p</italic> = 0.08; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1403494811425711">Table VI</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A large proportion of men in our study had been subjected to some kind of abuse. As in other studies, we found the highest prevalence for PA and the lowest for SA. The greatest proportion of victims who reported current suffering from abuse was victims of EA and AHC. These results indicate that physical abuse, though the most widespread form of abuse, may not necessarily have the strongest impact on men’s lives. Among women, the same scale of “current suffering” has been used and then shown to correlate with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494811425711">15</xref>]. Hence this result may indicate adverse health effects for male victims of abuse, especially EA and AHC, that need to be further clarified.</p>
<p>From a methodological point of view, the absence of differences in prevalence between the population and clinical sample is interesting. Even though the response rate in our two samples varied greatly (population 50% and clinic 74%), no difference in prevalence was seen between the two samples. This implies that in our two studies neither the variation in response rate, nor the sampling method, had any major influence on the prevalence rates found. However, due to the significant level of nonresponders, there is still a possibility of sampling bias.</p>
<p>Considering the differences in background characteristics between the two samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1403494811425711">Table IV</xref>), and the differences in sampling methods, there is a possibility that the response rate and sampling method interacted and concealed actual differences in prevalence rates due to response rate and/or sampling method. However, NorAQ has previously been used in different female samples, both clinical and population based. When comparing prevalence rates from those studies, the same result as in this study was found; prevalence rates were associated with background characteristics but not with sampling method or response rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494811425711">16</xref>]. Hence, although prevalence rates must continue to be related to response rate and sampling method, it seems that these factors are of less importance when measuring prevalence of abuse. Instead, the relative lack of research about male victimisation and in particular the use of varying definitions of abuse in different studies remain the major obstacles for gaining a reliable estimation of the magnitude of abusive experiences among men as well as for making relevant comparisons of prevalence of abuse across countries, cultures and sex.</p>
<p>The prevalence of PA (3.0%) and SA (0.5%) during the last 12 months found in this study are in line with corresponding numbers found in the Swedish Crime Survey (PA 3.8% and SA 0.3%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494811425711">7</xref>]. Comparisons should however be made cautiously considering differences in used definitions.</p>
<p>The prevalence of severe SA in our study (1.2%) was lower than the prevalence found in population-based studies in the USA, where 2.1 % of men have reported completed rape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494811425711">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494811425711">17</xref>] and an additional 0.9 % reported attempted rape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494811425711">17</xref>] (defined as completed/attempted forced penetrative sex, including anal or oral penetration). In our study, SA among men was more prevalent in childhood than as an adult, which was also seen in the two US studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494811425711">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494811425711">17</xref>]. It is unclear if our lower prevalence rate reflects an actual difference in prevalence between the countries; it might also be due to methodological differences between the studies or reflect regional differences in awareness and acknowledgment of SA against men.</p>
<p>The prevalence of EA increased with lesser resources, for example, being young, having low income, or being born outside the Nordic countries. At a general level this is rather unsurprising, although it is unclear if such experiences of EA occur mainly in intimate interpersonal situations in men’s personal lives or through institutional processes, as in workplaces and other organisations.</p>
<p>In the population-based sample, more than 7% reported AHC which is remarkable not only because the study was conducted in a healthy population sample collected at random, but also from the perspective that AHC generated high scores on the current suffering scale. In an earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494811425711">18</xref>] based on qualitative interviews, we have shown that the male experiences of AHC goes beyond earlier research limited to for instance patient satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494811425711">19</xref>], disagreements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494811425711">20</xref>] and misunderstandings in health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494811425711">21</xref>], and hospital errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494811425711">22</xref>]. The interviews showed that AHC had a profound impact at a deep personal level, leaving the male patients emotionally stuck and unable to achieve their vital goals. Experiencing AHC was a serious attack on their autonomy and their value as human beings. Some of the strongest associations in the study were found for AHC and three of the background variables likely to indicate low class status: being on social welfare support, low income, and being born outside of Sweden. These associations may indicate that a more general societal discrimination may contribute to what is here called AHC.</p>
<p>An accessible population register including all men in the base population contributes to the generalisability of the present study. The overall response rate was reasonable for this kind of survey. However, by comparing our sample with official statistics from the county which the random sample was drawn from, we conclude that our sample overrepresents the middle and higher classes and underrepresents the working classes. Interestingly, in our study the prevalence of SA was not strongly associated to any socio-demographic factors and PA was only slightly related to being young and having a higher education. EA and AHC, on the other hand, showed associations to characteristics underrepresented in our sample: being young, having low income, or being born outside Sweden (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1403494811425711">Table VI</xref>). This reasoning leads us to assume that the prevalence of PA and SA is representative, and that prevalence of EA and AHC might be underestimated in this study. EA and AHC are to be understood in relation to not only gender, but also intersections with, and indeed discriminations by, age, class, and ethnicity.</p>
<p>It could be questionable to merge two samples from different populations as has been done for this study. However, by analysing the interaction effects we could show that the associations between the measured background characteristics and the experiences of abuse were the same for the two samples with only one statistically significant exception. Being on sick leave, retired, or on social welfare was a risk factor for reporting AHC in the population, but not in the clinical sample. Also, by merging the samples we increased the included number of cases in the analyses considerably, and by doing so the confidence intervals for many analyses became slimmer and the estimates more robust.</p>
<p>The high prevalence of abusive experiences among men emphasise the need for a better understanding of men’s experiences as victims of abuse. The relative lack of such knowledge is probably linked with dominant constructions of masculinity and femininity which tend to view abuse against women as self-evident but misrecognise men as victims within somewhat similar processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494811425711">23</xref>]. It is also likely to be tied to debates that position men chiefly as perpetrators of abuse, thus tending to ignore the important associations between masculinity, abuse, and vulnerability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494811425711">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Since male victimisation is so prevalent and men are the main perpetrators of abuse, it is inevitable so that some victims are also perpetrators of abuse, either against other men or against women or children. It is hence important not to portray men’s victimisation simply as equivalent to women’s victimisation, particularly as the main aggressors towards men are other men, but rather to locate men’s abusive experiences within the context of gendered violence, predominantly abuse by men, whether to women, children, or other men. This is especially important as some media reports have misleadingly represented abuse of women and abuse of men as “symmetrical” (for a critical meta-review, see Kimmel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494811425711">25</xref>]). A better understanding of links between male victimisation, male perpetration, and constructs of masculinity is important in understanding how abuse influences men’s lives, and thus intensifying efforts towards primary prevention. Abuse, both perpetration and victimisation, is not an inevitable part of human life.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Abuse against men is prevalent and men are victimised as patients in health care. The response rate and sampling method do not seem to influence prevalence rates of abuse. Men’s victimisation from emotional abuse and abuse in health care are related to low income and being born outside of Sweden and hence need to be analysed in the intersections of gender, class, and ethnicity.</p>
